This paper considers feedback load reduction for multiuser multiple input
multiple output (MIMO) broadcast channel where the users' channel distributions
are not homogeneous. A cluster-based feedback scheme is proposed such that the
range of possible signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the users are divided into
several clusters according to the order statistics of the users' SNRs. Each
cluster has a corresponding threshold, and the users compare their measured
instantaneous SNRs with the thresholds to determine whether and how many bits
they should use to feed back their instantaneous SNRs. If a user's
instantaneous SNR is lower than a certain threshold, the user does not feed
back. Feedback load reduction is thus achieved. For a given number of clusters,
the sum rate loss using the cluster-based feedback scheme is investigated. Then
the minimum number of clusters given a maximum tolerable sum rate loss is
derived. Through simulations, it is shown that, when the number of users is
large, full multiuser diversity can be achieved by the proposed feedback
scheme, which is more efficient than the conventional schemes.
