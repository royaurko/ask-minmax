We theoretically and numerically investigate metamaterials composed of
coupled resonators with indirect coupling. First, we theoretically analyze a
mechanical model of coupled resonators with indirect coupling. The theoretical
analysis shows that an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-like
phenomenon with a transparency bandwidth narrower than the resonance linewidths
of the constitutive resonators can occur in the metamaterial with strong
indirect coupling. We then numerically examine the characteristics of the
metamaterial composed of coupled cut-wire pairs using a finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) method. The FDTD simulation confirms that an EIT-like
transparency phenomenon occurs in the metamaterial owing to indirect coupling.
Finally, we compare the results of the theoretical and numerical analyses. The
behavior of the EIT-like metamaterial is found to be well described by the
mechanical model of the coupled resonators.
