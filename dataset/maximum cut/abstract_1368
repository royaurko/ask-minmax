A distorted-wave version of the renormalisation group is applied to
scattering by an inverse-square potential and to three-body systems. In
attractive three-body systems, the short-distance wave function satisfies a
Schroedinger equation with an attractive inverse-square potential, as shown by
Efimov. The resulting oscillatory behaviour controls the renormalisation of the
three-body interactions, with the renormalisation-group flow tending to a limit
cycle as the cut-off is lowered. The approach used here leads to single-valued
potentials with discontinuities as the bound states are cut off. The
perturbations around the cycle start with a marginal term whose effect is
simply to change the phase of the short-distance oscillations, or the
self-adjoint extension of the singular Hamiltonian. The full power counting in
terms of the energy and two-body scattering length is constructed for
short-range three-body forces.
