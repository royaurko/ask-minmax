We report the observation of the de Haas-van Alphen effect in IrTe2 measured
using torque magnetometry at low temperatures down to 0.4 K and in high
magnetic fields up to 33T. IrTe2 undergoes a major structural transition around
283 K due to the formation of planes of Ir and Te dimers that cut diagonally
through the lattice planes, with its electronic structure predicted to change
significantly from a layered system with predominantly three-dimensional
character to a tilted quasi-two dimensional Fermi surface. Quantum oscillations
provide direct confirmation of this unusual tilted Fermi surface and also
reveal very light quasiparticle masses (less than 1 me), with no significant
enhancement due to electronic correlations. We find good agreement between the
angular dependence of the observed and calculated de Haas-van Alphen
frequencies, taking into account the contribution of different structural
domains that form while cooling IrTe2.
