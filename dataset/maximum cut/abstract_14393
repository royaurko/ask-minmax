The modifications of $D_s$-meson spectra in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion
collisions are identified as a quantitative probe of key properties of the hot
nuclear medium. This is enabled by the unique valence-quark content of the
$D_s$=$c\bar{s}$ which couples the well-known strangeness enhancement with the
collective-flow pattern of primordially produced charm quarks. We employ a
consistent strong-coupling treatment with hydrodynamic bulk evolution and
nonperturbative $T$-matrix interactions for both heavy-quark diffusion and
hadronization in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). A large enhancement of the $D_s$
nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) at RHIC is predicted, with a remarkable
maximum of $\sim$1.5-1.8 at transverse momenta around 2 GeV/$c$. We show this
to be a direct consequence of the strong coupling of the heavy quarks to the
QGP and their hadronization via coalescence with strange quarks. We furthermore
introduce the effects of diffusion in the hadronic phase and suggest that an
increase of the $D$-meson elliptic flow compared to the $D_s$ can disentangle
the transport properties of hadronic and QGP liquids.
