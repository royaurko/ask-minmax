In this paper, we show that the protocol complex of a Byzantine synchronous
system can remain $(k - 1)$-connected for up to $\lceil t/k \rceil$ rounds,
where $t$ is the maximum number of Byzantine processes, and $t \ge k \ge 1$.
Protocol complex connectivity is important since a $(k - 1)$-connected protocol
complex does not admit solutions for the $k$-set agreement problem. In
crash-failure systems, the connectivity upper bound is $\lfloor t/k \rfloor$
rounds, therefore, in Byzantine systems, the ambiguity in the communication can
potentially persist for one extra round, delaying the solution to $k$-set
agreement and other related problems.
  Additionally, we show that our connectivity bound is tight, at least when $n
+ 1$, the number of processes, is suitably large compared to $t$. We solve a
formulation of $k$-set agreement appropriate for Byzantine systems in $\lceil
t/k \rceil + 1$ rounds. Essentially, we see that Byzantine failures can
potentially require us one extra round to handle ambiguity, and, in specific
cases, at most that.
