We study the problem of deinterleaving a set of finite-memory (Markov)
processes over disjoint finite alphabets, which have been randomly interleaved
by a finite-memory switch. The deinterleaver has access to a sample of the
resulting interleaved process, but no knowledge of the number or structure of
the component Markov processes, or of the switch. We study conditions for
uniqueness of the interleaved representation of a process, showing that certain
switch configurations, as well as memoryless component processes, can cause
ambiguities in the representation. We show that a deinterleaving scheme based
on minimizing a penalized maximum-likelihood cost function is strongly
consistent, in the sense of reconstructing, almost surely as the observed
sequence length tends to infinity, a set of component and switch Markov
processes compatible with the original interleaved process. Furthermore, under
certain conditions on the structure of the switch (including the special case
of a memoryless switch), we show that the scheme recovers \emph{all} possible
interleaved representations of the original process. Experimental results are
presented demonstrating that the proposed scheme performs well in practice,
even for relatively short input samples.
