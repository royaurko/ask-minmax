We rigorously prove that a wide class of one-dimensional growth models with
onsite periodic potential, such as the discrete sine-Gordon model, have no
phase transition at any temperature $T>0$. The proof relies on the spectral
analysis of the transfer operator associated to the models. We show that this
operator is Hilbert-Schmidt and that its maximum eigenvalue is an analytic
function of temperature.
