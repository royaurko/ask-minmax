We report detailed studies of the ac susceptibility butterfly hysteresis on
the Ru1222 ruthenocuprate compounds. Two separate contributions to these
hysteresis have been identified and studied. One contribution is
ferromagnetic-like and is characterized by the coercive field maximum. Another
contribution, represented by the so called inverted maximum, is related to the
unusual inverted loops, unique feature of Ru1222 butterfly hysteresis. The
different nature of the two identified magnetic contributions is proved by the
different temperature dependences involved. By lowering the temperature the
inverted peak gradually disappears while the coercive field slowly raises. If
the maximum dc field for the hysteresis is increased, the size of the inverted
part of the butterfly hysteresis monotonously grows while the position of the
peak saturates. In reaching saturation exponential field dependence has been
demonstrated to take place. At T = 78 K the saturation field is 42 Oe.
