Let $\mathcal{T}^d(1)$ be the set of all $d$-dimensional simplices $T$ in
$\real^d$ with integer vertices and a single integer point in the interior of
$T$. It follows from a result of Hensley that $\mathcal{T}^d(1)$ is finite up
to affine transformations that preserve $\mathbb{Z}^d$. It is known that, when
$d$ grows, the maximum volume of the simplices $T \in \cT^d(1)$ becomes
extremely large. We improve and refine bounds on the size of $T \in
\mathcal{T}^d(1)$ (where by the size we mean the volume or the number of
lattice points). It is shown that each $T \in \mathcal{T}^d(1)$ can be
decomposed into an ascending chain of faces whose sizes are `not too large'.
More precisely, if $T \in \mathcal{T}^d(1)$, then there exist faces $G_1
\subseteq ... \subseteq G_d=T$ of $T$ such that, for every $i \in \{1,...,d\}$,
$G_i$ is $i$-dimensional and the size of $G_i$ is bounded from above in terms
of $i$ and $d$. The bound on the size of $G_i$ is double exponential in $i$.
The presented upper bounds are asymptotically tight on the log-log scale.
