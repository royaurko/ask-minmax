Two-particle unitarity-cuts of scattering amplitudes can be efficiently
computed by applying Stokes' Theorem, in the fashion of the Generalised Cauchy
Theorem. Consequently, the Optical Theorem can be related to the Berry Phase,
showing how the imaginary part of arbitrary one-loop Feynman amplitudes can be
interpreted as the flux of a complex 2-form.
