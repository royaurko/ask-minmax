We describe the VIRMOS Mask Manufacturing Unit (MMU) configuration, composed
of two units:the Mask Manufacturing Machine (with its Control Unit) and the
Mask Handling Unit (inclusive of Control Unit, Storage Cabinets and robot for
loading of the Instrument Cabinets). For both VIMOS and NIRMOS instruments, on
the basis of orders received by the Mask Preparation Software (see paper (a) in
same proceedings), the function of the MMU is to perform an off-line mask
cutting and identification, followed by mask storing and subsequent filling of
the Instrument Cabinets (IC). We describe the characteristics of the LPKF laser
cutting machine and the work done to support the choice of this equipment. We
also describe the remaining of the hardware configuration and the Mask Handling
Software.
