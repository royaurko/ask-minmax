Galaxy merging is the late time manifestation of the galaxy formation process
and likely significantly effects $z<1$ galaxies. A ``maximum reasonable rate''
model for merging finds a $\sim2$ mag K band increase in the luminosities of
dwarf galaxies so that they contribute significantly to the faint counts, with
spirals and ellipticals being far less affected. The median $K$ and $I$
redshifts stabilize (and even decrease slightly) at $z\simeq0.6$ beyond I=21 or
K=19. The B redshifts continue to rise (although strongly dependent on the UV
spectral evolution). Such rapid merging predicts that at $z=1$ the
characteristic galaxy mass is reduced to $\sim30\%$ of the $z=0$ value. To rule
out this model requires good sampling beyond $z=1$.
 A theoretical complication for even a minimal merger rate, which reduces $z=1$
masses to 2/3 of current epoch values, is that infall of a single satellite
having 10\% of a disk's mass may destroy thin disks. Using completely
self-consistent n-body simulations, we show that the primary response of a disk
to ``cosmological'' satellites up to 20\% of the disk mass is to {\em tilt} the
disk with a temporary warping.
