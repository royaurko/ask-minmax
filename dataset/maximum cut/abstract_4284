This contribution summarizes a presentation combining two topics in lattice
QCD. Firstly, the gluon propagator in Landau gauge is calculated in quenched
QCD on a large (32^3x64) lattice at beta=6.0. New structure seen in the
infrared region survives conservative cuts to the lattice data, and serves to
exclude a number of models that have appeared in the literature. Secondly, I
report on a recent lattice QCD calculation of the strangeness magnetic moment
of the nucleon. The result is G_M^s(0) =-0.36 +/- 0.20 . The strangeness Sachs
electric mean-square radius was also found to be small and negative.
