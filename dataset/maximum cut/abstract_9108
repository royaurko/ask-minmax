We show that squeezing of a nanomechanical mirror can be generated by
injecting broad band squeezed vacuum light and laser light into the cavity. We
work in the resolved sideband regime. We find that in order to obtain the
maximum momentum squeezing of the movable mirror, the squeezing parameter of
the input light should be about 1. We can obtain more than 70% squeezing.
Besides, for a fixed squeezing parameter, decreasing the temperature of the
environment or increasing the laser power increases the momentum squeezing. We
find very large squeezing with respect to thermal fluctuations, for instance at
1 mK, the momentum fluctuations go down by a factor more than one hundred.
