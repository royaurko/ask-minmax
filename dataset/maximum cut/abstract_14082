An isolated and fast decayed active region (NOAA 9729) was observed when
passing through solar disk. There is only one CME related with it that give us
a good opportunity to investigate the whole process of the CME. Filament in
this active region rises up rapidly and then hesitates and disintegrates into
flare loops. The rising filament from EIT images separates into two parts just
before eruption. A new filament reforms several hours later after CME and the
axis of this new one rotates clockwise about 22 degrees comparing with that of
the former one. We also observed a bright transient J-shaped X-ray sigmoid
immediately appears after filament eruption. It quickly develops into a soft
X-ray cusp and rises up firstly then drops down. Two magnetic cancelation
regions have been observed clearly just before filament eruption. Moreover, the
magnetic flux rope erupted as the magnetic helicity approach the maximum and
the normalized helicity is -0.036 when the magnetic flux rope erupted, which is
close to the prediction value based on the theoretical non-linear force-free
model.
