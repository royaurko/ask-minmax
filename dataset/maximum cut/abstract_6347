We present the results of 37 nights of CCD unfiltered photometry of nova
V2574 Oph (2004) from 2004 and 2005. We find two periods of 0.14164 d (~3.40 h)
and 0.14773 d (~3.55 h) in the 2005 data. The 2004 data show variability on a
similar timescale, but no coherent periodicity was found. We suggest that the
longer periodicity is the orbital period of the underlying binary system and
that the shorter period represents a negative superhump. The 3.40 h period is
about 4% shorter than the orbital period and obeys the relation between
superhump period deficit and binary period. The detection of superhumps in the
light curve is evidence of the presence of a precessing accretion disk in this
binary system shortly after the nova outburst. From the maximum magnitude -
rate of decline relation, we estimate the decay rate t_2 = 17+/-4 d and a
maximum absolute visual magnitude of M_Vmax = -7.7+/-1.7 mag.
