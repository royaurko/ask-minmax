Our aim is to constrain the properties of dark matter halos inhabiting high
density environments, such as is the case in massive galaxy clusters. We use
galaxy-galaxy lensing techniques that utilize a maximum likelihood method to
constrain the parameters of the lenses. It has been demonstrated that such a
technique provides strong constraints on the parameters that characterize a
galaxy halo, as well as on the aperture mass of these halos. In this analysis,
we only use weak shear data and do not include strong lensing constraints. We
present the results of a study of galaxy-galaxy lensing in a homogeneous sample
of massive X-ray luminous clusters at z~0.2. These have been observed in three
bands with the CFH12k instrument. We find dark matter halos in these clusters
to be compact compared to those inferred around isolated field galaxies of
equivalent luminosity at this redshift: the half mass radius is found to be
smaller than 50 kpc, with a mean total mass of order 0.2 10^{12} M_sun. This is
in good agreement with previous galaxy-galaxy lensing results and with
numerical simulations, in particular with the tidal stripping scenario. We thus
provide a strong confirmation of tidal truncation from a homogeneous sample of
galaxy clusters. Moreover, it is the first time that cluster galaxies are
probed successfully using galaxy-galaxy lensing techniques from ground based
data.
