We construct a parametrization of the lepton energy spectrum in inclusive
semileptonic decays of B mesons, based on the available experimental
information: moments of the spectrum with cuts, their errors and their
correlations, together with kinematical constraints. The result is obtained in
the form of a Monte Carlo sample of neural networks trained on replicas of the
experimental data, which represents the probability density in the space of
lepton energy spectra. This parametrization is then used to extract the b quark
mass m_b^{1S} in a way that theoretical uncertainties are minimized, for which
the value m_b^{1S}=4.84 \pm 0.14^{exp}\pm 0.05^{th} GeV is obtained.
