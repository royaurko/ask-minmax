The rational parts of 6-gluon one-loop amplitudes with scalars circulating in
the loop are computed by using the newly developed method for computing the
rational parts directly from Feynman integrals. We present the analytic results
for the two MHV helicity configurations: $(1^-2^+3^+4^-5^+6^+)$ and
$(1^-2^+3^-4^+5^+6^+)$, and the two NMHV helicity configurations:
$(1^-2^-3^+4^-5^+6^+)$ and $(1^-2^+3^-4^+5^-6^+)$. Combined with the previously
computed results for the cut-constructible part, our results are the last
missing pieces for the complete partial helicity amplitudes of the 6-gluon
one-loop QCD amplitude.
