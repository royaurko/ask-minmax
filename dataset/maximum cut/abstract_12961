Using a single-phase liquid argon detector with a signal yield of 4.85
photoelectrons per keV of electronic-equivalent recoil energy (keVee), we
measure the scintillation time dependence of both electronic and nuclear
recoils in liquid argon down to 5 keVee. We develop two methods of pulse shape
discrimination to distinguish between electronic and nuclear recoils. Using one
of these methods, we measure a background and statistics-limited level of
electronic recoil contamination to be $7.6\times10^{-7}$ between 60 and 128 keV
of nuclear recoil energy (keVr) for a nuclear recoil acceptance of 50% with no
nuclear recoil-like events above 72 keVr. Finally, we develop a maximum
likelihood method of pulse shape discrimination using the measured
scintillation time dependence and predict the sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon
scattering in three configurations of a liquid argon dark matter detector.
