We investigate the effect of the back-reaction by non-supersymmetric probes
in the Kuperstein-Sonnenschein model. In the limit where the back-reaction is
small, we discuss physical properties of the back-reacted geometry. We further
introduce additional probe flavours in this back-reacted geometry and study in
detail the phase structure of this sector when a constant electromagnetic field
or a chemical potential are present. We find that the Landau pole, which serves
as the UV cut-off of the background geometry, also serves as an important scale
in the corresponding thermodynamics of the additional flavour sector. We note
that since these additional probe flavours are indistinguishable from the
back-reacting flavours, the results we obtain point to a much richer phase
structure of the system.
