We show that an adiabatic increase of the supercurrent along a superconductor
with lines of nodes of the order parameter on the Fermi surface can result in a
cooling effect. The maximum cooling occurs if the supercurrent increases up to
its critical value. The effect can also be observed in a mixed state of a bulk
sample. An estimate of the energy dissipation shows that substantial cooling
can be performed during a reasonable time even in the microkelvin regime.
