In the present contribution we analyse a simple thought process at T = 0 in
an idealized heat engine having partitions made of a material with an upper
frequency cut-off and bathed in zero-point (ZP) electromagnetic radiation. As a
result, a possible mechanism of filling real cavities with ZP radiation based
on Doppler's effect has been suggested and corresponding entropy changes are
discussed.
