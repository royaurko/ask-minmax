The catalog section of the Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy, CDMS,
contains mostly rotational transition frequencies, with auxiliary information,
of molecules observable in space. The frequency lists are generated mostly from
critically evaluated laboratory data employing established Hamiltonian models.
The CDMS has been online publicly for more than 12 years, e.g., via the
short-cut http://www.cdms.de. Initially constructed as ascii tables, its
inclusion into a database environment within the Virtual Atomic and Molecular
Data Centre (VAMDC, http://www.vamdc.eu) has begun in June 2008. A test version
of the new CDMS is about to be released. The CDMS activities have been part of
the extensive laboratory spectroscopic investigations in Cologne. Moreover,
these activities have also benefit from collaborations with other laboratory
spectroscopy groups as well as with astronomers. We will provide some basic
information on the CDMS and its participation in the VAMDC project. In
addition, some recent detections of molecules as well as spectroscopic studies
will be discussed to evaluate the spectroscopic data needs of Herschel, SOFIA,
and ALMA in particular in terms of light hydrides, complex molecules, and metal
containing species
