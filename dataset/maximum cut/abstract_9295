This paper deals with parameter estimation when the data are randomly right
censored. The maximum likelihood estimates from censored samples are obtained
by using the expectation-maximization (EM) and Monte Carlo EM (MCEM)
algorithms. We introduce the concept of the EM and MCEM algorithms and develop
parameter estimation methods for a variety of distributions such as normal,
Laplace and Rayleigh distributions. These proposed methods are illustrated with
three examples.
