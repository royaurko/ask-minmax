A bit error rate (BER)-based physical layer security approach is proposed for
finite blocklength. For secure communication in the sense of high BER, the
information-theoretic strong converse is combined with cryptographic error
amplification achieved by substitution permutation networks (SPNs) based on
confusion and diffusion. For discrete memoryless channels (DMCs), an analytical
framework is provided showing the tradeoffs among finite blocklength,
maximum/minimum possible transmission rates, and BER requirements for the
legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Also, the security gap is
analytically studied for Gaussian channels and the concept is extended to other
DMCs including binary symmetric channels (BSCs) and binary erasure channels
(BECs). For fading channels, the transmit power is optimized to minimize the
outage probability of the legitimate receiver subject to a BER threshold for
the eavesdropper.
