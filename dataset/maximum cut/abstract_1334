In order to extract the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element |V_{ub}|
from B -> X_u l anti-nu_l decays, the overwhelming background from B -> X_c l
anti-nu_l decays must be reduced by appropriate acceptance cuts. We study the
non-perturbative effects due to the motion of the b quark inside the B meson on
the phenomenologically relevant decay distributions of B -> X_u l anti-nu_l in
the presence of such cuts in a comparative analysis based on shape functions
and the parton model in the light-cone limit. Comparisons with recent data from
the CLEO, BABAR, and BELLE collaborations favor the shape-function approach.
