The longitudinal ultrasonic sound velocity and attenuation, the resistivity,
and lattice parameters were studied as a function of temperature from 30 K to
300 K in La1-xCaxMnO3 (0.5<x<0.9). For all the samples, a dramatic stiffening
of the sound velocity below the charge ordering transition temperature TCO was
directly driven by distinct changes of the lattice parameters due to the
formation of long range ordering of Jahn-Teller distorted MnO6 octahedra. The
relative change of the sound velocity (DeltaV/V) below TCO depends on the Ca
concentration x and reaches the maximum at x=0.75, implying that the effective
strength of electron-lattice interaction with the Jahn-Teller distortion is the
strongest at x=0.75 and hence the charge ordered state is mostly stabilized
near x=0.75 and insensitive to the application of a magnetic field, which is
supported by the charge transport properties under high magnetic fields up to
14T.
