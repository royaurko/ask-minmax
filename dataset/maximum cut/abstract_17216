The shear modulus of solid $^4$He exhibits an anomalous change of order
10%[1, 2] at low temperatures that is qualitatively similar to the much smaller
frequency change in torsional oscillator experiments. We propose that in solid
$^4$He the stiffening of the shear modulus with decreasing temperature can be
described with a glass susceptibility assuming a temperature dependent
relaxation time $\tau(T)$. The glass susceptibility captures the freezing out
of glassy degrees of freedom below a characteristic crossover temperature
$T_X$. There the dynamic response of the solid satisfies $\omega \tau(T_X) \sim
1$, thus leading to an increase in the shear modulus. Within this model we
predict that the maximum change of the amplitude of the shear modulus and the
height of the dissipation peak are independent of the applied frequency
$\omega$. Our calculations also show a qualitative difference in behavior of
the shear modulus depending on the temperature behavior of the glass relaxation
time $\tau(T)$. These predictions can be tested by comparing the complex shear
modulus with experiments at different frequencies and for different levels of
disorder. [1] J. Day and J. Beamish, Nature 150, 853 (2007). [2] J. Day, O.
