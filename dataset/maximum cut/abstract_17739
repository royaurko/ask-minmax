In this paper we extend the Weibull power series (WPS) class of distributions
and named this new class as extended Weibull power series (EWPS) class of
distributions. The EWPS distributions are related to series and parallel
systems with a random num- ber of components, whereas the WPS distributions
(Morais and Barreto-Souza, 2011) are related to series systems only. Unlike the
WPS distributions, for which the Weibull is a limiting special case, the
Weibull law is a particular case of the EWPS distributions. We prove that the
distributions in this class are identifiable under a simple assumption. We also
prove stochastic and hazard rate order results and highlight that the shapes of
the EWPS distributions are markedly more flexible than the shapes of the WPS
distributions. We define a regression model for the EWPS response random
variable to model a scale parameter and its quantiles. We present the maximum
likelihood estimator and prove its consistency and normal asymptotic
distribution. Although the construction of this class was motivated by series
and parallel systems, the EWPS distributions are suitable for modeling a wide
range of positive data sets. To illustrate potential uses of this model, we
apply it to a real data set on the tensile strength of coconut fibers and
present a simple device for diagnostic purposes.
