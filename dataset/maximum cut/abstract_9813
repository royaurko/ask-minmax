The Sun-as-a-star helioseismic spectrophotometer GOLF and photometer VIRGO
instruments onboard the SoHO spacecraft are collecting high-quality, continuous
data since April 1996. We analyze here these unique datasets in order to
investigate the peculiar and weak on-going solar cycle 24. As this cycle 24 is
reaching its maximum, we compare its rising phase with the rising phase of the
previous solar cycle 23.
