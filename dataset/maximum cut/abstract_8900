Two-qubit states occupy a large and relatively unexplored Hilbert space. Such
states can be succinctly characterized by their degree of entanglement and
purity. In this letter we investigate entangled mixed states and present a
class of states that have the maximum amount of entanglement for a given linear
entropy.
