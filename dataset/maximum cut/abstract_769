In this paper we present a statistical analysis of the gamma-ray spectra of
flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) compared to those of BL Lacs. The average
spectra and possible systematic deviations from power-law behaviour are
investigated by summing up the intensity and the power-law fit statistic for
both classes of objects. We also compare the time-averaged spectrum to that at
the time of gamma-ray outbursts. The spectrum of the average AGN is softer than
that of the extragalactic gamma-ray background. It may be that BL Lacs, which
on average have a harder spectrum than FSRQs, make up the bulk of the
extragalactic background. We also find apparent cut-offs at both low and high
energies in the spectra of FSRQs at the time of gamma-ray outbursts. While the
cut-off at high energies may have something to do with opacity, the cut-off at
low energies may be taken as indication that the gamma-ray emission of FSRQs is
not a one component spectrum.
