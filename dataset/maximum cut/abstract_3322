The behavior of strongly coupled Radial Photonic Crystals shells is
investigated as a potential alternative to transfer electromagnetic energy
wirelessly. These sub-wavelength resonant microstructures, which are based on
anisotropic metamaterials, can produce efficient coupling phenomena due to
their high quality factor. A configuration of selected constitutive parameters
(permittivity and permeability) is analyzed in terms of its resonant
characteristics. The coupling to loss ratio between two coupled resonators is
calculated as a function of distance, the maximum (in excess of 300) is
obtained when the shells are separated by three times their radius. Under
practical conditions an 83% of maximum power transfer has been also estimated.
