We have implemented a virtual Young's double slit experiment for hard X-ray
photons with micro-fabricated bi-prisms. We observe fringe patterns with a
scintillator, and quantify interferograms by detecting X-ray fluorescence from
a scanned 30nm Cr metal film. The observed intensities are best modeled with a
near-field, Fresnel analysis. The maximum fringe number in the overlap region
is proportional to the ratio of real to imaginary parts refractive index of the
prism material. The horizontal and vertical transverse coherence lengths at
beamline APS 8-ID are measured.
