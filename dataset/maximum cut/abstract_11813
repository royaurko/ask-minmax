We study time series concerning rare events. The occurrence of a rare event
is depicted as a jump of constant intensity always occurring in the same
direction, thereby generating an asymmetric diffusion process. We consider the
case where the waiting time distribution is an inverse power law with index
$\mu$. We focus our attention on $\mu<3$, and we evaluate the scaling $\delta$
of the resulting diffusion process. We prove that $\delta$ gets its maximum
value, $\delta=1$, corresponding to the ballistic motion, at $\mu=2$. We study
the resulting diffusion process by means of joint use of the continuous time
random walk and of the generalized central limit theorem, as well as adopting
numerical treatment. We show that rendering asymmetric the diffusion process
yelds the significant benefit of enhancing the value of the scaling parameter
$\delta$. Furthermore, this scaling parameter becomes sensitive to the power
index $\mu$ in the whole region $1<\mu<3$. Finally, we show our method in
action on real data concerning human heartbeat sequences.
