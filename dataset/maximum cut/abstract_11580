High altitude meteors become luminous at altitudes above $\sim$130 km, where
the standard ablation theory of meteor light production is not applicable. The
physical mechanism responsible for their glow has not been known. We present a
model that explains their existence, morphology and lightcurves. The model is
based on particles ejected from the meteoroid surface through the sputtering
process. The kinetic energy of such a sputtered particle is typically more than
1,000 times larger than the energy of particles in the surrounding atmosphere.
Thus the sputtered particle creates a cascade of collisions in the atmosphere
during thermalization. We show analytically that this process is capable of
producing enough light for detection. We also explain the observed relationship
between the beginning height of high altitude meteors and their maximum
brightness. In addition, meteors are modeled with a Monte Carlo code developed
specifically for this phenomenon. Theoretical images reproduce the observed
shapes and sizes of high altitude meteors. Their exact shape depends on the
relative angle between the meteor path and observer's line of sight.
