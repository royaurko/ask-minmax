We propose the formulation of a dihadron fragmentation function in terms of
parton matrix elements. Under the collinear factorization approximation and
facilitated by the cut-vertex technique, the two hadron inclusive cross section
at leading order (LO) in e+ e- annihilation is shown to factorize into a short
distance parton cross section and the long distance dihadron fragmentation
function. We also derive the DGLAP evolution equation of this function at
leading log. The evolution equation for the non-singlet quark fragmentation
function is solved numerically with a simple ansatz for the initial condition
and results are presented for cases of physical interest.
