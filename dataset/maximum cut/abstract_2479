We present results from a calculation of the QCD equation of state with two
light (up, down) and one heavier (strange) quark mass performed on lattices
with three different values of the lattice cut-off. We show that also on the
finest lattice analyzed by us observables sensitive to deconfinement and chiral
symmetry restoration, respectively, vary most rapidly in the same temperature
regime.
