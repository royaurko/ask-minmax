We present Herschel PACS photometry of seventeen B- to M-type stars in the 30
Myr-old Tucana-Horologium Association. This work is part of the Herschel Open
Time Key Programme "Gas in Protoplanetary Systems" (GASPS). Six of the
seventeen targets were found to have infrared excesses significantly greater
than the expected stellar IR fluxes, including a previously unknown disk around
HD30051. These six debris disks were fitted with single-temperature blackbody
models to estimate the temperatures and abundances of the dust in the systems.
For the five stars that show excess emission in the Herschel PACS photometry
and also have Spitzer IRS spectra, we fit the data with models of optically
thin debris disks with realistic grain properties in order to better estimate
the disk parameters. The model is determined by a set of six parameters:
surface density index, grain size distribution index, minimum and maximum grain
sizes, and the inner and outer radii of the disk. The best fitting parameters
give us constraints on the geometry of the dust in these systems, as well as
lower limits to the total dust masses. The HD105 disk was further constrained
by fitting marginally resolved PACS 70 micron imaging.
