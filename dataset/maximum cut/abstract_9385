In this paper we study those generic intervals in the Bruhat order of the
symmetric group that are isomorphic to the principal order ideal of a
permutation w, and consider when the minimum and maximum elements of those
intervals are related by a certain property of their reduced words. We show
that the property does not hold when w is a decomposable permutation, and that
the property always holds when w is the longest permutation.
