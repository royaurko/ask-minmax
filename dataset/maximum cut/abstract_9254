In this paper, we study the behavior of the pseudo-Newtonian force and
potential about a higher dimensional rotating black hole. We obtain conditions
for the force character from an attractive to repulsive. We also find the
conditions under which force attains a maximum value. The results of this paper
generalizes the already found structure of force and potential about a five
dimensional rotating black hole. It is interesting to note that we recover the
five dimensional results under a special case.
