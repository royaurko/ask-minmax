Using data collected by the MACRO experiment during the years 1989-1996, we
show evidence for the shadow of the moon in the underground cosmic ray flux
with a significance of 3.6 sigma. This detection of the shadowing effect is the
first by an underground detector. A maximum-likelihood analysis is used to
determine that the angular resolution of the apparatus is 0.9+/-0.3 degrees.
These results demonstrate MACRO's capabilities as a muon telescope by
confirming its absolute pointing ability and quantifying its angular
resolution.
