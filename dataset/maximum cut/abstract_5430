We analyse some acoustic emission time series obtained from a lathe machining
process. Considering the dynamic evolution of the process we apply two classes
of well known stationary stochastic time series models. We apply a preliminary
root mean square (RMS) transformation followed by an ARMA analysis; results
thereof are mainly related to the description of the continuous part (plastic
deformation) of the signal. An analysis of acoustic emission, as some previous
works show, may also be performed with the scope of understanding the evolution
of the ageing process that causes the degradation of the working tools. Once
the importance of the discrete part of the acoustic emission signals (i.e.
isolated amplitude bursts) in the ageing process is understood, we apply a
stochastic analysis based on point processes waiting times between bursts and
to identify a parameter with which to characterise the wear level of the
working tool. A Weibull distribution seems to adequately describe the waiting
times distribution.
