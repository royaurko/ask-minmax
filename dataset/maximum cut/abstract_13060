The past few years have seen an increasing focus on energy harvesting issue,
including power supply for portable electric devices. Utilize scavenging
ambient energy from the environment could eliminate the need for batteries and
increase portable device lifetimes indefinitely. In addition, through MEMS
technology fabricated micro-generator could easy integrate with these small or
portable devices. Several different ambient sources, including solar, vibration
and temperature effect, have already exploited [1-3]. Each energy source should
be used in suitable environment, therefore to produce maximum efficiency. In
this paper, we present an acoustic wave actuated micro-generator for power
system by using the energy of acoustic waves, such as the sound from human
voices or speakerphone, to actuate a MEMS-type electromagnetic transducer. This
provides a longer device lifetime and greater power system convenience.
Moreover, it is convenient to integrate MEMS-based microgenerators with small
or porta le devices
