We discuss the behaviour of the signature index class of closed foliated
bundles under the operation of cutting and pasting. Along the way we establish
several index theoretic results: we define Atiyah-Patodi-Singer (APS) index
classes for Dirac-type operators on foliated bundles with boundary; we prove a
relative index theorem for the difference of two APS-index classes associated
to different boundary conditions; we prove a gluing formula on closed foliated
bundles that are the union of two foliated bundles with boundary; we establish
a variational formula for APS-index classes of a 1-parameter family of
Dirac-type operators on foliated bundles (this formula involves the
noncommutative spectral flow of the boundary family). All these formulas take
place in the $K$-theory of a suitable cross-product algebra.
 We then apply these results in order to find sufficient conditions ensuring
the equality of the signature index classes of two cut-and-paste equivalent
foliated bundles. We give applications to the question of when the Baum-Connes
higher signatures of closed foliated bundles are cut-and-paste invariant.
