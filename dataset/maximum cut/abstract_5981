To process data obtained during interference experiments in high-energy
physics, methods of spectral analysis are employed. Methods of spectral
analysis, in which an autoregression model of experimental data is used, such
as the maximum entropy technique as well as Pisarenko and Prony's method, are
described. To show the potentials of the methods, experimental and simulated
hummed data are discussed as an example.
