Extreme value theory is concerned with probabilistic and statistical
questions related to very high or very low values in sequences of random
variables and in stochastic processes. The subject has a rich mathematical
theory and also a long tradition of applications in a variety of areas. Among
many excellent books on the subject, Coles [2] while the book by concentrates
on data analysis and statistical inference for extremes. In this article, we
present a case study wherein we model annual maximum yearly rainfall data using
the generalized extreme value distribution. Also, we use R software for data
analysis and give the R codes in the appendix.
