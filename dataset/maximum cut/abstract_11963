The shot noise produced by tunneling of electrons and holes into a double dot
system incorporated inside a p-i-n junction is investigated theoretically. The
enhancement of the shot noise is shown to originate from the entangled
electron-hole pair created by superradiance. The analogy to the superconducting
cooper pair box is pointed out. A series of Zeno-like measurements is shown to
destroy the entanglement, except for the case of maximum entanglement.
