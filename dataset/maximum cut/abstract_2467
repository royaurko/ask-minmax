The holographic representation of the entanglement entropy of four
dimensional conformal field theories is studied. By generalizing the replica
trick the anomalous terms in the entanglement entropy are evaluated. The same
terms in the holographic representation are calculated by a method which does
not require the solution of the equations of motion or a cut off. The two
calculations disagree for rather generic geometries. The reasons for the
disagreement are analyzed.
