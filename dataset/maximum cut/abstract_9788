A study of proton-proton collisions at very high energy has revealed a "black
disk," whose radius grows with the logarithm of the center-of-mass energy,
surrounded by an edge of approximately constant width 1 fm. We interpret this
behavior as the maximum length of a QCD string connecting the color triplet and
antitriplet components of the proton, and propose further tests of this
explanation.
