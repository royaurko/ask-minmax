Synchronization is shown to occur in spatially extended systems under the
effect of additive spatio-temporal noise. In analogy to low dimensional
systems, synchronized states are observable only if the maximum Lyapunov
exponent $\Lambda$ is negative. However, a sufficiently high noise level can
lead, in map with finite domain of definition, to nonlinear propagation of
information, even in non chaotic systems. In this latter case the transition to
synchronization is ruled by a new ingredient : the propagation velocity of
information $V_F$. As a general statement, we can affirm that if $V_F$ is
finite the time needed to achieve a synchronized trajectory grows exponentially
with the system size $L$, while it increases logarithmically with $L$ when, for
sufficiently large noise amplitude, $V_F = 0$ .
