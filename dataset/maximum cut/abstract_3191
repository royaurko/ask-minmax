The statistical model assuming chemical equilibriumand local strangeness
conservation describes most of the observed features of strange particle
production from SIS up to RHIC. Deviations are found as the maximum in the
measured K+/pi+ ratio is much sharper than in the model calculations. At the
incident energy of the maximum, the statistical model shows that freeze out
changes regime from one being dominated by baryons at the lower energies toward
one being dominated by mesons. It will be shown how deviations from the usual
freeze-out curve influence the various particle ratios. Furthermore, other
observables exhibit also changes just in this energy regime.
