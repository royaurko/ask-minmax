We derive a holographic relation for the dS static patch with the dual field
theory defined on the observer horizon. The starting point is the duality of
higher-spin theory on AdS_4 and the O(N) vector model. We build on a similar
analytic continuation as used recently to obtain a realization of dS/CFT, and
adapt it to the static patch. The resulting duality relates higher-spin theory
on the dS_4 static patch to a cut-off CFT on the cylinder RxS^2. The
construction permits a derivation of the finite thermodynamic entropy
associated to the horizon of the static patch from the dual field theory. As a
further brick we recover the spectrum of quasinormal frequencies from the
correlation functions of the boundary theory. In the last part we incorporate
the dS/dS correspondence as an independent proposal for holography on dS and
show that a concrete realization can be obtained by similar reasoning.
