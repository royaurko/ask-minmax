Deep sequencing has enabled the investigation of a wide range of
environmental microbial ecosystems, but the high memory requirements for {\em
de novo} assembly of short-read shotgun sequencing data from these complex
populations are an increasingly large practical barrier. Here we introduce a
memory-efficient graph representation with which we can analyze the k-mer
connectivity of metagenomic samples. The graph representation is based on a
probabilistic data structure, a Bloom filter, that allows us to efficiently
store assembly graphs in as little as 4 bits per k-mer, albeit inexactly. We
show that this data structure accurately represents DNA assembly graphs in low
memory. We apply this data structure to the problem of partitioning assembly
graphs into components as a prelude to assembly, and show that this reduces the
overall memory requirements for {\em de novo} assembly of metagenomes. On one
soil metagenome assembly, this approach achieves a nearly 40-fold decrease in
the maximum memory requirements for assembly. This probabilistic graph
representation is a significant theoretical advance in storing assembly graphs
and also yields immediate leverage on metagenomic assembly.
