According to the Narnhofer Thirring Theorem interacting systems at finite
temperature cannot be described by particles with a sharp dispersion law. It is
therefore mandatory to develop new methods to extract particle masses at finite
temperature. The Maximum Entropy method offers a path to obtain the spectral
function of a particle correlation function directly. We have implemented the
method and tested it with zero temperature Upsilon correlation functions
obtained from an NRQCD simulation. Results for different smearing functions are
discussed.
