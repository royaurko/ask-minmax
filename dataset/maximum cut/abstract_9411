The transformations of $W$-type entangled states by using local operations
assisted with classical communication are investigated. For this purpose, a
parametrization of the $W$-type states which remains invariant under local
unitary transformations is proposed and a complete characterization of the
local operations carried out by a single party is given. These are used for
deriving the necessary and sufficient conditions for deterministic
transformations. A convenient upper bound for the maximum probability of
distillation of arbitrary target states is also found.
