We estimate the critical magnetic field strength at which the lowest or
second Landau levels play an important role in the quark phase inside the
hybrid stars, and show that the magnetic field should be in the order of
$10^{19}$ Gauss at the nuclear density $\sim0.16$ fm$^{-3}$. We also find that
the pressure of quark matter settling only in the lowest Landau level can be
expressed as a function of the energy density independently of the magnetic
field strength, which corresponds to the causality limit of a stiff equation of
state. Adiabatic index of quark matter well exceeds 4/3 in the core, and we
find a possibility to construct massive hybrid star models occupied in large
part by quark matter, whose maximum mass becomes larger than two solar mass.
