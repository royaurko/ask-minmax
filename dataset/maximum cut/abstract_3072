We study analytically a thermal Brownian motor model and calculate exactly
the Onsager coefficients. We show how the reciprocity relation holds and that
the determinant of the Onsager matrix vanishes. Such condition implies that the
device is built with tight coupling. This explains why Carnot's efficiency can
be achieved in the limit of infinitely slow velocities. We also prove that the
efficiency at maximum power has the maximum possible value, which corresponds
to the Curzon-Alhborn bound. Finally, we discuss the model acting as a Brownian
refrigerator.
