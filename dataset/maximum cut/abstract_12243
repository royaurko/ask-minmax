The local and global properties of the Goetz thick plane domain wall
space-time are studied. It is found that when the surface energy of the wall is
greater than a critical value $\sigma_{c}$, the space-time will be closed by
intermediate singularities at a finite proper distance. A model is presented in
which these singularities will give rise to scalar ones when interacting with
null fluids. The maximum extension of the space-time of the wall whose surface
energy is less than $\sigma_{c}$ is presented. It is shown that for certain
choice of the free parameter the space-time has a black hole structure but with
plane symmetry.
