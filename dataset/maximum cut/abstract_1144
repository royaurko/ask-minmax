We generalize a non-local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to a generic
representation of the gauge group. The critical temperature is given in a
closed form as a function of the parameters of the theory and the cut-off. This
result is generally useful in the understanding of QCD-like theories and their
thermodynamical behavior.
