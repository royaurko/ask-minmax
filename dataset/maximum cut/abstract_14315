Why bother with asteroseismology while studying exoplanets? There are several
answers to this question. Asteroseismology and exoplanetary sciences have much
in common and the synergy between the two opens up new aspects in both fields.
These fields and stellar activity, when taken together, allow maximum
extraction of information from exoplanet space missions. Asteroseismology of
the host star has already proved its value in a number of exoplanet systems by
its unprecedented precision in determining stellar parameters. In addition,
asteroseismology allows the possibility of discovering new exoplanets through
time delay studies. The study of the interaction between exoplanets and their
host stars opens new windows on various physical processes. In this review I
will summarize past and current research in exoplanet asteroseismology and
explore some guidelines for the future.
