An overview is given of Bayesian inversion and regularization procedures. In
particular, the conceptual basis of the maximum entropy method (MEM) is
discussed, and extensions to positive/negative and complex data are
highlighted. Other deconvolution methods are also discussed within the Bayesian
context, focusing mainly on the comparison of Wiener filtering, Massive
Inference and the Pixon method, using examples from both astronomical and
non-astronomical applications.
