We measured the far infrared reflectivity of two superconducting
Pr(2-x)Ce(x)CuO(4) films above and below Tc. The reflectivity in the
superconducting state increases and the optical conductivity drops at low
energies, in agreement with the opening of a (possibly) anisotropic
superconducting gap. The maximum energy of the gap scales roughly with Tc as 2
Delta_{max} / kB Tc ~ 4.7. We determined absolute values of the penetration
depth at 5 K as lambda_{ab} = (3300 +/- 700) A for x = 0.15 and lambda_{ab} =
(2000 +/- 300) A for x = 0.17. A spectral weight analysis shows that the
Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule is satisfied at conventional low energy scales
\~ 4 Delta_{max}.
