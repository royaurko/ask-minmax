We study inelastic electron-electron scattering mediated by the exchange
interaction of electrons with magnetic impurities, and find the kernel of the
corresponding two-particle collision integral. In a wide region of parameters,
the kernel K is proportional to the inverse square of the transferred energy,
$K\propto J^4/E^2$. The exchange constant J is renormalized due to the Kondo
effect, yielding an additional weak dependence of K on the energies of the
colliding electrons. At small energy transfers, the $1/E^2$ divergence is cut
off; the cut-off energy is determined by the dynamics of the impurity spins.
The obtained results may provide a quantitative explanation of the experiments
of Pothier et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 3490 (1997)] on anomalously strong
energy relaxation in short metallic wires.
