The definition of the virtual photon impact factor involves the integration
of the s-channel discontinuity of the photon-Reggeon scattering amplitude over
the right cut. It permits to formulate a new approach for the calculation of
the impact factor based on analytical properties of the amplitude in question.
In the next-to-leading order it may give a possibility for considerable
simplification of the calculation. We have shown that a part of the diagrams
contributing to the impact factor can be treated without their real
calculation.
