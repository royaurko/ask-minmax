We apply the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) to the problem of
maximum entropy and evaporation/absorption of energy of black holes near the
Planck scale. We find within this general approach corrections to the maximum
entropy, and indications for quenching of the evaporation because not only the
evaporation term goes to a finite limit, but also because absorption of quanta
seems to help the balance for black holes in a thermal bath. Then, residual
masses around the Planck scale may be the final outcome of primordial black
hole evaporation.
