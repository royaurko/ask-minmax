A simple explicit construction is provided of a partition-valued
fragmentation process whose distribution on partitions of $[n]=\{1,...,n\}$ at
time $\theta \ge 0$ is governed by the Ewens sampling formula with parameter
$\theta$. These partition-valued processes are exchangeable and consistent, as
$n$ varies. They can be derived by uniform sampling from a corresponding mass
fragmentation process defined by cutting a unit interval at the points of a
Poisson process with intensity $\theta x^{-1} \diff x$ on ${\mathbb R}_+$,
arranged to be intensifying as $\theta$ increases.
