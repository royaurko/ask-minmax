We demonstrate giant magnetoresistance in Fe/MoS$_2$/Fe junctions by means of
\textit{ab-initio} transport calculations. We show that junctions incorporating
either a mono- or a bi-layer of MoS$_2$ are metallic and that Fe acts as an
efficient spin injector into MoS$_2$ with an efficiency of about 45\%. This is
the result of the strong coupling between the Fe and S atoms at the interface.
For junctions of greater thickness a maximum magnetoresistance of $\sim$300\%
is obtained, which remains robust with the applied bias as long as transport is
in the tunneling limit. A general recipe for improving the magnetoresistance in
spin valves incorporating layered transition metal dichalcogenides is proposed.
