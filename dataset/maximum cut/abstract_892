The general structure of the conformal boundary $\mathscr{I}^+$ of
asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes is investigated. First we show that
Penrose's quasi-local mass, associated with a cut ${\cal S}$ of the conformal
boundary, can be zero even in the presence of outgoing gravitational radiation.
On the other hand, following a Witten--type spinorial proof, we show that an
analogous expression based on the Nester--Witten form is finite only if the
Witten spinor field solves the 2-surface twistor equation on ${\cal S}$, and it
yields a positive functional on the 2-surface twistor space on ${\cal S}$,
provided the matter fields satisfy the dominant energy condition. Moreover,
this functional is vanishing if and only if the domain of dependence of the
spacelike hypersurface which intersects $\mathscr{I}^+$ in the cut ${\cal S}$
is locally isometric to the de Sitter spacetime. For non-contorted cuts this
functional yields an invariant analogous to the Bondi mass.
