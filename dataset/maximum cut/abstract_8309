We have used available intermediate degree p-mode frequencies for the solar
cycle 23 to check the validity of previously derived empirical relations for
frequency shifts (Jain et al.: 2000, Solar Phys., 192, 487). We find that the
calculated and observed frequency shifts during the rising phase of the cycle
23 are in good agreement. The observed frequency shift from minimum to maximum
of this cycle as calculated from MDI frequency data sets is 251 $\pm$ 7 nHz and
from GONG data is 238 $\pm$ 11 nHz. These values are in close agreement with
the empirically predicted value of 271 $\pm$ 22 nHz.
