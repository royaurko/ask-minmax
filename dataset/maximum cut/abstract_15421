In this paper, we study a real-time scalable video broadcast over wireless
networks in instantly decodable network coded (IDNC) systems. Such real-time
scalable video has a hard deadline and imposes a decoding order on the video
layers.We first derive the upper bound on the probability that the individual
completion times of all receivers meet the deadline. Using this probability, we
design two prioritized IDNC algorithms, namely the expanding window IDNC
(EW-IDNC) algorithm and the non-overlapping window IDNC (NOW-IDNC) algorithm.
These algorithms provide a high level of protection to the most important video
layer before considering additional video layers in coding decisions. Moreover,
in these algorithms, we select an appropriate packet combination over a given
number of video layers so that these video layers are decoded by the maximum
number of receivers before the deadline. We formulate this packet selection
problem as a two-stage maximal clique selection problem over an IDNC graph.
Simulation results over a real scalable video stream show that our proposed
EW-IDNC and NOW-IDNC algorithms improve the received video quality compared to
the existing IDNC algorithms.
