We examine the cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum model in a dynamic setting
where scalar fields are present in the bulk as well as the branes. This
generates a mechanism similar to that of Goldberger-Wise for radion
stabilization and the recovery of late-cosmology features in the branes. Due to
the induced radion dynamics, the inflating branes roll towards the minimum of
the radion potential, thereby exiting inflation and reheating the Universe. In
the slow roll part of the potential, the 'TeV' branes have maximum inflation
rate and energy as their coupling to the radion and bulk modes have minimum
suppresion. Hence, when rolling down the steep end of the potential towards the
stable point, the radion field (which appears as the inflaton of the effective
4D theory in the branes) decays very fast, reheats the Universe .This process
results decayin a decrease of brane's canonical vacuum energy $\Lambda_4$.
However, at the minimum of the potential $\Lambda_4$ is small but not
neccessarily zero and the fine-tuning issue remains .Density perturbation
constraints introduce an upper bound when the radion stabilizies. Due to the
large radion mass and strong suppression to the bulk modes, moduli problems and
bulk reheating do not occur. The reheat temperature and a sufficient number of
e-folding constraints for the brane-universe are also satisfied. The model
therefore recovers the radiation dominated FRW universe.
