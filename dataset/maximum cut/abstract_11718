It is shown that the two-body character of the interaction in a many-body
system gives rise to specific correlations between the components of compound
states, even if this interaction is completely random. Surprisingly, these
correlations increase with the increase of the number of active (valence)
particles. Statistical theory of transition amplitudes between compound states,
which takes into account these correlation is developed and tested within the
framework of the Two-Body Random Interaction Model. It is demonstrated that a
feature, which can be called ``correlation resonance'', appears in the
distribution of the transition matrix amplitudes, since the correlations
strongly reduce the transition amplitudes at the tails and increase them near
the maximum of the distribution.
