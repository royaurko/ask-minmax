We present a direct bijection between descending plane partitions with no
special parts and permutation matrices. This bijection has the desirable
property that the number of parts of the descending plane partition corresponds
to the inversion number of the permutation. Additionally, the number of maximum
parts in the descending plane partition corresponds to the position of the one
in the last column of the permutation matrix. We also discuss the possible
extension of this approach to finding a bijection between descending plane
partitions and alternating sign matrices.
