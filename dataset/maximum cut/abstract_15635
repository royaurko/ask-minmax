In the current work we investigate the behaviour of a non-local stochastic
parabolic problem. We first prove the local-in-time existence and uniqueness of
a weak solution. Then we check the extendability in time of the weak solution.
In particular, the rest of paper is devoted to the investigation of the
conditions under which finite-time blow-up occurs. We first prove that noise
term induced finite-time blow up takes place when the stochastic term is rather
big independently of the size of the non-local term. Afterwards, non-local-term
induced finite-time blow occurs when the nonlinearity satisfies some specific
growth conditions. In this case some fundamental results like maximum principle
and Hopf's type lemma in the context of SPDEs are first provided and later
Kaplan's eigenfunction method adjusted to the our non-local SPDE is employed.
