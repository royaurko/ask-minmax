Non-zero width and Coulomb rescattering effects are analyzed for the pair
production of smuons and selectrons near the thresholds in e+ e- and e- e-
collisions, respectively. The excitation curves are predicted in a
gauge-invariant form. Energy cuts are designed to reduce irreducible
supersymmetric backgrounds.
