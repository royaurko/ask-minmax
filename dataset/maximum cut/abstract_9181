We will discuss some sharp estimates for CMC graphs in a Riemannian
3-manifold MxR whose boundary is contained in a slice. We will start by giving
sharp lower bounds for the geodesic curvature of the boundary and improve these
bounds when assuming additional restrictions on the maximum height that such a
surface reaches in MxR. We will also give a lower bound for the distance from
an interior point to the boundary in terms of the height at that point, and
characterize when these bounds are attained.
