MgB2 thin films were deposited on SiC buffered Si substrates by sequential
electron beam evaporation of B-Mg bilayer followed by in-situ annealing. The
application of a SiC buffer layer enables the maximum annealing temperature of
830 C. The Transmission Electron Microscopy analysis confirms the growth of a
nanogranular MgB2 film and the presence of a Mg2Si compound at the surface of
the film. The 150-200 nm thick films show a maximum zero resistance critical
temperature TC0 above 37 K and a critical current density JC ~ 106 A/cm2 at
11K.
