A 6-qubit hyperentangled state has been realized by entangling two photons in
three degrees of freedom. These correspond to the polarization, the
longitudinal momentum and the indistinguishable emission produced by a
2-crystal system operating with Type I phase matching in the spontaneous
parametric down conversion regime. The state has been characterized by a
chained interferometric apparatus and its complete entangled nature has been
tested by a novel witness criterium specifically introduced for hyperentangled
states. The experiment represents the first realization of a genuine
hyperentangled state with the maximum entanglement between the two particles
allowed in the given Hilbert space.
