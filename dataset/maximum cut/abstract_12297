The merger of two neutron stars usually produces a remnant with a mass
significantly above the single (nonrotating) neutron star maximum mass. In some
cases, the remnant will be stabilized against collapse by rapid, differential
rotation. MHD-driven angular momentum transport eventually leads to the
collapse of the remnant's core, resulting in a black hole surrounded by a
massive accretion torus. Here we present simulations of this process. The
plausibility of generating short duration gamma ray bursts through this
scenario is discussed.
