We discuss the spectrum of the tensor metric perturbations and the stability
of warped compactifications with the de Sitter spacetime in the
higher-dimensional gravity. The spacetime structure is given in terms of the
warped product of the non-compact direction, the spherical internal dimensions
and the four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. To realize a finite bulk volume,
we construct the brane world model, using the cut-copy-paste method. Then, we
compactify the spherical directions on the brane. In any case, we show the
existence of the massless zero mode and the mass gap of it with massive
Kaluza-Klein modes. Although the brane involves the spherical dimensions, no
light massive mode is excited. We also investigate the scalar perturbations,
and show that the model is unstable due to the existence of a tachyonic bound
state, which seems to have the universal negative mass square, irrespective of
the number of spacetime dimensions.
