We construct a simple accretion model of a rotating pressureless gas sphere
onto a Schwarzschild black hole. We show how to build analytic solutions in
terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. This construction represents a general
relativistic generalisation of the Newtonian accretion model first proposed by
Ulrich (1976). In exactly the same form as it occurs for the Newtonian case,
the flow naturally predicts the existence of an equatorial rotating accretion
disc about the hole. However, the radius of the disc increases monotonically
without limit as the flow reaches its maximum allowed angular momentum.
