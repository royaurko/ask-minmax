We present preliminary results on the metastable behavior of a nonequilibrium
ferromagnetic system. The metastable state mean lifetime is a non-monotonous
function of temperature; it shows a maximum at certain non-zero temperature
which depends on the strengh of the nonequilibrium perturbation. This is in
contrast with the equilibrium case in which lifetime increases monotonously as
the temperature is decreasesed. We also report on avalanches during the decay
from the metastable state. Assuming both free boundaries and nonequilibrium
impurities, the avalanches exhibit power-law size and lifetime distributions.
Such scale free behavior is very sensible. The chances are that our
observations may be observable in real (i.e. impure) ferromagnetic
nanoparticles.
