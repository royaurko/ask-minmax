We present the black hole solutions and analyse their properties in the
superstring effective field theory with the Gauss-Bonnet curvature correction
terms. We find qualitative differences in our results from those obtained in
the truncated model in the Einstein frame. The main difference in our model
from the truncated one is that the existence of a turning point in the
mass-area curve, the mass-entropy curve, and the mass-temperature curve in five
and higher dimensions, where we expect a change of stability. We also find a
mass gap in our model, where there is no black hole solution. In five
dimensions, there exists a maximum black hole temperature and the temperature
vanishes at the minimum mass, which is not found in the truncated model.
