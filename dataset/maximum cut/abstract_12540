Our interest is in the cumulative probabilities Pr(L(t) \le l) for the
maximum length of increasing subsequences in Poissonized ensembles of random
permutations, random fixed point free involutions and reversed random fixed
point free involutions. It is shown that these probabilities are equal to the
hard edge gap probability for matrix ensembles with unitary, orthogonal and
symplectic symmetry respectively. The gap probabilities can be written as a sum
over correlations for certain determinantal point processes. From these
expressions a proof can be given that the limiting form of Pr(L(t) \le l) in
the three cases is equal to the soft edge gap probability for matrix ensembles
with unitary, orthogonal and symplectic symmetry respectively, thereby
reclaiming theorems due to Baik-Deift-Johansson and Baik-Rains.
