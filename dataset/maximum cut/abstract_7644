We investigate the segregation of the extragalactic population via colour
criteria to produce an efficient and inexpensive methodology to select specific
source populations as a function of far-infrared flux. Combining galaxy
evolution scenarios and a detailed spectral library of galaxies, we produce
simulated catalogues incorporating segregation of the extragalactic population
into component types (Normal, star-forming, AGN) via color cuts. As a practical
application we apply our criteria to the deepest survey to be undertaken in the
far-infrared with the AKARI (formerly ASTRO-F) satellite. Using the
far-infrared wavebands of the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS, one of the
focal-plane instruments on AKARI) we successfully segregate the normal,
starburst and ULIRG populations. We also show that with additional MIR imaging
from AKARI's Infrared Camera (IRC), significant contamination and/or degeneracy
can be further decreased and show a particular example of the separation of
cool normal galaxies and cold ULIRG sources. We conclude that our criteria
provide an efficient means of selecting source populations (including rare
luminous objects) and produce colour-segregated source counts without the
requirement of time intensive ground-based follow up to differentiate between
the general galaxy population.
