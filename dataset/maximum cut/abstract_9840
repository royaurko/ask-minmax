Pressure dependence of the conductivity and thermoelectric power is measured
through the Mott transition in the layer organic conductor EtMe3P[Pd(dmit)2]2.
The critical behavior of the thermoelectric effect provides a clear and
objective determination of the Mott-Hubbard transition during the isothermal
pressure sweep. Above the critical end point, the metal-insulator crossing,
determined by the thermoelectric effect minimum value, is not found to coincide
with the maximum of the derivative of the conductivity as a function of
pressure. We show that the critical exponents of the Mott-Hubbard transition
fall within the Ising universality class regardless of the dimensionality of
the system.
