We study the multiband superfluid and the superfluid (SF) to band insulator
(BI) transition of strongly interacting fermionic atoms in an optical lattice
at a filling of two fermions per well. We present physical arguments to show
that a consistent mean field description of this problem is obtained by
retaining only intraband pairing between the fermions. Using this approach we
obtain a reasonable account of the experimentally observed critical lattice
depth for the SF-BI transition and the modulated components of the condensate
density, and make predictions for the lattice depth dependence of the
quasiparticle gap which can be tested in future experiments. We also highlight
some interesting features unique to cold atom superfluids within this intraband
pairing approximation; for instance, the pair field is forced to be uniform in
space and the Hartree field vanishes identically. These arise as a result of
the fact that while the pairing interaction is cut off at the scale of the
Debye frequency in conventional superconductors, or at the lattice scale in
tight binding model Hamiltonians, such a cutoff is absent for cold Fermi gases.
