For every finite field F and every positive integer r, there exists a finite
extension F' of F such that either SO(2r+1,F') or its simple derived group can
be realized as a Galois group over Q. If the characteristic of F is 3 or 5 (mod
8), then we can guarantee that the derived group of SO(2r+1,F') can be
realized. Likewise, for every finite field F, there exists a finite extension
F' of F such that the finite simple group G_2(F') can be realized a Galois
group over Q.
  The proof uses automorphic forms to construct Galois representations which
cut out Galois extensions of the desired type.
