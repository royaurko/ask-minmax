Prominent in the `Field of Streams' -- the Sloan Digital Sky Survey map of
substructure in the Galactic halo -- is an `Orphan Stream' without obvious
progenitor. In this numerical study, we show a possible connection between the
newly found dwarf satellite Ursa Major II (UMa II) and the Orphan Stream. We
provide numerical simulations of the disruption of UMa II that match the
observational data on the position, distance and morphology of the Orphan
Stream. We predict the radial velocity of UMa II as -100 km/s as well as the
existence of strong velocity gradients along the Orphan Stream. The velocity
dispersion of UMa II is expected to be high, though this can be caused both by
a high dark matter content or by the presence of unbound stars in a disrupted
remnant. However, the existence of a gradient in the mean radial velocity
across UMa II provides a clear-cut distinction between these possibilities. The
simulations support the idea that some of the anomalous, young halo globular
clusters like Palomar 1 or Arp 2 or Ruprecht 106 may be physically associated
with the Orphan Stream.
