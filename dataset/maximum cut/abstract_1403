The effects of the finite top quark width in the top pair production cross
section close to the threshold are discussed in this talk. We introduce a
$t\bar{t}$ cross section with a cut on the invariant masses of the top and
antitop that can be calculated theoretically with effective field theory (EFT)
methods. The matching procedure to implement the physical phase-space
boundaries in the NRQCD framework (``phase-space matching'') is briefly
outlined.
