The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope has discovered many gamma-ray pulsars,
both as radio-loud objects and radio-quiet or radio-weak pulsars that have been
identified through blind period searches. The latter presumably have gamma-ray
beams originating from high altitudes in the magnetosphere, resulting in little
or no overlap with the radio beam. The exponential cut-off of the emission at
high energy also points to a medium- or high-altitude origin of the gamma rays.
Population synthesis offers means to study two complementary aspects of the
gamma-ray pulsar population: energetics and light curve morphology. The latter
(peak multiplicity, position, separation, asymmetries, ...) can be used to
constrain the beam(s) geometry (their origin within the open magnetosphere,
evolution of the radiating region with pulsar power and age, ...). It can also
be used to constrain the obliquity and orientation of a pulsar in the framework
of a given accelerator model. We present preliminary results from new
simulations and light-curve analysis that indicate that the sample of Fermi
pulsars retains much of the geometrical information of the parent gamma-ray
pulsar population.
