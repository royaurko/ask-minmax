By considering a nonlinear combination of the probabilities of a system, a
physical interpretation of Tsallis statistics as representing the nonlinear
coupling or decoupling of statistical states is proposed. The escort
probability is interpreted as the coupled probability, with Q = 1 - q defined
as the degree of nonlinear coupling between the statistical states. Positive
values of Q have coupled statistical states, a larger entropy metric, and a
maximum coupled-entropy distribution of compact-support coupled-Gaussians.
Negative values of Q have decoupled statistical states and for -2 < Q < 0 a
maximum coupled-entropy distribution of heavy-tail coupled-Gaussians. The
conjugate transformation between the heavy-tail and compact-support domains is
shown to be -2Q/(2+Q) for coupled-Gaussian distributions. This conjugate
relationship has been used to extend the generalized Fourier transform to the
compact-support domain and to define a scale-invariant correlation structure
with heavy-tail limit distribution. In the present paper, we show that the
conjugate is a mapping between the source of nonlinearity in non-stationary
stochastic processes and the nonlinear coupling which defines the
coupled-Gaussian limit distribution. The effects of additive and multiplicative
noise are shown to be separable into the coupled-variance and the coupling
parameter Q, providing further evidence of the importance of the generalized
moments.
