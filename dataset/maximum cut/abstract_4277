The trilepton signal with missing transverse energy ($3\ell+\notE_T$, with
$\ell = e$ or $\mu$) from chargino-neutralino ($\chi^\pm_1 \chi^0_2$)
associated production and decays is studied for the upgraded Fermilab Tevatron
Collider with 2 TeV center of mass energy and integrated luminosity of 2
fb$^{-1}$ (MI) to 20 fb$^{-1}$ (TeV33). In some regions of parameter space in
the minimal supergravity model, $\chi^\pm_1$ and $\chi^0_2$ decay dominantly
into final states with $\tau$ leptons via real or virtual $\tilde{\tau}_1$
sleptons. The contributions from $\tau-$leptonic decays increase the trilepton
signal from $\chi^\pm_1 \chi^0_2$ by at least a factor of two when soft but
realistic cuts on lepton transverse momenta are used. With the Main Injector, a
trilepton signal can be detected at $\tan\beta \equiv v_2/v_1 \sim 3$ for
universal masses $m_{1/2}, m_0 \alt$ 200 GeV.
