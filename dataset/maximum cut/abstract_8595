We present a calculation of the maximum sensitivity achievable by the LIGO
Gravitational wave detector in construction, due to limiting thermal noise of
its suspensions. We present a method to calculate thermal noise that allows the
prediction of the suspension thermal noise in all its 6 degrees of freedom,
from the energy dissipation due to the elasticity of the suspension wires. We
show how this approach encompasses and explains previous ways to approximate
the thermal noise limit in gravitational waver detectors. We show how this
approach can be extended to more complicated suspensions to be used in future
LIGO detectors.
