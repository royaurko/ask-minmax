The properties of the ergosphere and energy extraction by Penrose process in
a rotating non-Kerr black hole are investigated. It is shown that the
ergosphere is sensitive to the deformation parameter $\epsilon$ and the shape
of the ergosphere becomes thick with increase of the parameter $\epsilon$. It
is of interest to note that, comparing with the Kerr black hole, the
deformation parameter $\epsilon$ can enhance the maximum efficiency of the
energy extraction process greatly. Especially, for the case of $a>M$, the
non-Kerr metric describes a superspinning compact object and the maximum
efficiency can exceed 60%, while it is only 20.7% for the extremal Kerr black
hole.
