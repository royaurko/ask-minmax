This paper gives a short summary of a mechanism of the enhanced paramagnetic
relaxation that acts on rapidly rotating interstellar grains. We show that the
Barnett magnetization that arises from grain rotation ensures that paramagnetic
absorption happens at its maximum efficiency, i.e. the conditions for
paramagnetic resonance are automatically fulfilled. The differences between the
predictions of classical Davis-Greenstein relaxation and the process which we
refer to as ``resonance relaxation'' are most pronounced for grains rotating
faster than 10 GHz. Microwave polarization is likely to be an impediment for
cosmic microwave background studies, but can provide a good tool for studying
galactic magnetic field.
