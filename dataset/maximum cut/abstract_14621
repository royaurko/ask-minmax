Wireless Electroencephalography (EEG) tele-monitoring systems performing
encoding and streaming over energy-hungry wireless channels are limited in
energy supply. However, excessive power consumption either in encoding or radio
channel may render some applications inapplicable. Hence, energy efficient
methods are needed to improve such applications. In this work, an embedded EEG
encoding system should be able to adjust its computational complexity, hence,
energy consumption according to the channel variations. To analyze the
distortion-compression ratio (PRD-CR) behavior of the wireless EEG system under
energy constraints, both encoding and transmission power should be taken into
consideration. In this paper, we propose a power-distortion- compression ratio
(P-PRD-CR) framework, which extends the traditional PRD-CR to P-PRD-CR model.
We analyze the computational complexity for a typical discrete wavelet
transform (DWT)-based encoding system. Using our developed P-PRD-CR framework,
the encoder effectively reconfigures the complexity control parameters to match
the energy constraints while retaining maximum reconstruction quality. Results
show that using the proposed framework, we can obtain higher reconstruction
accuracy for the same power constrained-portable device.
