The boundary of the Siegel disk of a quadratic polynomial with an
irrationally indifferent fixed point and the rotation number whose continued
fraction expansion is preperiodic has been observed to be self-similar with a
certain scaling ratio. The restriction of the dynamics of the quadratic
polynomial to the boundary of the Siegel disk is known to be quasisymmetrically
conjugate to the rigid rotation with the same rotation number. The geometry of
this self-similarity is universal for a large class of holomorphic maps. A
renormalization explanation of this universality has been proposed in the
literature.
  In this paper we provide an estimate on the quasisymmetric constant of the
conjugacy, and use it to prove bounds on the scaling ratio $\lambda$ of the
form $$\alpha^\gamma \le |\lambda| \le C \delta^s,$$ where $s$ is the period of
the continued fraction, and $\alpha \in (0,1)$ depends on the rotation number
in an explicit way, while $C>1$, $\delta \in (0,1)$ and $\gamma \in (0,1)$
depend only on the maximum of the integers in the continued fraction expansion
of the rotation number.
