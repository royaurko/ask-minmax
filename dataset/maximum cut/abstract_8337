Using simulation methods, distortion effects on energy spectra caused by
errors in the energy determination have been investigated. For cosmic ray
proton spectra, falling steeply with kinetic energy E as E-2.7, significant
effects appear. When magnetic spectrometers are used to determine the energy,
the relative error increases linearly with the energy and distortions with a
sinusoidal form appear starting at an energy that depends significantly on the
error distribution but at an energy lower than that corresponding to the
Maximum Detectable Rigidity of the spectrometer. The effect should be taken
into consideration when comparing data from different experiments, often having
different error distributions.
