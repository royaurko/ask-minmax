We present a theoretical study of the director fields and energetics of
nematic liquid crystal shells with two pairs of surface defects. The pairs of
defects can undergo abrupt transitions between a configuration of maximum
separation to at state in which the defects are confined to the thinnest
hemisphere. We construct a phase diagram that maps out the stability and
coexistence of these two configurations as a function of shell thickness and
thickness inhomogeneity. Our results compare favorably with the experimentally
observed transitions in nematic double emulsion droplets and explain their
hysteretic character.
