With generalizing the Brody distribution to include the Poisson, GOE and GUE
limits and with employing the maximum likelihood estimation technique, the
spectral statistics of different sequences were considered in the nearest
neighbor spacing statistics framework. The ML-based estimated values for the
parameters of generalized distribution propose more precisions in compare to
the predictions of other distributions. The transition in the level spacing
statistics of different systems were described by the distances of ML-based
predictions for generalized distribution to three limits which determined by
KLD measures.
