Analysis of observations of the SU UMa-type dwarf nova, CP Dra, between
February 2001 and April 2009 has revealed 15 outbursts, at least eight of which
were superoutbursts. The supercycle length is 230+/-56 d. We report photometry
of the 2001 and 2009 superoutbursts which shows that they were remarkably
similar to each other in terms of the profile of the outburst light curve and
the evolution of the superhumps. The outburst amplitude was 5.5 magnitudes and
the Psh during the plateau phase was measured at 0.08335(31) and 0.08343(21) d,
respectively. In both cases, Psh decreased during the course of the outburst
and there is some evidence that there was an abrupt change corresponding to the
point in the plateau where a slow fade begins. The 2001 superoutburst was
caught during the rise to maximum and during this period we found that the Psh
was significantly longer than during the subsequent stages. Superhumps of 0.3
magnitude peak-to-peak amplitude were present at the height of each outburst
and these gradually diminished during the outburst. We also report photometry
from the 2002 superoutburst, although coverage was not so extensive, which
revealed Psh = 0.08348(32) d consistent with the other two superoutbursts.
Analysis of time resolved photometry from the 2009 outburst revealed evidence
for an orbital period of 0.08084(86) d, giving a fractional superhump period
excess epsilon = 0.032(3) d.
