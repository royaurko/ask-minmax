A focused proof system provides a normal form to cut-free proofs that
structures the application of invertible and non-invertible inference rules.
The focused proof system of Andreoli for linear logic has been applied to both
the proof search and the proof normalization approaches to computation. Various
proof systems in literature exhibit characteristics of focusing to one degree
or another. We present a new, focused proof system for intuitionistic logic,
called LJF, and show how other proof systems can be mapped into the new system
by inserting logical connectives that prematurely stop focusing. We also use
LJF to design a focused proof system for classical logic. Our approach to the
design and analysis of these systems is based on the completeness of focusing
in linear logic and on the notion of polarity that appears in Girard's LC and
LU proof systems.
