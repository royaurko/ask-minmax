Longitudinal ion acceleration from high-intensity (I ~ 10^20 Wcm^-2) laser
interactions with helium gas jet targets (n_e ~ 0.04 n_c) have been observed.
The ion beam has a maximum energy for He^2+ of approximately 40 MeV and was
directional along the laser propagation path, with the highest energy ions
being collimated to a cone of less than 10 degrees. 2D particle-in-cell
simulations have been used to investigate the acceleration mechanism. The time
varying magnetic field associated with the fast electron current provides a
contribution to the accelerating electric field as well as providing a
collimating field for the ions. A strong correlation between the plasma density
and the ion acceleration was found. A short plasma scale-length at the vacuum
interface was observed to be beneficial for the maximum ion energies, but the
collimation appears to be improved with longer scale-lengths due to enhanced
magnetic fields in the ramp acceleration region.
