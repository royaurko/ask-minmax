We propose a method to evaluate the entropy density and entropy flux in a
vacuum gap between two half-spaces that takes into account influence of
near-field effects, i.e., interference, diffraction, and tunneling of waves.
The method developed is used to determine the maximum work that can be
extracted through near-field radiative transfer between two half-spaces at
different temperatures.
