The point-contact (PC) spectroscopy study of the electron-phonon(boson)
interaction (EP(B)I) spectral function in HoNi2B2C reveals phonon maxima at 16
and 22meV and 34meV. For the first time the pronounced high energy maxima at
about 50meV and 100meV were resolved. Additionally, an admixture of a
crystalline-electric-field (CEF) excitation with a maximum near 10meV and a
`magnetic` peak near 3meV are observed. The contribution of the CEF peak in
EP(B)I constant \lambda_{PC} is evaluated as 20-30%, while contribution of the
high frequency modes at 50 and 100meV amounts about 10% for each maxima. PC
Andreev reflection measurements below the critical temperature T_c=8.5K reveals
two different superconducting (SC) states separated by T_c^*=5.6K which is
close to the Neel temperature T_N=5.3K. Below T_c^* the gap \Delta in HoNi2B2C
exhibits a standard single-band BCS-like behavior with 2\Delta/kT_c^*=3.9.
Above T_c^* the gap features in PC spectra are strongly suppressed pointing to
a peculiar SC state between T_c^* and T_c, where incommensurate magnetic order
develops.
