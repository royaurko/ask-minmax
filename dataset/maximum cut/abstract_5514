We show that the topologically trivial zero bias peak (ZBP) emerging in
semiconductor Majorana wires due to soft confinement exhibits correlated
splitting oscillations as a function of the applied Zeeman field, similar to
the correlated splitting of the Majorana ZBP. Also, we find that the presence
of a strong impurity can effectively cut the wire in two and destroy the
correlated splitting in both the trivial and the Majorana regimes. We identify
a strong nonlocal effect that operates only in the topologically trivial regime
and demonstrate that the dependence of the ZBP on the confining gate potential
at the opposite end in Majorana wires with two normal metal end-contacts
represents a powerful tool for discriminating between topologically trivial and
nontrivial ZBPs.
