The synchrotron radio maps of supernova remnants (SNRs) in uniform
interstellar medium and interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) are analyzed,
allowing different `sensitivity' of injection efficiency to the shock
obliquity. The very-high energy gamma-ray maps due to inverse Compton process
are also synthesized. The properties of images in these different wavelength
bands are compared, with particular emphasis on the location of the bright
limbs in bilateral SNRs. Recent H.E.S.S. observations of SN 1006 show that the
radio and IC gamma-ray limbs coincide, and we found that this may happen if: i)
injection is isotropic but the variation of the maximum energy of electrons is
rather quick to compensate for differences in magnetic field; ii) obliquity
dependence of injection (either quasi-parallel or quasi-perpendicular) and the
electron maximum energy is strong enough to dominate magnetic field variation.
In the latter case, the obliquity dependence of the injection and the maximum
energy should not be opposite. We argue that the position of the limbs alone
and even their coincidence in radio, X-rays and gamma-rays, as it is discovered
by H.E.S.S. in SN 1006, cannot be conclusive about the dependence of the
electron injection efficiency, the compression/amplification of ISMF and the
electron maximum energy on the obliquity angle.
