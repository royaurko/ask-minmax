The LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS have discovered a new boson that resembles
the long-sought Higgs boson: it cannot have spin one, and has couplings to
other particles that increase with their masses, but the spin and parity remain
to be determined. We show here that the `Higgs' + gauge boson invariant-mass
distribution in `Higgs'-strahlung events at the Tevatron or the LHC would be
very different under the J^P = 0+, 0- and 2+ hypotheses, and could provide a
fast-track indicator of the `Higgs' spin and parity. Our analysis is based on
simulations of the experimental event selections and cuts using PYTHIA and
Delphes, and incorporates statistical samples of `toy' experiments.
