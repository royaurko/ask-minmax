How can applications be deployed on the cloud to achieve maximum performance?
This question has become significant and challenging with the availability of a
wide variety of Virtual Machines (VMs) with different performance capabilities
in the cloud. The above question is addressed by proposing a six step
benchmarking methodology in which a user provides a set of four weights that
indicate how important each of the following groups: memory, processor,
computation and storage are to the application that needs to be executed on the
cloud. The weights along with cloud benchmarking data are used to generate a
ranking of VMs that can maximise performance of the application. The rankings
are validated through an empirical analysis using two case study applications;
the first is a financial risk application and the second is a molecular
dynamics simulation, which are both representative of workloads that can
benefit from execution on the cloud. Both case studies validate the feasibility
of the methodology and highlight that maximum performance can be achieved on
the cloud by selecting the top ranked VMs produced by the methodology.
