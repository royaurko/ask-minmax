We study different solid phases of Helium-four, by means of Path Integral
Monte Carlo simulations based on a recently developed "worm" algorithm. Our
study includes simulations that start off from a high-T gas phase, which is
then "quenched" down to T=0.2 K. The low-T properties of the system crucially
depend on the initial state. While an ideal hcp crystal is a clear-cut
insulator, the disordered system freezes into a "superglass", i.e., a
metastable amorphous solid featuring off-diagonal long-range order and
superfluidity.
