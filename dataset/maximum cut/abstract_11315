SN1994D of type Ia has been suspected not to fit into the relation between
decline rate, colour, and brightness. However, an individual distance of its
host galaxy, NGC4526, other than that of the Virgo cluster, has not yet been
published. We determined the distance by the method of globular cluster
luminosity functions on the basis of HST archive data. A maximum-likelihood fit
returns apparent turn-over magnitudes of 23.16+-0.16mag in V and 21.96+-0.09mag
in I. The corresponding distance modulus is 30.4+-0.3mag, where the error
reflects our estimation of the absolute distance scale. The absolute magnitudes
(not corrected for decline rate and colour) are -18.67+-0.30mag,
-18.62+-0.30mag, and -18.40+-0.30mag for B, V, and I, respectively. The
corrected magnitudes are -18.69+-0.31mag, -18.69+-0.31mag, and -18.44+-0.31mag.
  Compared with other supernovae with reliably determined distances, SN1994D
fits within the errors. It is therefore not a counter-example against a uniform
decline-rate-colour-brightness relation.
