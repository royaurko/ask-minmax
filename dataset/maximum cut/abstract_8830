We use a modified SU(2) chiral sigma model to study nuclear matter component
and simple bag model for quark matter constituting a neutron star. We also
study the phase transition of nuclear matter to quark matter with the mixed
phase characterized by two conserved charges in the interior of highly dense
neutron stars. Stable solutions of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations
representing hybrid stars are obtained with a maximum mass of 1.67$M_{\odot}$
and radius around 8.9 km.
