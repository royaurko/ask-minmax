We present RESOLVE, a new algorithm for radio aperture synthesis imaging of
extended and diffuse emission in total intensity. The algorithm is derived
using Bayesian statistical inference techniques, estimating the surface
brightness in the sky assuming a priori log-normal statistics. RESOLVE not only
estimates the measured sky brightness in total intensity, but also its spatial
correlation structure, which is used to guide the algorithm to an optimal
reconstruction of extended and diffuse sources. For a radio interferometer, it
succeeds in deconvolving the effects of the instrumental point spread function
during this process. Additionally, RESOLVE provides a map with an uncertainty
estimate of the reconstructed surface brightness. Furthermore, with RESOLVE we
introduce a new, optimal visibility weighting scheme that can be viewed as an
extension to robust weighting. In tests using simulated observations, the
algorithm shows improved performance against two standard imaging approaches
for extended sources, Multiscale-CLEAN and the Maximum Entropy Method.
