Here, we present a temperature ($T$) dependent comparison between
field-effect and Hall mobilities in field-effect transistors based on
few-layered WSe$_2$ exfoliated onto SiO$_2$. Without dielectric engineering and
beyond a $T$-dependent threshold gate-voltage, we observe maximum hole
mobilities approaching 350 cm$^2$/Vs at $T$=300 K. The hole Hall mobility
reaches a maximum value of 650 cm$^2$/Vs as $T$ is lowered below $\sim$ 150 K,
indicating that insofar WSe$_2$-based field-effect transistors (FETs) display
the largest Hall mobilities among the transition metal dichalcogenides. The
gate capacitance, as extracted from the Hall-effect, reveals the presence of
spurious charges in the channel, while the two-terminal sheet resistivity
displays two-dimensional variable-range hopping behavior, indicating carrier
localization induced by disorder at the interface between WSe$_2$ and SiO$_2$.
We argue that improvements in the fabrication protocols as, for example, the
use of a substrate free of dangling bonds are likely to produce WSe$_2$-based
FETs displaying higher room temperature mobilities, i.e. approaching those of
$p$-doped Si, which would make it a suitable candidate for high performance
opto-electronics.
