QCD spectral functions of hadrons in the pseudo-scalar and vector channels
are extracted from lattice Monte Carlo data of the imaginary time Green's
functions. The maximum entropy method works well for this purpose, and the
resonance and continuum structures in the spectra are obtained in addition to
the ground state peaks.
