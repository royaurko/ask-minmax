Recent work indicates that 27 day variations in cosmic ray flux during 2007
2009 are phase locked to 27 day variations in cloud and surface temperature at
Shetland. Here we extend the study to other regions including Central England,
US and Australia and to several other annual intervals that exhibit strong 27
day variation in cosmic ray flux and sunspot area. Band pass filtering was used
to obtain 27 day components of daily maximum temperature in each region and 27
day components of cloud variation were determined, in Australia only, from
solar exposure records. When cosmic ray flux is the dominant influence phase
locked variations in surface temperature occur in each of the regions with,
however, in phase or anti phase variation in different regions. Similar phase
locking of 27 day variation in surface temperature to sunspot area variation
occurs when sunspot activity is the dominant influence with indications that
changes from in phase to anti phase variation are linked to flipping of sunspot
activity from one active longitude to another. The 27 day component of cloud in
Australia was phase locked to the 27 day component of temperature in Central
England in two of the intervals studied, 1997 and 2005, indicating the global
nature of the connection between solar disturbance and the lower atmosphere. It
was observed that very large swings in 27 day temperature components are often
correlated with 27 day variation in solar activity.
