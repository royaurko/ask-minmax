We use the Stein-Chen method to study the extremal behaviour of the problem
of extremes for univariate and bivariate geometric laws. We obtain a rate for
the convergence to the Gumbel distribution of the law of the maximum of i. i.
d. geometric random variables, and show that convergence is faster when
approximating by a discretised Gumbel. We similarly find a rate of convergence
for the law of maxima of bivariate Marshall-Olkin geometric random pairs when
approximating by a discrete limit law. We introduce marked point processes of
exceedances (MPPEs), both with univariate and bivariate Marshall-Olkin
geometric variables as marks and we determine bounds on the error of the
approximation, in an appropriate probability metric, of the law of the MPPE by
that of a Poisson process with same mean measure. We then approximate by
another Poisson process with an easier-to-use mean measure and estimate the
error of this additional approximation. This work contains and extends results
