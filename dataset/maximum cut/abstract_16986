In the future, optical stellar interferometers will provide true images
thanks to larger number of telescopes and to advanced cophasing subsystems.
These conditions are required to have sufficient resolution elements (resel) in
the image and to provide direct images in the hypertelescope mode. It has
already been shown that hypertelescopes provide snapshot images with a
significant gain in sensitivity without inducing any loss of the useful field
of view for direct imaging applications. This paper aims at studying the
properties of the point spread functions of future large arrays using the
hypertelescope mode. Numerical simulations have been performed and criteria
have been defined to study the image properties. It is shown that the choice of
the configuration of the array is a trade-off between the resolution, the halo
level and the field of view. A regular pattern of the array of telescopes
optimizes the image quality (low halo level and maximum encircled energy in the
central peak), but decreases the useful field of view. Moreover, a
non-redundant array is less sensitive to the space aliasing effect than a
redundant array.
