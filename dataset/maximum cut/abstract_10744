We present results from a study of broadband timing and spectral properties
of EXO 2030+375 using a Suzaku observation. Pulsations with a period of 41.41 s
and strong energy dependent pulse profiles were clearly detected up to ~100
keV. Narrow dips are seen in the profiles up to ~70 keV. Presence of prominent
dips at several phases in the profiles up to such high energy ranges were not
seen before. At higher energies, these dips gradually disappeared and the
profile appeared single-peaked. The 1.0-200.0 keV broad-band spectrum is found
to be well described by a partial covering high energy cut-off power-law model.
Several low energy emission lines are also detected in the pulsar spectrum. We
fitted the spectrum using neutral as well as partially ionized absorbers along
with above continuum model yielding similar parameter values. The partial
covering with partially ionized absorber resulted into marginally better fit.
The spectral fitting did not require any cyclotron feature in the best fit
model. To investigate the changes in spectral parameters at dips, we carried
out pulse-phase-resolved spectroscopy. During the dips, the value of additional
column density was estimated to be high compared to other pulse phases. While
using partially ionized absorber, the value of ionization parameter is also
higher at the dips. This may be the reason for the presence of dips up to
higher energies. No other spectral parameters show any systematic variation
with pulse phases of the pulsar.
