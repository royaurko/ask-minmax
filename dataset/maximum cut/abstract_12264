We analyze here the structure of non-radial nonspacelike geodesics
terminating in the past at a naked singularity formed as the end state of
inhomogeneous dust collapse. The spectrum of outgoing nonspacelike null
geodesics is examined analytically. The local and global visibility of the
singularity is also examined by integrating numerically the null geodesics
equations. The possible implications of existence of such families towards the
appearance of the star in late stages of gravitational collapse are considered.
It is seen that the outgoing non-radial geodesics give an appearance to the
naked central singularity as that of an expanding ball whose radius reaches a
maximum before the star goes within its apparent horizon. The radiated energy
(along the null geodesics) is shown to decay very sharply in the neighbourhood
of the singularity. Thus the total energy escaping via non-radial null
geodesics from the naked central singularity vanishes in the scenario
considered here.
