We solve the dispersion relation for the P-wave pi pi amplitude.We discuss
the role of the left hand cut vs Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD), pole
contribution and compare the solution with a generic quark model description.
We review the the generic properties of analytical partial wave scattering and
production amplitudes and discuses their applicability and fits of experimental
data.
