The low temperature properties of the Kagome-type system Co3V2O8 have been
studied by powder neutron diffraction both in zero field and in applied
magnetic field of up to 8 T. Below 6 K, the zero-field ground state is
ferromagnetic with the magnetic moments aligned along the a-axis. The size of
the moment on one of the two Co sites, the so called cross-tie site, is
considerably reduced compared to the fully polarized state. The application of
a magnetic field in this phase is found to rapidly enhance the cross-tie site
magnetic moment, which reaches the expected value of ~3muB by the maximum
applied field of 8 T. Different reorientation behaviors are found for the Co
cross-tie and spine sites, suggesting a more pronounced easy-axis anisotropy
for moments on the spine sites. Rietveld refinements reveal that a simple
model, where the spins on both cross-tie and spine sites rotate in the ac-plane
in a magnetic field, reproduces the experimental diffraction patterns well. In
addition, it is found that at higher temperatures and moderate magnetic fields,
the incommensurate antiferromagnetic order, corresponding to a transverse
sinusoidal modulation above 8 K, is suppressed to be replaced by ferromagnetic
order.
