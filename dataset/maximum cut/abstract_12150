The tunneling spectra of YBa2Cu3O7 break-junctions have been investigated for
the tunneling direction close to the node one. The zero-bias conductance peak
(ZBCP) and Josephson current have been studied with temperature and magnetic
field. The observed deep splitting of ZBCP which starts at Ts<20-30K is in
agreement with the theory for the dx2-y2+-is order parameter [Y. Tanuma, Y.
Tanaka, and S. Kashiwaya, Phys. Rev. B 64, 214519 (2001)]. The low (0.04T)
magnetic field depresses significantly such splitting. The 1/T temperature
dependence of maximum Josephson current goes to saturation at T<Ts also
confirming the mixed order parameter formation.
