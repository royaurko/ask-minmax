A Lead Tungstate crystal produced for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the
CMS experiment at the LHC was cut into three equal-length sections. The central
one was irradiated with 290 MeV/c positive pions up to a fluence of (5.67 +-
0.46)x10^13 /cm^2, while the other two were exposed to a 24 GeV/c proton
fluence of (1.17 +- 0.11) x 10^13/ cm^2. The damage recovery in these crystals,
stored in the dark at room temperature, has been followed over two years. The
comparison of the radiation-induced changes in light transmission for these
crystals shows that damage is proportional to the star densities produced by
the irradiation.
