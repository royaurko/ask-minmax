We present measurements of anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) from the first season of observations with the Degree Angular Scale
Interferometer (DASI). The instrument was deployed at the South Pole in the
austral summer 1999--2000, and made observations throughout the following
austral winter. We have measured the angular power spectrum of the CMB in the
range 100<l<900 with high signal-to-noise. In this paper we review the
formalism used in the analysis, in particular the use of constraint matrices to
project out contaminants such as ground and point source signals, and to test
for correlations with diffuse foreground templates. We find no evidence of
foregrounds other than point sources in the data, and find a maximum likelihood
temperature spectral index beta = -0.1 +/- 0.2 (1 sigma), consistent with CMB.
We detect a first peak in the power spectrum at l approx 200, in agreement with
previous experiments. In addition, we detect a peak in the power spectrum at l
approx 550 and power of similar magnitude at l approx 800 which are consistent
with the second and third harmonic peaks predicted by adiabatic inflationary
cosmological models.
