A vertex subset M of a graph G is a multipacking if for each vertex v, and
each positive integer s less than or equal to the diameter of G, v is within
distance s of at most s vertices of M. The multipacking number of a graph is
the maximum cardinality of a multipacking of G. A generalization of 2-packings,
multipackings offer interesting insight into the minimum cost broadcast
domination problem. This paper surveys recent results in the study of
multipackings, including the equality of the multipacking number and broadcast
number in trees, an extension of Farber's Algorithm for finding dominating sets
and 2-packings of strongly chordal graphs, and some early results on fractional
multipackings. The paper closes with a series of in-depth examples of the
various algorithms presented.
