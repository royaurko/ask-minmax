We show that the two molecular mechanics models, the stick-spiral and the
beam models, predict considerably different mechanical properties of materials
based on energy equivalence. The difference between the two models is
independent of the materials since all parameters of the beam model are
obtained from the harmonic potentials. We demonstrate this difference for
finite width graphene nanoribbons and a single polyethylene chain comparing
results of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with harmonic potentials and
the finite element method with the beam model. We also find that the difference
strongly depends on the loading modes, chirality and width of the graphene
nanoribbons, and it increases with decreasing width of the nanoribbons under
pure bending condition. The maximum difference of the predicted mechanical
properties using the two models can exceed 300% in different loading modes.
Comparing the two models with the MD results of AIREBO potential, we find that
the stick-spiral model overestimates and the beam model underestimates the
mechanical properties in narrow armchair graphene nanoribbons under pure
bending condition.
