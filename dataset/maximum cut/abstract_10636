Results are presented from a reanalysis of the entire five-tower data set
acquired with the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS II) experiment at the
Soudan Underground Laboratory, with an exposure of 969 kg-days. The analysis
window was extended to a recoil energy of 150 keV, and an improved
surface-event background-rejection cut was defined to increase the sensitivity
of the experiment to the inelastic dark matter (iDM) model. Three dark matter
candidates were found between 25 keV and 150 keV. The probability to observe
three or more background events in this energy range is 11%. Because of the
occurrence of these events the constraints on the iDM parameter space are
slightly less stringent than those from our previous analysis, which used an
energy window of 10-100 keV.
