The fermion mass effects in e+ e- --> 4f and in the corresponding
bremsstrahlung reactions in the presence of realistic cuts are studied. It is
shown that, for some four--fermion final states, the mass effects become
sizeable to the extent that they may affect the accuracy of theoretical
predictions which is required to be better than 1%.
