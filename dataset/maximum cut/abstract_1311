The NLO QCD calculation for the photoproduction of the isolated photon with a
large $p_T$ at the HERA $ep$ collider is presented. The single resolved photon
contribution and the QCD corrections of order $\alpha_s$ to the Born term are
consistently included. The sizeable NNLO contributions, the box and the double
resolved photon subprocesses, are taken into account in addition. The
importance of the isolation cut, as well as the influence of other experimental
cuts on the p_T and rapidity eta_gamma distributions are discussed in detail.
Results are compared with experimental data and with the different NLO
calculations.
