The potential energy of a deformed nucleus has been determined within a
Generalized Liquid Drop Model taking into account the proximity energy, the
microscopic corrections and compact and necked shapes. Multiple-humped
potential barriers appear. A third minimum and third maximum exist in specific
exit channels where one fragment is close to a magic spherical nucleus while
the other one varies from oblate to prolate shapes. The heights of the fission
barriers and half-lives of actinides are in agreement with the experimental
results.
