The most general Lorentz invariant spin-correlation functions for $\tau
^{-}\rightarrow \rho ^{-}\nu ,a_1^{-}\nu ,K^{*-}\nu , \pi ^{-}\nu ,K^{-}\nu $
are expressed in terms of eight semi-leptonic parameters. They are physically
defined in terms of tau-decay partial-width-intensities for
polarized-final-states. The parameters are also expressed in terms of a
``$(V-A)\ +\ $additional chiral coupling'' structure in the
${J^{Charged}}_{Lepton}$ current, so as to bound the scales $\Lambda $\ for
``new physics'' such as arising from leptonic CP violation, tau weak magnetism,
weak electricity, and/or second-class currents. The two tests for leptonic CP
violation in $\tau \rightarrow \rho \nu \ $ decay are generalized to $\tau
\rightarrow a_1\nu \ $ decay and to two additional tests if there are $\nu _R\
$ and $\bar \nu _L\ $ couplings.
