I derive general conditions in order to explain the origin of the Vainshtein
radius inside dRGT. The set of equations, which I have called "Vainshtein"
conditions are extremal conditions of the dynamical metric ($g_{\mu\nu}$)
containing all the degrees of freedom of the theory. The Vainshtein conditions
are able to explain the coincidence between the Vainshtein radius in dRGT and
the scale $r_0=\left(\frac{3}{2}r_s r_\Lambda^2\right)^{1/3}$, obtained
naturally from the Schwarzschild de-Sitter (S-dS) space inside General
Relativity (GR). In GR, this scale was interpreted as the maximum distance in
order to get bound orbits. The same scale corresponds to the static observer
position if we want to define the black hole temperature in an asymptotically
de-Sitter space. In dRGT, the scale marks a limit after which the extra degrees
of freedom of the theory become relevant.
