We investigate the pseudo specific heat of SU(2) gauge theory near the
crossover point on $4^4$ to $16^4$ lattices. Several different methods are used
to determine the specific heat. The curious finite size dependence of the peak
maximum is explained from the interplay of the crossover phenomenon with the
deconfinement transition occurring due to the finite extension of the lattice.
In this context we calculate the modulus of the lattice average of the Polyakov
loop on symmetric lattices and compare it to the prediction from a random walk
model.
