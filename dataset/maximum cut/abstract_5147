We consider the construction of generic spherically symmetric thin-shell
traversable wormhole spacetimes in standard general relativity. By using the
cut-and-paste procedure, we comprehensively analyze the stability of arbitrary
spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes to linearized spherically symmetric
perturbations around static solutions. While a number of special cases have
previously been dealt with in scattered parts of the literature, herein we take
considerable effort to make the analysis as general and unified as practicable.
We demonstrate in full generality that stability of the wormhole is equivalent
to choosing suitable properties for the exotic material residing on the
wormhole throat.
