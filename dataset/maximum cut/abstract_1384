We study Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton production in the large extra dimensions
model via 2 jets plus missing transverse momentum signatures at the LHC. We
make predictions for both the signal and the dominant Zjj and Wjj backgrounds,
where we introduce missing P_T-dependent jet selection cuts that ensure the
smallness of the 2-jet rate over the 1-jet rate. With the same jet selection
cuts, the distributions of the two jets and their correlation with the missing
transverse momentum provide additional evidence for the production of an
invisible massive object.
