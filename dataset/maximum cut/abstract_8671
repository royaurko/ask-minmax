The masses of quarks and leptons in units of $m_t$ are expressed in powers
of $\sigma=\sqrt{m_c/m_t}$. The regularities found suggest specific mass
matrices. They reproduce all masses and mixings in striking agreement with
observation. A 90 degree relative phase angle between the off-diagonal elements
of up and down quark matrices leads to a maximum magnitude for CP-violation
and, for the phase angle $\gamma$ of the unitary triangle, to $\gamma\simeq
90^o$.
