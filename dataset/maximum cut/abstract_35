The theory of the Clausius' virial maximum to explain the Fundamental Plane
(FP) proposed by Secco (2000, 2001,2005) is based on the existence of a maximum
in the Clausius' Virial (CV) potential energy of a early type galaxy (ETG)
stellar component when it is completely embedded inside a dark matter (DM)
halo. At the first order approximation the theory was developed by modeling the
two-components with two cored power-law density profiles. An higher level of
approximation is now taken into account by developing the same theory when the
stellar component is modeled by a King-model with a cut-off. Even if the DM
halo density remains a cored power law the inner component is now more
realistic for the ETGs. The new formulation allows us to understand more deeply
what is the dynamical reason of the FP tilt and in general how the CV theory
may really be the engine to produce the FP main features. The degeneracy of FP
in respect to the initial density perturbation spectrum may be now full
understood in a CDM cosmological scenario. A possible way to compare the FPs
predicted by the theory with those obtained by observations is also
exemplified.
