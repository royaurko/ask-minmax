For a map $\mathcal M$ cellularly embedded on a connected and closed
orientable surface, the bases of its Lagrangian (also known as delta-) matroid
correspond to the bases of a Lagrangian subspace $L$ of the standard orthogonal
space $\mathbb{Q}^E\oplus\mathbb{Q}^{E^*}$, where $E$ and $E^*$ are the
edge-sets of $\mathcal M$ and its dual map. The Lagrangian subspace $L$ is said
to be the representation of $\mathcal M$; in this paper we study the
representations $L$ and $L_j$ of $\mathcal M$ and its partial duals
$\partial_j\mathcal M$, respectively. We show that $L_j$ can be obtained from
$L$ by acting on $L$ with a transposition $(j~j^*)$ in the Coxeter group
$BC_n$, and that $L$ and $L_j$ form a Lagrangian pair of subspaces, for all
$j\in E$.
