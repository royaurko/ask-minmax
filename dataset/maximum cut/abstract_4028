Tunneling and theoretical studies have suggested that Andreev bound states
form at certain surfaces of unconventional superconductors. Through studies of
the temperature and field dependence of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth
lambda_ab at low temperature, we have found strong evidence for the presence of
these states in clean single crystal YBCO and BSCCO. Crystals cut to expose a
[110] interface show a strong upturn in lambda_ab at around 7K, when the field
is oriented so that the supercurrents flow around this surface. In YBCO this
upturn is completely suppressed by a field of ~0.1 T.
