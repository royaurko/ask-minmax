We analyze the interplay of topological objects in four-dimensional QCD on
the lattice. The distributions of color magnetic monopoles in the maximum
abelian gauge are computed around instantons in both pure and full QCD. We find
an enhanced probability for monopoles inside the core of an instanton on gauge
field average. This feature is independent of the topological charge definition
used. For specific gauge field configurations we visualize the situation
graphically. Moreover we investigate how monopole loops and instantons are
correlated with the chiral condensate. Strong evidence is found that clusters
of the quark condensate and topological objects coexist locally on individual
configurations.
