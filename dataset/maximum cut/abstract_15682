The CDMS low ionization threshold experiment (CDMSlite) uses cryogenic
germanium detectors operated at a relatively high bias voltage to amplify the
phonon signal in the search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).
Results are presented from the second CDMSlite run with an exposure of 70 kg
days, which reached an energy threshold for electron recoils as low as 56 eV. A
fiducialization cut reduces backgrounds below those previously reported by
CDMSlite. New parameter space for the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross
section is excluded for WIMP masses between 1.6 and 5.5 GeV/$c^2$.
