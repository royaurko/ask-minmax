In order to develop a method to extract the parameters of the two inherent
Schottky contacts from a single current-voltage (I-V) characteristic curve, the
I-V characteristics of metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) diodes with asymmetric
Schottky barrier heights are theoretically investigated using the thermionic
emission model. The MSM diode structure is commonly used because an additional
MS interface is required for the electrical characterization of MS diodes. A
finite charge-injection barrier is generally formed at the additional
interface. When a local maximum was detected in the first-order derivative of
the measured I-V characteristics for a MSM diode, the parameters for the
Schottky contacts, the zero-bias barrier heights of both MS interfaces, the
series resistance of the MSM diode and the effective ideality factor for the MS
diode with a higher barrier could be extracted using this method.
