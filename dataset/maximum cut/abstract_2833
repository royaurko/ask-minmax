There is no generally accepted view of the structure of the light-quark
non-strange scalar mesons. A variety of models have been proposed that
encompass $qq\bar{q}\bar{q}$, molecular, $q\bar{q}$ and glueball states in
various combinations. Previously we considered scalar-meson photoproduction in
a simple Regge-pole model and showed that it was experimentally viable. Recent
data on the photoproduction of $a_0(980)$ and $f_0(980)$ confirm this. We
extend our model to incorporate Regge cuts, based on our knowledge of $\pi^0$
photoproduction. The theoretical predictions are compared to the $a_0(980)$ and
$f_0(980)$ photoproduction data.
