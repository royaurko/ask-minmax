The spectrum of the Dirac operator near zero virtuality obtained in lattice
gauge simulations is known to be universally described by chiral random matrix
theory. We address the question of the maximum energy for which this
universality persists. For this purpose, we analyze large ensembles of complete
spectra of the Euclidean Dirac operator for staggered fermions. We calculate
the disconnected scalar susceptibility and the microscopic number variance for
the chiral symplectic ensemble of random matrices and compare the results with
lattice Dirac spectra for quenched SU(2). The crossover to a non-universal
regime is clearly identified and found to scale with the square of the linear
lattice size and with $f_{\pi}^2$, in agreement with theoretical expectations.
