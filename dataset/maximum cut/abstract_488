Multi-cut critical points and their macroscopic loop amplitudes are studied
in the multi-cut two-matrix models, based on an extension of the prescription
developed by Daul, Kazakov and Kostov. After identifying possible critical
points and potentials in the multi-cut matrix models, we calculate the
macroscopic loop amplitudes in the Z_k symmetric background. With a natural
large N ansatz for the matrix Lax operators, a sequence of new solutions for
the amplitudes in the Z_k symmetric k-cut two-matrix models are obtained, which
are realized by the Jacobi polynomials.
