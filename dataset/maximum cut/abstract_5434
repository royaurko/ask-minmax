Jets at high energy colliders are complicated objects to identify. Even if
jets are widely separated, there is no reason for jets to have the same size. A
single reconstruction, or interpretation, of each event can only extract a
limited amount of information. Motivated by the recently proposed Qjet
algorithms, which give multiple interpretations for each event using
nondeterministic jet clustering, we propose a simple, fast and powerful method
to give multiple event interpretations by varying the parameter R in the jet
definition. With multiple interpretations we can redefine the weight of each
event in a counting experiment to be the fraction of interpretations passing
the experimental cuts, instead of 0 or 1 in a conventional analysis. We show
that the statistical power of an analysis can be dramatically increased. In
particular, we can have a 46% improvement in the statistical significance for
the Higgs search with an associated Z boson (ZH\rightarrow \nu {\bar \nu}b
{\bar b}) at the 8 TeV LHC.
