The hadronic interaction model BBL implements the ideas of gluon saturation
due to large densities. When approaching the black body limit at high energies,
leading partons acquire large transverse momenta which breaks up their
coherence. This leads to a suppression of forward scattering, and is therefore
important for air showers. We discuss some general aspects of this new approach
and their influence on air shower properties as seen by fluorescence and
surface detectors: The position of the shower maximum is reduced due to
stronger absorption in the atmosphere. The lateral distribution functions
become flatter for the same reason. Muons are produced abundantly due to high
multiplicities in the mid-rapidity region. The response of water Cherenkov
detectors and comparisons to other interaction models are shown.
