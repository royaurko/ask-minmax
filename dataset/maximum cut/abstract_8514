Magnetization-induced optical third-harmonic generation (MTHG) is observed in
magnetic nanostructures: Co and Fe nanolayers and granular films containing Co
nanoparticles. Magnetization-induced variations of the MTHG characteristics in
these nanostructures exceed the typical values of linear magneto-optical Kerr
effect by at least an order of magnitude: the maximum of magnetic contrast in
the MTHG intensity is up to 0.2, the angle of polarization rotation for MTHG is
10 deg. and the relative phase shift is up to 100 deg.
