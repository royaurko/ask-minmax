Employing the nonabelian duality transformation, I derive the Gauge String
form of certain D>=3 lattice Yang-Mills (YM_{D}) theories in the strong
coupling (SC) phase. With the judicious choice of the actions, in D>=3 our
construction generalizes the Gross-Taylor stringy reformulation of the
continuous YM_{2} on a 2d manifold. Using the Eguchi-Kawai model as an example,
we develope the algorithm to determine the weights w[\tilde{M}] for connected
YM-flux worldsheets \tilde{M} immersed into the 2d skeleton of a D>=3
base-lattice. Owing to the invariance of w[\tilde{M}] under a continuous group
of area-preserving worldsheet homeomorphism, the set of the weights
{w[\tilde{M}]} can be used to define the theory of the smooth YM-fluxes which
unambiguously refers to a particular continuous YM_{D} system. I argue that the
latter YM_{D} models (with a finite ultraviolet cut-off) for sufficiently large
bare coupling constant(s) are reproduced, to all orders in 1/N, by the smooth
Gauge String thus associated. The asserted YM_{D}/String duality allows to make
a concrete prediction for the 'bare' string tension \sigma_{0} which implies
that (in the large N SC regime) the continuous YM_{D} systems exhibit
confinement for $D\geq{2}$. The resulting pattern is qualitatively consistent
(in the extreme D=4 SC limit) with the Witten's proposal motivated by the
AdS/CFT correspondence.
