We present spectral variations of the binary X-ray pulsar LMC X-4 using the
RXTE/PCA observations at different phases of its 30.5 day long super-orbital
period. Only out of eclipse data were used for this study. During the high
state of the super-orbital period of LMC X-4, the spectrum is well described by
a high energy cut-off power-law with a photon index in the range of 0.7-1.0 and
an iron emission line. In the low state, the spectrum is found to be flatter
with power-law photon index in the range 0.5-0.7. A direct correlation is
detected between the continuum flux in 7-25 keV energy band and the iron
emission line flux. The equivalent width of the iron emission line is found to
be highly variable during low intensity state, whereas it remains almost
constant during the high intensity state of the super-orbital period. It is
observed that the spectral variations in LMC X-4 are similar to those of Her
X-1 (using RXTE/PCA data). These results suggest that the geometry of the
region where the iron line is produced and its visibility with respect to the
phase of the super-orbital period is similar in LMC X-4 and Her X-1. A
remarkable difference between these two systems is a highly variable absorption
column density with phase of the super-orbital period that is observed in Her
X-1 but not in LMC X-4.
