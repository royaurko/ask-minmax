In this paper we present a tail inequality for the maximum of partial sums of
a weakly dependent sequence of random variables that are not necessarily
bounded. The class considered includes geometrically and subgeometrically
strongly mixing sequences. The result is then used to derive asymptotic
moderate deviations results. Applications include classes of Markov chains,
functions of linear processes with absolutely regular innovations and ARCH
models
