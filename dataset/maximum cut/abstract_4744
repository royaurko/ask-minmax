In this paper the advantages provided by multicell processing of signals
transmitted by mobile terminals (MTs) which are received via dedicated relay
terminals (RTs) are studied. It is assumed that each RT is capable of
full-duplex operation and receives the transmission of adjacent relay
terminals. Focusing on intra-cell TDMA and non-fading channels, a simplified
relay-aided uplink cellular model based on a model introduced by Wyner is
considered. Assuming a nomadic application in which the RTs are oblivious to
the MTs' codebooks, a form of distributed compress-and-forward (CF) scheme with
decoder side information is employed. The per-cell sum-rate of the CF scheme is
derived and is given as a solution of a simple fixed point equation. This
achievable rate reveals that the CF scheme is able to completely eliminate the
inter-relay interference, and it approaches a ``cut-set-like'' upper bound for
strong RTs transmission power. The CF rate is also shown to surpass the rate of
an amplify-and-forward scheme via numerical calculations for a wide range of
the system parameters.
