A non-parametric statistical model is constructed to directly relate The
distribution of observed microlens timescales to that of the mass Function of
the population from which the lenses are drawn, corrected For observational
selection based on timescales and event amplifications. Explicit distributions
are derived for microlensing impact parameters and maximum amplifications; both
are shown to be statistically independent of all other parameters in the
problem, including lens mass. The model is used to demonstrate that the narrow
range of microlens timescales observed toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
is probably not consistent with lensing by a widely distributed spheroidal
population of large velocity dispersion, as expected of a dark halo; but is
consistent with lensing within a rotating thick disk. Poor numerical
conditioning on the statistical connection between lens masses and event
timescales, and small number statistics, severely limit the mass function
information obtainable from current microlensing surveys toward the LMC.
