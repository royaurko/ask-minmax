In this paper we consider collision of two particle near the STU black hole
and calculate center of mass energy. In the case of uncharged black hole we
find that the maximum energy obtained near the black hole horizon which
similarly happen for charged black hole. We verify that the black hole charge
may be decreased or increased the center of mass energy near the black hole
horizon.
