We consider a measurement of exclusive production of scalar
$\chi_{c}(0^{++})$ meson in the proton-proton collisions at LHC and RHIC and in
the proton-antiproton collisions at the Tevatron via $\chi_{c0} \to
\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay. The corresponding amplitude for exclusive
double-diffractive $\chi_{c0}$ meson production was obtained within the
$k_{t}$-factorization approach including virtualities of active gluons and the
corresponding cross section is calculated with unintegrated gluon distribution
functions (UGDFs) known from the literature. The four-body $p p \to p p \pi^+
\pi^-$ reaction constitutes an irreducible background to the exclusive
$\chi_{c0}$ meson production. We calculate several differential distributions
for $pp(\bar{p}) \to pp(\bar{p})\chi_{c0}$ process including absorptive
corrections. The influence of kinematical cuts on the signal-to-background
ratio is investigated. Corresponding experimental consequences are discussed.
