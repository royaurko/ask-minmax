We study the production of three gauge bosons at the next generation of
linear $e^+e^-$ colliders operating in the $\gamma\gamma$ mode. The processes
$\gamma\gamma \rightarrow W^+W^-V$ ($V=Z^0$, or $\gamma$) can provide direct
information about the quartic gauge-boson couplings. We analyze the total cross
section as well as several dynamical distributions of the final state particles
including the effect of kinematical cuts. We find out that a linear $e^+e^-$
machine operating in the $\gamma\gamma$ mode will produce 5--10 times more
three-gauge-boson states compared to the standard $e^+e^-$ mode at high
energies.
