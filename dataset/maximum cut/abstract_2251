We present the complete electroweak one-loop corrections to top-pair
production at a linear e^+e^- collider in the continuum region. Besides weak
and photonic virtual corrections, real hard bremsstrahlung with simple
realistic kinematical cuts is included. For the bremsstrahlung we advocate a
semi-analytical approach with a high numerical accuracy. The virtual
corrections are parametrized through six independent form factors, suitable for
Monte-Carlo implementation. Alternatively, our numerical package topfit, a
stand-alone code, can be utilized for the calculation of both differential and
integrated cross sections as well as forward--backward asymmetries.
