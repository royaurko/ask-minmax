We compare the simultaneous 2007 space-based MOST photometry and ground-based
radial velocity observations of the F5 star Procyon. We identify slow
variations in the MOST data that are similar to those reported in the radial
velocity (RV) time series, and confirm by comparison with the Sun that these
variations are likely the signature of stellar activity. The MOST power
spectrum yields clear evidence for individual oscillation frequencies that
match those found in the radial velocity data by Bedding et al. (2010). We
identify the same ridges due to modes of different spherical degree in both
datasets, but are not able to confirm a definite ridge identification using the
MOST data. We measure the luminosity amplitude per radial mode A_{l=0, phot} =
9.1 +/- 0.5 ppm. Combined with the estimate for the RV data by Arentoft et al.
(2008) this gives a mean amplitude ratio of A_{l=0, phot}/A_{l=0, RV} = 0.24
+/- 0.02 ppm cm^{-1} s, considerably higher than expected from scaling
relations but in reasonable agreement with theoretical models by Houdek (2010).
We also compare the amplitude ratio as a function of frequency, and find that
the maximum of the oscillation envelope is shifted to higher frequencies in
photometry than in velocity.
