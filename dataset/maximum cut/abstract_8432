Charge current static and dynamical correlations are computed by exact
diagonalisation methods on a 2-leg t-t'-J ladder which exhibits a sharp
transition between a Luther-Emery (LE) phase of hole pairs and a phase with
deconfined holes. In the LE phase, we find short-range low-energy
incommensurate current fluctuations which are intrinsically connected to the
internal charge dynamics within one hole pair. On the contrary, when holes
unbind, the maximum of the current susceptibility moves abruptly to the
commensurate wavevector $\pi$ and strongly increases for decreasing doping
suggesting an instability towards a staggered flux state at sufficiently small
doping.
