Testable weighted graph parameters and equivalent notions of testability are
investigated based on papers of Laszlo Lovasz and cocontributors. We prove that
certain balanced minimum multiway cut densities are testable. Using this fact,
quadratic programming techniques are applied to approximate some of these
quantities. The problem is related to cluster analysis and statistical physics.
Convergence of special noisy graph sequences is also discussed.
