Pattern matching is commonly required in many application areas and
bioinformatics is a major area of interest that requires both exact and
approximate pattern matching. Much work has been done in this area, yet there
is still a significant space for improvement in efficiency, flexibility, and
throughput. This paper presents a hardware software co-design of Aho-Corasick
algorithm in Nios II soft-processor and a study on its scalability for a
pattern matching application. A software only approach is used to compare the
throughput and the scalability of the hardware software co-design approach.
According to the results we obtained, we conclude that the hardware software
co-design implementation shows a maximum of 10 times speed up for pattern size
of 1200 peptides compared to the software only implementation. The results also
show that the hardware software co-design approach scales well for increasing
data size compared to the software only approach.
