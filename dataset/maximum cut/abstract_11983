We present microscopic and macroscopic magnetic properties of the highly
frustrated antiferromagnet Ba$_{2}$Sn$_{2}$ZnCr$_{7p}$Ga$_{10-7p}$O$_{22}$,
respectively probed with NMR and SQUID experiments. The $T$-variation of the
intrinsic susceptibility of the Cr$^{3+}$ frustrated kagom\'{e} bilayer,
$\chi_{kag}$, displays a maximum around 45 K. The dilution of the magnetic
lattice has been studied in detail for $0.29 \leq p \leq0.97$. Novel dilution
independent defects, likely related with magnetic bond disorder, are evidenced
and discussed. We compare our results to SrCr$_{9p}$Ga$_{12-9p}$O$_{19}$. Both
bond defects and spin vacancies do not affect the average susceptibility of the
kagom\'{e} bilayers.
