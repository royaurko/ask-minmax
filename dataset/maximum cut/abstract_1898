We investigate the accuracy of the two most common estimators for the maximum
expected value of a general set of random variables: a generalization of the
maximum sample average, and cross validation. No unbiased estimator exists and
we show that it is non-trivial to select a good estimator without knowledge
about the distributions of the random variables. We investigate and bound the
bias and variance of the aforementioned estimators and prove consistency. The
variance of cross validation can be significantly reduced, but not without
risking a large bias. The bias and variance of different variants of cross
validation are shown to be very problem-dependent, and a wrong choice can lead
to very inaccurate estimates.
