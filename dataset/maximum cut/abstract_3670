Gravitational-wave astronomers often wish to characterize the expected
parameter-estimation accuracy of future observations. The Fisher matrix
provides a lower bound on the spread of the maximum-likelihood estimator across
noise realizations, as well as the leading-order width of the posterior
probability, but it is limited to high signal strengths often not realized in
practice. By contrast, Monte Carlo Bayesian inference provides the full
posterior for any signal strength, but it is too expensive to repeat for a
representative set of noises. Here I describe an efficient semianalytical
technique to map the exact sampling distribution of the maximum-likelihood
estimator across noise realizations, for any signal strength. This technique
can be applied to any estimation problem for signals in additive Gaussian
noise.
