We show that the coercive field in ferritin and ferrihydrite depends on the
maximum magnetic field in a hysteresis loop and that coercivity and loop shifts
depend both on the maximum and cooling fields. In the case of ferritin we show
that the time dependence of the magnetization also depends on the maximum and
previous cooling fields. This behavior is associated to changes in the
intra-particle energy barriers imprinted by these fields. Accordingly, the
dependence of the coercive and loop shift fields with the maximum field in
ferritin and ferrihydrite can be described within the frame of a
uniform-rotation model considering a dependence of the energy barrier with the
maximum and the cooling fields.
