In the previous paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02622), it was demonstrated
that applying the principle of maximum information entropy by maximizing the
conditional information entropy, subject to the constraint given by the
Liouville equation averaged over the phase space, leads to a definition of the
rate of entropy change for closed Hamiltonian systems without any additional
assumptions. Here, we generalize this basic model and, with the introduction of
the additional constraints which are equivalent to the hydrodynamic continuity
equations, show that the results obtained are consistent with the known results
from the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of
irreversible processes. In this way, as a part of the approach developed in
this paper, the rate of entropy change and entropy production density for the
classical Hamiltonian fluid are obtained. The results obtained suggest the
general applicability of the principles of predictive statistical mechanics and
their importance for the theory of irreversibility.
