For the injector Scheme-I test stand of the China-ADS, a beam with the
maximum power of 100 kW will be produced and transported to the beam dump. At
the beam dump, the beam power will be converted to thermal load and brought
away by the cooling water. Two measures are taken to deal with the huge power
density at the target. One is to enlarge the contact area between the beam and
the target, and this is to be accomplished by expanding the beam profile at the
target and using two copper plates each having a 20o inclination angle relative
to the beam direction. The other is to produce more homogenous beam profile at
the target to minimize the maximum power density. Here the beam dump line is
designed to meet the requirement of beam expansion and homogenization, and the
step-like field magnets are employed for the beam spot homogenization. The
simulations results including space charge effects and errors show that the
beam line can meet the requirements very well at the three different energies
(3.2 MeV, 5 MeV and 10 MeV). In the meantime, the alternative beam design using
standard multipole magnets is also presented.
