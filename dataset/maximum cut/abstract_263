High harmonic generation in polarizable multi-electron systems is
investigated in the framework of multi-configuration time-dependent
Hartree-Fock. The harmonic spectra exhibit two cut offs. The first cut off is
in agreement with the well established, single active electron cut off law. The
second cut off presents a signature of multi-electron dynamics. The strong
laser field excites non-linear plasmon oscillations. Electrons that are ionized
from one of the multi-plasmon states and recombine to the ground state gain
additional energy, thereby creating the second plateau.
