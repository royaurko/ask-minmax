We update our previous studies of nuclear-matter effects on J/Psi production
in proton-nucleus for the recent LHC pPb runs at sqrt(s_NN)=5 TeV. We have
analysed the effects of the modification of the gluon PDFs in nucleus, using an
exact kinematics for a 2->2 process, namely g+g->J/Psi+g as expected from LO
pQCD. This allows to constrain the transverse-momentum while computing the
nuclear modification factor for different rapidities, unlike with the usual
simplified kinematics. Owing to the absence of measurement in pp collisions at
the same sqrt(s_NN) and owing to the expected significant uncertainties in
yield interpolations which would hinder definite interpretations of nuclear
modification factor --R_pPb--, we have derived forward-to-backward and
central-to-peripheral yield ratios in which the unknown proton-proton yield
cancel. These have been computed without and with a transverse-momentum cut,
e.g. to comply with the ATLAS and CMS constraints in the central-rapidity
region.
