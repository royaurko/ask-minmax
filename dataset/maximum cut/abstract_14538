In this paper we introduce the exponentiated Weibull power series (EWPS)
class of distributions which is obtained by compounding exponentiated Weibull
and power series distributions, where the compounding procedure follows same
way that was previously carried out by Roman et al. (2010) and Cancho et al.
(2011) in introducing the complementary exponential-geometric (CEG) and the
two-parameter Poisson-exponential (PE) lifetime distributions, respectively.
This distribution contains several lifetime models such as: exponentiated
weibull-geometric (EWG), exponentiated weibull-binomial (EWB), exponentiated
weibull-poisson (EWP), exponentiated weibull-logarithmic (EWL) distributions as
a special case.
  The hazard rate function of the EWPS distribution can be increasing,
decreasing, bathtub-shaped and unimodal failure rate among others. We obtain
several properties of the EWPS distribution such as its probability density
function, its reliability and failure rate functions, quantiles and moments.
The maximum likelihood estimation procedure via a EM-algorithm is presented in
this paper. Sub-models of the EWPS distribution are studied in details. In the
end, Applications to two real data sets are given to show the flexibility and
potentiality of the EWPS distribution.
