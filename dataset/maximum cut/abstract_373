We study the optical properties of metamaterials made from cut-wire pairs or
plate pairs. We obtain a more pronounced optical response for arrays of plate
pairs -- a geometry which also eliminates the undesired polarization anisotropy
of the cut-wire pairs. The measured optical spectra agree with simulations,
revealing negative magnetic permeability in the range of telecommunications
wavelengths. Thus, nanoscopic plate pairs might serve as an alternative to the
established split-ring resonator design.
