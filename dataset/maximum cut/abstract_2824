We show that an equilibrium-like additivity property can remarkably lead to
the frequently observed power law distributions in a wide class of
out-of-equilibrium systems where the full scaling form of the distribution
functions can be obtained using standard statistical mechanics. The asymptotic
behaviour of these distributions is solely governed by multiple-pole or
branch-cut singularity in the variance of the subsystem mass. To substantiate
these claims, we explicitly calculate, using the additivity property, subsystem
mass distributions in a wide class of previously studied mass aggregation
models as well as in their variants. These results could help in thermodynamic
characterization of nonequilibrium critical phenomena.
