We report the observation of macroscopic field-free orientation, i.e. more
than 73 % of CO molecules pointing in the same direction. This is achieved
through an all-optical scheme operating at high particle densities
($>10^{17}$cm$^{-3}$) that combines a one-color ($\omega$) and a two-color
($\omega + 2\omega$) non-resonant femtosecond laser pulses. We show that the
achieved orientation solely relies on the hyperpolarizability interaction as
opposed to an ionization-depletion mechanism thus opening a wide range of
applications. The achieved strong orientation enables us to reveal the
molecular-frame anisotropies of the photorecombination amplitudes and phases
caused by a shape resonance. The resonance appears as a local maximum in the
even-harmonic emission around 28~eV. In contrast, the odd-harmonic emission is
suppressed in this spectral region through the combined effects of an
asymmetric photorecombination phase and a sub-cycle Stark effect, generic for
polar molecules, that we experimentally identify.
