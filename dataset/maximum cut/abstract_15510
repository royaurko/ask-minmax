In this work, the feasibility condition of Powder-In-Tube (PIT) processed
wires of Fe(Se,Te) superconductor has been investigated. We faced several
technical issues that are extensively described and discussed. In particular,
we tested different metals and alloys as external sheaths (Cu, Ag, Nb, Ta, Ni,
Fe, cupronickel, brass) concluding that the only sheath that does not affect
substantially the Fe(Se,Te) phase is Fe. On the other hand, Fe sheath
introduces excess iron in the Fe(Se,Te) phase, which affects the
superconducting properties; we investigated the effects of the thermal
treatments and of the powder composition in order to avoid it. The maximum Jc
value obtained in our samples is 4*10^2 A/cm2, comparable to other published
values of PIT conductors of the 11 family. We conclude that the fabrication of
Fe(Se,Te) wires by PIT method is quite challenging and other approaches should
be developed.
