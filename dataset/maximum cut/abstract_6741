The reflection spectrum of a probe light in a -type three-level atomic system
coupled by an off-resonant standing-wave is investigated experimentally and
theoretically. We show that the maximum value of reflection coefficient occurs
when both of the coupling and probe lights are tuned off resonances from the
atomic transitions. The nature of enhanced reflection is attributed to the
phase compensation caused by the anomalous dispersion, which leads to a
significant reduction of nonlinear phase mismatch in atomic four-wave mixing.
At certain detuning of coupling and probe frequencies near two-photon
resonance, there exits a best compensation, so the reflection efficiency
reaches its maximum. The dependences of efficiency on the intensity of coupling
fields and the density of atoms are also studied.
