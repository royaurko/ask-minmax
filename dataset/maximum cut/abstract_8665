We consider here quark matter equation of state in a relativistic harmonic
confinement model at zero temperature. The same is considered to study phase
transition of neutron matter to quark matter at high densities. This, along
with a phenomenological equation of state in the neutron matter sector is used
to study hybrid stars. Using Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations, stable
solutions for hybrid stars are obtained with a maximum mass of 1.98 $M_\odot$
and radii around 10 kms with a quark core of about 1 to 2 kilometers.
