Banhatti (2009) set down the procedure to derive cosmological number density
n(z) from the differential distribution p(x) of the fractional luminosity
volume relative to the maximum volume, x \equiv V/Vm (0 \leq x \leq 1), using a
small sample of 76 quasars for illustrative purposes. This procedure is here
applied to a bigger sample of 286 quasars selected from Parkes half-Jansky
flat-spectrum survey at 2.7 GHz (Drinkwater et al 1997). The values of n(z) are
obtained for 8 values of redshift z from 0 to 3.5. The function n(z) can be
interpreted in terms of redshift distribution obtained by integrating the radio
luminosity function {\rho}(P, z) over luminosities P for the survey limiting
flux density S0 = 0.5 Jy. Keywords. V/Vm - luminosity-volume - cosmological
