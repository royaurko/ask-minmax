Two methods based on bremsstrahlung were applied to the stable even Mo
isotopes for the experimental determination of the photon strength function
covering the high excitation energy range above 4 MeV with its increasing level
density. Photon scattering was used up to the neutron separation energies Sn
and data up to the maximum of the isovector giant resonance(GDR) were obtained
by photo-activation. After a proper correction for multi-step processes the
observed quasi-continuous spectra of scattered photons show a remarkably good
match to the photon strengths derived from nuclear photo effect data obtained
previously by neutron detection and corrected in absolute scale using the new
activation results. The combined data form an excellent basis to derive a shape
dependence of the E1 strength in the even Mo isotopes with increasing deviation
from the N = 50 neutron shell, i.e. with the impact of quadrupole deformation
and triaxiality. The wide energy coverage of the data allows for a stringent
assessment of the dipole sum-rule, and a test of a novel parameterization
developed previously which is based upon. This parameterization for the
electric dipole strength function in nuclei with A>80 deviates significantly
from prescriptions generally used previously. In astrophysical network
calculations it may help to quantify the role the p-process plays in the cosmic
nucleosynthesis. It also has impact on the accurate analysis of neutron capture
data of importance for future nuclear energy systems and waste transmutation.
