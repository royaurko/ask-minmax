Using the well-known ``displace, cut and reflect'' method used to generate
disks from given solutions of Einstein field equations, we construct static
disks made of perfect fluid based on vacuum Schwarzschild's solution in
isotropic coordinates. The same method is applied to different exactsolutions
to the Einstein'sequations that represent static spheres of perfect fluids. We
construct several models of disks with axially symmetric perfect fluid halos.
  All disks have some common features: surface energy density and pressures
decrease monotonically and rapidly with radius. As the ``cut'' parameter $a$
decreases, the disks become more relativistic, with surface energy density and
pressure more concentrated near the center. Also regions of unstable circular
orbits are more likely to appear for high relativistic disks. Parameters can be
chosen so that the sound velocity in the fluid and the tangential velocity of
test particles in circular motion are less then the velocity of light. This
tangential velocity first increases with radius and reaches a maximum.
