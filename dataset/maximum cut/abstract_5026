In this work we have used extensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite size
scaling theory to study the phase transition in the dipolar Planar Rotator
model (dPRM), also known as dipolar XY model. The true long-range character of
the dipolar interactions were taken into account by using the Ewald summation
technique. Our results for the critical exponents does not fit those from known
universality classes. We observed that the specific heat is apparently
non-divergent and the critical exponents are $\nu=1.277(2)$, $\beta=0.2065(4)$
and $\gamma=2.218(5)$. The critical temperature was found to be $T_c=1.201(1)$.
Our results are clearly distinct from those of a recent Renormalization Group
study from Maier and Schwabl [PRB 70, 134430 (2004)] and agrees with the
results from a previous study of the anisotropic Heisenberg model with dipolar
interactions in a bilayer system using a cut-off in the dipolar interactions
[PRB 79, 054404 (2009)].
