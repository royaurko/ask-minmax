A possibility of a few MeV electron beam diagnostics (Lorentz factor ~ 10)
using polarization characteristics of the optical transition radiation (OTR)
have been considered. Determinaton of the electron beam divergence have been
performed with technique based on the OTR measurements. The technique is based
on measuring the ratio R=Imin/Imax, where Imin(Imax) is the photon yield in the
minimum (maximum) of OTR angular distribution. It is shown that the value of R
can be obtained also from the measurement of the so-called psi-scan of the OTR
yield registered by a fixed detector with the aperture < gamma^(-1) by varying
the target tilt angle with respect to the electron-beam. The experiment curried
out at 6.1 MeV Tomsk microtron has demonstrated the feasibility of the
technique proposed.
