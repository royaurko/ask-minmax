The positive cosmological constant sets the scale
$r_0=(\frac{3}{2}r_sr_\Lambda^2)^{1/3}$, which depending on the mass of the
source, can be of astrophysical order of magnitude. This scale was interpreted
before as the maximum distance in order to get bound orbits. In this paper I
compute $r_0$ with a different method and obtain its first order correction
$(r_0(\beta))$ due to the angular momentum $L$ of the test particle moving
around the source. I then re-derive other relevant scales related to $\Lambda$.
Finally I analyze the role of $r_0(\beta= 0)$ in the Black Hole thermodynamics
and in the non-linear (ghost-free) theory of massive gravity where it appears
as the Vainshtein radius ($r_V$) for the dRGT version of the theory. In the
case of dRGT, $r_0=r_V$ appears as an extremal condition for the dynamical
metric in unitary gauge for a stationary metric solution. Finally, I derive the
equations of motion for a test particle moving around the Schwarzschild
de-Sitter (S-dS) metric in dRGT in order to analyze the predictable character
of the theory at the background level.
