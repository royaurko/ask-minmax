We present simulations of a cosmic shear survey and show how the survey
geometry influences the accuracy of determination of cosmological parameters.
We numerically calculate the full covariance matrices of the two-point
statistics \xi_+, \xi_- and <Map^2> and use maximum likelihood and Fisher
matrix analyses in order to derive expected constraints on the cosmological
parameters \Omega_m, \sigma_8, \Gamma, n_s and \Omega_\Lambda.
