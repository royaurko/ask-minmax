Starch-water slurries are commonly used to study fracture dynamics. Drying
starch-cakes benefit from being simple, economical, and reproducible systems,
and have been used to model desiccation fracture in soils, thin film fracture
in paint, and columnar joints in lava. In this paper, the physical properties
of starch-water mixtures are studied, and used to interpret and develop a
multiphase transport model of drying. Starch-cakes are observed to have a
nonlinear elastic modulus, and a desiccation strain that is comparable to that
generated by their maximum achievable capillary pressure. It is shown that a
large material porosity is divided between pore spaces between starch grains,
and pores within starch grains. This division of pore space leads to two
distinct drying regimes, controlled by liquid and vapor transport of water,
respectively. The relatively unique ability for drying starch to generate
columnar fracture patterns is shown to be linked to the unusually strong
separation of these two transport mechanisms.
