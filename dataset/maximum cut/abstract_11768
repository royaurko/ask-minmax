For a spinor gas, i.e., a mixture of identical particles with several
internal degrees of freedom, we derive the partition function in terms of the
Feynman-Kac functionals of polarized components. As an example we study a
spin-1 Bose gas with the spins subjected to an external magnetic field and
confined by a parabolic potential. From the analysis of the free energy for a
finite number of particles, we find that the specific heat of this ideal spinor
gas as a function of temperature has two maxima: one is related to a Schottky
anomaly, due to the lifting of the spin degeneracy by the external field, the
other maximum is the signature of Bose-Einstein condensation.
