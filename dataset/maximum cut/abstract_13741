Let $\mathbb K$ be a field of characteristic 0. Let $\Gamma\subset\mathbb
P^n_{\mathbb K}$ be a reduced finite set of points, not all contained in a
hyperplane. Let $hyp(\Gamma)$ be the maximum number of points of $\Gamma$
contained in any hyperplane, and let $d(\Gamma)=|\Gamma|-hyp(\Gamma)$. If
$I\subset R=\mathbb K[x_0,...,x_n]$ is the ideal of $\Gamma$, then in \cite{t1}
it is shown that for $n=2,3$, $d(\Gamma)$ has a lower bound expressed in terms
of some shift in the graded minimal free resolution of $R/I$. In these notes we
show that this behavior is true in general, for any $n\geq 2$: $d(\Gamma)\geq
A_n$, where $A_n=\min\{a_i-n\}$ and $\oplus_i R(-a_i)$ is the last module in
the graded minimal free resolution of $R/I$. In the end we also prove that this
bound is sharp for a whole class of examples due to Juan Migliore (\cite{m}).
