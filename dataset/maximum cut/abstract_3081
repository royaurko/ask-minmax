Algebraic immunity has been proposed as an important property of Boolean
functions. To resist algebraic attack, a Boolean function should possess high
algebraic immunity. It is well known now that the algebraic immunity of an
$n$-variable Boolean function is upper bounded by $\left\lceil {\frac{n}{2}}
\right\rceil $. In this paper, for an odd integer $n$, we present a
construction method which can efficiently generate a Boolean function of $n$
variables with maximum algebraic immunity, and we also show that any such
function can be generated by this method. Moreover, the number of such Boolean
functions is greater than $2^{2^{n-1}}$.
