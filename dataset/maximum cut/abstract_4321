We propose a parton model of inelastic collisions at transplanckian energies
E >> G^{-1/2}, using the gravitons, whose transverse momenta are cut at the
Planck scale, as partons. For this purpose we represent the gravitational
shock-wave accompanying the fast particle in terms of such partons and take
into account the higher order multiperipheral-like contributions. We argue that
the internal part of this shock plane contains the ``black'' disk of radius
R(E) ~ E^{1/2} filled by such hard partons with the Planck density. When two
fast particles collide the hard graviton production comes from the region of
intersection of their black disks. The corresponding value of inclusive
cross-section at the given rapidity and the impact parameter is proportional to
the area of this region. The final state with such hard gravitons is unstable
relative to the long range gravitational repulsion, and this leads to the
creation of the multiperipheral chain of black holes at later stages of the
reaction. We discuss various details of this picture including higher order
corrections and there connection to a purely classical approach; we also
consider briefly possible changes when additional hidden dimensions are
present.
