Aperiodic point sets (or tilings) which can be obtained by the method of cut
and projection from higher dimensional periodic sets play an important role for
the description of quasicrystals. Their topological invariants can be computed
using the higher dimensional periodic structure. We report on the results
obtained for the cohomology groups of projection point patterns supplemented by
explicit calculations made by F. Gaehler for many well-known icosahedral
tilings.
