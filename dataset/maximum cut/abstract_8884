Because of growing interest in temperature-based sampling methods like
replica exchange, this note aims to make some observations and raise some
potentially important questions which we have not seen addressed sufficiently
in the literature. Mainly, we wish to call attention to limits on the maximum
speed-up to be expected from temperature-based methods, and also note the need
for careful quantification of sampling efficiency. Because potentially lengthy
studies may be necessary to address these issues, we felt it would be useful to
bring them to the attention of the broader community. Here \emph{we are
strictly concerned with canonical sampling at a fixed temperature,} and
\emph{not} with conformational search.
