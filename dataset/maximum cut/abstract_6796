We deduce the maximum-entropy state of partons created in proton-proton and
nucleus-nucleus collisions. This state is characterized by a distribution
function n(x,pT) depending on the light-cone fraction x and the transverse
momentum pT of forward or backward particles, respectively. The mean transverse
momentum <pT> determines the single parameter of the maximum entropy
distribution which is constrained by the sum of all light-cone momentum
fractions being unity. The total multiplicity is related to the transverse area
of the colliding Lorentz-contracted hadrons. Assuming parton-hadron duality we
can compare the model to data from RHIC and LHC.
