Recently it has been observed that the bivariate generalized linear failure
rate distribution can be used quite effectively to analyze lifetime data in two
dimensions. This paper introduces a more general class of bivariate
distributions. We refer to this new class of distributions as bivariate
generalized linear failure rate power series model. This new class of bivariate
distributions contains several lifetime models such as: generalized linear
failure rate-power series, bivariate generalized linear failure rate and
bivariate generalized linear failure rate geometric distributions as special
cases among others. The construction and characteristics of the proposed
bivariate distribution are presented along with estimation procedures for the
model parameters based on maximum likelihood. The marginal and conditional laws
are also studied. We present an application to the real data set where our
model provides a better fit than other models.
