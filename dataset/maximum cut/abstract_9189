This second part on polygons in the hyperbolic plane is based on the first
part which deals with uniqueness and existence of cocyclic polygons with
prescribed sidelengths. The topic here is the maximum question for the area of
these polygons. It is shown that the maximal copies must be cocyclic and
oriented-convex or have a special collinear shape. The maximal copies are
unique up to rigid hyperbolic motions. The cocyclicity means that the vertices
are situated on a distance circle, a distance line or a horocycle, the three
types of cycles in the hyperbolic plane. The phenomenon of different circle
types stands in salient contrast to the Euclidean case and pays for various
difficulties in the hyperbolic discussion.
