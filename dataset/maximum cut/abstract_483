We present a steepest descent calculation of the Kallen-Lehmann spectral
density of two-point functions involving complex conjugate masses in Euclidean
space. This problem occurs in studies of (gauge) theories with Gribov-like
propagators. As the presence of complex masses and the use of Euclidean space
brings the theory outside of the strict validity of the Cutkosky cut rules, we
discuss an alternative method based on the Widder inversion operator of the
Stieltjes transformation. It turns out that the results coincide with those
obtained by naively applying the cut rules. We also point out the potential
usefulness of the Stieltjes (inversion) formalism when non-standard propagators
are used, in which case cut rules are not available at all.
