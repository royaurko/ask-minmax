The LHC searches for the CP-odd Higgs boson is studied (with masses from 300
GeV to 1 TeV) in the context of the general two-Higgs-doublet model. With the
discovery of the 125 GeV Higgs boson at the LHC, we highlight one promising
discovery channel of the hZ. This channel can become significant after the
global signal fitting to the 125 GeV Higgs boson in the general
two-Higgs-doublet model. It is particularly important in the scenario where two
CP-even Higgs bosons in the two-Higgs-doublet model have the common mass of 125
GeV. Since the final states involve a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson, we apply
the jet substructure analysis of the fat Higgs jet in order to eliminate the
Standard Model background sufficiently. After performing the kinematic cuts, we
present the LHC search sensitivities for the CP-odd Higgs boson with mass up to
1 TeV via this channel.
