We describe the process of stacking radio interferometry visibilities to form
a deep composite image and its application to the observation of transient
phenomena. We apply "visibility stacking" to 46 archival Very Large Array
observations of nearby type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). This new approach provides
an upper limit on the SNIa ensemble peak radio luminosity of
1.2x10^{25}erg/s/Hz at 5GHz, which is 5-10 times lower than previously
measured. This luminosity implies an upper limit on the average companion
stellar wind mass loss rate of 1.3x10^{-7}M_o/yr. This mass loss rate is
consistent with the double degenerate scenario for SNeIa and rules out
intermediate and high mass companions in the single degenerate scenario. In the
era of time domain astronomy, techniques such as visibility stacking will be
important in extracting the maximum amount of information from observations of
populations of short lived events.
