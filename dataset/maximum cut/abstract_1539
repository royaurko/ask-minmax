Intel Xeon Phi is a recently released high-performance coprocessor which
features 61 cores each supporting 4 hardware threads with 512-bit wide SIMD
registers achieving a peak theoretical performance of 1Tflop/s in double
precision. Many scientific applications involve operations on large sparse
matrices such as linear solvers, eigensolver, and graph mining algorithms. The
core of most of these applications involves the multiplication of a large,
sparse matrix with a dense vector (SpMV). In this paper, we investigate the
performance of the Xeon Phi coprocessor for SpMV. We first provide a
comprehensive introduction to this new architecture and analyze its peak
performance with a number of micro benchmarks. Although the design of a Xeon
Phi core is not much different than those of the cores in modern processors,
its large number of cores and hyperthreading capability allow many application
to saturate the available memory bandwidth, which is not the case for many
cutting-edge processors. Yet, our performance studies show that it is the
memory latency not the bandwidth which creates a bottleneck for SpMV on this
architecture. Finally, our experiments show that Xeon Phi's sparse kernel
performance is very promising and even better than that of cutting-edge general
purpose processors and GPUs.
