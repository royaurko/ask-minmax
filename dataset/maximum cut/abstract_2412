Within a transport code simulation for heavy-ion collisions at bombarding
energies around 1 AGeV, we demonstrate that double-differential di-electron
spectra with suitable kinematical cuts are useful to isolate (i) the $\rho$
meson peak even in case of strong broadening, and (ii) the in-medium $\omega$
decay contribution. The expected in-medium modifications of the vector meson
spectral densities can thus be probed in this energy range via the di-electron
channel.
