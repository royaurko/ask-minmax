We propose a new way to determine the squark mass based on the shape of
di-jet invariant mass distribution of supersymmetry (SUSY) di-jet events at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our algorithm, which is based on event kinematics,
requires that the branching ratio $B(\tilde{q} \rightarrow q \tilde{z}_1)$ is
substantial for at least some types of squarks, and that
$m_{\tilde{z}_1}^2/m_{\tilde{q}}^2 \ll 1$. We select di-jet events with no
isolated leptons, and impose cuts on the total jet transverse energy,
$E_T^{tot}=E_T(j_1)+E_T(j_2)$, on $\alpha = E_T(j_2)/m_{jj}$, and on the
azimuthal angle between the two jets to reduce SM backgrounds. The shape of the
resulting di-jet mass distribution depends sensitively on the squark mass,
especially if the integrated luminosity is sufficient to allow a hard enough
cut on $E_T^{tot}$ and yet leave a large enough signal to obtain the $m_{jj}$
distribution. We simulate the signal and Standard Model (SM) backgrounds for
100 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity at 14 TeV requiring $E_T^{tot}> 700$ GeV.
We show that it should be possible to extract $m_{\tilde{q}}$ to within about
3% at 95% CL --- similar to the precision obtained using $m_{T2}$ --- from the
di-jet mass distribution if $m_{\tilde{q}} \sim 650$ GeV, or to within $\sim
5$% if $m_{\tilde{q}}\sim 1$ TeV.
