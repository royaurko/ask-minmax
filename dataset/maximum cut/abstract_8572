A simple phenomenological model is developed for the recent torsional
oscillator experiments on solid $^4$He. Within this model, for a homogeneous
sample there is a specific quantitative relation between the change in the
oscillator's frequency and its maximum damping at the apparent supersolid
transition. Much of the published data do not satisfy this relation, indicating
that the dissipation peaks in those samples are strongly inhomogeneously
broadened.
