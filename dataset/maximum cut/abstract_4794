Previous studies have indicated that the near-side peak of high-$p_T$
triggered correlations can be decomposed into two parts, the \textit{Jet} and
the \textit{Ridge}. We present data on the yield per trigger of the
\textit{Jet} and the \textit{Ridge} from $d+Au$, $Cu+Cu$ and $Au+Au$ collisions
at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV and compare data on the \textit{Jet}
to PYTHIA 8.1 simulations for $p+p$. PYTHIA describes the \textit{Jet}
component up to a scaling factor, meaning that PYTHIA can provide a better
understanding of the \textit{Ridge} by giving insight into the effects of the
kinematic cuts. We present collision energy and system dependence of the
\textit{Ridge} yield, which should help distinguish models for the production
mechanism of the \textit{Ridge}.
