Multicuts enable to conveniently represent discrete graphical models for
unsupervised and supervised image segmentation, based on local energy functions
that exhibit symmetries. The basic Potts model and natural extensions thereof
to higher-order models provide a prominent class of representatives, that cover
a broad range of segmentation problems relevant to image analysis and computer
vision. We show how to take into account such higher-order terms systematically
in view of computational inference, and present results of a comprehensive and
competitive numerical evaluation of a variety of dedicated cutting-plane
algorithms. Our results reveal ways to evaluate a significant subset of models
globally optimal, without compromising runtime. Polynomially solvable
relaxations are studied as well, along with advanced rounding schemes for
post-processing.
