It is proved that the maximum condition for subloops in a commutative Moufang
loop $Q$ is equivalent with the conditions of finite generating of different
subloops of the loop $Q$ and different subgroups of the multiplication group of
the loop $Q$. An analogue equivalence is set for the commutative Moufang
$ZA$-loops.
