Within the mean-field theory, the magnetic properties of spin-$1/2$ charged
Fermi gases with ferromagnetic interactions are investigated. A competition
among the paramagnetism, diamagnetism and ferromagnetism are found in this
system, and there exists a spontaneous magnetization for weak magnetic field.
The intensity of the paramagnetic effect which comes from the spin degree of
freedom is described by the Land\'{e} factor $g$. When the magnetic field
intensity increases, both the paramagnetism and diamagnetism increase. The
critical value of reduced ferromagnetic coupling constant $\bar I_{c}$
increases with the increase of the reduced temperature $t$. The reduced
magnetization density $\bar M$ increases firstly as the temperature increases,
then reaches a maximum, finally decreases smoothly in the high temperature
region. The domed shape of the magnetization density $\bar M$ is different from
the behavior of Bose gas. We also calculate the susceptibility. We find the
curve of susceptibility follows the Curie-Weiss law, and for a given
temperature the susceptibility increases with the increase of the Land\'{e}
factor $g$.
