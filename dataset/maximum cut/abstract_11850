Monte-Carlo simulation technique has been used to investigate the effect of
temperature and adsorbed gases on the composition profile of unsupported Pt-Rh
nanocatalysts. For a 2406 atom fcc cubo-octahedral Pt$_{\rm{}50}$Rh$_{\rm{}50}$
nanocatalyst the shell-wise composition for all the eight shells has been
simulated. For the temperatures 700 K, 1000 K and 1300 K, the top shell of
clean Pt-Rh nanocatalysts is found to be mildly Pt-enriched, while the second
shell is Pt-depleted. The Pt concentration of the top shell shows a maximum at
T = 1000 K. In presence of a quarter monolayer of adsorbed oxygen the top shell
shows Rh enrichment, while all the other shells show Pt-enrichment. This is
true for all the three temperatures for which the composition profiles have
been studied.
