By comparing positions on a spectral color-color diagram from 10 black hole
candidates (BHCs) observed with Ginga (1354-64, 1826-24, 1630-47, LMC X-1,
LMC X-3, GS 2000+25, GS 2023+33, GS 1124-68, Cyg X-1, and GX 339-4) with the
observed broad-band noise (0.001-64 Hz; BBN) and quasi-periodic oscillation
(QPO) variability, we find that the so-called ``Very High State'' is spectrally
intermediate to the Soft/High-State and Hard/Low-State. We find a transition
point in spectral hardness where the dependence of the BHC QPO centroid
frequency (of GS 1124-68 and GX 339-4) on spectral hardness switches from a
correlation to an anti-correlation; where the BBN variability switches from
High-State to Low-State; and where the spectral hardness of the QPO relative to
that of the BBN variability is a maximum. This coincidence of changing behavior
in both the QPO and the broad-band variability leads us to hypothesize that the
QPO is due to interaction between the physical components which dominate the
behaviors of BHCs when they occupy the Hard/Low and Soft/High States. We
conclude that these QPO should be observed from BHCs during transition between
these two states. Comparison with QPO and BBN behavior observed during the 1996
transition of Cyg X-1 supports this hypothesis.
  We also report 1-3 Hz QPO observed in GS 2000+25 and Cyg X-1 in the Hard/Low
State, and we compare these to the QPO observed in GS 1124-68 and GX 339-4.
