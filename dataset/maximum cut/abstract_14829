We have studied the electronic structure of unoccupied states measured by O
K-edge and Cu L-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), combined with crystal
structure studied by high resolution powder x-ray diffraction (HRPXRD), of
charge-compensated layered superconducting CaxLa(1-x)Ba(1.75-x)La(0.25+x)Cu3Oy
(0<x<0.4, 6.4<y<7.3) cuprate. A detailed analysis shows that, apart from hole
doping, chemical pressure on the electronically active CuO2 plane due to the
lattice mismatch with the spacer layers greatly influences the superconducting
properties of this system. The results suggest chemical pressure to be the most
plausible parameter to control the maximum critical temperatures (Tcmax) in
different cuprate families at optimum hole density.
