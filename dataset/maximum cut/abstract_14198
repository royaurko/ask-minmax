How the Hawking effect and the prepared states influence the entanglement
distillability of Dirac fields in the Schwarzschild spacetime is studied by
using the Werner states which are composed of the maximum or generic entangled
states. It is found that the states are entangled when the parameter of the
Werner states, $F$, satisfies $\tau<F\leq 1$ in which $\tau$ is influenced both
by the Hawking temperature of the black hole and energy of the fields. It is
also shown that although the parameter of the generic entangled states,
$\alpha$, affects the entanglement, it does not change the range of the
parameter, $F$, where the states are entangled for the case of generic
entangled states.
