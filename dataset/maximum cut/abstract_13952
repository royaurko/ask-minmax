We investigate by particle-in-cell simulations in two and three dimensions
the laser-plasma interaction and the proton acceleration in multilayer targets
where a low density "near-critical" layer of a few micron thickness is added on
the illuminated side of a thin, high density layer. This target design can be
obtained by depositing a "foam" layer on a thin metallic foil. The presence of
the near-critical plasma strongly increases both the conversion efficiency and
the energy of electrons and leads to enhanced acceleration of proton from a
rear side layer via the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration mechanism. The
electrons of the foam are strongly accelerated in the forward direction and
propagate on the rear side of the target building up a high electric field with
a relatively flat longitudinal profile. In these conditions the maximum proton
energy is up to three times higher than in the case of the bare solid target.
