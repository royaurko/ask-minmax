In this paper we present a comparative study on fusion of visual and thermal
images using different wavelet transformations. Here, coefficients of discrete
wavelet transforms from both visual and thermal images are computed separately
and combined. Next, inverse discrete wavelet transformation is taken in order
to obtain fused face image. Both Haar and Daubechies (db2) wavelet transforms
have been used to compare recognition results. For experiments IRIS
Thermal/Visual Face Database was used. Experimental results using Haar and
Daubechies wavelets show that the performance of the approach presented here
achieves maximum success rate of 100% in many cases.
