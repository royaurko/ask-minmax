In this paper, we investigate the spatial distribution of solar flares in the
northern and southern hemisphere of the Sun that occurred during the period
1996 to 2003. This period of investigation includes the ascending phase, the
maximum and part of descending phase of solar cycle 23. It is revealed that the
flare activity during this cycle is low compared to previous solar cycle,
indicating the violation of Gnevyshev-Ohl rule. The distribution of flares with
respect to heliographic latitudes shows a significant asymmetry between
northern and southern hemisphere which is maximum during the minimum phase of
the solar cycle. The present study indicates that the activity dominates the
northern hemisphere in general during the rising phase of the cycle
(1997-2000). The dominance of northern hemisphere is shifted towards the
southern hemisphere after the solar maximum in 2000 and remained there in the
successive years. Although the annual variations in the asymmetry time series
during cycle 23 are quite different from cycle 22, they are comparable to cycle
21.
