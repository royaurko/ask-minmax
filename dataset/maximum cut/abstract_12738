Transient {\it time-domain resonances} found recently in time-dependent
solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger's equation are used to investigate the issue of
the tunneling time in rectangular potential barriers. In general, a time
frequency analysis shows that these transients have frequencies above the
cutoff frequency associated with the barrier height, and hence correspond to
non-tunneling processes. We find, however, a regime characterized by the
barrier opacity, where the peak maximum $t_{max}$ of the {\it time-domain
resonance} corresponds to under-the-barrier tunneling. We argue that $t_{max}$
represents the relevant tunneling time scale through the classically forbidden
region.
