We present short \chandra observations of twelve bright (i<18) z_em~1.5
quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey chosen to have significantly redder
optical colors than most quasars at the same redshift. Of the five quasars with
optical properties most consistent with dust reddening at the quasar redshift,
four show indirect evidence of moderate X-ray absorption (inferred N_H~10^22
cm^-2) with a dust-to-gas ratio <1% of the SMC value. The remaining seven
objects show no evidence for even moderate intrinsic X-ray absorption. Thus,
while optically red quasars are marginally more likely to show signatures of
X-ray absorption than optically selected quasars with normal colors,
dust-reddened type 1 AGN (as opposed to fully obscured type 2 AGN) are unlikely
to contribute significantly to the remaining unresolved hard X-ray background.
The red quasar population includes objects with intrinsically red continua as
well as objects with dust-reddened continua. Improved sample selection is thus
needed to increase our understanding of either subpopulation. To identify
dust-reddened quasars likely to exhibit X-ray absorption, some measure of
spectral curvature is preferable to simple cuts in observed or relative
broad-band colors.
