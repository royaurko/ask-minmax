The angular-dependent critical current density, Jc(theta), and the upper
critical field, Hc2(theta), of epitaxial Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 thin films have been
investigated. No Jc(theta) peaks for H || c were observed regardless of
temperatures and magnetic fields. In contrast, Jc(theta) showed a broad maximum
at theta=90 degree, which arises from intrinsic pinning. All data except at
theta=90 degree can be scaled by the Blatter plot. Hc2(theta) near Tc follows
the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau expression. The mass anisotropy increased from
1.5 to 2 with increasing temperature, which is an evidence for multi-band
superconductivity.
