We report resistivity measurement under pressure in single crystals of
SrFe_2As_2, which is one of the parent materials of Fe-based superconductors.
The structural and antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition of T_0 = 198 K at ambient
pressure is suppressed under pressure, and the ordered phase disappears above
P_c ~ 3.6-3.7 GPa. Superconductivity with a sharp transition appears
accompanied by the suppression of the AFM state. T_c exhibits a maximum of 34.1
K, which is realized close to the phase boundary at P_c. This T_c is the
highest among those of the stoichiometric Fe-based superconductors.
