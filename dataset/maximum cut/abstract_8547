Small and stable drops of 3He atoms can only exist above a minimum number of
particles, due to the combination of the 3He atom Fermi statistics and its
light mass. An accurate estimation of this minimum number using microscopic
theory has been difficult due to the inhomogeneous and fermionic nature of
these systems. We present a diffusion Monte Carlo calculation of 3He drops with
sizes near the minimum in order to determine the stability threshold. The
results show that the minimum self-bound drop is formed by N=30 atoms with
preferred orbitals for open shells corresponding to maximum value of the spin.
