We study charmonium correlators at finite temperature in quenched anisotropic
lattice QCD. The smearing technique is applied to enhance the low energy part
of the correlator. We use two analysis procedures: the maximum entropy method
for extraction of the spectral function without assuming specific form, as an
estimate of the shape of spectral function, and the $\chi^2$ fit assuming
typical forms as quantitative evaluation of the parameters associated to the
forms. We find that at $T\simeq 0.9T_c$ the ground state peak has almost the
same mass as at T=0 and almost vanishing width. At $T\simeq 1.1T_c$, our result
suggests that the correlator still has nontrivial peak structure at almost the
same position as below $T_c$ with finite width.
