There is a fundamental relationship between belief propagation and maximum a
posteriori decoding. A decoding algorithm, which we call the Maxwell decoder,
is introduced and provides a constructive description of this relationship.
Both, the algorithm itself and the analysis of the new decoder are reminiscent
of the Maxwell construction in thermodynamics. This paper investigates in
detail the case of transmission over the binary erasure channel, while the
extension to general binary memoryless channels is discussed in a companion
paper.
