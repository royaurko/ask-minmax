Boundary interactions of closed-string with open-strings are examined
intended to provide a constructive formulation of boundary string field theory.
As an illustration, we consider the BPS $D$-brane of the type II superstring in
a constant NS-NS two-form background, and study the boundary interaction with
arbitrary configurations of gauge field on the brane. The boundary interaction
is presented, within the world-sheet cut-off theories, as an off-shell boundary
state in the closed-string Hilbert space. It is regarded as a closed-string
theoretical counterpart of the Wilson loop in the world-volume gauge theory. We
show that the action of the closed-string BRST operator on the boundary state
is translated into the non-linear BRST transformation of the open-string fields
on the world-volume. In particular, the BRST invariance condition at the
$\alpha'$-order becomes the non-linear equation of motion for the
non-commutative gauge theory. The action of the closed-string BRST operator on
the boundary state is also shown to be identified with the beta functions of
the world-sheet renormalization group flow.
