We consider the application of the DRA method to the case of several master
integrals in a given sector. We establish a connection between the homogeneous
part of dimensional recurrence and maximal unitarity cuts of the corresponding
integrals: a maximally cut master integral appears to be a solution of the
homogeneous part of the dimensional recurrence relation. This observation
allows us to make a necessary step of the DRA method, the construction of the
general solution of the homogeneous equation, which, in this case, is a coupled
system of difference equations.
