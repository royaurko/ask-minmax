Crossed Andreev reflection splitting a Cooper pair into the metal through
spatially separated terminals as two spin and energy entangled electrons is one
of the most promising approaches to generation of entangled electron pairs.
However, while the conventional (local) Andreev reflection occurs with the
probability of unity, the probability of crossed Andreev reflection is
significantly suppressed. We propose a one-dimensional model capturing main
features of the hybrid normal metal-superconductor setups used in experiments,
which allows to achieve a unitary limit of crossed Andreev transport, i.e.
splitting of Cooper pairs with the 100% efficiency. We calculate and analyze
electron-to-hole transmission probability, differential conductance, and
cross-correlations of currents passing through different terminals thus putting
the ideas of maximum possible outcome on a firm analytical basis.
