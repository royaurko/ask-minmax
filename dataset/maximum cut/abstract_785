In analogy with classical electromagnetic theory, where one determines the
total charge and both electric and magnetic multipole moments of a source from
certain surface integrals of the asymptotic (or far) fields, it has been known
for many years - from the work of Hermann Bondi - that energy and momentum of
gravitational sources could be determined by similar integrals of the
asymptotic Weyl tensor. Recently we observed that there were certain overlooked
structures, {defined at future null infinity,} that allowed one to determine
(or define) further properties of both electromagnetic and gravitating sources.
These structures, families of {complex} `slices' or `cuts' of Penrose's null
infinity, are referred to as Universal Cut Functions, (UCF). In particular, one
can define from these structures a (complex) center of mass (and center of
charge) and its equations of motion - with rather surprising consequences. It
appears as if these asymptotic structures contain in their imaginary part, a
well defined total spin-angular momentum of the source. We apply these ideas to
the type II algebraically special metrics, both twisting and twist-free.
