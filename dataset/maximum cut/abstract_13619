We study a stochastic model for tumor cell growth with both multiplicative
and additive colored noise as well as a non-zero cross-correlations in between.
Whereas the death rate within the logistic model is altered by a deterministic
term characterizing immunization, the birth rate is assumed to be
stochastically changed due to biological motivated growth processes leading to
a multiplicative internal noise. Moreover, the system is subjected to an
external additive noise which mimics the influence of the environment of the
tumor. The stationary probability distribution Ps is derived depending on the
finite correlation time, the immunization rate and the strength of the
crosscorrelation. Ps offers a maximum which becomes more pronounced for
increasing immunization rate. The mean-first passage time is also calculated in
order to find out under which conditions the tumor can suffer extinction. Its
characteristics is again controlled by the degree of immunization and the
strength of the cross-correlation. The behavior observed can be interpreted in
terms of the three state model of a tumor population.
