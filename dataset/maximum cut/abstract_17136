Coherent Space-Time Shift Keying (CSTSK) is a recently developed generalized
shift-keying framework for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output systems, which uses a
set of Space-Time matrices termed as Dispersion Matrices (DM). CSTSK may be
combined with a classic signaling set (eg. QAM, PSK) in order to strike a
flexible tradeoff between the achievable diversity and multiplexing gain. One
of the key benefits of the CSTSK scheme is its Inter-Channel Interference (ICI)
free system that makes single-stream Maximum Likelihood detection possible at
low-complexity. In the existing CSTSK scheme, DMs are chosen by maximizing the
mutual information over a large set of complex valued, Gaussian random matrices
through numerical simulations. We refer to them as Capacity-Optimized (CO) DMs.
In this contribution we establish a connection between the STSK scheme as well
as the Space-Time Block Codes (STBC) and show that a class of STBCs termed as
Decomposable Dispersion Codes (DDC) enjoy all the benefits that are specific to
the STSK scheme. Two STBCs belonging to this class are proposed, a rate-one
code from Field Extensions and a full-rate code from Cyclic Division Algebras,
that offer structured DMs with desirable properties such as full-diversity, and
a high coding gain. We show that the DMs derived from these codes are capable
of achieving a performance than CO-DMs, and emphasize the importance of DMs
having a higher coding gain than CO-DMs in scenarios having realistic,
imperfect channel state information at the receiver.
