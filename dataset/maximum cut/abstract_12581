Fusion-evaporation cross sections for $^{64}$Ni+$^{64}$Ni have been measured
down to the 10 nb level. For fusion between two open-shell nuclei, this is the
first observation of a maximum in the $S$-factor, which signals a strong
sub-barrier hindrance. A comparison with the $^{58}$Ni+$^{58}$Ni,
$^{58}$Ni+$^{60}$Ni, and $^{58}$Ni+$^{64}$Ni systems indicates a strong
dependence of the energy where the hindrance occurs on the stiffness of the
interacting nuclei.
