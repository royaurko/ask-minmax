We report on radiation properties of extreme nulling pulsar J1502-5653, by
analyzing the data acquired from the Parkes 64-m telescope at 1374 MHz. The
radio emission from this pulsar exhibits sequences of several tens to several
hundreds consecutive burst pulses, separated by null pulses, and the appearance
of the emission seems quasi-periodic. The null fraction from the data is
estimated to be 93.6%. No emission is detected in the integrated profile of all
null pulses. Systematic modulations of pulse intensity and phase are found at
the beginning of burst-pulse sequences just after null. The intensity usually
rises to a maximum for the first few pulses, then declines exponentially
afterwards, and becomes stable after few tens of pulse periods. The peak phase
appears at later longitudes for the first pulse, then drifts to earlier
longitudes rapidly, and then systematic drifting gradually vanishes while the
intensity becomes stable. In this pulsar, the intensity variation and phase
modulation of pulses are correlated in a short duration after the emission
starts following a null. Observed properties of the pulsar are compared with
other nulling pulsars published previously, and the possible explanation for
phase modulation is discussed.
