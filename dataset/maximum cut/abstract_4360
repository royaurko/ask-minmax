We have performed a detailed Monte Carlo exploration of the parameter space
for a warped Higgsless model of electroweak symmetry breaking in 5 dimensions.
This model is based on the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge group
in an AdS$_5$ bulk with arbitrary gauge kinetic terms on both the Planck and
TeV branes. Constraints arising from precision electroweak measurements and
collider data are found to be relatively easy to satisfy. We show, however,
that the additional requirement of perturbative unitarity up to the cut-off,
$\simeq 10$ TeV, in $W_L^+W_L^-$ elastic scattering in the absence of dangerous
tachyons eliminates all models. If successful models of this class exist, they
must be highly fine-tuned.
