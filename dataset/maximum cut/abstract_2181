We assume the stability of vacuum under radiative corrections in the context
of the standard electroweak theory. We find that this theory behaves as a good
effective model already at cut off energy scales as low as 0.7 TeV. This
stability criterion allows to predict m_H= 318 +- 13 GeV for the Higgs boson
mass.
