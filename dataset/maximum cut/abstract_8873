An examination of the propagation of intense 200 fs pulses in water reveals
light filaments not sustained by the balance between Kerr-induced self-focusing
and plasma-induced defocusing. Their appearance is interpreted as the
consequence of a spontaneous reshaping of the wave packet form a gaussian into
a conical wave, driven by the requirement of maximum localization, minimum
losses and stationarity in the presence of non-linear absorption.
