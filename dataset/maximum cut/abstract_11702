We discuss the effects of finite perturbations in fully developed turbulence
by introducing a measure of the chaoticity degree associated to a given scale
of the velocity field. This allows one to determine the predictability time for
non-infinitesimal perturbations, generalizing the usual concept of maximum
Lyapunov exponent. We also determine the scaling law for our indicator in the
framework of the multifractal approach. We find that the scaling exponent is
not sensitive to intermittency corrections, but is an invariant of the
multifractal models. A numerical test of the results is performed in the shell
model for the turbulent energy cascade.
