We simulate a model of repulsively interacting colloids on a commensurate
two-dimensional triangular pinning substrate where the amount of heterogeneous
motion that appears at melting can be controlled systematically by turning off
a fraction of the pinning sites. We correlate the amount of heterogeneous
motion with the average topological defect number, time dependent defect
fluctuations, colloid diffusion, and the form of the van Hove correlation
function. When the pinning sites are all off or all on, the melting occurs in a
single step. When a fraction of the sites are turned off, the melting becomes
considerably broadened and signatures of a two-step melting process appear. The
noise power associated with fluctuations in the number of topological defects
reaches a maximum when half of the pinning sites are removed, and the noise
spectrum has a pronounced 1/f^\alpha structure in the heterogeneous regime. We
find that regions of high mobility are associated with regions of high
dislocation densities.
