The possibility of detecting Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) in TeV energy range using
large area muon detectors like AMANDA and Lake Baikal detector is examined.
These detectors can detect TeV energy photons by detecting the secondary muons
created by the TeV photons in the Earth's atmosphere. We calculate the expected
number of muons and the signal to square root of noise ratios in these
detectors due to TeV gamma-rays from individual GRBs for various assumption on
their luminosity, distance from the observer (redshift), gamma-ray integral
spectral index, maximum energy cutoff of the photon spectrum and duration
including the effect of the absorption of TeV photons in the intergalactic
infrared radiation background. We also calculate the expected rate of
detectable TeV-GRB events in these detectors using a recent determination of
the luminosity and redshift distributions of GRBs in the Universe.
