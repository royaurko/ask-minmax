Asymptotic properties of random regular graphs are object of extensive study
in mathematics. In this note we argue, based on theory of spin glasses, that in
random regular graphs the maximum cut size asymptotically equals the number of
edges in the graph minus the minimum bisection size. Maximum cut and minimal
bisection are two famous NP-complete problems with no known general relation
between them, hence our conjecture is a surprising property of random regular
graphs. We further support the conjecture with numerical simulations. A
rigorous proof of this relation is obviously a challenge.
