The dynamic behavior of polyelectrolyte chains in the oligomer range is
investigated with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation and compared to
data obtained by two different experimental methods, namely capillary
electrophoresis and electrophoresis NMR. We find excellent agreement of
experiments and simulations when hydrodynamic interactions are accounted for in
the simulations. We show that the electrophoretic mobility exhibits a maximum
in the oligomer range and for the first time illustrate that this maximum is
due to the hydrodynamical shielding between the chain monomers. Our findings
demonstrate convincingly that it is possible to model dynamic behavior of
polyelectrolytes using coarse grained models for both, the polyelectrolyte
chains and the solvent induced hydrodynamic interactions.
