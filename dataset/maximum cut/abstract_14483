Transport of Brownian particles interacting with each other via the Morse
potential is investigated in the presence of an ac driving force applied
locally at one end of the chain. By using numerical simulations, we find that
the system can behave as a particle diode for both overdamped and underdamped
cases. For low frequencies, the transport from the free end to the ac acting
end is prohibited, while the transport from the ac acting end to the free end
is permitted. However, the polarity of the particle diode will reverse for
medium frequencies. There exists an optimal value of the well depth of the
interaction potential at which the average velocity takes its maximum. The
average velocity $\upsilon$ decreases monotonically with the system size $N$ by
a power law $\upsilon \propto N^{-1}$.
