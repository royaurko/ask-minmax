We present a new algorithm for inverting poorly resolved gravitational lens
systems using the maximum entropy method (MEM). We test the method with
simulations and then apply it to an 8 GHz VLA map of the radio ring lens
MG1654+134. We model the lens as a singular isothermal sphere embedded in an
external shear field and find the critical radius of the lens is
$b=0\parcs9820$, the dimensionless shear is $\gamma=0.0771$, and the position
angle of the shear is $\theta=100\pdeg8$. These results are consistent with the
results obtained by Kochanek (1995) using a complementary inversion algorithm
based on Clean.
