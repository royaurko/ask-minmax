We study the hadronic vacuum polarization in the resonance energy region,
using the framework given by the Resonance Effective Theory of QCD. We consider
the incorporation of vector-pseudoscalar meson loops that give, inclusively,
three and four pseudoscalar meson cuts. After resummation we achieve a
QCD-based inclusive parameterization of the correlator, hence of the hadronic
cross-section in the energy region populated by resonances.
