This article concerns the application of bootstrap methodology to construct a
likelihood-based confidence region for operating conditions associated with the
maximum of a response surface constrained to a specified region. Unlike
classical methods based on the stationary point, proper interpretation of this
confidence region does not depend on unknown model parameters. In addition, the
methodology does not require the assumption of normally distributed errors. The
approach is demonstrated for concave-down and saddle system cases in two
dimensions. Simulation studies were performed to assess the coverage
probability of these regions.
