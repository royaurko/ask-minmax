We report on the plasma properties of small-scale transient events identified
in the quiet Sun, coronal holes and their boundaries.
  We use spectroscopic co-observations from SUMER/SoHO and EIS/Hinode combined
with high cadence imaging data from XRT/Hinode. We measure Doppler shifts using
single and multiple Gauss fits of transition region and coronal lines as well
as electron densities and temperatures. We combine co-temporal imaging and
spectroscopy to separate brightening expansions from plasma flows. The
transient brightening events in coronal holes and their boundaries were found
to be very dynamical producing high density outflows at large speeds. Most of
these events represent X-ray jets from pre-existing or newly emerging coronal
bright points at X-ray temperatures. The average electron density of the jets
is logNe ~ 8.76 cm^-3 while in the flaring site it is logNe ~ 9.51 cm^-3. The
jet temperatures reach a maximum of 2.5 MK but in the majority of the cases the
temperatures do not exceed 1.6 MK. The footpoints of jets have temperatures of
a maximum of 2.5 MK though in a single event scanned a minute after the flaring
the measured temperature was 12 MK. The jets are produced by multiple
microflaring in the transition region and corona. Chromospheric emission was
only detected in their footpoints and was only associated with downflows. The
Doppler shift measurements in the quiet Sun transient brightenings confirmed
that these events do not produce jet-like phenomena. The plasma flows in these
phenomena remain trapped in closed loops.
