Building on a recent work of \v C. Crnkovi\'c, M. Douglas and G. Moore, a
study of multi-critical multi-cut one-matrix models and their associated
$sl(2,C)$ integrable hierarchies, is further pursued. The double scaling limits
of hermitian matrix models with different scaling ans\"atze, lead, to the KdV
hierarchy, to the modified KdV hierarchy and part of the non-linear
Schr\"odinger hierarchy. Instead, the anti-hermitian matrix model, in the
two-arc sector, results in the Zakharov-Shabat hierarchy, which contains both
KdV and mKdV as reductions. For all the hierarchies, it is found that the
Virasoro constraints act on the associated tau-functions. Whereas it is known
that the ZS and KdV models lead to the Virasoro constraints of an $sl(2,C)$
vacuum, we find that the mKdV model leads to the Virasoro constraints of a
highest weight state with arbitrary conformal dimension.
