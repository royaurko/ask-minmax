We show that an array of Josephson coupled Cooper paired planes can never
have long range phase coherence at any finite temperature due to an infrared
divergence of phase fluctuations. The phase correlations decay in a slow enough
manner providing enough local phase coherence as to make possible the
nucleation of vortices. The planes then acquire Kosterlitz-Thouless topological
order with its intrinsic rigidity and concomitant superfluidity. We thus
conclude that the high temperature superconducting cuprates are topologically
ordered superconductors rather than phase ordered superconductors. For low
enough superfluid densities, as in the underdoped cuprates, the transition
temperature, Tc, will be proportional to the superfluid density corresponding
to vortex-antivortex unbinding, and not to disappearance of the Cooper pairing
amplitude. Above Tc, but below the BCS pairing temperature Tp, we will have a
dephased Cooper pair fluid that is a vortex-antivortex liquid. The AC and DC
conductivities measured in this region are those corresponding to flux flow.
Furthermore there will be vortices above Tc which will lead to Nernst
vortexlike response and there will be a measurable depairing field H_c2 above
Tc as evidenced by recent experiments.
