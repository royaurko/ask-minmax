Models based on Universal Extra Dimensions predict Kaluza-Klein (KK)
excitations of all Standard Model (SM) particles. We examine the pair
production of KK excitations of top- and bottom-quarks at the Large Hadron
Collider. Once produced, the KK top/bottom quarks can decay to $b$-quarks,
leptons and the lightest KK-particle, $\gamma_1$, resulting in 2 $b$-jets, two
opposite sign leptons and missing transverse momentum, thereby mimicing
top-pair production. We show that, with a proper choice of kinematic cuts, an
integrated luminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$ would allow a discovery for an inverse
radius upto $R^{-1} = 750$ GeV.
