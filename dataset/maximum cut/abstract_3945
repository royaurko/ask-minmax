Dust particles observed in extrasolar planetary discs originate from
undetectable km-sized bodies but this valuable information remains
uninteresting if the theoretical link between grains and planetesimals is not
properly known. We outline in this paper a numerical approach we developed in
order to address this issue for the case of dust producing collisional
cascades. The model is based on a particle-in-a-box method. We follow the size
distribution of particles over eight orders of magnitude in radius taking into
account fragmentation and cratering according to different prescriptions. A
very particular attention is paid to the smallest particles, close to the
radiation pressure induced cut-off size $R_{pr}$, which are placed on highly
eccentric orbits by the stellar radiation pressure....(abstract continued in
