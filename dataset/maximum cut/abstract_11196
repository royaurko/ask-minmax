This report describes a modification of the orthogonal function Poisson
solver for n-body simulations that minimizes relaxation caused by small
particle number fluctuations. With the standard algorithm, the noise leading to
relaxation can be reduced by making the expansion basis similar to the particle
distribution and by carefully choosing the maximum order in the expansion. The
proposed algorithm accomplishes both tasks simultaneously while the simulation
is running. This procedure is asymptotically equivalent to expanding in an
orthogonal series which is matched to the distribution to start and truncating
at low order. Because the modified algorithm adapts to a time-evolving
distribution, it has advantage over a fixed basis.
 The required changes to the standard algorithm are minor and do not affect its
overall structure or scalability. Tests show that the overhead in CPU time is
small in practical applications. The decrease in relaxation rate is
demonstrated for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric systems and the
robustness of the algorithm is demonstrated by following the evolution of
unstable generalized polytropes. Finally, the empirically based moment analysis
which leads to the uncorrelated basis is an ideal tool for investigating
structure and modes in n-body simulations and an example is provided.
