We theoretically demonstrate unusual features of superconducting proximity
effect in gapped graphene which presents a pseudospin symmetry-broken
ferromagnet with a net pseudomagnetization. We find that the presence of a band
gap makes the Andreev conductance of graphene superconductor/pseudoferromagnet
(S/PF) junction to behave similar to that of a graphene
ferromagnet-superconductor junction. The energy gap $\Delta_N$ enhance the
pseudospin inverted Andreev conductance of S/PF junction to reach a limiting
maximum value for $\Delta_N\gg \mu$, which depending on the bias voltage can be
larger than the value for the corresponding junction with no energy gap. We
further demonstrate a damped-oscillatory behavior for the local density of
states of the PF region of S/PF junction and a long-range crossed Andreev
reflection process in PF/S/PF structure with antiparallel alignment of
pseudomagnetizations of PFs, which confirm that, in this respect, the gapped
normal graphene behaves like a ferromagnetic graphene.
