We present new pre-maximum and late-time optical photometry of the Type
Ia/IIn supernova 2002ic. These observations are combined with the published
V-band magnitudes of Hamuy et al. (2003) and the VLT spectrophotometry of Wang
et al. (2004) to construct the most extensive light curve to date of this
unusual supernova. The observed flux at late time is significantly higher
relative to the flux at maximum than that of any other observed Type Ia
supernova and continues to fade very slowly a year after explosion. Our
analysis of the light curve suggests that a non-Type Ia supernova component
becomes prominent $\sim20$ days after explosion. Modeling of the non-Type Ia
supernova component as heating from the shock interaction of the supernova
ejecta with pre-existing circumstellar material suggests the presence of a
$\sim1.7 10^{15}$ cm gap or trough between the progenitor system and the
surrounding circumstellar material. This gap could be due to significantly
lower mass-loss $\sim15 (v_w/10 km/s)^{-1}$ years prior to explosion or
evacuation of the circumstellar material by a low-density fast wind. The latter
is consistent with observed properties of proto-planetary nebulae and with
models of white-dwarf + asymptotic giant branch star progenitor systems with
the asymptotic giant branch star in the proto-planetary nebula phase.
