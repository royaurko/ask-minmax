The Kamiokande II and IMB data on contained events induced by atmospheric
neutrinos exhibit too low a ratio of muons to electrons, which has been
interpreted as a possible indication of neutrino oscillations. At the same
time, the recent data on upward--going muons in underground detectors have
shown no evidence for neutrino oscillations, strongly limiting the allowed
region of oscillation parameter space. In this paper we confront different
types of neutrino oscillation hypotheses with the experimental results. The
matter effects in $\nu_\mu \leftrightarrow \nu_e$ and in $\nu_\mu
\leftrightarrow \nu_{sterile}$ oscillations are discussed and shown to affect
significantly the upward--going muons.
