We describe a method for inverting Gentzen's cut-elimination in classical
first-order logic. Our algorithm is based on first computign a compressed
representation of the terms present in the cut-free proof and then cut-formulas
that realize such a compression. Finally, a proof using these cut-formulas is
constructed. This method allows an exponential compression of proof length. It
can be applied to the output of automated theorem provers, which typically
produce analytic proofs. An implementation is available on the web and
described in this paper.
