The characteristics of topological insulators are manifested in both their
surface and bulk properties, but the latter remain to be explored. Here we
report bulk signatures of pressure-induced band inversion and topological phase
transitions in Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se ($x=$0.00, 0.15, and 0.23). The results of
infrared measurements as a function of pressure indicate the closing and the
reopening of the band gap as well as a maximum in the free carrier spectral
weight. The enhanced density of states near the band gap in the topological
phase give rise to a steep interband absorption edge. The change of density of
states also yields a maximum in the pressure dependence of the Fermi level.
Thus our conclusive results provide a consistent picture of pressure-induced
topological phase transitions and highlight the bulk origin of the novel
properties in topological insulators.
