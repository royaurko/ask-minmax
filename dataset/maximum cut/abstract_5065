Virtual fermionic N_f = 1 and N_f = 2 contributions to Bhabha scattering are
combined with realistic real corrections at next-to-next-to-leading order in
QED. The virtual corrections are determined by the package bha_nnlo_hf, and
real corrections with the Monte Carlo generators Bhagen-1Ph, Helac-Phegas and
Ekhara. Numerical results are discussed at the energies of and with realistic
cuts used at the Phi factory DAFNE, at the B factories PEP-II and KEK, and at
the charm/tau factory BEPC II. We compare these complete calculations with the
approximate ones realized in the generator BabaYaga@NLO used at meson factories
to evaluate their luminosities. For realistic reference event selections we
find agreement for the NNLO leptonic and hadronic corrections within 0.07% or
better and conclude that they are well accounted for in the generator by
comparison with the present experimental accuracy.
