We demonstrate atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) high-k dielectric integration on
two-dimensional (2D) layer-structured molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) crystals and
MoS2 dual-gate n-channel MOSFETs with ALD Al2O3 as top-gate dielectric. Our C-V
study of MOSFET structures shows good interface between 2D MoS2 crystal and ALD
Al2O3. Maximum drain currents using back-gates and top-gates are measured to be
7.07mA/mm and 6.42mA/mm at Vds=2V with a channel width of 3 {\mu}m, a channel
length of 9 {\mu}m, and a top-gate length of 3 {\mu}m. We achieve the highest
field-effect mobility of electrons using back-gate control to be 517 cm^2/Vs.
The highest current on/off ratio is over 10^8.
