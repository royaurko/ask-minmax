The model dependence of the development of extensive air showers generated by
high-energy cosmic-ray particles in the atmosphere is studied. The increase of
proton-proton and proton-air inelastic cross-sections and values for the
elasticity are varied in the hadronic interaction model QGSJET. Using the
CORSIKA simulation program, the impact of these changes is investigated on air
shower observables like the average depth of the shower maximum X_max and the
number of muons and electrons at ground level. Calculating the mean logarithmic
mass from experimental X_max values, it is found that a moderate logarithmic
increase of the proton-proton inelastic cross-section from sigma_pp^inel=51 mb
at E_0=10^6 GeV to sigma_pp^inel=64 mb at E_0=10^8 GeV and an elasticity,
additionally increased by 10% to 15%, describes the data best. Using these
parameters, the mean logarithmic mass lna derived from X_max measurements is
compatible with the extrapolations of the results of direct measurements to
high energies using the poly-gonato model.
