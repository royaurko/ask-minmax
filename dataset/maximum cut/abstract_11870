We study the thermodynamic properties of a semiflexible polymer confined
inside strips of widths L<=9 defined on a square lattice. The polymer is
modeled as a self-avoiding walk and a short range interaction between the
monomers and the walls is included through an energy e associated to each
monomer placed on one of the walls. Also, an additional energy is associated to
each elementary bend of the walk. The free energy of the model is obtained
exactly through a transfer matrix formalism. The profile of the monomer density
and the force on the walls are obtained. We notice that as the bending energy
is decreased, the range of values of e for which the density profile is neither
convex nor concave increases, and for sufficiently attracting walls (e<0) we
find that in general the attractive force is maximum for situations where the
bends are favored.
