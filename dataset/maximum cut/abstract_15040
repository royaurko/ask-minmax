Constraints are presented on the total width of the recently discovered Higgs
boson, Gamma[H], using its relative on-shell and off-shell production and decay
rates to a pair of Z bosons, where one Z boson decays to an electron or muon
pair, and the other to an electron, muon, or neutrino pair. The analysis is
based on the data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012,
corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 inverse femtobarns at a
centre-of-mass energy sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and 19.7 inverse femtobarns at sqrt(s) =
8 TeV. A simultaneous maximum likelihood fit to the measured kinematic
distributions near the resonance peak and above the Z-boson pair production
threshold leads to an upper limit on the Higgs boson width of Gamma[H] < 22 MeV
at a 95% confidence level, which is 5.4 times the expected value in the
standard model at the measured mass.
