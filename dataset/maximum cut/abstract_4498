We further study the correspondence between open semiclassical strings and
long defect operators which is discussed in our previous work [hep-th/0410139].
We give an interpretation of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of SO(6)->
SO(3)_H x SO(3)_V from the viewpoint of the Riemann surface by following the
argument of Minahan. Then we use the concrete form of the resolvent for a
single cut solution and compute the anomalous dimension of operators dual to an
open pulsating string at three-loop level. In the string side we obtain the
energy of the open pulsating string solution by semiclassical analysis. Both
results agree at two-loop level but we find a three-loop discrepancy.
