We describe the measurement of anisotropic viscoelastic moduli in complex
soft materials, such as biopolymer gels, via video particle tracking
microrheology of colloid tracer particles. The use of a correlation tensor to
find the axes of maximum anisotropy, and hence the mechanical director, is
described. The moduli of an aligned DNA gel are reported, as a test of the
technique; this may have implications for high DNA concentrations in vivo. We
also discuss the errors in microrheological measurement, and describe the use
of frequency space filtering to improve displacement resolution, and hence
probe these typically high modulus materials.
