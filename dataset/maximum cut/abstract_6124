Effective equation of motion of a rattleback is obtained from the basic
equation of motion with viscous friction depending on slip velocity. This
effective equation of motion is used to estimate the number of spin reversals
and the rattleback shape that causes the maximum number of spin reversals.
These estimates are compared with numerical simulations based on the basic
equation of motion.
