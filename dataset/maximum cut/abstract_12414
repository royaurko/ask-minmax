In this work we argue that, in the interpretation of the energy dependence of
the depth of the shower maximum and of the muon content in high energy cosmic
ray showers ($E > 10^{17}$ eV), other variables besides the composition may
play an important role, in particular those characterising the first (high
energy) hadronic collisions. The role of the inelasticity, of the nature of the
leading particle, and of the particle multiplicity are discussed. A consistent
interpretation of existing data within a string percolation model implemented
in a hybrid, one dimensional simulation method is given.
