We provide conditions that ensure that the recentered maximum of the Gaussian
free field on a sequence of graphs fluctuates at the same order as the field at
the point of maximal variance. In particular, on a sequence of such graphs the
recentered maximum is not tight, similarly to the situation in Z but in
contrast with the situation in Z^2. We show that our conditions cover a large
class of "fractal" graphs.
