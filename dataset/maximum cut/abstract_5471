We present the analysis on our new limits of the dark matter (DM) halo
consisting of primordial black holes (PBHs) or massive compact halo objects
(MACHOs). We present a search of the first two years of publicly available
Kepler mission data for potential signatures of gravitational microlensing
caused by these objects, as well as an extensive analysis of the astrophysical
sources of background error. These include variable stars, flare events, and
comets or asteroids which are moving through the Kepler field. We discuss the
potential of detecting comets using the Kepler lightcurves, presenting
measurements of two known comets and one unidentified object, most likely an
asteroid or comet. After removing the background events with statistical cuts,
we find no microlensing candidates. We therefore present our Monte Carlo
efficiency calculation in order to constrain the PBH DM with masses in the
range of 2 x 10^-9 solar masses to 10^-7 solar masses. We find that PBHs in
this mass range cannot make up the entirety of the DM, thus closing a full
order of magnitude in the allowed mass range for PBH DM.
