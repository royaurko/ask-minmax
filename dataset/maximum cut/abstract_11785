Magnetic phase diagram of NiS2-xSex has been reexamined by systematic studies
of electrical resistivity, uniform magnetic susceptibility and neutron
diffraction using single crystals grown by a chemical transport method. The
electrical resistivity and the uniform magnetic susceptibility exhibit the same
feature of temperature dependence over a wide Se concentration. A distinct
first order metal-insulator (M-I) transition accompanied by a volume change was
observed only in the antiferromagnetic ordered phase for 0.50<x<0.59. In this
region, the M-I transition makes substantial effects to the thermal evolution
of staggered moments. In the paramagnetic phase, the M-I transition becomes
broad; both the electrical resistivity and the uniform magnetic susceptibility
exhibit a broad maximum around the temperatures on the M-I transition-line
extrapolated to the paramagnetic phase.
