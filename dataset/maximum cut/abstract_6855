The performance of Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is studied
analytically for binary symmetric multi-channel Hidden Markov processes. We
reduce the estimation problem to a 1D Ising spin model and define order
parameters that correspond to different characteristics of the MAP-estimated
sequence. The solution to the MAP estimation problem has different operational
regimes separated by first order phase transitions. The transition points for
$L$-channel system with identical noise levels, are uniquely determined by $L$
being odd or even, irrespective of the actual number of channels. We
demonstrate that for lower noise intensities, the number of solutions is
uniquely determined for odd $L$, whereas for even $L$ there are exponentially
many solutions. We also develop a semi analytical approach to calculate the
estimation error without resorting to brute force simulations. Finally, we
examine the tradeoff between a system with single low-noise channel and one
with multiple noisy channels.
