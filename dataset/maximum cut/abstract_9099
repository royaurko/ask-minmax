We investigate the different regimes that emerge when a periodic driving
force, the rocking force, acts on a collective feedback flashing ratchet. The
interplay of the rocking and the feedback control gives a rich dynamics with
different regimes presenting several unexpected novel features. In particular,
we show that for both the one-particle ratchet and the collective version of
the ratchet an appropriate rocking increases the flux. This mechanism gives the
maximum flux that has been achieved in a ratchet device without an a priori
bias.
