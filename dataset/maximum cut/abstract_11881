We discuss a Statistical Mechanics approach in the manner of Edwards to the
``inherent states'' (defined as the stable configurations in the potential
energy landscape) of glassy systems and granular materials. We show that at
stationarity the inherent states are distributed according a generalized Gibbs
measure obtained assuming the validity of the principle of maximum entropy,
under suitable constraints. In particular we consider three lattice models (a
diluted Spin Glass, a monodisperse hard-sphere system under gravity and a
hard-sphere binary mixture under gravity) undergoing a schematic ``tap
dynamics'', showing via Monte Carlo calculations that the time average of
macroscopic quantities over the tap dynamics and over such a generalized
distribution coincide. We also discuss about the general validity of this
approach to non thermal systems.
