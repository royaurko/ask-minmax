We investigate a high frequency turn-over effect in radio spectra for pulsars
with positive or flat spectral index. Using GMRT and Effelsberg observatory, we
estimated the flux density to reconstruct pulsar spectra. We find objects that
have a maximum flux in their spectrum above 1 GHz and whose spectral indices
are positive at lower frequencies. Some pulsars with a turn-over in their
spectrum at high frequencies are found to exist in very interesting
environments. We call these objects gigahertz-peaked spectra pulsars.
