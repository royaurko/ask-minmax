We study the propulsion of a one-dimensional (1D) polymer chain under
sinusoidal external forces in the overdamped (low Reynolds number) regime. We
show that, when hydrodynamical interactions are included, the polymer presents
directional motion which depends on the phase differences of the external force
applied along the chain. Moreover, the velocity shows a maximum as a function
of the frequency. We discuss the relevance of all these results in light of
recent nanotechnology experiments.
