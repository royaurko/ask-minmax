Strong interactions are addressed in connection to extracting |V_{cb}| and
determining heavy quark parameters. A comprehensive approach allows a robust
analysis not relying on a 1/m_c expansion; a percent defendable accuracy in
|V_{cb}| becomes realistic. Some of the heavy quark parameters are already
accurately known. We have at least one nontrivial precision check of the OPE at
the nonperturbative level in inclusive decays. The alleged controversy between
theory and BaBar data on <M_X^2> is argued to be an artefact of oversimplifying
the OPE for high cuts in lepton energy. Consequences of the proximity to the
`BPS' limit are addressed and their accuracy qualified. It is suggested that
theory-wise B->D l\nu near zero recoil offers an accurate way for measuring
|V_{cb}|.
