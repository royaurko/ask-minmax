The Kepler mission has allowed the detection of numerous multi-planet
exosystems where the planetary orbits are relatively compact. The first such
system detected was Kepler-11 which has six known planets at the present time.
These kinds of systems offer unique opportunities to study constraints on
planetary albedos by taking advantage of both the precision timing and
photometry provided by Kepler data to monitor possible phase variations. Here
we present a case study of the Kepler-11 system in which we investigate the
phase modulation of the system as the planets orbit the host star. We provide
predictions of maximum phase modulation where the planets are simultaneously
close to superior conjunction. We use corrected Kepler data for Q1-Q17 to
determine the significance of these phase peaks. We find that data quarters
where maximum phase peaks occur are better fit by a phase model than a "null
hypothesis" model.
