Photoluminescence (PL) measurements of porphyrin-doped single wall carbon
nanotubes (SWNT) were studied in sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (NaDDBS)
aqueous dispersions. The PL spectra were used to draw PL maps were the maxima
corresponds to absorption-emission excitonic processes related to (E11, E22)
first Van Hove singularities of the SWNT electronic structure. The influence of
the net charge of the porphyrin was a determinant factor in the energy map
maximum shifts (EMMS) compared to the energy map of a pristine NaDDBS/SWNT
dispersion. A non-interacting porphyrin is used as a reference to discard the
influence of the dielectric constant of the medium in the EMMS.
