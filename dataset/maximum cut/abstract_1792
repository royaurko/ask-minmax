Here we discuss the possibility of employment of ultrarelativistic electron
and proton bunches for generation of high plasma wakefields in dense plasmas
due to the Cherenkov resonance plasma-bunch interaction. We estimate the
maximum amplitude of such a wake and minimum system length at which the maximum
amplitude can be generated at the given bunch parameters.
