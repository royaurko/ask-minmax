Parton recombination is reconsidered in perturbation theory without using the
AGK cutting rules in the leading order of the recombination. We use
time-ordered perturbation theory to sum the cut diagrams, which are neglected
in the GLR evolution equation. We present a set of new evolution equations
including parton recombination.
