We demonstrate rather interesting manifestations of co-existence of resonance
features in characteristics of the photoionization of 3d-electrons in Xe@C60.
It is shown that the reflection of photoelectrons produced by the 3d Xe
photoionization affects greatly partial photoionization cross-sections of and
levels and respective angular anisotropy parameters, both dipole and non-dipole
adding to all of them additional maximums and minimums. The calculations are
performed treating the 3/2 and 5/2 electrons as electrons of different kinds
with their spins "up" and "down". The effect of C60 shell is accounted for in
the frame of the "orange" skin potential model.
