Scale-free distributions and correlation functions found in financial data
are reminiscent of the scale invariance of physical observables in the vicinity
of a critical point. Here, we present empirical evidence for a transition
phenomenon, accompanied by a symmetry breaking, in the investors' demand for
stocks. We study the volume imbalance $\Omega$ -- difference between the number
of shares traded in buyer-initiated and seller-initiated trades in a time
interval $\Delta t$ -- conditioned on $\Sigma$ which is defined as the local
first moment of $\Omega$ in $\Delta t$. We find that the conditional
distribution $P(\Omega | \Sigma)$ undergoes a qualitative change in behavior as
$\Sigma$ increases beyond a critical threshold $\Sigma_c$. For $\Sigma
<\Sigma_c$, $P(\Omega|\Sigma)$ displays a maximum at $\Omega=0$, i.e., trades
in $\Delta t$ are equally likely to be buyer initiated or seller initiated. For
$\Sigma > \Sigma_c$, $\Omega=0$ becomes a local minimum and two new maxima
$\Omega_{+}$ and $\Omega_{-}$ appear at non-zero values of $\Omega$, i.e.,
trades in $\Delta t$ are either predominantly buyer initiated or predominantly
seller initiated. We interpret these results using a Langevin equation with
multiplicative noise.
