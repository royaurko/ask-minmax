As a first step in the aim of arriving at a differential description of
neutral Higgs boson decays into heavy quarks, $h \to Q {\bar Q}X$, to second
order in the QCD coupling $\alpha_S$, we have computed the $hQ{\bar Q}$
amplitude at the two-loop level in QCD for a general neutral Higgs boson which
has both scalar and pseudoscalar couplings to quarks. This amplitude is given
in terms of a scalar and a pseudoscalar vertex form factor, for which we
present closed analytic expressions in terms of one-dimensional harmonic
polylogarithms of maximum weight 4. The results hold for arbitrary
four-momentum squared, $q^2$, of the Higgs boson and of the heavy quark mass,
$m$. Moreover we derive the approximate expressions of these form factors near
threshold and in the asymptotic regime $m^2/q^2 \ll 1$.
