A high-performance algorithm for searching for frequent patterns (FPs) in
transactional databases is presented. The search for FPs is carried out by
using an iterative sieve algorithm by computing the set of enclosed cycles. In
each inner cycle of level FPs composed of elements are generated. The assigned
number of enclosed cycles (the parameter of the problem) defines the maximum
length of the desired FPs. The efficiency of the algorithm is produced by (i)
the extremely simple logical searching scheme, (ii) the avoidance of recursive
procedures, and (iii) the usage of only one-dimensional arrays of integers.
