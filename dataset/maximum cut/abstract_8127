We present weak-lensing mass measurements of 50 X-ray luminous galaxy
clusters at $0.15\le z\le0.3$, based on high quality observations with
Suprime-Cam mounted on the 8.2-m Subaru telescope. We pay close attention to
possible systematic biases, aiming to control them at the $\lt4$ per cent
level. The dominant source of systematic bias in weak-lensing measurements of
the mass of individual galaxy clusters is contamination of background galaxy
catalogues by faint cluster and foreground galaxies. We extend our conservative
method for selecting background galaxies with $(V-i')$ colours redder than the
red sequence of cluster members to use a colour-cut that depends on
cluster-centric radius. This allows us to define background galaxy samples that
suffer $\le1$ per cent contamination, and comprise $13$ galaxies per square
arcminute. Thanks to the purity of our background galaxy catalogue, the largest
systematic in our measurement is a shape measurement bias of $3$ per cent, that
we measure using custom-made simulations that probe weak shears upto $g=0.3$.
Our individual cluster mass and concentration measurements are in excellent
agreement with predictions of the mass-concentration relation. Equally, our
stacked shear profile is in excellent agreement with the Navarro Frenk and
White profile. Our new LoCuSS mass measurements are consistent with the CCCP
and CLASH surveys, and in tension with the Weighing the Giants (WtG) at
$\sim2\sigma$ significance.
