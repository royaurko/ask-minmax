This paper reports the results of the analysis of the second ROSAT PSPC
survey of M31 performed in summer 1992. We compare our results with those of
the first survey. Within the ~10.7 deg^2 field of view, 396 individual X-ray
sources are detected in the second survey data, of which 164 are new
detections. When combined with the first survey, this result in a total of 560
X-ray sources in the field of M31. Their (0.1 keV - 2.0 keV) fluxes range from
7 x 10^-15 to 7.6 x 10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1, and of these 560 sources, 55 are
tentatively identified with foreground stars, 33 with globular clusters, 16
with supernova remnants, and 10 with radio sources and galaxies (including
M32). A comparison with the results of the Einstein M31 survey reveals 491
newly detected sources, 11 long term variable sources, and 7 possible transient
sources. Comparing the two ROSAT surveys, we come up with 34 long term variable
sources and 8 transient candidates. For the M31 sources, the observed
luminosities range from 4 x 10^35 to 4 x 10^38 erg s^-1. The total (0.1 keV -
2.0 keV) luminosity of M31 is (3.4+-0.3) x 10^39 erg s^-1, distributed
approximately equally between the bulge and disk. Within the bulge region, the
luminosity of a possible diffuse component combined with faint sources below
the detection threshold is (2.0+-0.5) x 10^38 erg s^-1. An explanation in terms
of hot gaseous emission leads to a maximum total gas mass of (1.0+-0.3) x 10^6
M_sun.
