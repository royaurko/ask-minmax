The cutoff method, which cuts off the values of a function less than a given
number, is studied for the numerical computation of nonnegative solutions of
parabolic partial differential equations. A convergence analysis is given for a
broad class of finite difference methods combined with cutoff for linear
parabolic equations. Two applications are investigated, linear anisotropic
diffusion problems satisfying the setting of the convergence analysis and
nonlinear lubrication-type equations for which it is unclear if the convergence
analysis applies. The numerical results are shown to be consistent with the
theory and in good agreement with existing results in the literature. The
convergence analysis and applications demonstrate that the cutoff method is an
effective tool for use in the computation of nonnegative solutions. Cutoff can
also be used with other discretization methods such as collocation, finite
volume, finite element, and spectral methods and for the computation of
positive solutions.
