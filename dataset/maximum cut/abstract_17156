A sequence of nonnegative integers $\pi$ is {\it graphic} if it is the degree
sequence of some graph $G$. In this case we say that $G$ is a
\textit{realization} of $\pi$, and we write $\pi=\pi(G)$. A graphic sequence
$\pi$ is {\it potentially $H$-graphic} if there is a realization of $\pi$ that
contains $H$ as a subgraph.
  Given nonincreasing graphic sequences $\pi_1=(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ and $\pi_2 =
(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$, we say that $\pi_1$ {\it majorizes} $\pi_2$ if $d_i \geq
s_i$ for all $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$. In 1970, Erd\H{o}s showed that for any
$K_{r+1}$-free graph $H$, there exists an $r$-partite graph $G$ such that
$\pi(G)$ majorizes $\pi(H)$. In 2005, Pikhurko and Taraz generalized this
notion and showed that for any graph $F$ with chromatic number $r+1$, the
degree sequence of an $F$-free graph is, in an appropriate sense, nearly
majorized by the degree sequence of an $r$-partite graph.
  In this paper, we give similar results for degree sequences that are not
potentially $H$-graphic. In particular, there is a graphic sequence $\pi^*(H)$
such that if $\pi$ is a graphic sequence that is not potentially $H$-graphic,
then $\pi$ is close to being majorized by $\pi^*(H)$. Similar to the role
played by complete multipartite graphs in the traditional extremal setting, the
sequence $\pi^*(H)$ asymptotically gives the maximum possible sum of a graphic
sequence $\pi$ that is not potentially $H$-graphic.
