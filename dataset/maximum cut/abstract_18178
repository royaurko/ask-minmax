The first limits on the prompt emission from the long gamma-ray burst (GRB)
130427A in the $>100\nobreakspace\rm{GeV}$ energy band are reported. GRB
130427A was the most powerful burst ever detected with a redshift
$z\lesssim0.5$ and featured the longest lasting emission above
$100\nobreakspace\rm{MeV}$. The energy spectrum extends at least up to
$95\nobreakspace\rm{GeV}$, clearly in the range observable by the High Altitude
Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-ray Observatory, a new extensive air shower
detector currently under construction in central Mexico. The burst occurred
under unfavourable observation conditions, low in the sky and when HAWC was
running 10% of the final detector. Based on the observed light curve at MeV-GeV
energies, eight different time periods have been searched for prompt and
delayed emission from this GRB. In all cases, no statistically significant
excess of counts has been found and upper limits have been placed. It is shown
that a similar GRB close to zenith would be easily detected by the full HAWC
detector, which will be completed soon. The detection rate of the full HAWC
detector may be as high as one to two GRBs per year. A detection could provide
important information regarding the high energy processes at work and the
observation of a possible cut-off beyond the $\mathit{Fermi}$-LAT energy range
could be the signature of gamma-ray absorption, either in the GRB or along the
line of sight due to the extragalactic background light.
