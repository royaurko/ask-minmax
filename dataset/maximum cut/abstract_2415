Photoproduction of the Theta+ pentaquark on the proton is analyzed by using
an isobar and a Regge models. The difference in the calculated total cross
section is found to be more than two orders of magnitude for a hadronic form
factor cut-off Lambda > 1 GeV. Comparable results would be obtained for 0.6 <
Lambda < 0.8 GeV. We also calculate contribution of the Theta+ photoproduction
to the GDH integral. By comparing with the current phenomenological
calculation, it is found that the GDH sum rule favors the result obtained from
Regge approach and isobar model with small Lambda.
