We present optical photometry of one Type IIn supernova (1994Y) and nine Type
Ia supernovae (1993Y, 1993Z, 1993ae, 1994B, 1994C, 1994M, 1994Q, 1994ae, and
1995D). SN 1993Y and SN 1993Z appear to be normal SN Ia events with similar
rates of decline, but we do not have data near maximum brightness. The colors
of SN 1994C suggest that it suffers from significant reddening or is
intrinsically red. The light curves of SN 1994Y are complicated; they show a
slow rise and gradual decline near maximum brightness in $VRI$ and numerous
changes in the decline rates at later times. SN 1994Y also demonstrates color
evolution similar to that of the SN IIn 1988Z, but it is slightly more luminous
and declines more rapidly than SN 1988Z. The behavior of SN1994Y indicates a
small ejecta mass and a gradual strengthening of the H$\alpha$ emission
relative to the continuum.
