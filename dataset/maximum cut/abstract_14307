We study the percolation transition of the geometrical clusters in the square
lattice LCCC model (a kinetic opinion exchange model introduced by Lallouache
et al. in Phys. Rev. E 82 056112 (2010)) with the change in conviction and
influencing parameter. The cluster comprises of the adjacent sites having an
opinion value greater than or equal to a prefixed threshold value of opinion
(\Omega). The transition point is different from that obtained for the
transition of the order parameter (average opinion value) found by Lallouache
et al. Although the transition point varies with the change in the threshold
value of the opinion, the critical exponents for the percolation transition
obtained from the data collapses of the maximum cluster size, cluster size
distribution and Binder cumulant remain same. The exponents are also
independent of the values of conviction and influencing parameters indicating
the robustness of this transition. The exponents do not match with that of any
other known percolation exponents (e.g. the static Ising, dynamic Ising,
standard percolation) and thus characterizes the LCCC model to belong to a
separate universality class.
