We discuss modifications of hadron properties in the heat bath extracted from
Euclidian correlation functions and spectral functions r econstructed with the
Maximum Entropy Method. To investigate the cut-off dependencies we perform
simulation on various lattice sizes and present the result of an analytic
calculation of the mesonic spectral functions in the infinite temperature
limit.
