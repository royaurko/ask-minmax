We report on preliminary design studies of a pixel detector for CMS at the
Super-LHC. The goal of these studies was to investigate the possibility of
designing an inner tracker pixel detector whose data could be used for
selecting events at the First Level Trigger. The detector considered consists
of two layers of 20x50x10 um3 pixels at very close radial proximity from each
other so that coincidences of hits between the two layers amount to a track
transverse momentum (pT) cut. This cut reduces the large amount of low-momentum
data expected at SLHC while keeping the tracking efficiency very high for the
high pT tracks. Preliminary results on the performance of such a detector are
presented.
