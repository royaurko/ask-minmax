We have considered the antikaon condensation in a neutron star in the
presence of strong magnetic fields by using the modified quark-meson coupling
(MQMC) model. The structure of the neutron star is investigated with various
magnetic fields and different kaon optical potentials, and the effects of the
magnetic fields for kaon condensation is discussed. When employing strong
magnetic fields inside a neutron star with hyperons and kaon condensation, the
magnetic fields can cause the equation of state to be stiff; thus, a large
maximum mass of the neutron star can be obtained.
