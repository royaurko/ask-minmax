The inelastic portion of the tunnel current through an individual magnetic
atom grants unique access to read out and change the atom's spin state, but it
also provides a path for spontaneous relaxation and decoherence. Controlled
closure of the inelastic channel would allow for the latter to be switched off
at will, paving the way to coherent spin manipulation in single atoms. Here we
demonstrate complete closure of the inelastic channels for both spin and
orbital transitions due to a controlled geometric modification of the atom's
environment, using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). The observed
suppression of the excitation signal, which occurs for Co atoms assembled into
chain on a Cu$_2$N substrate, indicates a structural transition affecting the
d$_z$$^2$ orbital, effectively cutting off the STM tip from the spin-flip
cotunnelling path.
