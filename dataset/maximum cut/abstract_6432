We propose a simple theoretical model for a molecular chemical engine that
catalyzes a chemical reaction and converts the free energy released by the
reaction into mechanical work. Binding and unbinding processes of reactant and
product molecules to and from the engine are explicitly taken into account. The
work delivered by the engine is calculated analytically for infinitely slow
(``pseudo-static'') processes, which can be reversible (quasi-static) or
irreversible, controlled by an external agent. It is shown that the work larger
than the maximum value limited by the second law of thermodynamics can be
obtained in a single cycle of operation by chance, although the statistical
average of the work never exceeds this limit and the maximum work is delivered
if the process is reversible. The mechanism of the energy transductionis also
discussed.
