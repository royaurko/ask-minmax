A significant asymmetry in baryon/antibaryon yields in the central region of
high energy collisions is observed when the initial state has non-zero baryon
charge. This asymmetry is connected with the possibility of baryon charge
diffusion in rapidity space. Such a diffusion should decrease the baryon charge
in the fragmentation region and translate into the corresponding decrease of
the multiplicity of leading baryons. As a result, a new mechanism for Feynman
scaling violation in the fragmentation region is obtained. Another numerically
more significant reason for the Feynman scaling violation comes from the fact
that the average number of cutted Pomerons increases with initial energy. We
present the quantitative predictions of the Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM) for
the Feynman scaling violation at LHC energies and at even higher energies that
can be important for cosmic ray physics.
