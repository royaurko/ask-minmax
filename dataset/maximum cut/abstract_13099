On the ground of the Landau criterion we study the behavior of critical
velocities in a superfluid two-component Bose gas. It is found that under
motion of the components with different velocities the velocity of each
component should not be lower than a minimum phase velocity of elementary
excitations (s_). The Landau criterion yields a relation between the critical
velocities of the components (v_{c1}, v_{c2}). The velocity of one or even both
components may exceed s_. The maximum value of the critical velocity of a given
component can be reached when the other component does not move. The approach
is generalized for a two-component condensate confined in a cylindrical
harmonic potential.
