In this article, we report the measurement of collision-induced loss rate
coefficients \beta_{Li,Rb} and \beta_{Rb,Li}, and also discuss means to
significantly suppress such collision induced losses. We first describe our
dual-species magneto-optical trap (MOT) that allows us to simultaneously trap >
5x10^8 7Li atoms loaded from a Zeeman slower and > 2x10^8 85Rb atoms loaded
from a dispenser. We observe strong interspecies collision-induced losses in
the MOTs which dramatically reduce the maximum atom number achievable in the
MOTs. We measure the trap loss rate coefficients \beta_{Li,Rb} and
\beta_{Rb,Li}, and, from a study of their dependence on the MOT parameters,
determine the cause for the losses observed. Our results provide valuable
insights into ultracold collisions between 7Li and 85Rb, guide our efforts to
suppress collision induced losses, and also pave the way for the production of
ultracold 7Li85Rb molecules.
