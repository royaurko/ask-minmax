Disordered 2D chiral fermions provide an effective description of several
materials including graphene and topological insulators. While previous
analysis considered delta correlated disorder and no ultraviolet cut-offs, we
consider here the effect of short range correlated disorder and the presence of
a momentum cut-off, providing a more realistic description of condensed matter
models. We show that the density of states is anomalous with a critical
exponent function of the disorder and that conductivity is universal only when
the ultraviolet cut-off is removed, as consequence of the supersymmetric
cancellation of the anomalies.
