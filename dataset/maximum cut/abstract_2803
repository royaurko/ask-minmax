We prove that smooth 1-dimensional topological field theories over a manifold
are the same as vector bundles with connection. The main novelty is our
definition of the smooth 1-dimensional bordism category, which encodes cutting
laws rather than gluing laws. We make this idea precise through a smooth
generalization of Rezk's complete Segal spaces. With such a definition in hand,
we analyze the category of field theories using a combination of descent, a
smooth version of the 1-dimensional cobordism hypothesis, and standard
differential geometric arguments.
