We present [OIII]500.7nm and Halpha+[NII] images and long-slit, high
resolution echelle spectra in the same spectral regions of Sa2--237, a possible
bipolar planetary nebula. The image shows a bipolar nebula of about 34" extent,
with a narrow waist, and showing strong point symmetry about the central
object, indicating it's likely binary nature. The long slit spectra were taken
over the long axis of the nebula, and show a distinct ``eight'' shaped pattern
in the velocity--space plot, and a maximum projected outflow velocity of
V=106km/s, both typical of expanding bipolar planetary nebulae. By model
fitting the shape and spectrum of the nebula simultaneously, we derive the
inclination of the long axis to be 70 degrees, and the maximum space velocity
of expansion to be 308 km/s. Due to asymmetries in the velocities we adopt a
new value for the system's heliocentric radial velocity of -30km/s. We use the
IRAS and 21cm radio fluxes, the energy distribution, and the projected size of
Sa2-237 to estimate it's distance to be 2.1+-0.37kpc. At this distance Sa2-237
has a luminosity of 340 Lsun, a size of 0.37pc, and -- assuming constant
expansion velocity -- a nebular age of 624 years. The above radial velocity and
distance place Sa2--237 in the disk of the Galaxy at z=255pc, albeit with
somewhat peculiar kinematics.
