Subcluster interactions within clusters of galaxies produce shocks that
accelerate nonthermal particles. We treat Fermi acceleration of nonthermal
electrons and protons by injecting power-law distributions of particles during
the merger event, subject to constraints on maximum particle energies. The
broadband nonthermal spectrum emitted by accelerated electrons and protons is
calculated during and following the subcluster interaction for a standard
parameter set. The intensity of gamma-ray emission from primary and secondary
processes is calculated and discussed in light of detection capabilities at
radio and gamma-ray energies.
