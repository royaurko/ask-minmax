We consider the following random graph process: starting with n isolated
vertices, add edges uniformly at random provided no such edge creates a copy of
C_4. We show that, with probability tending to 1 as $n \to \infty$, the final
graph produced by this process has maximum degree O((n \log n)^{1/3}) and
consequently size O(n^{4/3}\log(n)^{1/3}), which are sharp up to constants.
This confirms conjectures of Bohman and Keevash and of Osthus and Taraz, and
improves upon previous bounds due to Bollob\'as and Riordan and Osthus and
Taraz.
