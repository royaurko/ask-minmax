Measures of uncertainty and divergence are introduced for interval-valued
probability distributions and are shown to have desirable mathematical
properties. A maximum uncertainty inference procedure for marginal interval
distributions is presented. A technique for reconstruction of interval
distributions from projections is developed based on this inference procedure
