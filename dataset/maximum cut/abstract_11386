We present major and minor axis kinematics out to 2 half-light radii for the
bright (M_B=-16.7) dwarf elliptical FS76, a member of the NGC5044 group. Its
velocity dispersion is 46 \pm 2 km/s in the center and rises to 70 \pm 10 km/s
at half-light radius. Beyond 1R_e the dispersion starts to fall again. The
maximum rotation velocity is 15 \pm 6 km/s, about the value expected for an
oblate isotropic rotator with the same flattening as FS76 (dE1). Hence, FS76 is
the first dE discovered so far that is not flattened predominantly by
anisotropy. Using dynamical models, we estimate the mass-to-light ratio to be
between 3.2 and 9.1, consistent with predictions based on CDM cosmological
scenarios for galaxy formation.
