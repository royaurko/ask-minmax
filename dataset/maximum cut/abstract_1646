Using the maximum-likelihood detector (MLD) of a soliton with timing jitter
and noise, other than walk-out of the bit interval, timing jitter does not
degrade the performance of MLD. When the MLD is simulated with important
sampling method, even with a timing jitter standard deviation the same as the
full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the soliton, the signal-to-noise (SNR)
penalty is just about 0.2 dB. The MLD performs better than conventional scheme
to lengthen the decision window with additive noise proportional to the window
wide.
