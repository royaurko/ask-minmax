Relations between the off thermal equilibrium dynamical process of on-line
learning and the thermally equilibrated off-line learning are studied for
potential gradient descent learning. The approach of Opper to study on-line
Bayesian algorithms is extended to potential based or maximum likelihood
learning. We look at the on-line learning algorithm that best approximates the
off-line algorithm in the sense of least Kullback-Leibler information loss. It
works by updating the weights along the gradient of an effective potential
different from the parent off-line potential. The interpretation of this off
equilibrium dynamics holds some similarities to the cavity approach of
Griniasty. We are able to analyze networks with non-smooth transfer functions
and transfer the smoothness requirement to the potential.
