We explore the effects on nucleosynthesis in Type II supernovae of various
parameters (mass cut, neutron excess, explosion energy, progenitor mass) in
order to explain the observed trends of the iron-peak element abundance ratios
([Cr/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Co/Fe] and [Ni/Fe]) in halo stars as a function of
metallicity for the range $ -4 \le$ [Fe/H] $\le -2.5$. [Cr/Fe] and [Mn/Fe]
decrease with decreasing [Fe/H], while [Co/Fe] behaves the opposite way and
increases. We show that such a behavior can be explained by a variation of mass
cuts in Type II supernovae as a function of progenitor mass, which provides a
changing mix of nucleosynthesis from an alpha-rich freeze-out of Si-burning and
incomplete Si-burning. This explanation is consistent with the amount of
ejected $^{56}$Ni determined from modeling the early light curves of individual
supernovae. We also suggest that the ratio [H/Fe] of halo stars is mainly
determined by the mass of interstellar hydrogen mixed with the ejecta of a
single supernova which is larger for larger explosion energy and the larger
Str\"omgren radius of the progenitor.
