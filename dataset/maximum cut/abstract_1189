We investigate the efficiency at maximum power of an irreversible Carnot
engine performing finite-time cycles between two reservoirs at temperatures
$T_h$ and $T_c$ $(T_c<T_h)$, taking into account of internally dissipative
friction in two "adiabatic" processes. In the frictionless case, the
efficiencies at maximum power output are retrieved to be situated between
$\eta_{_C}/$ and $\eta_{_C}/(2-\eta_{_C})$, with $\eta_{_C}=1-T_c/{T_h}$ being
the Carnot efficiency. The strong limits of the dissipations in the hot and
cold isothermal processes lead to the result that the efficiency at maximum
power output approaches the values of $\eta_{_C}/$ and
$\eta_{_C}/(2-\eta_{_C})$, respectively. When dissipations of two isothermal
and two adiabatic processes are symmetric, respectively, the efficiency at
maximum power output is founded to be bounded between 0 and the Curzon-Ahlborn
(CA) efficiency $1-\sqrt{1-\eta{_C}}$, and the the CA efficiency is achieved in
the absence of internally dissipative friction.
