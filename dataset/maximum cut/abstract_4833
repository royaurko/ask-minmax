We investigate the evaporation history of known transiting exoplanets in
order to consider the origin of observed correlations between mass, surface
gravity and orbital period. We show that the survival of the known planets at
their current separations is consistent with a simple model of evaporation, but
that many of the same planets would not have survived closer to their host
stars. These putative closer-in systems represent a lost population that could
account for the observed correlations. We conclude that the relation underlying
the correlations noted by Mazeh et al. (2005) and Southworth et al. (2007) is
most likely a linear cut-off in the M^2/R^3 vs a^-2 plane, and we show that the
distribution of exoplanets in this plane is in close agreement with the
evaporation model.
