Pion loop fluctuations of the constituent u and d quarks are shown to give
only a minute contribution to the intrinsic charge radius of the neutron, under
the assumption that the pion-quark coupling constant has its conventional
value, with a cut-off scale of the order of 1.0 GeV. The contribution from the
pion loops to the anomalous magnetic moment of the neutron represents a small
($\sim$ 12-14%) increase over of the static quark model value.
