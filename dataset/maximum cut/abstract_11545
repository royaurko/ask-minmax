We have developed a sophisticated model of the radio emission from extensive
air showers in the scheme of coherent geosynchrotron radiation, providing a
theoretical foundation for the interpretation of experimental data from current
and future experiments. Having verified the model through comparison of
analytic calculations, Monte Carlo simulations and historical experimental
data, we now present the results of extensive simulations performed with our
Monte Carlo code. Important results are the absence of significant asymmetries
in the total field strength emission pattern, the spectral dependence of the
radiation, the polarization characteristics of the emission (allowing an
unambiguous test of the geomagnetic emission mechanism), and the dependence of
the radio emission on important air shower and observer parameters such as the
shower zenith angle, the primary particle energy, the depth of the shower
maximum and the observer position. An analytic parametrization incorporating
the aforementioned dependences summarizes our results in a particularly useful
way.
