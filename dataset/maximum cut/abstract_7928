The integrability-based solution of string theories related to
AdS(n)/CFT(n-1) dualities relies on the worldsheet S matrix. Using generalized
unitarity we construct the terms with logarithmic dependence on external
momenta at one- and two-loop order in the worldsheet S matrix for strings in a
general integrable worldsheet theory. We also discuss aspects of calculations
at higher orders. The S-matrix elements are expressed as sums of integrals with
coefficients given in terms of tree-level worldsheet four-point scattering
amplitudes. One-loop rational functions, not determined by two-dimensional
unitarity cuts, are fixed by symmetry considerations. They play an important
role in the determination of the two-loop logarithmic contributions. We
illustrate the general analysis by computing the logarithmic terms in the one-
and two-loop four-particle S-matrix elements in the massive worldsheet sectors
of string theory in AdS_5 x S^5, AdS_4 x CP^3, AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x S^1 and
AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4. We explore the structure of the S matrices and provide
explicit evidence for the absence of higher-order logarithms and for the
exponentiation of the one-loop dressing phase.
