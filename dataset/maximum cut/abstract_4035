By comparing the voltage-current (V-I) curves obtained before and after
cutting a sample of 2H-NbSe2, we separate the bulk and edge contributions to
the transport current at various dissipation levels and derive their respective
V- I curves and critical currents. We find that the edge contribution is
thermally activated across a current dependent surface barrier. By contrast the
bulk V-I curves are linear, as expected from the free flux flow model. The
relative importance of bulk and edge contributions is found to depend on
dissipation level and sample dimensions. We further show that the peak effect
is a sharp bulk phenomenon and that it is broadened by the edge contribution.
