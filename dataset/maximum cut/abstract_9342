We propose and experimentally demonstrate a photonic crystal nanocavity with
multiple resonances that can be tuned nearly independently. The design is
composed of two orthogonal intersecting nanobeam cavities. Experimentally, we
measure cavity quality factors of 6,600 and 1000 for resonances separated by
382 nm; we measure a maximum separation between resonances of 506 nm. These
structures are promising for enhancing efficiency in nonlinear optical
processes such as sum/difference frequency and stimulated Raman scattering.
