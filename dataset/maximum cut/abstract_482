The theta bodies of a polynomial ideal are a series of semidefinite
programming relaxations of the convex hull of the real variety of the ideal. In
this paper we construct the theta bodies of the vanishing ideal of cycles in a
binary matroid. Applied to cuts in graphs, this yields a new hierarchy of
semidefinite programming relaxations of the cut polytope of the graph. If the
binary matroid avoids certain minors we can characterize when the first theta
body in the hierarchy equals the cycle polytope of the matroid. Specialized to
cuts in graphs, this result solves a problem posed by Lov\'asz.
