A detailed analysis of the coupled relativistic kinetic equations for two
domains separated by a hypersurface having both space- and time-like parts is
presented. Integrating the derived set of transport equations, we obtain the
correct system of the hydro+cascade equations to model the relativistic nuclear
collision process. Remarkably, the conservation laws on the boundary between
domains conserve separately both the incoming and outgoing components of
energy, momentum and baryonic charge. Thus, the relativistic kinetic theory
generates twice the number of conservation laws compared to traditional
hydrodynamics. Our analysis shows that these boundary conditions between
domains, the three flux discontinuity, can be satisfied only by a special
superposition of two cut-off distribution functions for the ``out'' domain. All
these results are applied to the case of the phase transition between quark
gluon plasma and hadronic matter. The possible consequences for an improved
hydro+cascade description of the relativistic nuclear collisions are discussed.
The unique properties of the three flux discontinuity and their effect on the
space-time evolution of the transverse expansion are also analyzed. The
possible modifications of both transversal radii from pion correlations
generated by a correct hydro+cascade approach are discussed.
