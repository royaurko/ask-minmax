A multi-pomeron exchange potential (MPP) is proposed as a model for the
universal many-body repulsion in baryonic systems on the basis of the Extended
Soft Core (ESC) bryon-baryon interaction. The strength of MPP is determined by
analyzing the nucleus-nucleus scattering with the G-matrix folding model. The
interaction in $\Lambda N$ channels is shown to reproduce well the experimental
$\Lambda$ binding energies. The equation of state (EoS) in neutron matter with
hyperon mixing is obtained including the MPP contribution, and mass-radius
relations of neutron stars are derived. It is shown that the maximum mass can
be larger than the observed one $2M_{\odot}$ even in the case of including
hyperon mixing on the basis of model-parameters determined by terrestrial
experiments.
