We have studied optical spectra of the symbiotic star Z And, obtained during
its latest outburst started in April 2006, with the aim of finding changes in
the spectrum yielding clues to the nature of the hot component and its
outbursts. The spectroscopic observations of Z And have been made using the
1.5-meter telescope at the Tartu Observatory, Estonia, and processed in a
standard way. We have found high velocity satellites to the hydrogen Balmer
emission lines. Starting from July 30, 2006, weak additional emission
components at velocities of about +/-1150 km/s were detected. Their appearance
near the outburst maximum and similarity to the emission features in another
symbiotic star Hen 3-1341 imply fast collimated outflows from the hot component
of Z And. This finding is consistent with the earlier results by several
contributors that symbiotic stars can emit bipolar jets at certain stages of their
outbursts. A significant decrease in the temperature of the hot component in
initial stages of the outburst was detected by the disappearance of the high
excitation emission line from the spectrum.
