We determine the critical current anisotropy at maximum Lorentz force from
hysteresis loops in a vibrating sample magnetometer. To eliminate the signal of
spurious variable Lorentz force currents it is sufficient to cut the sample to
a specific length, which is calculated from the position dependent sensitivity
of the instrument. The procedure increases the resolution of the measurement
and the results compare well to transport data on the same sample. As the
electric field in magnetisation measurements is lower than in transport
experiments the anisotropy at high currents (low temperatures and fields) can
be measured without the need of making current contacts or any special sample
preparation.
