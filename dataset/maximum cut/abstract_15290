An adaptive delay-tolerant distributed space-time coding (DSTC) scheme with
feedback is proposed for two-hop cooperative multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) networks using an amplify-and-forward strategy and opportunistic
relaying algorithms. Maximum likelihood receivers and adjustable code matrices
are considered subject to a power constraint. In the proposed delay-tolerant
DSTC scheme, an adjustable code matrix is employed to transform the space-time
coded matrices at the relay nodes. Stochastic gradient algorithms are developed
with reduced computational complexity to estimate the parameters of the code
matrix. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms obtain significant
performance gains and address the delay issue in cooperative MIMO systems as
compared to existing DSTC schemes.
