The differential and total cross sections for the d+p->3He+eta reaction have
been measured in a high precision high statistics COSY-ANKE experiment near
threshold using a continuous beam energy ramp up to an excess energy Q of 11.3
MeV with essentially 100% acceptance. The kinematics allowed the mean value of
Q to be determined to about 9 keV. Evidence is found for the effects of higher
partial waves for Q>4 MeV. The very rapid rise of the total cross section to
its maximum value within 0.5 MeV of threshold implies a very large eta-3He
scattering length and hence the presence of a quasi-bound state extremely close
to threshold.
