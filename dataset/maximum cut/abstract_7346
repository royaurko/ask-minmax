The FORTE (Fast On-orbit Recording of Transient Events) satellite records
bursts of electromagnetic waves arising from near the Earth's surface in the
radio frequency (RF) range of 30 to 300 MHz with a dual polarization antenna.
We investigate the possible RF signature of ultra-high energy cosmic-ray
particles in the form of coherent Cherenkov radiation from cascades in ice. We
calculate the sensitivity of the FORTE satellite to ultra-high energy (UHE)
neutrino fluxes at different energies beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK)
cutoff. Some constraints on supersymmetry model parameters are also estimated
due to the limits that FORTE sets on the UHE neutralino flux. The FORTE
database consists of over 4 million recorded events to date, including in
principle some events associated with UHE neutrinos. We search for candidate
FORTE events in the period from September 1997 to December 1999. The candidate
production mechanism is via coherent VHF radiation from a UHE neutrino shower
in the Greenland ice sheet. We demonstrate a high efficiency for selection
against lightning and anthropogenic backgrounds. A single candidate out of
several thousand raw triggers survives all cuts, and we set limits on the
corresponding particle fluxes assuming this event represents our background
level.
