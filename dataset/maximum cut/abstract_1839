We have taken optical and infrared observations during the 2002 outburst of
the soft X-ray transient, 4U 1543-47. A secondary maximum occurs in the
lightcurves during the outburst decline. This feature is much stronger at
infrared wavelengths than optical. We have applied single blackbody, multicolor
blackbody and broken-power law models to the optical/infrared spectral energy
distribution of the secondary maximum and find that the broken power-law
provides the best fit. We therefore conclude that the secondary maximum
emission originates from a jet. We also show the most recent lightcurves of the
2002/2003 outburst of GX 339-4 in which a secondary maximum appears. This leads
us to the conclusion that secondary maxima may be a common occurrence in soft
X-ray transients during outburst decline which appear after the object
transitions into the low-hard state. Infrared observations of such phenomena
will give reliable triggers for multiwavelength observations, allowing us to
greatly improve our knowledge of jet formation and behavior, and how this
relates to the accretion geometry.
