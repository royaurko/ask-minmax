We investigate the effect of the color-flavor locking pairing pattern on the
adiabatic radial oscillations of pure self-bound quark stars using an equation
of state in the framework of the MIT Bag model. We integrate the equations of
relativistic radial oscillations to determine the fundamental and the first
excited oscillation modes for several parameterizations of the equation of
state. For low mass stars we find that the period of the fundamental mode is
typically $\sim 0.1$ ms and has a small dependence on the parameters of the
equation of state. For large mass stars the effect of color-flavor locking is
related to the rise of the maximum mass with increasing $\Delta$. As for
unpaired quark stars, the period of the fundamental mode becomes divergent at
the maximum mass but now the divergence is shifted to large masses for large
values of the pairing gap $\Delta$. As a consequence, the oscillation period is
strongly affected by color superconductivity for stars with $M \gtrsim 1.5 \;
\textrm{M}_{\odot}$. We fit the period of the fundamental mode with appropriate
analytical functions of the gravitational redshift of the star and the pairing
gap $\Delta$. We further discuss the excitation and damping of the modes and
their potential detectability during violent transient phenomena.
