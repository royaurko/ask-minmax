A cut set is a collection of component failure modes that could lead to a
system failure. Cut Set Analysis (CSA) is applied to critical systems to
identify and rank system vulnerabilities at design time. Model checking tools
have been used to automate the generation of minimal cut sets but are generally
based on checking reachability of system failure states. This paper describes a
new approach to CSA using a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) model checker called BT
Analyser that supports the generation of multiple counterexamples. The approach
enables a broader class of system failures to be analysed, by generalising from
failure state formulae to failure behaviours expressed in LTL. The traditional
approach to CSA using model checking requires the model or system failure to be
modified, usually by hand, to eliminate already-discovered cut sets, and the
model checker to be rerun, at each step. By contrast, the new approach works
incrementally and fully automatically, thereby removing the tedious and
error-prone manual process and resulting in significantly reduced computation
time. This in turn enables larger models to be checked. Two different
strategies for using BT Analyser for CSA are presented. There is generally no
single best strategy for model checking: their relative efficiency depends on
the model and property being analysed. Comparative results are given for the
A320 hydraulics case study in the Behavior Tree modelling language.
