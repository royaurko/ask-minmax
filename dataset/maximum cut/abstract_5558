We solve the BFKL equation in the leading logarithmic approximation
numerically in the Yang-Mills theory with the Higgs mechanism for the vector
boson mass generation. It can be considered as a model for the amplitude with
the correct behavior of the $s$-channel partial waves at large impact
parameters. The Pomeron spectrum of the massive BFKL kernel in the
$\omega$-space for $t=0$ coincides with the continuous spectrum for the
massless case although the density of its eigenvalues is two times smaller for
$\omega >\omega _0$, where $\omega_0$ is a negative number. We find a simple
parametrization for the corresponding eigenfunctions. Because the leading
singularity in the $\omega$-plane in this Higgs model for $t=0$ is a fixed cut,
the Regge pole contributions could be only for non-physical positive $t$. Hence
we can state that the correct behaviour at large $b$ does not influence the
main properties of the BFKL equation.
