We report on a ~37-ks XMM-Newton observation of the intermediate polar FO
Aquarii, presenting X-ray and UV data from the EPIC and OM cameras. We find
that the system has changed from its previously reported state of disc-overflow
accretion to one of purely disc-fed accretion. We detect the previously
reported `notch' feature in the X-ray spin pulse, and explain it as a partial
occultation of the upper accretion pole. Maximum flux of the quasi-sinusoidal
UV pulse coincides with the notch, in keeping with this idea. However, an
absorption dip owing to the outer accretion curtains occurs 0.27 later than the
expected phase, which implies that the accretion curtains are twisted, trailing
the magnetic poles. This result is the opposite of that reported in PQ Gem,
where accreting field lines were found to lead the pole. We discuss how such
twists relate to the accretion torques and thus the observed period changes of
the white dwarfs, but find no simple connection.
