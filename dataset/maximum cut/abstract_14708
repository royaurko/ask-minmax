In this paper we study Ollivier's coarse Ricci-curvature for graphs, and
obtain exact formulas for the Ricci-curvature for bipartite graphs and for the
graphs with girth at least 5. These are the first formulas for Ricci-curvature
which hold for a wide class of graphs. We also obtain a general lower bound on
the Ricci-curvature involving the size of the maximum matching in an
appropriate subgraph. As a consequence, we characterize Ricci-flat graphs of
girth 5, and give the first necessary and sufficient condition for the
structure of Ricci-flat regular graphs of girth 4. Finally, we obtain the
asymptotic Ricci-curvature of random bipartite graphs $G(n,n, p)$ and random
graphs $G(n, p)$, in various regimes of $p$.
