We investigate the initial-boundary value problem for linearized
gravitational theory in harmonic coordinates. Rigorous techniques for
hyperbolic systems are applied to establish well-posedness for various
reductions of the system into a set of six wave equations. The results are used
to formulate computational algorithms for Cauchy evolution in a 3-dimensional
bounded domain. Numerical codes based upon these algorithms are shown to
satisfy tests of robust stability for random constraint violating initial data
and random boundary data; and shown to give excellent performance for the
evolution of typical physical data. The results are obtained for plane
boundaries as well as piecewise cubic spherical boundaries cut out of a
Cartesian grid.
