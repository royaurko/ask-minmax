We analytically calculate the spatial nonlocal pair correlation function for
an interacting uniform 1D Bose gas at finite temperature and propose an
experimental method to measure nonlocal correlations. Our results span six
different physical realms, including the weakly and strongly interacting
regimes. We show explicitly that the characteristic correlation lengths are
given by one of four length scales: the thermal de Broglie wavelength, the mean
interparticle separation, the healing length, or the phase coherence length. In
all regimes, we identify the profound role of interactions and find that under
certain conditions the pair correlation may develop a global maximum at a
finite interparticle separation due to the competition between repulsive
interactions and thermal effects.
