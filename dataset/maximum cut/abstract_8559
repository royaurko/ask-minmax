A report of numerical experiment results on long Josephson junction with one
and two rectangular inhomogeneities in the barrier layer is presented. In case
of one inhomogeneity we demonstrate the existence of the asymmetric fluxon
states. The disappearance of mixed fluxon-antifluxon states when the position
of inhomogeneity shifted to the end of the junction is shown. In case with two
inhomogeneities the change of the amplitude of Josephson current through the
inhomogeneity at the end of junction makes strong effect on the stability of
the fluxon states and smoothes the maximums on the dependence ``critical
current - magnetic field''.
