In this paper, we present the next-to-leading order predictions for diphoton
production in the ADD model, matched to the HERWIG parton shower using the
MC@NLO formalism. A selection of the results is presented for d=2-6 extra
dimensions, using generic cuts as well as analysis cuts mimicking the search
strategies as pursued by the ATLAS and CMS experiments.
