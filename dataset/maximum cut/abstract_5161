We solve the ghost-gluon system of Yang-Mills theory using Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs). Working in Landau gauge, we use the Dyson-Schwinger
formalism for the mathematical description as this approach is well-suited to
directly benefit from the computing power of the GPUs. With the help of a
Chebyshev expansion for the dressing functions and a subsequent appliance of a
Newton-Raphson method, the non-linear system of coupled integral equations is
linearized. The resulting Newton matrix is generated in parallel using OpenMPI
and CUDA(TM). Our results show, that it is possible to cut down the run time by
two orders of magnitude as compared to a sequential version of the code. This
makes the proposed techniques well-suited for Dyson-Schwinger calculations on
more complicated systems where the Yang-Mills sector of QCD serves as a
starting point. In addition, the computation of Schwinger functions using GPU
devices is studied.
