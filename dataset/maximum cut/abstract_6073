This paper considers two-dimensional stably stratified steady periodic
gravity water waves with surface profiles monotonic between crests and troughs.
We provide sufficient conditions under which such waves are necessarily
symmetric. This is done by first exploiting some elliptic structure in the
governing equations to show that, in certain size regimes, a maximum principle
holds. This then forms the basis for a method of moving planes argument.
