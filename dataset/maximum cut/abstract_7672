We have earlier proposed the idea of making card drawing experiment of which
outcome potentially decides whether Large Hadron Collider (LHC for short)
should be closed or not. The purpose is to test theoretical models which, like
e.g. our own model that has an imaginary part of the action with much a similar
form to that of the real part. The imaginary part has influence on the initial
conditions not only in the past but even from the future. It was speculated
that all accelerators producing large amounts of Higgs particles like the
Superconducting Super Collider (SSC for short) would call for initial
conditions to have been so arranged as to finally not allow these accelerators
to come to work. If there were such effects we could perhaps provoke a very
clear cut "miracle" by having the effect make the drawn card be the one closing
LHC. Here we shall, however, discuss that a total closing is hardly needed and
seek to calculate how one could perform checking experiment for the proposed
type of influence from future to be made in the statistically least disturbing
and least harmful way.
  We shall also discuss how to extract most information about our effect or
model in the unlikely case that a card restricting the running of LHC or the
Tevatron would be drawn at all, by estimating say the relative importance of
high beam energy or of high luminosity for the purpose of our effect.
