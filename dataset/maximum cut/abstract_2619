We argue that dark matter particles which have strong interactions with the
Standard Model particles are not excluded by current astrophysical constraints.
These dark matter particles have unique signatures at colliders; instead of
missing energy, the dark matter particles produce jets. We propose a new search
strategy for such strongly interacting particles by looking for a signal of two
trackless jets. We show that suitable cuts can plausibly allow us to find these
signals at the LHC even in early data.
