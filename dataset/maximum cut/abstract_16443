In the experiment with the SND detector at VEPP-2M e^+e^- collider the
process $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ was studied in the energy range 2E_0 from
1.04 to 1.38 GeV. A broad peak was observed with the visible mass
$M_{vis}=1220\pm 20$ MeV and cross section in the maximum $\sigma_0\simeq 4$
nb. The peak can be interpreted as a $\omega$-like resonance $\omega (1200)$.
