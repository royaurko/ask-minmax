We present the thermodynamics of a nonlocal chiral quark model with separable
4-fermion interaction for the case of U(3) flavor symmetry within a functional
integral approach. The four free parameters of the model are fixed by the
chiral condensate, and by the pseudoscalar meson properties (pion mass, kaon
mass, pion decay constant). We discuss the T=0 equation of state (EoS) which
describes quark confinement (zero quark matter pressure) below the critical
chemical potential mu_c=333 MeV. The new result of the present approach is that
the strange quark deconfinement is separated from the light quark one and
occurs only at a higher chemical potential of mu_{c,s}=492 MeV. We compare the
resulting EoS to bag model ones for two and three quark flavors, which have the
phase transition to the vacuum with zero pressure also at mu_c. We study quark
matter stars in general relativity theory assuming beta-equilibrium with
electrons and show that for configurations with masses close to the maximum of
stability at M=1.62 ... 1.64 M_{solar} strange quark matter can occur.
