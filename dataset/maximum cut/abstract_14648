We study the properties of charmonium in a strongly coupled QCD-like plasma
at finite momentum. As a basis for this study, a "bottom-up" holographic model
is used which has been previously shown to reproduce charmonium phenomenology
in vacuum and give a reasonable dissociation temperature at zero momentum. The
finite momentum spectral functions are presented and found to be consistent
with recent lattice results. The in-medium dispersion relation and momentum
dependence of decay width of J/Psi have also been studied. We find no signature
of a subluminal limiting velocity from the dispersion relation, while we note
that the dissociation temperature decreases with momentum faster than previous
holographic models. Based upon the dissociation temperature, a maximum momentum
for J/Psi in medium is identified and its phenomenological implications on
J/Psi suppression are discussed.
