In this study, we test the theoretically predicted mass-loss behaviour as a
function of stellar effective temperature across the so-called `bi-stability'
jump (BSJ). We gathered radio observations of 30 OB supergiants (O8-B3). We
derived the radio mass-loss rates and wind efficiencies, and compared our
results with Halpha mass-loss rates and predictions based on radiation-driven
wind models. he wind efficiency shows the possible presence of a local maximum
around an effective temperature of 21~000 K -- in qualitative agreement with
predictions. We also find that the radio mass-loss rates show good agreement
with empirical Halpha rates. However, the empirical mass-loss rates are larger
than the predicted rates from radiation-driven wind theory for objects above
the BSJ temperature, whilst they are smaller for the rest. A new wind
momenta-luminosity relation for O8-B0 stars has been derived.
