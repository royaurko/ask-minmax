Using the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope operating at 1.36 GHz, we have
performed a targeted radio pulsar survey of 289 unassociated gamma-ray sources
discovered by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi satellite and
published in the 1FGL catalogue (Abdo et al., 2010). This survey resulted in
the discovery of millisecond pulsar J1745+1017, which resides in a short-period
binary system with a low-mass companion, Mmin ~ 0.0137 Msun, indicative of
`Black Widow' type systems. A two-year timing campaign has produced a refined
radio ephemeris, accurate enough to allow for phase-folding of the LAT photons,
resulting in the detection of a dual-peaked gamma-ray light-curve, proving that
PSR J1745+1017 is the source responsible for the gamma-ray emission seen in
1FGL J1745.5 + 1018 (2FGL J1745.6+1015; Nolan et al., 2012). We find the
gamma-ray spectrum of PSR J1745+1017 to be well modelled by an
exponentially-cut-off power law with cut-off energy 3.2 GeV and photon index
1.6. The observed sources are known to contain a further 10 newly discovered
pulsars which were undetected in this survey. Our radio observations of these
sources are discussed and in all cases limiting flux densities are calculated.
The reasons behind the seemingly low yield of discoveries are also discussed.
