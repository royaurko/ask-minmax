Recent astronomical observations show that the universe may be anisotropic on
large scales. The Union2 SnIa data hint that the universe has a preferred
direction. If such a cosmological privileged axis indeed exists, one has to
consider an anisotropic expanding Universe, instead of the isotropic
cosmological model. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the cosmic
dipoles in f(R; T) Cosmological Model. the maximum anisotropic deviation
direction is (l, b) = (137,23) or equivalently (l, b) = (317,-23). Our
numerical results show that, using Union2 data, the anisotropic f(R, T) model
provides a significantly better fit than the isotropic f(R, T), CPL, and
{\Lambda}CDM models.
