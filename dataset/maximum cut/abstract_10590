If neutrinos are a significant contributor to the matter density of the
universe, then they should have $\sim$ eV mass and cluster in galactic (super)
cluster halos, and possibly in galactic halos as well. It was noted in the
early 1980's that cosmic ray neutrinos with energy within $\delta
E/E_R=\Gamma_Z/M_Z \sim 3%$ of the peak energy $E_R=4 (eV/m_{\nu})\times
10^{21}$ eV will annihilate on the nonrelativistic relic antineutrinos (and
vice versa) to produce the Z-boson with an enhanced, resonant cross section of
${\cal O}(G_F)\sim 10^{-32}{cm}^2$. The result of the resonant neutrino
annihilation is a hadronic Z-burst 70% of the time, which contains, on average,
thirty photons and 2.7 nucleons with energies near or above the GZK cutoff
energy of $5\times 10^{19}$ eV. These photons and nucleons produced within our
Supergalactic halo may easily propagate to earth and initiate super-GZK air
showers. Here we show that the probability for each neutrino flavor at its
resonant energy to annihilate within the halo of our Supergalactic cluster is
likely within an order of magnitude of 1%, with the exact value depending on
unknown aspects of neutrino mixing and relic neutrino clustering. The absolute
lower bound in a hot Big Bang universe for the probability to annihilate within
a 50 Mpc radius (roughly a nucleon propagation distance) of earth is 0.036%.
  From fragmentation data for Z-decay, we estimate that the nucleons are more
energetic than the photons by a factor $\sim 10$. Several tests of the
hypothesis are indicated.
