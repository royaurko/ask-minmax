To find X-ray bursts from sources within the field of view of the
IBIS/INTEGRAL telescope, we have analysed all the archival data of the
telescope available at the time of writing the paper (the observations from
January 2003 to April 2009). We have detected 834 hard (15-25 keV) X-ray
bursts, 239 of which were simultaneously recorded by the JEM-X/INTEGRAL
telescope in the standard X-ray energy range. More than 70% of all bursts (587
events) have been recorded from the well-known X-ray burster GX 354-0. We have
found upper limits on the distances to their sources by assuming that the
Eddington luminosity limit was reached at the brightness maximum of the
brightest bursts.
