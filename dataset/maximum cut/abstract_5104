We present an implementation of the model of minimal universal extra
dimensions (MUED) in CalcHEP/CompHEP. We include all level-1 and level-2
Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles outside the Higgs sector. The mass spectrum is
automatically calculated at one loop in terms of the two input parameters in
MUED: the radius of the extra dimension and the cut-off scale of the model. We
implement both the KK number conserving and the KK number violating
interactions of the KK particles. We also account for the proper running of the
gauge coupling constants above the electroweak scale. The implementation has
been extensively cross-checked against known analytical results in the
literature and numerical results from other programs. Our files are publicly
available and can be used to perform various automated calculations within the
MUED model.
