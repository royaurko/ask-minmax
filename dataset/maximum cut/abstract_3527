The out-degree distribution of citation networks is investigated. Statistical
data of the number of papers cited within a paper (out-degree) for different
journals in the period 1991-1999 is reported. The out-degree distribution is
characterized by a maximum at intermediate out-degrees. At the left of the
maximum there are strong fluctuations from journal to journal while is quite
universal at the right, with two classes of journals. These two classes are
associated with the existence or not of a restriction in the maximum number of
pages per paper. The shape of the out-degree distribution does not change
appreciable from period to period, but the average out-degree is observed to
increase logarithmically with the number of published papers. These features
are modeled using a recursive search model.
