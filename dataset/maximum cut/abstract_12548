We study a generalized Ginzburg-Landau equation that models a sample formed
of a superconducting/normal junction and which is not submitted to an applied
magnetic field. We prove the existence of a unique positive (and bounded)
solution of this equation. In the particular case when the domain is the entire
plane, we determine the explicit expression of the solution (and we find that
it satisfies a Robin (de Gennes) boundary condition on the boundary of the
superconducting side). Using the result of the entire plane, we determine for
the case of general domains, the asymptotic behavior of the solution for large
values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The main tools are Hopf's Lemma, the
Strong Maximum Principle, elliptic estimates and Agmon type estimates.
