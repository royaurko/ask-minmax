In this article, it has been theoretically shown that broad angle negative
refraction is possible with asymmetric anisotropic metamaterials constructed by
only dielectrics or loss less semiconductors at the telecommunication and
relative wavelength range. Though natural uniaxial materials can exhibit
negative refraction, the maximum angle of negative refraction and critical
incident angle lie in a very narrow range. This notable problem can be overcome
by our proposed structure. In our structures, negative refraction originates
from the highly asymmetric elliptical iso-frequency.This is artificially
created by the rotated multilayer sub-wavelength dielectric/semiconductor
stack, which act as an effective asymmetric anisotropic metamaterial.This
negative refraction is achieved without using any negative permittivity
materials such as metals. As we are using simple dielectrics, fabrication of
such structures would be less complex than that of the metal based
metamaterials. Our proposed ideas have been validated numerically and also by
the full wave simulations considering both the effective medium approach and
realistic structure model. This device might find some important applications
in photonics and optoelectronics.
