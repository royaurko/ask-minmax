Previously it was shown that gravitation theory allows the existance of
supermassive stable compact configurations of the degenerated electronic gas
(L.V.Verozub, Astr. Nacr. 317 (1996) 107) without events horizon. In the
present paper the simplest model of such kind of objects in gas environment
has been considered. It is shown that at the spherically symmetric accretion
onto the object the luminosity is about $10^{37} erg/s$ for the mass accretion
rate of the order of $\stackrel{\cdot}{M}=10^{-6} M_{\odot}/year$. The
wavelength of the radiation maximum is about $400\div 500\stackrel{\circ}{A}$.
There is an ionization zone around the central objects with the radius about
$10^{-3}pc$.
