Biopolymers are characterized by heterogeneous interactions, and usually
perform their biological tasks forming contacts within domains of limited size.
Combining polymer theory with a replica approach, we study the scaling
properties of the probability of contact formation in random heteropolymers as
a function of their linear distance. It is found that close or above the
theta--point, it is possible to define a contact probability which is typical
(i.e. "self-averaging") for different realizations of the heterogeneous
interactions, and which displays an exponential cut--off, dependent on
temperature and on the interaction range. In many cases this cut--off is
comparable with the typical sizes of domains in biopolymers. While it is well
known that disorder causes interesting effects at low temperature, the behavior
elucidated in the present study is an example of a non--trivial effect at high
temperature.
