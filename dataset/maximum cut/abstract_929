The merger of binary neutron stars is likely to lead to differentially
rotating remnants. In this paper we numerically construct models of
differentially rotating neutron stars in general relativity and determine their
maximum allowed mass. We model the stars adopting a polytropic equation of
state and tabulate maximum allowed masses as a function of differential
rotation and stiffness of the equation of state. We also provide a crude
argument that yields a qualitative estimate of the effect of stiffness and
differential rotation on the maximum allowed mass.
