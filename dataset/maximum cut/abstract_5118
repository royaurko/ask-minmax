We report on our experimental work concerning a planar metamaterial
exhibiting classical electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Using a
structure with two mirrored split-ring resonators as the dark element and a cut
wire as the radiative element, we demonstrate that an EIT-like resonance can be
achieved without breaking the symmetry of the structure. The mirror symmetry of
the metamaterial's structural element results in a selection rule inhibiting
magnetic dipole radiation for the dark element, and the increased quality
factor leads to low absorption (<10%) and large group index (of the order of
30).
