We present the properties of spectrum of radiation emitted during
gravitational collapse in which electromagnetic field strengths rise over the
critical value for $e^+e^-$ pair creation. A drift from soft to a hard energy
and a high energy cut off have been found; a comparison with a pure black body
spectrum is outlined.
