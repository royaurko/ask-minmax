We report on the effect of organic acid capping on the behavior of magnetite
nanoparticles. The nanoparticles of magnetite were obtained using microwave
activated process, and the magnetic properties as well as the electron magnetic
resonance behavior were studied for the Fe3O4 nanoparticles capped with alginic
acid. The capped nanoparticles exhibit improved crystalline structure of the
surface which leads to an enhanced magnetization. The saturation magnetization
Ms increases to ~75% of the bulk magnetization. The improved structure also
facilitates quantization of spin-wave spectrum in the finite size nanoparticles
and this in turn is responsible for unconventional behavior at low
temperatures. In magnetic resonance these anomalies are manifested as an
unusual increase in the resonant field Hr(T) and also as a maximum of the
spectroscopic splitting geff parameter at low temperatures. The unconventional
behavior of the nanoparticles also leads to pronounced upturn of magnetization
at low temperatures and a deviation from the Bloch law M(T) T^3/2.
