We present preliminary results of a maximum-likelihood Dalitz-plot analysis
of the charmless hadronic B decays to the final states pi pi pi and K pi pi
from data corresponding to an integrated on-resonance luminosity of 166 fb^-1
recorded by the BABAR experiment at the SLAC PEP-II asymmetric-energy B
Factory. We measure the total branching fractions B(B -> pi pi pi) = (16.2 +-
2.1 +- 1.3) x 10^-6 and B(B -> K pi pi) = (61.4 +- 2.4 +- 4.5) x 10^-6, and
provide fit fractions and phases for intermediate resonance states.
