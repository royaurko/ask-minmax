One of the most important and uncertain stages in the binary evolution is the
common envelope (CE) event. Significant attention has been devoted in the
literature so far to the energy balance during the CE event, expected to
determine the outcome. However this question is intrinsically coupled with the
problem of what is left from the donor star after the CE and its immediate
evolution. In this paper we argue that an important stage has been overlooked:
post-CE remnant thermal readjustment phase. We propose a methodology for
unambiguously defining the post-CE remnant mass after it has been thermally
readjusted, namely by calling the core boundary the radius in the hydrogen
shell corresponding to the local maximum of the sonic velocity. We argue that
the important consequences of the thermal readjustment phase are: (i) a change
in the energy budget requirement for the CE binaries and (ii) a companion
spin-up and chemical enrichment, as a result of the mass transfer that occurs
during the remnant thermal readjustment (TR). More CE binaries are expected to
merge. If the companion is a neutron star, it will be mildly recycled during
the TR phase. The mass transfer during the TR phase is much stronger than the
accretion rate during the common envelope, and therefore satisfies the
condition for a hypercritical accretion better. We also argue that the TR phase
is responsible for a production of mildly recycled pulsars in double neutron
stars.
