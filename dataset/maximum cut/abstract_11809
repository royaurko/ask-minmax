In three-dimensional trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), described by the
time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii-Ginzburg equation, we study the effect of
initial conditions on stability using a Gaussian variational approach and exact
numerical simulations. We also discuss the validity of the criterion for
stability suggested by Vakhitov and Kolokolov. The maximum initial chirp
(initial focusing defocusing of cloud) that can lead a stable condensate to
collapse even before the number of atoms reaches its critical limit is obtained
for several specific cases. When we consider two- and three-body nonlinear
terms, with negative cubic and positive quintic terms, we have the conditions
for the existence of two phases in the condensate. In this case, the magnitude
of the oscillations between the two phases are studied considering sufficient
large initial chirps. The occurrence of collapse in a BEC with repulsive
two-body interaction is also shown to be possible.
