Upper limits for the mass-radius ratio are derived for arbitrary general
relativistic matter distributions in the presence of a cosmological constant.
General restrictions for the red shift and total energy (including the
gravitational contribution) for compact objects in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter
geometry are also obtained in terms of the cosmological constant and of the
mean density of the star.
