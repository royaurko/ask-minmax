There is a sequence of random numbers x1,x2, ..., xn and so on. Numbers are
independent of each other, but all numbers are from the same continuous
distribution. If x1 < x2 > x3, then x2 is a local maximum. Here, we show that
the probability mass function (PMF) of idstribution of distances between local
maxima is non-parametric and the same for any probability distribution of
random numbers in the sequence, and that the average distance is exactly 3. We
present a method of computation of this PMF and its table for distances betwen
2 and 29. This PMF is confirmed to match distance distributions of sample
random number sequences, which were created by pseudo-random number generators
or obtained from "true" random number sources.
