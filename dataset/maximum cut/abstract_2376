By using cutting strips and transformations on outside decompositions of a
skew diagram, we show that the Giambelli type matrices of a skew Schur function
are stably equivalent to each other over symmetric functions. As a consequence,
the Jacobi-Trudi matrix and the dual Jacobi-Trudi matrix are stably equivalent
over symmetric functions. This gives an affirmative answer to an open problem
posed by Kuperberg.
