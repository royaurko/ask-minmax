We showed in another paper [arXiv:1103.1759] that every connected graph can
be realized as the cut locus of some point on some riemannian surface $S$.
Here, criteria for the orientability of $S$ are given, and are applied to
classify the distinct, orientable, cut locus structures on graphs with four
generating cycles.
