We consider evolution of interstellar clouds in Local Group dwarf spheroidal
galaxies (dSphs) in the context of their observed star formation histories. The
Local Group dSphs generally experienced initial bursts of star formations in
their formation epochs ($\sim 15$ Gyr ago), when hot gas originating from the
supernovae can make the cold interstellar clouds evaporate. We find that the
maximum size of evaporating cloud is 10 pc. Thus, clouds larger than 10 pc can
survive during the initial star formation. These surviving clouds can
contribute to the second star formation to produce ``intermediate-age ($\sim$
3--10 Gyr ago) stellar populations.'' Assuming that collisions between clouds
induce star formation and that the timescale of the second star formation is a
few Gyr, we estimate the total mass of the clouds. The total mass is about
$10^{4}M_\odot$, which is 1--3 orders of magnitude smaller than the typical
stellar mass of a present dSph. This implies that the initial star formation is
dominant over the second star formation, which is broadly consistent with the
observed star formation histories. However, the variety of the dSphs in their
star formation histories suggests that the effects of environments on the dSphs
may be important.
