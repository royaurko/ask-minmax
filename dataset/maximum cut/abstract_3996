We present results of synthetic spectro-polarimetric diagnostics of radiative
MHD simulations of solar surface convection with magnetic fields. Stokes
profiles of Zeeman-sensitive lines of neutral iron in the visible and infrared
spectral ranges emerging from the simulated atmosphere have been calculated in
order to study their relation to the relevant physical quantities and compare
with observational results. We have analyzed the dependence of the Stokes-I
line strength and width as well as of the Stokes-V signal and asymmetries on
the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we have evaluated the correspondence
between the actual velocities in the simulation with values determined from the
Stokes-I (Doppler shift of the centre of gravity) and Stokes-V profiles
(zero-crossing shift). We confirm that the line weakening in strong magnetic
fields results from a higher temperature (at equal optical depth) in the
magnetic flux concentrations. We also confirm that considerable Stokes-V
asymmetries originate in the peripheral parts of strong magnetic flux
concentrations, where the line of sight cuts through the magnetopause of the
expanding flux concentration into the surrounding convective donwflow.
