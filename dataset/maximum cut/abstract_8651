Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) is applied to glueball correlators at finite
temperature constructed by using 5,500-9,900 gauge field configurations
generated in SU(3) quenched lattice QCD with the lattice parameter beta =
2N_c/g^2 = 6.25 and the renormalized anisotropy a_s/a_t = 4. The results
support the thermal width broadening of the 0++ glueball near the critical
temperature.
