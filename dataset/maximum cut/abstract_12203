Using Monte Carlo simulations and mean field calculations for a cell model of
water we find a dynamic crossover in the orientational correlation time $\tau$
from non-Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures to Arrhenius behavior at low
temperatures. This dynamic crossover is independent of whether water at very
low temperature is charaterized by a ``liquid-liquid critical point'' or by the
``singularity free'' scenario. We relate $\tau$ to fluctuations of hydrogen
bond network and show that the crossover found for $\tau$ for both scenarios is
a consequence of the sharp change in the average number of hydrogen bonds at
the temperature of the specific heat maximum. We find that the effect of
pressure on the dynamics is strikingly different in the two scenarios, offering
a means to distinguish between them.
