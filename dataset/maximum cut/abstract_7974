Extra scalar fields are common in beyond Standard Model (SM) new physics, and
they may mix with the 125 GeV SM-like Higgs boson discovered at the LHC. This
fact suggests possible discovery channels for these new scalar fields with
their decay modes involving the 125 GeV Higgs boson. In this work, we explore
the LHC search potential of the heavy CP-even Higgs boson H in the
two-Higgs-doublet model. We focus on the channel of H decaying to a pair of
light CP-even Higgs bosons h, with two h's decaying to two b jets and diphoton
sequentially. This channel is particularly involved when the relevant cubic
coupling is enhanced. We find such enhancement to be possible when taking a
large CP-odd Higgs mass input for the two-Higgs-doublet model spectrum.
Analogous to the SM Higgs self-coupling measurement, the two b jets plus
diphoton final states are of particular interest due to the manageable SM
background. After performing a cut-based analysis of both signal and background
processes, we demonstrate the LHC search sensitivities for the heavy CP-even
Higgs boson in a broad mass range via the two b jets plus diphoton final
states.
