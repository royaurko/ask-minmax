This paper discusses mixing of chaotic systems as a dependable method for
secure communication. Distribution of the entropy function for steady state as
well as plaintext input sequences are analyzed. It is shown that the mixing of
chaotic sequences results in a sequence that does not have any state dependence
on the information encrypted by them. The generated output states of such a
cipher approach the theoretical maximum for both complexity measures and cycle
length. These features are then compared with some popular ciphers.
