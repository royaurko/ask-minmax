The vector boson fusion process leads to two forward/backward jets (tag jets)
and the produced state, a Higgs boson in this case, moving slowly in the p-p
C.M. frame at the LHC. For the case of Higgs decaying to W+W (W*) with Higgs
mass below 180 GeV, the W bosons have low momentum in the Higgs C.M. For the
case of W leptonic decays, this fact allows for an approximate reconstruction
of the two final state neutrinos. In turn, those solutions then provide
additional kinematic cuts against background.
