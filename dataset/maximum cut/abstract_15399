This paper addresses the problem of event-triggered control of linear
time-invariant systems over time-varying rate limited communication channels,
including the possibility of channel blackouts, which are intervals of time
when the communication channel is unavailable for feedback. In order to design
an effective event-triggered controller that operates successfully even in the
presence of blackouts, we analyze the channel data capacity, which is the total
maximum number of bits that could be communicated over a given time interval.
We provide an efficient real-time algorithm to estimate the channel capacity
for a time-slotted model of channel evolution. Equipped with this algorithm we
then propose an event-triggering scheme, which using prior knowledge of the
channel information, guarantees exponential stabilization at a desired
convergence rate despite intermittent channel blackouts. The contributions are
the notion of channel blackouts, the effective control despite their
occurrence, and the analysis and quantification of the data capacity for a
class of time-varying continuous-time channels.
