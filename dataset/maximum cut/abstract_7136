A metamaterial magnetic flux concentrator is investigated in detail in
combination with a Halbach cylinder of infinite length. A general analytical
solution to the field is determined and the magnetic figure of merit is
determined for a Halbach cylinder with a flux concentrator. It is shown that an
ideal flux concentrator will not change the figure of merit of a given magnet
design, while the non-ideal will always lower it. The geometric parameters
producing maximum figure of merit, i.e. the most efficient devices, are
determined. The force and torque between two concentric Halbach cylinders with
flux concentrators is determined and the maximum torque is found. Finally, the
effect of non-ideal flux concentrators and the practical use of flux
concentrators, as well as demagnetization issues, is discussed.
