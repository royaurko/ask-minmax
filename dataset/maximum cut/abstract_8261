We generalize the maximum likelihood method to non-Gaussian distribution
functions by means of the multivariate Edgeworth expansion. We stress the
potential interest of this technique in all those cosmological problems in
which the determination of a non-Gaussian signature is relevant, e.g. in the
analysis of large scale structure and cosmic microwave background. A first
important result is that the asymptotic confidence limits on the parameters are
systematically widened when the higher order correlation functions are
positive, with respect to the Gaussian case.
