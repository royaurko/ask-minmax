We explore the signature of a cold dark matter compensated void in the quasi
non-linear regime. We find that this void is entirely a cold spot on the
microwave background, in contrast to a non-linear void. On the last scattering
surface(LSS), it appears as either a hot or cold spot depending on where this
surface cuts the void. In addition, because the usual cancellations do not
occur, the void's LSS signature can be very large as it is proportional to
$R/H^{-1}$ rather than $(R/H^{-1})^3$. This implies strict limits for voids on
the LSS.
