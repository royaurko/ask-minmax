Extensive air showers, induced by high energy cosmic rays impinging on the
Earth's atmosphere, produce radio emission that is measured with the LOFAR
radio telescope. As the emission comes from a finite distance of a few
kilometers, the incident wavefront is non-planar. A spherical, conical or
hyperbolic shape of the wavefront has been proposed, but measurements of
individual air showers have been inconclusive so far. For a selected
high-quality sample of 161 measured extensive air showers, we have
reconstructed the wavefront by measuring pulse arrival times to sub-nanosecond
precision in 200 to 350 individual antennas. For each measured air shower, we
have fitted a conical, spherical, and hyperboloid shape to the arrival times.
The fit quality and a likelihood analysis show that a hyperboloid is the best
parametrization. Using a non-planar wavefront shape gives an improved angular
resolution, when reconstructing the shower arrival direction. Furthermore, a
dependence of the wavefront shape on the shower geometry can be seen. This
suggests that it will be possible to use a wavefront shape analysis to get an
additional handle on the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, which is
sensitive to the mass of the primary particle.
