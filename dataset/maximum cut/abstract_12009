Studies of the kinetics of the bias-stress effect are reported for PQT-12
polymer thin film transistors. We associate the bias-stress effect with
bipolaron formation, based on the observation that the stressing rate is
proportional to the square of the hole concentration. The bipolaron formation
rate is measured as a function of temperature, and the thermal dissociation
rate is also deduced from the data. We discuss the hole capture process and
suggest that tunneling through the Coulomb barrier dominates. The temperature
dependence of bipolaron formation and recovery kinetics leads to a maximum in
their formation at about 220 K, and we also find other changes in the
electrical properties near this temperature. A separate bias-stress effect is
observed to operate at much longer time scales, and might be associated with a
different population of bipolarons.
