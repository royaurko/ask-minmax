We present a luminosity function for low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies
identified in the APM survey of Impey et al 1996. These galaxies have central
surface brightnesses in B in the range 22 < mu < 25. Using standard
maximum-likelihood estimators, we determine that the best-fit Schechter
function parameters for this luminosity function (LF) are alpha = -1.42, M* =
-18.34, and phi* = 0.0036, assuming H_0 = 100. We compare these results to
those of other recent studies and find that surveys which do not take account
of the observation selection bias imposed by surface brightness are missing a
substantial fraction of the galaxies in the local universe. Under our most
conservative estimates, our derivation of the LF for LSB galaxies suggests that
the CfA redshift survey has missed at least one third of the local galaxy
population. This overlooked fraction is not enough by itself to explain the
large number of faint blue galaxies observed at moderate redshift under
no-evolution models, but it does help close the gap between local and
moderate-redshift galaxy counts.
