BVRI light curves are presented for 27 Type Ia supernovae discovered during
the course of the Calan/Tololo Survey and for two other SNe Ia observed during
the same period. Estimates of the maximum light magnitudes in the B, V, and I
bands and the initial decline rate parameter m15(B) are also given.
