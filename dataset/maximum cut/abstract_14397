The main result is a version of Morse inequalities for the minimum and
maximum ideal boundary conditions of the de Rham complex on strata of compact
Thom-Mather stratifications, endowed with adapted metrics. An adaptation of the
analytic method of Witten is used in the proof, as well as certain perturbation
of the harmonic oscillator related with the Dunkl harmonic oscillator.
