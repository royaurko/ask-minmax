Reexamination of the amplitude ratios of the photometric and radial velocity
changes of Blazhko RRab stars in their different Blazhko phases shows that a
normal amplitude ratio occurs near the phase of maximum amplitude. Checking the
Fourier parameters of maximum amplitude light curves with different methods
proved, however, that none of these light curves can be regarded as a normal RR
Lyrae type light curve.
