We have calculated the shear viscosity coefficient $\eta$ of the strongly
interacting matter in the relaxation time approximation, where a quasi particle
description of quarks with its dynamical mass is considered from NJL model. Due
to the thermodynamic scattering of quarks with pseudo scalar type condensate
(i.e. pion), a non zero Landau damping will be acquired by the propagating
quarks. This Landau damping may be obtained from the Landau cut contribution of
the in-medium self-energy of quark-pion loop, which is evaluated in the
framework of real-time thermal field theory.
