Here, we propose a clustering technique for general clustering problems
including those that have non-convex clusters. For a given desired number of
clusters $K$, we use three stages to find a clustering. The first stage uses a
hybrid clustering technique to produce a series of clusterings of various sizes
(randomly selected). They key steps are to find a $K$-means clustering using
$K_\ell$ clusters where $K_\ell \gg K$ and then joins these small clusters by
using single linkage clustering. The second stage stabilizes the result of
stage one by reclustering via the `membership matrix' under Hamming distance to
generate a dendrogram. The third stage is to cut the dendrogram to get $K^*$
clusters where $K^* \geq K$ and then prune back to $K$ to give a final
clustering. A variant on our technique also gives a reasonable estimate for
$K_T$, the true number of clusters.
  We provide a series of arguments to justify the steps in the stages of our
methods and we provide numerous examples involving real and simulated data to
compare our technique with other related techniques.
