In this paper we construct a large class of new normal forms for
Levi-nondegenerate real hypersurfaces in complex spaces. We adopt a general
approach illustrating why these normal forms are natural and which role is
played by the celebrated Chern-Moser normal form. The latter appears in our
class as the one with the "maximum normalization" in the lowest degree.
However, there are other natural normal forms, even with normalization
conditions for the terms of the same degree. Some of these forms do not involve
the cube of the trace operator and, in that sense, are simplier than the one by
Chern-Moser. We have attempted to give a complete and self-contained exposition
(including proofs of well-known results about trace decompositions) that should
be accessible to graduate students.
