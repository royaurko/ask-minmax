We report a general class of steady and transient states of granular gases.
We find that the kinetic theory of inelastic gases admits stationary solutions
with a power-law velocity distribution, f(v) ~ v^(-sigma). The exponent sigma
is found analytically and depends on the spatial dimension, the degree of
inelasticity, and the homogeneity degree of the collision rate. Driven
steady-states, with the same power-law tail and a cut-off can be maintained by
injecting energy at a large velocity scale, which then cascades to smaller
velocities where it is dissipated. Associated with these steady-states are
freely cooling time-dependent states for which the cut-off decreases and the
velocity distribution is self-similar.
