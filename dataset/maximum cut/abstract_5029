We consider a (2+1)-dimensional field theory, assumed to be holographically
dual to the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom AdS(4) black hole background, and
calculate the retarded correlators of charge (vector) current and
energy-momentum (tensor) operators at finite momentum and frequency. We show
that, similar to what was observed previously for the correlators of scalar and
spinor operators, these correlators exhibit emergent scaling behavior at low
frequency. We numerically compute the electromagnetic and gravitational
quasinormal frequencies (in the shear channel) of the extremal
Reissner-Nordstrom AdS(4) black hole corresponding to the spectrum of poles in
the retarded correlators. The picture that emerges is quite simple: there is a
branch cut along the negative imaginary frequency axis, and a series of
isolated poles corresponding to damped excitations. All of these poles are
always in the lower half complex frequency plane, indicating stability. We show
that this analytic structure can be understood as the proper limit of finite
temperature results as T is taken to zero holding the chemical potential fixed.
