We prove that a four-dimensional gradient shrinking Ricci soliton with
$\delta W^{\pm}=0$ is either Einstein, or a finite quotient of
$S^3\times\mathbb{R}$, $S^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^4$. We also prove
that a four-dimensional cscK gradient Ricci soliton is either
K\"ahler-Einstein, or a finite quotient of $M\times\mathbb{C}$, where $M$ is a
Riemann surface. The main arguments are curvature decompositions, the
Weitzenb\"ock formula for half Weyl curvature, and the maximum principle.
