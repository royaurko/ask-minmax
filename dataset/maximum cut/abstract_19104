We determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) using
an area of 143 deg^2 from the first three years of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly
(GAMA) survey. The magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r < 19.4 mag
over two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. The GSMF is determined
from a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method.
This efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number density
versus redshift. With H_0 = 70, the GSMF is well described between 10^8 and
10^11.5 Msun using a double Schechter function with mass^* = 10^10.66 Msun,
phi_1^* = 3.96 x 10^-3 Mpc^-3, alpha_1 = -0.35, phi_2^* = 0.79 x 10^-3 Mpc^-3
and alpha_2 = -1.47. This result is more robust to uncertainties in the
flow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower Sloan Digital Sky Survey
main sample (r < 17.8 mag). The upturn in the GSMF is also seen directly in the
i-band and K-band galaxy luminosity functions. Accurately measuring the GSMF
below 10^8 Msun is possible within the GAMA survey volume but as expected
requires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from low
surface-brightness galaxies.
