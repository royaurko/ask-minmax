We present a new map-making method for CMB measurements. The method is based
on the destriping technique, but it also utilizes information about the noise
spectrum. The low-frequency component of the instrument noise stream is
modelled as a superposition of a set of simple base functions, whose amplitudes
are determined by means of maximum-likelihood analysis, involving the
covariance matrix of the amplitudes. We present simulation results with $1/f$
noise and show a reduction in the residual noise with respect to ordinary
destriping. This study is related to \Planck LFI activities.
