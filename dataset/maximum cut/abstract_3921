Based on Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data, we discuss the classification of
the soft X-ray transient Aquila X-1 in the Z/atoll scheme, and the relation of
its kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPO) properties to the X-ray
colors. The color-color diagram shows one elongated ("banana") structure and
several "islands" of data points. The power spectra of the island are best
represented by a broken power-law, whereas those of the banana by a power-law
below ~ 1 Hz plus an exponentially cut-off component at intermediate
frequencies (30-60 Hz). The parameters of these two components change in
correlation with the position of the source in the color-color diagram. Based
on the pattern that the source shows in the color-color diagram and its
aperiodic variability we conclude that Aquila X-1 is an atoll source. We have
also investigated the possible correlation between the frequency of the kHz QPO
and the position of the source in the color-color diagram. The complexity seen
in the frequency versus count rate diagram is reduced to a single track when
the frequency is plotted against hard or soft color.
