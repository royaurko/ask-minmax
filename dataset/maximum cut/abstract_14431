The Abelian Sandpile Model is a discrete diffusion process defined on graphs
(Dhar \cite{DD90}, Dhar et al. \cite{DD95}) which serves as the standard model
of self-organized criticality. The transience class of a sandpile is defined as
the maximum number of particles that can be added without making the system
recurrent (\cite{BT05}). We demonstrate a class of sandpile which have
polynomially bound transience classes by identifying key graph properties that
play a role in the rapid diffusion process. These are the volume growth
parameters, boundary regularity type properties and non-empty interior type
constraints. This generalizes a previous result by Babai and Gorodezky (SODA
2007,\cite{LB07}), in which they establish polynomial bounds on $n \times n$
grid. Indeed the properties we show are based on ideas extracted from their
proof as well as the continuous analogs in complex analysis. We conclude with a
discussion on the notion of degeneracy and dimensions in graphs.
