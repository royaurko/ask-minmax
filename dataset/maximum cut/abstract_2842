The bulk of the cosmic rays up to about 100 TeV are thought to be accelerated
by the 1st order Fermi mechanism at supernova shocks, producing a power-law
spectrum. Both electrons and protons should be accelerated, but their ratio on
acceleration is not well known. Recently, the EGRET instrument on the Compton
Gamma Ray Observatory has observed supernova remnants IC 443 and $\gamma$ Cygni
at GeV energies. On the assumption that the observed gamma-rays are produced by
accelerated particles in the remnants (rather than, for example, from a central
compact object) we model the contributions due to pion production,
bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering on the cosmic microwave, diffuse
galactic radiation, and locally produced radiation fields. In the case of the
same spectral index for both electrons and nuclei, and a cut-off at 80 TeV, we
find that a spectral index of accelerated particles close to 2.4, and a ratio
of electrons to protons in the range 0.2 to 0.3, gives a good fit to the
observed spectra. For lower cut-off energies flatter spectra are possible. We
also investigate the case where the electron spectrum is steeper than that of
nuclei. We discuss the implications of our results for observations at air
shower energies, and for the propagation of cosmic rays.
