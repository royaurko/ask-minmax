Exclusive observables involving Higgs boson in association with jets are
often well suited to study the Higgs boson properties. They are rates involving
cuts on the final state jets or differential distributions of rapidity,
transverse momentum of the observed Higgs boson. While they get dominant
contributions from gluon initiated partonic subprocesses, it is important to
include the subdominant ones coming from other channels. In this article, we
study one such channel namely the Higgs production in association with a jet in
bottom anti-bottom annihilation process. We compute relevant amplitude
$H\rightarrow b+\overline b+g$ up to two loop level in QCD where Higgs couples
to bottom quark through Yukawa coupling. We use projection operators to obtain
the coefficients for each tensorial structure appearing in this process. We
have demonstrated that the renormalized amplitudes do have the right infrared
structure predicted by the QCD factorization in dimensional regularization. The
finite parts of the one and two loop amplitudes are presented after subtracting
the infrared poles using Catani's subtraction operators.
