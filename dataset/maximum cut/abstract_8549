We analyze the interplay of synchronization and structure evolution in an
evolving network of phase oscillators. An initially random network is
adaptively rewired according to the dynamical coherence of the oscillators, in
order to enhance their mutual synchronization. We show that the evolving
network reaches a small-world structure. Its clustering coefficient attains a
maximum for an intermediate intensity of the coupling between oscillators,
where a rich diversity of synchronized oscillator groups is observed. In the
stationary state, these synchronized groups are directly associated with
network clusters.
