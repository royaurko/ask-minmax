The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) Be/X-ray binary pulsar SXP6.85 = XTE
J0103-728 underwent a large Type II outburst beginning on 2008 August 10. The
source was consistently seen for the following 20 weeks (MJD = 54688 - 54830).
We present X-ray timing and spectroscopic analysis of the source as part of our
ongoing Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) monitoring campaign and INTEGRAL key
programme monitoring the SMC and 47 Tuc. A comparison with the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) III light curve of the Be counterpart
shows the X-ray outbursts from this source coincide with times of optical
maximum. We attribute this to the circumstellar disk increasing in size,
causing mass accretion onto the neutron star. Ground based IR photometry and
H-alpha spectroscopy obtained during the outburst are used as a measure of the
size of the circumstellar disk and lend support to this picture. In addition,
folded RXTE light curves seem to indicate complex changes in the geometry of
the accretion regions on the surface of the neutron star, which may be
indicative of an inhomogeneous density distribution in the circumstellar
material causing a variable accretion rate onto the neutron star. Finally, the
assumed inclination of the system and H-alpha equivalent width measurements are
used to make a simplistic estimate of the size of the circumstellar disk.
