We develop a general theoretical framework to analytically disentangle the
contributions of the neutrino mass hierarchy, the atmospheric mixing angle, and
the CP phase, in neutrino oscillations. To illustrate the usefulness of this
framework, especially that it can serve as a complementary tool to neutrino
oscillogram in the study of atmospheric neutrino oscillations, we take PINGU as
an example and compute muon- and electron-like event rates with event cuts on
neutrino energy and zenith angle. Under the assumption of exact momentum
measurements of neutrinos with a perfect e-$\mu$ identification and no
backgrounds, we find that the PINGU experiment has the potential of resolving
the neutrino mass hierarchy and the octant degeneracies within 1-year run,
while the measurement of the CP phase is significantly more challenging. Our
observation merits a serious study of the detector capability of estimating the
neutrino momentum for both muon- and electron-like events.
