Refined one- and two-dimensional models for the nebular spectra of the
hyper-energetic Type Ic supernova (SN) 1998bw, associated with the gamma-ray
burst GRB980425, from 125 to 376 days after B-band maximum are presented. One
dimensional, spherically symmetric spectrum synthesis calculations show that
reproducing features in the observed spectra, i.e., the sharply peaked [OI]
6300\AA doublet and MgI] 4570\AA emission, and the broad [FeII] blend around
5200\AA, requires the existence of a high-density O-rich core expanding at low
velocities ($\lsim 8,000$ km s$^{-1}$) and of Fe-rich material moving faster
than the O-rich material. Synthetic spectra at late phases from aspherical
(bipolar) explosion models are also computed with a two-dimensional spectrum
synthesis code. The above features are naturally explained by the aspherical
model if the explosion is viewed from a direction close to the axis of symmetry
($\sim 30^{\rm o}$), since the aspherical model yields a high-density O-rich
region confined along the equatorial axis. By examining a large parameter space
(in energy and mass), our best model gives following physical quantities: the
kinetic energy $E_{51} \equiv E_{\rm K}/10^{51}$ ergs $\gsim 8 - 12$ and the
main-sequence mass of the progenitor star $M_{\rm ms} \gsim 30 - 35 \Msun$. The
temporal spectral evolution of SN 1998bw also indicates mixing among Fe-, O-,
and C-rich regions, and highly clumpy structure.
