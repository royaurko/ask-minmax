An elementary statistical observation identifies generalizations of the Fuoss
approximation for the probability distribution function that describes ion
clustering in electrolyte solutions. The simplest generalization, equivalent to
a Poisson distribution model for inner-shell occupancy, exploits measurable
inter-ionic correlation functions, and is correct at the closest pair distances
whether primitive electrolyte solutions models or molecularly detailed models
are considered, and for low electrolyte concentrations in all cases. With
detailed models these generalizations includes non-ionic interactions and
solvation effects. These generalizations are relevant for computational
analysis of bi-molecular reactive processes in solution. Comparisons with
direct numerical simulation results show that the simplest generalization is
accurate for a slightly supersaturated solution of tetraethylammonium
tetrafluoroborate in propylene carbonate ([tea][BF$_4$]/PC), and also for a
primitive model associated with the [tea][BF$_4$]/PC results. For
[tea][BF$_4$]/PC, the atomically detailed results identify solvent-separated
nearest-neighbor ion-pairs. This generalization is examined also for the ionic
liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim][BF$_4$]) where the
simplest implementation is less accurate. In this more challenging situation an
augmented maximum entropy procedure is satisfactory, and explains the more
varied near-neighbor distributions observed in that case.
