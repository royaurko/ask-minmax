We study the interaction of electromagnetic (EM) radiation with single-layer
graphene and a stack of parallel graphene sheets at arbitrary angles of
incidence. It is found that the behavior is qualitatively different for
transverse magnetic (or p-polarized) and transverse electric (or s-polarized)
waves. In particular, the absorbance of single-layer graphene attains minimum
(maximum) for p (s) polarization, at the angle of total internal reflection
when the light comes from a medium with a higher dielectric constant. In the
case of equal dielectric constants of the media above and beneath graphene, for
grazing incidence graphene is almost 100% transparent to p-polarized waves and
acts as a tunable mirror for the s-polarization. These effects are enhanced for
the stack of graphene sheets, so the system can work as a broad band polarizer.
It is shown further that a periodic stack of graphene layers has the properties
of an one-dimensional photonic crystal, with gaps (or stop--bands) at certain
frequencies. When an incident EM wave is reflected from this photonic crystal,
the tunability of the graphene conductivity renders the possibility of
controlling the gaps, and the structure can operate as a tunable
spectral--selective mirror.
