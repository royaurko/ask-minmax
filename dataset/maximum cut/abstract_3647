Understanding the dynamics of neural networks is a major challenge in
experimental neuroscience. For that purpose, a modelling of the recorded
activity that reproduces the main statistics of the data is required. In a
first part, we present a review on recent results dealing with spike train
statistics analysis using maximum entropy models (MaxEnt). Most of these
studies have been focusing on modelling synchronous spike patterns, leaving
aside the temporal dynamics of the neural activity. However, the maximum
entropy principle can be generalized to the temporal case, leading to Markovian
models where memory effects and time correlations in the dynamics are properly
taken into account. In a second part, we present a new method based on
Monte-Carlo sampling which is suited for the fitting of large-scale
spatio-temporal MaxEnt models. The formalism and the tools presented here will
be essential to fit MaxEnt spatio-temporal models to large neural ensembles.
