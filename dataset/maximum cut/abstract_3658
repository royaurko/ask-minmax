Maximum likelihood (ML) imputation is a form of multiple imputation (MI) that
draws random imputations conditionally on a maximum likelihood estimate. ML
imputation is simpler and more efficient than the more popular Bayesian
approach to MI which draws imputations from the posterior predictive
distribution. A disadvantage of ML imputation has been the difficulty of
estimating the standard error of the ML imputation point estimate. This paper
derives a simple new standard error formula, then tests it through simulation.
The formula performs well if the fraction of missing information is small to
moderate, but has a negative bias if the fraction of missing information is
large.
