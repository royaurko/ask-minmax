We study the influence of finite kinematic boundaries on the induced gluon
radiation from a fast quark in a finite size quark-gluon plasma. The
calculations are carried out for fixed and running coupling constant. We find
that for running coupling constant the kinematic correction to the radiative
energy loss is small for quark energy larger than about 5 GeV. Our results
differ both analytically and numerically from that obtained by the GLV group
[6]. The effect of the kinematic cut-offs is considerably smaller than reported
in [6].
