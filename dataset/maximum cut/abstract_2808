We study pilgrim dark energy model by taking IR cut-offs as particle and
event horizons as well as conformal age of the universe. We derive evolution
equations for fractional energy density and equation of state parameters for
pilgrim dark energy. The phantom cosmic evolution is established in these
scenarios which is well supported by the cosmological parameters such as
deceleration parameter, statefinder parameters and phase space of
$\omega_\vartheta$ and $\omega'_\vartheta$. We conclude that the consistent
value of parameter $\mu$ is $\mu<0$ in accordance with the current Planck and
WMAP$9$ results.
