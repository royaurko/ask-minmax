In this paper, results of 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations
are reported for the magnetic reconnection of non-perfectly antiparallel
magnetic fields. The magnetic field has a component perpendicular to the
computational plane, that is, guide field. The angle theta between magnetic
field lines in two half regions is a key parameter in our simulations whereas
the initial distribution of the plasma is assumed to be simple; density and
pressure are uniform except for the current sheet region. Alfven waves are
generated at the reconnection point and propagate along the reconnected field
line. The energy fluxes of the Alfven waves and magneto-acoustic waves (slow
mode and fast mode) generated by the magnetic reconnection are measured. Each
flux shows the similar time evolution independent of theta. The percentage of
the energies (time integral of energy fluxes) carried by the Alfven waves and
magneto-acoustic waves to the released magnetic energy are calculated. The
Alfven waves carry 38.9%, 36.0%, and 29.5% of the released magnetic energy at
the maximum (theta=80^\circ) in the case of beta=0.1, 1, and 20 respectively,
where beta is the plasma beta (the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure).
The magneto-acoustic waves carry 16.2% (theta=70^\circ), 25.9%
(theta=60^\circ), and 75.0% (theta=180^\circ) of the energy at the maximum.
Implications of these results for solar coronal heating and acceleration of
high-speed solar wind are discussed.
