In an effort to investigate the link between failure mechanisms and the
geometry of fractures of compacted grains materials, a detailed statistical
analysis of the surfaces of fractured Fontainebleau sandstones has been
achieved. The roughness of samples of different widths W is shown to be self
affine with an exponent zeta=0.46 +- 0.05 over a range of length scales ranging
from the grain size d up to an upper cut-off length \xi = 0.15 W. This low zeta
value is in agreement with measurements on other sandstones and on sintered
materials. The probability distributions P(delta z,delta h) of the variations
of height over different distances delta z > d can be collapsed onto a single
Gaussian distribution with a suitable normalisation and do not display
multifractal features. The roughness amplitude, as characterized by the
height-height correlation over fixed distances delta z, does not depend on the
sample width, implying that no anomalous scaling of the type reported for other
materials is present. It is suggested, in agreement with recent theoretical
work, to explain these results by the occurence of brittle fracture (instead of
damage failure in materials displaying a higher value of zeta = 0.8).
