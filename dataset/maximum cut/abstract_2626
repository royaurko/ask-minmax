We have explored the reconstruction of kinks from the decay of metastable
staus into a gravitino and a stau lepton in the radial region between the outer
layer of the vertex detector and the second central tracking layer. After
applying a cut on track multiplicity, we find a high efficiency for such
events, with minimal background from Standard Model processes.
