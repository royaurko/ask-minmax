Although asymptotic analyses of undirected network models based on degree
sequences have started to appear in recent literature, it remains an open
problem to study the statistical properties of directed network models. In this
paper, we provide for the first time a rigorous analysis of directed
exponential random graph models using the in-degrees and out-degrees as
sufficient statistics with binary and non-binary weighted edges. We establish
the uniform consistency and the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood
estimator, when the number of parameters grows and only one realized
observation of the graph is available. One key technique in the proofs is to
approximate the inverse of the Fisher information matrix using a simple matrix
with high accuracy. Along the way, we also establish a geometrically fast rate
of convergence for the Newton iterative algorithm, which is used to obtain the
maximum likelihood estimate. Numerical studies confirm our theoretical
findings.
