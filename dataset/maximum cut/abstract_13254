Single crystals of the Ni-doped FeAs-based superconductor SrFe2-xNixAs2 were
grown using a self-flux solution method and characterized via x-ray
measurements and low temperature transport, magnetization, and specific heat
studies. A doping phase diagram has been established where the
antiferromagnetic order associated with the magnetostructural transition of the
parent compound SrFe2As2 is gradually suppressed with increasing Ni
concentration, giving way to bulk-phase superconductivity with a maximum
transition temperature of 9.8 K. The superconducting phase exists through a
finite range of Ni concentrations centered at x=0.15, with full diamagnetic
screening observed over a narrow range of x coinciding with a sharpening of the
superconducting transition and an absence of magnetic order. An enhancement of
bulk superconducting transition temperatures of up to 20% was found to occur
upon high-temperature annealing of samples.
