Blood Donation and Blood Transfusion Services (BTS) are crucial for saving
people lives. Recently, worldwide efforts have been undertaken to utilize
social media and smartphone applications to make the blood donation process
more convenient, offer additional services, and create communities around blood
donation centers. Blood banks suffer frequent shortage of blood; hence,
advertisements are frequently seen on social networks urging healthy
individuals to donate blood for patients who urgently require blood
transfusion. The blood donation process usually consumes a lot of time and
effort from both donors and medical staff since there is no concrete
information system that allows donors and blood donation centers communicate
efficiently and coordinate with each other to minimize time and effort required
for blood donation process. Moreover, most blood banks work in isolation and
are not integrated with other blood donation centers and health organizations
which affect the blood donation and blood transfusion services quality. This
work aims at developing a Blood Donation System (BDS) based on the cutting-edge
information technologies of cloud computing and mobile computing.
