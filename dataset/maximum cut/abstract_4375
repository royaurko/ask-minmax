We present a study of proton decay in a supersymmetric $ SO(10)$ gauge theory
in six dimensions compactified on an orbifold. The dimension 5 proton decay
operators are absent, but the dimension 6 are enhanced due to the presence of
KK towers. We resum the KK modes up to the cut-off of the theory and find the
rate for the dominant mode $p \to \pi^0 e^{+} $. We explore also the flavour
dependence, due to the different localization of states in the extra dimensions
and find that it is possible to distinguish the model from the usual 4D $
SU(5)/SO(10)$ models.
