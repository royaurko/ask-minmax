We consider the half-filled Hubbard model with a cut-off forbidding momenta
close to the angles of the square shaped Fermi surface. By Renormalization
Group methods we find a convergent expansion for the Schwinger function up to
exponentially small temperatures. We prove that the system is not a Fermi
liquid, but on the contrary it behaves like a Marginal Fermi liquid, a
behaviour observed in the normal phase of high T_c superconductors.
