We make a study of Weinstein functionals, first defined in ~\cite{W}, on the
hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$. We are primarily interested in the existence
of Weinstein functional maximisers, or, in other words, existence of extremal
functions for the best constant of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. The main
result is that the maximum value of the Weinstein functional on $\mathbb{H}^n$
is the same as that on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the related fact that the maximum
value of the Weinstein functional is not attained on $\mathbb{H}^n$, when
maximisation is done in the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb{H}^n)$. This proves a
conjecture made in ~\cite{CMMT} and also answers questions raised in several
other papers (see, for example, ~\cite{B}). We also prove that a corresponding
version of the conjecture will hold for the Weinstein functional with the
fractional Laplacian as well.
