While the OPERA experimental scrutiny is ongoing in the community, in the
present article we construct a toy model of {\it extended Lorentz code} (ELC)
of the uniform motion, which will be a well established consistent and unique
theoretical framework to explain the apparent violations of the standard
Lorentz code (SLC), the possible manifestations of which arise in a similar way
in all particle sectors. We argue that in the ELC-framework the propagation of
the superluminal particle, which implies the modified dispersion relation,
could be consistent with causality. Furthermore, in this framework, we give a
justification of forbiddance of Vavilov-Cherenkov (VC)-radiation/or analog
processes in vacuum. To be consistent with the SN1987A and OPERA data, we
identify the neutrinos from SN1987A and the light as so-called {\it 1-th type}
particles carrying the {\it individual Lorentz motion code} with the velocity
of light $c_{1}\equiv c$ in vacuum as maximum attainable velocity for all the
1-th type particles. Thereby, we treat superluminal muon neutrinos as so-called
{\it 2-nd type} particles carrying the individual Lorentz motion code with the
velocity $c_{2}$ as maximum attainable velocity for all the 2-nd type
particles. For the muon neutrinos mean energy $E_{\nu 2}=17.5$ GeV, claimed
velocity $(v_{\nu 2}-c)/c= 2.48\times 10^{-5}$, and expected finite rest mass
$m_{0}\approx 1eV/c^{2}$, we obtain then $ c_{2}/c\approx 17.5\times 10^{9}$.
