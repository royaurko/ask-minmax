In this work, we consider homogeneous and isotropic FRW model of the
universe, filled with interacting dark matter and dark energy. The dark matter
is chosen as usual in the form of dust while dark energy is holographic in
nature with IR cut off at the Ricci's length and it is in the form of a perfect
fluid with variable equation of state. We have chosen the interaction term of
the following two types: (i) a linear combination of the matter density of the
two fluids, (ii) a product of the two matter densities. For both the choices
the evolution equations are transformed to an autonomous system and the
corresponding critical points are analyzed. Finally, for the first choice of
the interaction term the evolution of the ratio of the energy densities has
been studied from the point of view of the present coincidence problem.
