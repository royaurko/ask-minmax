We present tree-level scattering amplitudes in beta-deformed super Yang-Mills
theory in terms of new generating functions, derived by construction of a phase
operator and application thereof to the N = 4 superamplitudes. The technique is
explicitly illustrated for the MHV and NMHV sectors. Along these lines we
propose a phase representation of the N = 4 superconformal algebra realized on
deformed amplitudes in the planar limit. Validity of the MHV vertex expansion
is proven and a connection to non-planar multi-loop unitarity cuts is
established. Our derivations are also compatible with the related
gamma-deformation.
