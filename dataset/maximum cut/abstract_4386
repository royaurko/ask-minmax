I demonstrate that the correlated angular distributions of final-state
particles in both single-top-quark production and the dominant Wjj backgrounds
can be reliably predicted. Using these fully-correlated angular distributions,
I propose a set of cuts that can improve the single-top-quark discovery
significance by 25%, and the signal to background ratio by a factor of 3 with
very little theoretical uncertainty. Up to a subtlety in t-channel
single-top-quark production, leading-order matrix elements are shown to be
sufficient to reproduce the next-to-leading order correlated distributions.
