Upper limits for the mass-radius ratio and total charge are derived for
stable charged general relativistic matter distributions. For charged compact
objects the mass-radius ratio exceeds the value 4/9 corresponding to neutral
stars. General restrictions for the redshift and total energy (including the
gravitational contribution) are also obtained.
