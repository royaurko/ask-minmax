Temporal evolutions toward thermal equilibria are numerically investigated in
a Hamiltonian system with many degrees of freedom which has second order phase
transition. Relaxation processes are studied through local order parameter, and
slow relaxations of power type are observed at the critical energy of phase
transition for some initial conditions. Numerical results are compared with
results of a phenomenological theory of statistical mechanics. At the critical
energy, the maximum Lyapunov exponent takes the largest value. Temporal
evolutions and probability distributions of local Lyapunov exponents show that
the system is highly chaotic rather than weakly chaotic at the critical energy.
Consequently theories for perturbed systems may not be applied to the system at
the critical energy in order to explain the slow relaxation of power type.
