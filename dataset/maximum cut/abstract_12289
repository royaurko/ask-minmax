In this paper we investigate the possibility of measuring the post-Newtonian
general relativistic gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring effect in the Jovian system
of its Galilean satellites Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto in view of recent
developments in processing and modelling their optical observations spanning a
large time interval (125 years). The present day best observations have an
accuracy between several kilometers to few tens of kilometers, which is just
the order of magnitude of the Lense-Thirring shifts of the orbits of the
Galilean satellites over almost a century. From a comparison between analytical
development and numerical integration it turns out that, unfortunately, most of
the secular component of the gravitomagnetic signature is removed in the
process of fitting the initial conditions. Indeed, an estimation of the
magnitude of the Lense-Thirring effect in the ephemerides residuals is given;
the resulting residuals have a maximum magnitude of 20 meters only (over 125
years).
