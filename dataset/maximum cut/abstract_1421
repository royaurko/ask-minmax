We consider the ``modified Minimal Analytic'' (mMA) coupling that involves an
infrared cut to the standard MA coupling. The mMA coupling is a Stieltjes
function and, as a consequence, the paradiagonal Pade approximants converge to
the coupling in the entire $Q^2$-plane except on the time-like semiaxis below
the cut. The equivalence between the narrow width approximation of the
discontinuity function of the coupling, on the one hand, and this Pade
(rational) approximation of the coupling, on the other hand, is shown. We
approximate the analytic analogs of the higher powers of mMA coupling by
rational functions in such a way that the singularity region is respected by
the approximants.Several comparisons, for real and complex arguments $Q^2$,
between the exact and approximate expressions are made and the speed of
convergence is discussed. Motivated by the success of these approximants, an
improvement of the mMA coupling is suggested, and possible uses in the
reproduction of experimental data are discussed.
