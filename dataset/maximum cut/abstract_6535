We introduce a new graph invariant \Lambda(G) that we call maxmaxflow, and
put it in the context of some other well-known graph invariants, notably
maximum degree and its relatives. We prove the equivalence of two "dual"
definitions of maxmaxflow: one in terms of flows, the other in terms of cocycle
bases. We then show how to bound the total number (or more generally, total
weight) of various classes of subgraphs of G in terms of either maximum degree
or maxmaxflow. Our results are motivated by a conjecture that the modulus of
the roots of the chromatic polynomial of G can be bounded above by a function
of \Lambda(G).
