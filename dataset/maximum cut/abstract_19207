Black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries are important sources of
gravitational waves for second-generation interferometers, and BHNS mergers are
also a proposed engine for short, hard gamma-ray bursts. The behavior of both
the spacetime (and thus the emitted gravitational waves) and the neutron star
matter in a BHNS merger depend strongly and nonlinearly on the black hole's
spin. While there is a significant possibility that astrophysical black holes
could have spins that are nearly extremal (i.e. near the theoretical maximum),
to date fully relativistic simulations of BHNS binaries have included
black-hole spins only up to $S/M^2$=0.9, which corresponds to the black hole
having approximately half as much rotational energy as possible, given the
black hole's mass. In this paper, we present a new simulation of a BHNS binary
with a mass ratio $q=3$ and black-hole spin $S/M^2$=0.97, the highest simulated
to date. We find that the black hole's large spin leads to the most massive
accretion disk and the largest tidal tail outflow of any fully relativistic
BHNS simulations to date, even exceeding the results implied by extrapolating
results from simulations with lower black-hole spin. The disk appears to be
remarkably stable. We also find that the high black-hole spin persists until
shortly before the time of merger; afterwards, both merger and accretion spin
down the black hole.
