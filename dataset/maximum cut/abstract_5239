We have shown, that the possibility of the existence of the mixed phase of
the non-uniform chiral (NCh) and the color superconducting (2SC) ground state
depends significantly on the choice of the parameters and type of the
regularization scheme. Our calculations indicates, that in the 3d cut-off
regularization scheme, the mixed region of the NCh and the 2SC phases exists
for a broad set of NJL model parameters. However, in the Schwinger
regularization scheme, if parameters are fitted to the physical quantities in
the vacuum, then, the mixed region of the NCh and the 2SC phases does not
exists.
