Several algorithms are presented. The standard algorithm generates all N
anticliques of a graph with v vertices in time O(N^v2). It can e.g. be adapted
to calculate the independence polynomial of G, to generate all maximum
cardinality anticliques, or just one maximum anticlique. The latter was
programmed using the Mathematica 6.0 code. For a random (45, 92)-graph G a
maximum anticlique of size 21 was found in 1.344 sec, whereas the "hardwired"
Mathematica command MaximumIndependentSet[G] clocked in at 155838 sec, which is
five orders of magnitude slower.
