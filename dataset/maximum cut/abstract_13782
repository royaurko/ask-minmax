We study the properties of neutron star using the chiral quark-meson coupling
model, in which the quark-quark hyperfine interaction due to the exchanges of
gluon and pion based on chiral symmetry is considered. We also examine the
effects of hyperons and $\Delta$-isobars in a neutron star. Extending the SU(6)
spin-flavor symmetry to more general SU(3) flavor symmetry in the vector-meson
couplings to baryons, the maximum mass of neutron star can reach the recently
observed, massive pulsar mass, $1.97 \pm 0.04 M_{\odot}$. In this calculation,
$\Lambda$ and $\Xi$ are generated in a neutron star, while $\Sigma$ and
$\Delta$-isobars do not appear.
