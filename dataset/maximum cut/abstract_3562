We measured the first azimuthal distributions of triple--differential cross
sections of neutrons emitted in heavy-ion collisions, and compared their
maximum azimuthal anisotropy ratios with Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (BUU)
calculations with a momentum-dependent interaction. The BUU calculations agree
with the triple- and double-differential cross sections for positive rapidity
neutrons emitted at polar angles from 7 to 27 degrees; however, the maximum
azimuthal anisotropy ratio for these free neutrons is insensitive to the size
of the nuclear incompressibility modulus K characterizing the nuclear matter
equation of state.
