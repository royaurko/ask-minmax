We present a lattice QCD calculation of the charge diffusion coefficient, the
electrical conductivity and various susceptibilities of conserved charges, for
a range of temperatures below and above the deconfinement crossover. The
calculations include the contributions from up, down and strange quarks. We
find that the diffusion coefficient is of the order of 1/(2\pi T) and has a dip
around the crossover temperature. Our results are obtained with lattice
simulations containing 2+1 dynamical flavours on anisotropic lattices. The
Maximum Entropy Method is used to construct spectral functions from correlators
of the conserved vector current.
