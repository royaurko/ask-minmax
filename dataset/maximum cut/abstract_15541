We investigate experimentally spin ordering in spin-1 Bose-Einstein
condensate of sodium atoms. Antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions favor
spin-nematic ordering, where the magnetic order is characterized by a second
rank tensor with the symmetry of an ellipsoid. In a mean field description this
order is enforced by locking a particular relative phase $\Theta$ between the
spin components. We reveal this mechanism by two methods, a study of the
magnetization noise after spin rotation and a maximum-likelihood analysis to
infer the probability distribution function of $\Theta$. Our methods can in
principle also be applied to atoms with higher spin in order to reveal complex
magnetic phases.
