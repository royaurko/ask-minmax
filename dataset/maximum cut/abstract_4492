We propose a new, twistor string theory inspired formalism to calculate loop
amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. In this approach, maximal helicity
violating (MHV) tree amplitudes of N=4 super Yang-Mills are used as vertices,
using an off-shell prescription introduced by Cachazo, Svrcek and Witten, and
combined into effective diagrams that incorporate large numbers of conventional
Feynman diagrams. As an example, we apply this formalism to the particular
class of MHV one-loop scattering amplitudes with an arbitrary number of
external legs in N=4 super Yang-Mills. Remarkably, our approach naturally leads
to a representation of the amplitudes as dispersion integrals, which we
evaluate exactly. This yields a new, simplified form for the MHV amplitudes,
which is equivalent to the expressions obtained previously by Bern, Dixon,
Dunbar and Kosower using the cut-constructibility approach.
