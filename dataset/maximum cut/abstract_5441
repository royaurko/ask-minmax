We investigate the stability under variation of the renormalization,
factorization and energy scales entering the calculation of the cross section,
at next-to-leading order in the BFKL formalism, for the production of
Mueller-Navelet jets at the Large Hadron Collider, following the experimental
cuts on the tagged jets. To find optimal values for the scales involved in this
observable it is possible to look for regions of minimal sensitivity to their
variation. We show that the scales found with this logic are more natural, in
the sense of being more similar to the squared transverse momenta of the tagged
jets, when the BFKL kernel is improved with a resummation of collinear
contributions than when the treatment is at a purely next-to-leading order. We
also discuss the good perturbative convergence of the ratios of azimuthal angle
correlations, which are quite insensitive to collinear resummations and well
described by the original BFKL framework.
