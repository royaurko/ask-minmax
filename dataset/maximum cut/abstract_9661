We describe the C_{2k+1}-free graphs on n vertices with maximum number of
edges. The extremal graphs are unique except for n = 3k-1, 3k, 4k-2, or 4k-1.
The value of ex(n,C_{2k+1}) can be read out from the works of Bondy, Woodall,
and Bollobas, but here we give a new streamlined proof. The complete
determination of the extremal graphs is also new.
  We obtain that the bound for n_0(C_{2k+1}) is 4k in the classical theorem of
Simonovits, from which the unique extremal graph is the bipartite Turan graph.
