Asymptotic behavior of a class of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations are
studied. Particular cases of 1D weakly focusing and Bose-Einstein condensates
are considered. A statistical approach is presented to describe the stationary
probability density of a discretized finite system. Using a maximum entropy
argument, the theory predicts that the statistical equilibrium is described by
energy equivalued fluctuation modes around the coherent structure minimizing
the Hamiltonian of the system. Good quantitative agreement is found with
numerical simulations. In particular, the particle number spectral density
follows an effective $1/k^2$ law for the asymptotic large time averaged
solutions. Transient dynamics from a given initial condition to the
statistically steady regime shows rapid oscillation of the condensate.
