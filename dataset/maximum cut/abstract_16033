We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the gamma-ray burst
GRB 021211 obtained during the late stages of its afterglow. The light curve
shows a rebrightening occurring ~25 days after the GRB. The analysis of a VLT
spectrum obtained during the bump (27 days after the GRB) reveals a suggestive
resemblance with the spectrum of the prototypical type-Ic SN 1994I, obtained
about ~10 days past maximum light. Particularly we have measured a strong,
broad absorption feature at 3770 A, which we have identified with Ca II
blueshifted by ~14400 km/s, thus indicating that a supernova (SN) component is
indeed powering the `bump' in the afterglow decay. Assuming SN 1994I as a
template, the spectroscopic and photometric data together indicate that the SN
and GRB explosions were at most separated by a few days. Our results suggest
that GRBs might be associated also to standard type-Ic supernovae.
