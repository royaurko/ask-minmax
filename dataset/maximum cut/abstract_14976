Coupling of the charge carriers in the high temperature superconducting
oxides to bosonic modes has been widely reported using a variety of
experimental probes. These include angular resolved photoemission (ARPES),
scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS), Raman scattering (RS) and infrared
optical spectroscopy (IRS). The energy scale investigated has been mostly
limited to a relatively small range up to 300 meV or so. Although some ARPES
experiments report boson structure up to 800 meV in the dressed electron
dispersion curves the data are not analyzed to recover the spectral density of
the fluctuation spectrum. We have extended to higher energies up to 2.2 eV the
usual maximum entropy technique used to invert optical data so as to obtain an
electron-boson spectral density. This has required that we include in our
inversions, the calculated (LDA) particle-hole symmetrized energy dependent
electronic density of states (DOS). Our analysis reveals that significant
spectral weight remains in the fluctuation spectra up to 2.2 eV in the Bi-2212
family and to 1.2 eV in Bi-2201 for all doping levels considered.
