While current nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) from global fits
to experimental data are spatially homogeneous, many experimental observables
in nucleus-nucleus collisions are presented in terms of centrality cuts. These
cuts can be related to impact parameter using the Glauber theory and it is thus
usual in the description of such observables to convolute an assumed impact
parameter distribution with the homogeneous nPDFs. In this study we use the
Gribov theory of nuclear shadowing supplemented with information from
diffraction to model the impact parameter distributions of nuclear shadowing
ratio in the small-$x$ region. The modeled distributions are applied to the
description of the centrality dependence of observables in deuteron-gold (d+Au)
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ AGeV.
