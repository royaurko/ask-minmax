The objective of this paper is to study a special family of Minkowski sums,
that is of polytopes relatively in general position. We show that the maximum
number of faces in the sum can be attained by this family. We present a new
linear equation that is satisfied by f-vectors of the sum and the summands. We
study some of the implications of this equation.
