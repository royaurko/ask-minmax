A new silicon detector has been developed to provide the PHENIX experiment
with precise charged particle tracking at forward and backward rapidity. The
Forward Silicon Vertex Tracker (FVTX) was installed in PHENIX prior to the 2012
run period of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The FVTX is composed
of two annular endcaps, each with four stations of silicon mini-strip sensors,
covering a rapidity range of $1.2<|\eta|<2.2$ that closely matches the two
existing PHENIX muon arms. Each station consists of 48 individual silicon
sensors, each of which contains two columns of mini-strips with 75 $\mu$m pitch
in the radial direction and lengths in the $\phi$ direction varying from 3.4 mm
at the inner radius to 11.5 mm at the outer radius. The FVTX has approximately
0.54 million strips in each endcap. These are read out with FPHX chips,
developed in collaboration with Fermilab, which are wire bonded directly to the
mini-strips. The maximum strip occupancy reached in central Au-Au collisions is
approximately 2.8%. The precision tracking provided by this device makes the
identification of muons from secondary vertices away from the primary event
vertex possible. The expected distance of closest approach (DCA) resolution of
200 $\mu$m or better for particles with a transverse momentum of 5 GeV/$c$ will
allow identification of muons from relatively long-lived particles, such as $D$
and $B$ mesons, through their broader DCA distributions.
