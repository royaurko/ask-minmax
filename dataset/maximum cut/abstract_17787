The nature of the progenitor systems of type~Ia supernovae is still unclear.
One way to distinguish between the single-degenerate scenario and
double-degenerate scenario for their progenitors is to search for the surviving
companions. Using a technique that couples the results from multi-dimensional
hydrodynamics simulations with calculations of the structure and evolution of
main-sequence- and helium-rich surviving companions, the color and magnitude of
main-sequence- and helium-rich surviving companions are predicted as functions
of time. The surviving companion candidates in Galactic type~Ia supernova
remnants and nearby extragalactic type~Ia supernova remnants are discussed. We
find that the maximum detectable distance of main-sequence surviving companions
(helium-rich surviving companions) is $0.6-4$~Mpc ($0.4-16$~Mpc), if the
apparent magnitude limit is 27 in the absence of extinction, suggesting that
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and the Andromeda Galaxy are excellent
environments in which to search for surviving companions. However, only five
Ia~SNRs have been searched for surviving companions, showing little support for
the standard channels in the singe-degenerate scenario. To better understand
the progenitors of type Ia supernovae, we encourage the search for surviving
companions in other nearby type Ia supernova remnants.
