The millisecond proto-magnetar model for the central engine of long-duration
gamma-ray bursts is briefly reviewed. Limitations and uncertainties in the
model are highlighted. A short discussion of the maximum energy, maximum
duration, radiative efficiency, jet formation mechanism, late-time energy
injection, and (non-)association with supernovae of millisecond
magnetar-powered GRBs is provided.
