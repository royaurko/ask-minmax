We report spectral fitting results for Rosat PSPC observations of the dipping
source X 1755-338. These results are consistent with the two-component model
that we previously proposed consisting of a blackbody point source plus an
extended power law component. Remarkably, the low energy cut-off of the
spectrum does not change appreciably in dips, and it can be seen that dipping
takes place in the higher part of the PSPC band where the blackbody contributes
to the spectrum. Thus dipping consists primarily of absorption of this
component, whereas the low energy cut-off is determined by the power law. Thus,
above 0.5 keV, the dipping is approximately independent of energy as seen in
Exosat and 10 +/- 0.4% deep. Below 0.5 keV, there may be a small residual
dipping effect of up to 3%; however dipping is certainly substantially reduced
compared with the 20% seen by Exosat, and this is the first time that the
effective cessation of dipping at low energies in such sources has been seen.
