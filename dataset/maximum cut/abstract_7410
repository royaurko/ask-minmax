We examine the clustering properties of HI-selected galaxies through an
analysis of the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey Catalogue (HICAT) two-point
correlation function. Various sub-samples are extracted from this catalogue to
study the overall clustering of HI-rich galaxies and its dependence on
luminosity, HI gas mass and rotational velocity. These samples cover the entire
southern sky Dec < 0 deg, containing up to 4,174 galaxies over the radial
velocity range 300-12,700 km/s. A scale length of r_0 = 3.45 +/- 0.25 Mpc/h and
slope of gamma = 1.47 +/- 0.08 is obtained for the HI-rich galaxy real-space
correlation function, making gas-rich galaxies among the most weakly clustered
objects known. HI-selected galaxies also exhibit weaker clustering than
optically selected galaxies of comparable luminosities. Good agreement is found
between our results and those of synthetic HI-rich galaxy catalogues generated
from the Millennium Run CDM simulation. Bisecting HICAT using different
parameter cuts, clustering is found to depend most strongly on rotational
velocity and luminosity, while the dependency on HI mass is marginal. Splitting
the sample around v_rot = 108 km/s, a scale length of r_0 = 2.86 +/- 0.46 Mpc/h
is found for galaxies with low rotational velocities compared to r_0 = 3.96 +/-
0.33 Mpc/h for the high rotational velocity sample.
