It has been known for 30 years that posets with bounded height and with cover
graphs of bounded maximum degree have bounded dimension. Recently, Streib and
Trotter proved that dimension is bounded for posets with bounded height and
planar cover graphs, and Joret et al. proved that dimension is bounded for
posets with bounded height and with cover graphs of bounded tree-width. In this
paper, it is proved that posets of bounded height whose cover graphs exclude a
fixed topological minor have bounded dimension. This generalizes all the
aforementioned results and verifies a conjecture of Joret et al. The proof
relies on the Robertson-Seymour and Grohe-Marx graph structure theorems.
