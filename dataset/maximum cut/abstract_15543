For a graph $G$ with $p$ vertices the cone of concentration matrices consists
of all real positive semidefinite $p\times p$ matrices with zeros in the
off-diagonal entries corresponding to nonedges of $G$. The extremal rays of
this cone and their associated ranks have applications to matrix completion
problems, maximum likelihood estimation in Gaussian graphical models in
statistics, and Gauss elimination for sparse matrices. For a weakly bipartite
graph $G$, we show that the normal vectors to the facets of the $(\pm1)$-cut
polytope of $G$ specify the off-diagonal entries of extremal matrices in
$\mathcal{K}_G$. We also prove that the constant term of the linear equation of
each facet-supporting hyperplane is the rank of its corresponding extremal
matrix in $\mathcal{K}_G$. Furthermore, we show that if $G$ is series-parallel
then this gives a complete characterization of all possible extremal ranks of
$\mathcal{K}_G$, consequently solving the sparsity order problem for
series-parallel graphs.
