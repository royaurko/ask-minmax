The spectrophotometric variability of the mCP star 56 Ari in the far-UV
spectral region from 1150 \AA\ to 1980 \AA\ is investigated. This study is
based on the archival {\it IUE} data obtained at different phases of the
rotational cycle. The brightness of 56 Ari is not constant in the investigated
wavelengths over the whole rotational period. The monochromatic light curves
continuously change their shape with wavelength. The comparison of energy
distributions at three phases show that the first minimum of light curves at
phase 0.25 is replaced by the maximum for $\lambda>$1608\AA, but the second
minimum of light curves at phase 0.65 absent in the spectral region between
$\lambda$1938\AA\ and $\lambda$1980\AA. The variable broad features in the
far-UV connected with a non-uniform distribution of silicon over the surface of
56 Ari influence substantially the light variations in the UV.
