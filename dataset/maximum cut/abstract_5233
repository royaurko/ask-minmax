We present two Suzaku observations of the Galactic center microquasar 1E
1740.7-2942 separated by approximately 700 days. The source was observed on
both occasions after a transition to the spectrally hard state. Significant
emission from 1E 1740.7-2942 is detected out to an energy of 300 keV, with no
spectral break or turnover evident in the data. We tentatively measure a lower
limit to the cut-off energy of ~ 380 keV. The spectra are found to be
consistent with a Comptonized corona on both occasions, where the high energy
emission is consistent with a hard power-law (\Gamma ~ 1.8) with a significant
contribution from an accretion disc with a temperature of ~ 0.4 keV at soft
X-ray energies. The measured value for the inner radius of the accretion disc
is found to be inconsistent with the picture whereby the disc is truncated at
large radii in the low-hard state and instead favours a radius close to the
ISCO (R_in ~ 10 - 20 R_g).
