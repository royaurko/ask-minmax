We examine the recoil velocity induced by the superposition of the magnetic
dipole and quadrupole radiation from a pulsar/magnetar born with rapid
rotation. The resultant velocity depends on not the magnitude, but rather the
ratio of the two moments and their geometrical configuration. The model does
not necessarily lead to high spatial velocity for a magnetar with a strong
magnetic field, which is consistent with the recent observational upper bound.
The maximum velocity predicted with this model is slightly smaller than that of
observed fast-moving pulsars.
