We report measurements of the cluster X-ray luminosity function out to z=0.8
based on the final sample of 201 galaxy systems from the 160 Square Degree
ROSAT Cluster Survey. There is little evidence for any measurable change in
cluster abundance out to z~0.6 at luminosities less than a few times 10^44
ergs/s (0.5-2.0 keV). However, between 0.6 < z < 0.8 and at luminosities above
10^44 ergs/s, the observed volume densities are significantly lower than those
of the present-day population. We quantify this cluster deficit using
integrated number counts and a maximum-likelihood analysis of the observed
luminosity-redshift distribution fit with a model luminosity function. The
negative evolution signal is >3 sigma regardless of the adopted local
luminosity function or cosmological framework. Our results and those from
several other surveys independently confirm the presence of evolution. Whereas
the bulk of the cluster population does not evolve, the most luminous and
presumably most massive structures evolve appreciably between z=0.8 and the
present. Interpreted in the context of hierarchical structure formation, we are
probing sufficiently large mass aggregations at sufficiently early times in
cosmological history where the Universe has yet to assemble these clusters to
present-day volume densities.
