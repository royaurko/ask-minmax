Solar-like oscillations have been observed by Kepler and CoRoT in several
solar-type stars, thereby providing a way to probe the stars using
asteroseismology.
  We provide the mode frequencies of the oscillations of various stars required
to perform a comparison with those obtained from stellar modelling.
  We used a time series of nine months of data for each star. The 61 stars
observed were categorised in three groups: simple, F-like and mixed-mode. The
simple group includes stars for which the identification of the mode degree is
obvious. The F-like group includes stars for which the identification of the
degree is ambiguous. The mixed-mode group includes evolved stars for which the
modes do not follow the asymptotic relation of low-degree frequencies.
Following this categorisation, the power spectra of the 61 main sequence and
subgiant stars were analysed using both maximum likelihood estimators and
Bayesian estimators, providing individual mode characteristics such as
frequencies, linewidths, and mode heights. We developed and describe a
methodology for extracting a single set of mode frequencies from multiple sets
derived by different methods and individual scientists. We report on how one
can assess the quality of the fitted parameters using the likelihood ratio test
and the posterior probabilities.
  We provide the mode frequencies of 61 stars (with their 1-sigma error bars),
as well as their associated echelle diagrams.
