A special shaping of YAG:Nd^{3+} laser beam profile has been found to improve
homogeneity and T_c of YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta} films being deposited by the
pulsed laser. Targets of a considerably non-stoichiometric composition and
substrates of slanting cuts have turned to be necessary for the high-quality
film growing. Multiple droplets and solid particles ejected from the target
surface by the infrared radiation are removed successfuly from the
laser-induced plasma by use of a velocity filter.
