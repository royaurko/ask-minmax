Algebraic and fast algebraic attacks are power tools to analyze stream
ciphers. A class of symmetric Boolean functions with maximum algebraic immunity
were found vulnerable to fast algebraic attacks at EUROCRYPT'06. Recently, the
notion of AAR (algebraic attack resistant) functions was introduced as a
unified measure of protection against both classical algebraic and fast
algebraic attacks. In this correspondence, we first give a decomposition of
symmetric Boolean functions, then we show that almost all symmetric Boolean
functions, including these functions with good algebraic immunity, behave badly
against fast algebraic attacks, and we also prove that no symmetric Boolean
functions are AAR functions. Besides, we improve the relations between
algebraic degree and algebraic immunity of symmetric Boolean functions.
