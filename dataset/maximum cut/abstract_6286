We present a model of a freely precessing neutron star which is then compared
against pulsar observations. The aim is to draw conclusions regarding the
structure of the star, and test theoretical ideas of crust-core coupling and
superfluidity. We argue that, on theoretical grounds, it is likely that the
core neutron superfluid does not participate in the free precession of the
crust. We apply our model to the handful of proposed observations of free
precession that have appeared in the literature. Assuming crust-only
precession, we find that all but one of the observations are consistent with
there not being any pinned crustal superfluid at all; the maximum amount of
pinned superfluid consistent with the observations is about 10^-10 of the total
stellar moment of inertia. However, the observations do not rule out the
possibility that the crust and neutron superfluid core precess as a single
unit. In this case the maximum amount of pinned superfluid consistent with the
observations is about 10^-8 of the total stellar moment of inertia. Both of
these values are many orders of magnitude less than the 10^-2 value predicted
by many theories of pulsar glitches. We conclude that superfluid pinning, at
least as it affects free precession, needs to be reconsidered.
