We describe how to compute estimates of the power spectrum C_l from Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) maps that not only retain all the cosmological
information, but also have uncorrelated error bars and well-behaved window
functions. We apply this technique to the 4-year COBE/DMR data, and tabulate
eight uncorrelated band-powers.
