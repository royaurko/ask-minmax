Complete census of wide visual companions to nearby G-dwarf stars can be
achieved by selecting candidates from the 2MASS Point-Source Catalog and
checking their status by second-epoch imaging. Such data are obtained for 124
candidates with separations up to 20", 47 of which are shown to be new physical
low-mass stellar companions. A list of visual binaries with G-dwarf primaries
is produced by combining newly found companions with historical data. Maximum
likelihood analysis leads to the companion frequency of 0.13+-0.015 per decade
of separation. The mass ratio is distributed almost uniformly, with a power-law
index between -0.4 and 0. The remaining uncertainty in the index is related to
modeling of the companion detection threshold in 2MASS. These findings are
confirmed by alternative analysis of wider companions in 2MASS, removing the
contamination by background stars statistically. Extension of this work will
lead to a complete detection of visual companions - a necessary step towards
reaching unbiased multiplicity statistics over the full range of orbital
periods and, eventually, understanding the origin of multiple systems.
