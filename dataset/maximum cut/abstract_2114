We use a cooling algorithm based on an improved action with scale invariant
instanton solutions, which needs no monitoring or calibration and has a
inherent cut off for dislocations. We present results for SU(2) Yang-Mills
theory where the method provides good susceptibility data and physical size
distributions of instantons.
