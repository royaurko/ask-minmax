Recent results obtained with the Pierre Auger Observatory are described.
These include measurements of the spectrum, anisotropies and composition of
ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The ankle of the spectrum is measured at
$4\times 10^{18}$~eV and a suppression above $3\times 10^{19}$~eV consistent
with the GZK effect is observed. At energies above $5.5\times 10^{19}$~eV a
correlation with the distribution of nearby extragalactic objects is found,
including an excess around the direction of Centaurus~A, the nearest radio loud
active galaxy. Measurements of the depth of shower maximum and its fluctuations
suggest a gradual change in the average mass of the primary cosmic rays (under
standard extrapolations of hadronic interaction models), being the results
consistent with a light composition consisting mostly of protons at few$\times
10^{18}$~eV and approaching the expectations from iron nuclei at $4\times
10^{19}$~eV. Upper bounds on the photon fraction and the neutrino fluxes are
also obtained.
