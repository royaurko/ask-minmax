We further investigate, in the planar limit of N=4 supersymmetric Yang Mills
theories,the high energy Regge behavior of six-point MHV scattering amplitudes.
In particular, for the new Regge cut contribution found in our previous paper,
we compute in the leading logarithmic approximation (LLA) the energy spectrum
of the BFKL equation in the color octet channel, and we calculate explicitly
the two loop corrections to the discontinuities of the amplitudes for the
transitions 2 to 4 and 3 to 3. We find an explicit solution of the BFKL
equation for the octet channel for arbitrary momentum transfers and investigate
the intercepts of the Regge singularities in this channel. As an important
result we find that the universal collinear and infrared singularities of the
BDS formula are not affected by this Regge-cut contribution. Any improvement of
the BDS formula should reproduce this cut to all orders in the coupling.
