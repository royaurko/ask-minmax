The aim of this paper is to present an analytical calculation of the chemical
potential of a Lennard Jones fluid. The integration range is divided into two
regions. In the small distance region,which is $r\leq\sigma$ in the usual
notation,the integration range had to be cut off in order to avoid the
occurence of divergences.In the large distance region,the calculation is
technically simpler. The calculation reported here will be useful in all kinds
of studies concerning phase equilibrium in a $LJ$ fluid. Interesting kinds of
such systems are the giant planets and the icy satellites in various planetary
systems,but also the (so far) hypothetical quark stars.
