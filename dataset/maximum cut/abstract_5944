This study investigates wireless information and energy transfer for dual-hop
amplify-and-forward full-duplex relaying systems. By applying time switching
(TS) as a relay transceiver architecture, the full duplex information relaying
can be powered by energy harvested from the source-emitted radio frequency
signal. Considering that the loop channel at the relay follows Rician fading,
the throughputs are analyzed for three relay control schemes, including the
maximum relay, sub-optimal relay, and target relay. Analytical expressions for
the outage probability and ergodic capacity are also presented for these
considered relay control schemes. It has shown that the energy efficiency
maximization problem of the maximum relay is concave for the TS factor and the
bisection method has been applied to obtain the optimized TS factor. The time
switching factors that maximize the relaying transmission time with collateral
energy harvesting benefits are presented for the sub-optimal relay and target
relay, which incorporate instantaneous channel information to increase the
energy efficiency over the maximum relay. Without requiring channel information
for the second-hop, the target relay can ensure competitive performance for
outage probability, ergodic capacity, and energy efficiency.
