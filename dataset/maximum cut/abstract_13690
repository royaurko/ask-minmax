We present the temporal evolution of line profiles ranging from near
ultraviolet to optical wavelengths by analyzing 59 Subaru telescope spectra of
normal Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) in the intermediate redshift range (0.05 < z
< 0.4) discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova
Survey. We derive line velocities, peak wavelengths and pseudo-equivalent
widths (pEWs) of these lines. Additionally, we compare the line profiles around
the date of maximum brightness with those from their nearby counterparts. We
find that line profiles represented by their velocities and pEWs for
intermediate redshift SNe Ia are consistent with their nearby counterparts
within 2 $\sigma$. These findings support the picture that SNe Ia are a
"standard" candle for the intermediate redshift range as has been shown between
SNe Ia at nearby and high redshifts. There is a hint that the "MgII \lambda
4300" pEW distribution for intermediate redshift SNe Ia is larger than for the
nearby sample, which could be interpreted as a difference in the progenitor
abundance.
