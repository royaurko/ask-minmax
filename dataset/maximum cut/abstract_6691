We constrain the maximum flux from extragalactic neutrino point sources by
using diffuse neutrino flux limits. We show that the maximum flux from
extragalactic point sources is E^2(dN/dE) < 1.4 x 10^-9 (L_nu/2x10^43
erg/s)^1/3 GeV cm-^2 s^-1 from individual point sources with average neutrino
luminosity per decade, L_nu. It depends only slightly on factors such as the
inhomogeneous matter density distribution in the local universe, the luminosity
distribution, and the assumed spectral index. The derived constraints are at
least one order of magnitude below the current experimental limits from direct
searches. Significant constraints are also derived on the number density of
neutrino sources and on the total neutrino power density.
