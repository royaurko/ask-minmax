We present a method for tuning the resonant wavelength of photonic crystal
cavities (PCCs) around 1.55 um. Large tuning of the PCC mode is enabled by
electromechanically controlling the separation between two parallel InGaAsP
membranes. A fabrication method to avoid sticking between the membranes is
discussed. Reversible red/blue shifting of the symmetric/anti-symmetric modes
has been observed, which provides clear evidence of the electromechanical
tuning, and a maximum shift of 10 nm with < 6 V applied bias has been obtained.
