We present high resolution CO(1-0) interferometric observations and deep HST
B-V-I images of the flocculent isolated Sc type spiral NGC 4414. The goal is to
determine the stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratio in a galactic disk. The stars
are seen without a dust screen, the central gas mass is very low (undetected),
and we show that the dark matter is negligible in the central regions. We have
developed an axisymmetric analytical gravitational potential model to account
for the central light (mass) profile, the dynamics of the molecular gas in the
highly obscured molecular ring, and the stellar light profile outside the
highly obscured region. The contribution of dark matter is constrained by the
extremely extended HI rotation curve and is small, possibly negligible, at
distances less than 5 -- 7 kpc from the center. Furthermore, the M/L ratios we
derive are low, about 1.5 in I band and 0.5 in K' band. The B and V band M/L
ratios vary greatly due to absorption by dust, reaching 4 in the molecular ring
and decreasing to about 1.6 -- 1.8 at larger radii. This unequivocally shows
that models, like most maximum disk models, assuming constant M/L ratios in an
optical waveband, simply are not appropriate. We illustrate this by making mock
maximum disk models with a constant V band M/L ratio. The key is having the
central light distribution unobscured such that it can be used to trace the
mass. A primitive attempt to determine the intrinsic M/L ratio yields values
close to unity in the B,V, and I bands and slightly below 0.5 in K'.
