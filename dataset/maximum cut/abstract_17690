Economic integration, globalization and financial crises represent examples
of processes whose understanding requires the analysis of the underlying
network structure. Of particular interest is establishing whether a real
economic network is in a state of (quasi)stationary equilibrium, i.e.
characterized by smooth structural changes rather than abrupt transitions.
While in the former case the behaviour of the system can be reasonably
controlled and predicted, in the latter case this is generally impossible.
Here, we propose a method to assess whether a real economic network is in a
quasi-stationary state by checking the consistency of its structural evolution
with appropriate quasi-equilibrium maximum-entropy ensembles of graphs. As
illustrative examples, we consider the International Trade Network (ITN) and
the Dutch Interbank Network (DIN). We find that the ITN is an almost perfect
example of quasi-equilibrium network, while the DIN is clearly
out-of-equilibrium. In the latter, the entity of the deviation from
quasi-stationarity contains precious information that allows us to identify
remarkable early warning signals of the interbank crisis of 2008. These early
warning signals involve certain dyadic and triadic topological properties,
including dangerous 'debt loops' with different levels of interbank
reciprocity.
