We present in this paper a rigorous method to derive the nonlinear
Fokker-Planck (FP) equation of anomalous diffusion directly from a
generalization of the principle of least action of Maupertuis proposed by Wang
for smooth or quasi-smooth irregular dynamics evolving in Markovian process.
The FP equation obtained may take two different but equivalent forms. It was
also found that the diffusion constant may depend on both q (the index of
Tsallis entropy) and the time t.
