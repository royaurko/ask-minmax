Interplanetary magnetic field magnitude fluctuations are notoriously more
intermittent than velocity fluctuations in both fast and slow wind. This
behaviour has been interpreted in terms of the anomalous scaling observed in
passive scalars in fully developed hydrodynamic turbulence. In this paper, the
strong intermittent nature of the interplanetary magnetic field is briefly
discussed comparing results performed during different phases of the solar
cycle. The scaling properties of the interplanetary magnetic field magnitude
show solar cycle variation that can be distinguished in the scaling exponents
revealed by structure functions. The scaling exponents observed around solar
maximum coincide, within the errors, to those measured for passive scalars in
hydrodynamic turbulence. However, it is also found that the values are not
universal in the sense that the solar cycle variation may be reflected in
dependence on the structure of the velocity field.
