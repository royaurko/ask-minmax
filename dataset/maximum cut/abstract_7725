An adequate description of the neutral-current Drell-Yan process at the
Tevatron and the LHC, in particular, requires the inclusion of electroweak
radiative corrections. We extend earlier work in this direction in various
ways. First, we define and numerically compare different methods to describe
the Z-boson resonance including next-to-leading order electroweak corrections;
moreover, we provide explicit analytical expressions for those. Second, we pay
particular attention to contributions from photon-photon and photon-quark
collisions, which involve photons in the initial state, and work out how their
impact can be enhanced by selection cuts. Third, we supplement the O(\alpha)
corrections by universal electroweak effects of higher order, such as universal
two-loop contributions from \Delta\alpha and \Delta\rho, and the leading
two-loop corrections in the high-energy Sudakov regime as well as multi-photon
radiation off muons in the structure-function approach. Finally, we present
results on the complete next-to-leading order electroweak and QCD corrections
within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model.
