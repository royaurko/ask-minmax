Using statistical thermodynamics, we derive a general expression of the
stationary probability distribution for thermodynamic systems driven out of
equilibrium by several thermodynamic forces. The local equilibrium is defined
by imposing the minimum entropy production and the maximum entropy principle
under the scale invariance restrictions. The obtained probability distribution
presents a singularity that has immediate physical interpretation in terms of
the intermittency models. The derived reference probability distribution
function is interpreted as time and ensemble average of the real physical one.
A generic family of stochastic processes describing noise-driven intermittency,
whose stationary density distribution coincides exactly with the one resulted
from entropy maximization, is presented.
