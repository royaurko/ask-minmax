Observations by the {\RHESSI} satellite of large polarization of the prompt
$\gamma$-ray emission from the Gamma Ray Burst GRB021206 \citep{coburn03} imply
that the magnetic field coherence scale is larger than the size of the visible
emitting region, $\sim R/\Gamma$, where $R$ is the radius of the flow, $\Gamma$
is the associated Lorentz factor.
  Such fields cannot be generated in a causally disconnected, hydrodynamically
dominated outflow. Electromagnetic models of GRBs \citep{lyutikov02}, in which
large scale, dynamically dominant, magnetic fields are present in the outflow
from the very beginning, provide a natural explanation of this large reported
linear polarization. We derive Stokes parameters of synchrotron emission of a
relativistically moving plasma with a given magnetic field configuration and
calculate the pulse averaged polarization fraction of the emission from a
relativistically expanding shell carrying global toroidal magnetic field. For
viewing angles larger than $1/\Gamma$ the observed patch of the emitting shell
has almost homogeneous magnetic field, producing a large fractional
polarization ($56% $ for a power-law energy distribution of relativistic
particles $dn/d\epsilon \propto \epsilon^{-3}$). The maximum polarization is
smaller than the theoretical upper limit for a stationary plasma in uniform
magnetic field due to relativistic kinematic effects.
