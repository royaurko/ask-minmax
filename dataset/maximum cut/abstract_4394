Collisions of deformed uranium nuclei are studied in a Monte-Carlo Glauber
model. For U+U at zero impact parameter (b=0) in the most favorable orientation
(tip-to-tip), the transverse particle density (charged-particle rapidity
density per weighted transverse area of the initial participant zone) increases
by about 35% compared to Au+Au at b=0. To estimate the advantage of U+U over
Au+Au in the context of real experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider, we examine the effect of a range of centrality cuts on the event
sample. In terms of the transverse particle density, the predicted advantage of
U+U is about 16%.
