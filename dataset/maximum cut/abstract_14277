In this article I give a pedagogical illustration of why the essential
problem of high-Tc superconductivity in the cuprates is about how an
antiferromagnetically ordered state can be turned into a short-range state by
doping. I will start with half-filling where the antiferromagnetic ground state
is accurately described by the Liang-Doucot-Anderson (LDA) wavefunction. Here
the effect of the Fermi statistics becomes completely irrelevant due to the no
double occupancy constraint. Upon doping, the statistical signs reemerge,
albeit much reduced as compared to the original Fermi statistical signs. By
precisely incorporating this altered statistical sign structure at finite
doping, the LDA ground state can be recast into a short-range antiferromagnetic
state. Superconducting phase coherence arises after the spin correlations
become short-ranged, and the superconducting phase transition is controlled by
spin excitations. I will stress that the pseudogap phenomenon naturally emerges
as a crossover between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases. As a
characteristic of non Fermi liquid, the mutual statistical interaction between
the spin and charge degrees of freedom will reach a maximum in a
high-temperature "strange metal phase" of the doped Mott insulator.
