A quasionedimentional spin chain (s=1/2) is considered as a lattice
consisting of two sublattices. The attention is paid to the states which are
pure spin states of the whole lattice and both sublattices, the value of the
sublattices' spins being maximum. It is shown that the Neel state can be
considered as a superposition of such states. The exact equation for this
superposition coefficients is developed.
  The possibility of the Neel state to be the eigenstate of a Hamiltonian is
discussed. Several model Hamiltonians are examined, the well known ones and few
novel Hamiltonians being considered. The time evolution of the Neel state in
different models is studied with the help of Fock-Krylov method.
