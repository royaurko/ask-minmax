Dynamics of coded information over Bloch channels is investigated for
different values of the channel's parameters. We show that, the suppressing of
the travelling coded information over Bloch channel can be increased by
decreasing the equilibrium absolute value of information carrier and
consequently decreasing the distilled information by eavesdropper. The amount
of decoded information can be improved by increasing the equilibrium values of
the two qubits and decreasing the ratio between longitudinal and transverse
relaxation times. The robustness of coded information in maximum and partial
entangled states is discussed. It is shown that the maximum entangled states
are more robust than the partial entangled state over this type of channels.
