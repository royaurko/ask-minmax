We report here results from detailed timing and spectral studies of the high
mass X-ray binary pulsar 4U~1538--52 over several binary periods using
observations made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and BeppoSAX
satellites. Pulse timing analysis with the 2003 RXTE data over two binary
orbits confirms an eccentric orbit of the system. Combining the orbitial
parameters determined from this observation with the earlier measurements we
did not find any evidence of orbital decay in this X-ray binary. We have
carried out orbital phase resolved spectroscopy to measure changes in the
spectral parameters with orbital phase, particularly the absorption column
density and the iron line flux. The RXTE-PCA spectra in the 3--20 keV energy
range were fitted with a power law and a high energy cut-off alongwith a
Gaussian line at $\sim$ 6.4 keV, whereas the BeppoSAX spectra needed only a
power law and Gaussian emission line at $\sim$ 6.4 keV in the restricted energy
range of 0.3--10.0 keV. An absorption along the line of sight was included for
both the RXTE and BeppoSAX data. The variation of the free spectral parameters
over the binary orbit was investigated and we found that the variation of the
column density of absorbing material in the line of sight with orbital phase is
in reasonable agreement with a simple model of a spherically symmetric stellar
wind from the companion star.
