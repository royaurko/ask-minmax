The effects of nuclear medium on the residue, mass and self energy of the
positive and negative parity $\Sigma, \Lambda$ and $\Xi$ hyperons are
investigated using the QCD sum rule method. In the calculations, the general
interpolating currents of hyperons with an arbitrary mixing parameter are used.
We compare the results obtained in medium with those of the vacuum and
calculate the shifts in the corresponding parameters. It is found that the
shifts on the residues in nuclear matter are positive for both parities in all
channels, while the shifts are negative for mass of the hyperons under
consideration. The shifts on the residues and masses of negative parity states
are large compared to those of positive parities. The maximum shifts belong to
the residues of the negative parity $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$ hyperons. The vector
self-energies gained by the positive parity baryons are large compared to the
negative parities' vector self-energies. The maximum value of the vector
self-energy belongs to the positive parity $\Sigma$ hyperon. The numerical
values are compared with the existing predictions in the literature.
