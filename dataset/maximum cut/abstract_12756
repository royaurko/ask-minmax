The entanglement of collaboration (EoC) quantifies the maximum amount of
entanglement, that can be generated between two parties, A and B, given
collaboration with N-2 other parties, when the N parties share a multipartite
(possibly mixed) state and where the collaboration consists of local operations
and classical communication (LOCC) by all parties. The localizable entanglement
(LE) is defined similarly except that A and B do not participate in the effort
to generate bipartite entanglement. We compare between these two operational
definitions and find sufficient conditions for which the EoC is equal to the
LE. In particular, we find that the two are equal whenever they are measured by
the concurrence or by one of its generalizations called the G-concurrence. We
also find a simple expression for the LE in terms of the Jamiolkowski
isomorphism and prove that it is convex.
