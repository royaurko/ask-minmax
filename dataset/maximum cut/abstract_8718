We investigate mesons and diquarks as resonant states above chiral critical
temperature $T_c$ in flavor SU(2) Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. For each kind of
resonance, we solve the pole equation for the resonant mass in the complex
energy plane, and find an ultimate temperature where the pole starts to
disappear. The phase diagram including these limit temperatures in $T-\mu$
plane is obtained. The maximum limit temperature at $\mu=0$ is approximately
two times $T_c$.
