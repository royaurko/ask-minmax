We developed an efficient numerical algorithm for computing the spectrum of
anomalous dimensions of the planar ${\cal N}=4$ Super-Yang--Mills at finite
coupling. The method is based on the Quantum Spectral Curve formalism. In
contrast to Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, worked out only for some very special
operators, this method is applicable for generic states/operators and is much
faster and precise due to its Q-quadratic convergence rate.
  To demonstrate the method we evaluate the dimensions $\Delta$ of twist
operators in $sl(2)$ sector directly for any value of the spin $S$ including
non-integer values. In particular, we compute the BFKL pomeron intercept in a
wide range of the 't Hooft coupling constant with up to $20$ significant
figures precision, confirming two previously known from the perturbation theory
orders and giving prediction for several new coefficients. Furthermore, we
explore numerically a rich branch cut structure for complexified spin $S$.
