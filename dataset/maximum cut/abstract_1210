The electric and magnetic polarizabilities of an aperture are its important
characteristics in the theory of aperture coupling and diffraction of EM waves.
The beam coupling impedances due to a small discontinuity on the chamber wall
of an accelerator can also be expressed in terms of the polarizabilities of the
discontinuity. The polarizabilities are geometrical factors which can be found
by solving a static (electric or magnetic) problem. However, they are known in
an explicit analytical form only for a few simple-shaped discontinuities, such
as an elliptic hole in a thin wall. In the present paper the polarizabilities
of a ring-shaped cut in the wall of an arbitrary thickness are studied using a
combination of analytical, variational and numerical methods. The results are
applied to estimate the coupling impedances of button-type beam position
monitors.
