We study the fluctuations of the total topological charge of a scalar wave
propagating in a hollow conducting wave guide filled with scatterers inside. We
investigate the dependence of the screening on the scattering mean free path
and on the presence of boundaries. Near the cut-off frequencies of the wave
guide, screening is strongly suppressed near the boundaries. The resulting huge
fluctuations of the total topological charge are very sensitive to the
disorder.
