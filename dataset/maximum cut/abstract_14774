We study the behavior of persistent current of relativistic electrons on a
one dimensional ring in presence of attractive/repulsive scattering potentials.
In particular, we investigate the persistent current in accordance with the
strength as well as the number of the scattering potential. We find that in
presence of single scatterer the persistent current becomes smaller in
magnitude than the scattering free scenario. This behaviour is similar to the
non-relativistic case. Even for a very strong scattering potential, finite
amount of persistent current remains for a relativistic ring. In presence of
multiple scatterer we observe that the persistent current is maximum when the
scatterers are placed uniformly compared to the current averaged over random
configurations. However if we increase the number of scatterers, we find that
the random averaged current increases with the number of scatterers. The latter
behaviour is in contrast to the non-relativistic case.
