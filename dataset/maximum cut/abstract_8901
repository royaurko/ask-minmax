A new scheme for generating amplitude squeezed light by means of soliton
self-phase modulation is experimentally demonstrated. By injecting 180-fs
pulses into an equivalent Mach-Zehnder fiber interferometer, a maximum noise
reduction of $4.4 \pm 0.3$ dB is obtained ($6.3 \pm 0.6$ dB when corrected for
losses). The dependence of noise reduction on the interferometer splitting
ratio and fiber length is studied in detail.
