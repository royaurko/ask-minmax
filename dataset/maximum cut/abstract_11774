The low-field Bose-glass transition temperature in heavy-ion irradiated
Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8+d increases progressively with increasing density of
irradiation-induced columnar defects, but saturates for densities in excess of
1.5 x10^9 cm^-2. The maximum Bose-glass temperature corresponds to that above
which diffusion of two-dimensional pancake vortices between different vortex
lines becomes possible, and above which the ``line-like'' character of vortices
is lost. We develop a description of the Bose-glass line that is in excellent
quantitative agreement with the experimental line obtained for widely different
values of track density and material parameters.
