Giant flares can release large amounts of energy within a few days: X-ray
emission alone can be up to ten percent of the star's bolometric luminosity.
These flares exceed the luminosities of the largest solar flares by many orders
of magnitude, which suggests that the underlying physical mechanisms supplying
the energy are different from those on the Sun. Magnetic coupling between the
components in a binary system or between a young star and an accretion disk has
been proposed as a prerequisite for giant flares. Here we report X-ray
observations of a giant flare on Algol B, a giant star in an eclipsing binary
system. We observed a total X-ray eclipse of the flare, which demonstrates that
the plasma was confined to Algol B, and reached a maximum height of 0.6 stellar
radii above its surface. The flare occurred around the south pole of Algol B,
and energy must have been released continously throughout its life. We conclude
that a specific extrastellar environment is not required for the presence of a
flare, and that the processes at work are therefore similar to those on the
Sun.
