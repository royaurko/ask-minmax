The recently discovered sharp peak in the K+/pi+ ratio is discussed in the
framework of the statistical model. In this model a rapid change is expected as
the hadronic gas undergoes a transition from a baryon-dominated to a
meson-dominated gas. The transition happens at sqrt{s_{NN}} = 8.16 GeV,
temperature T = 140 MeV and baryon chemical potential mu_B = 410 MeV. The
maximum in the Lambda/pi ratio is well reproduced by the statistical model, but
the change in the K+/pi+ ratio is much less pronounced than the one observed by
the NA49 collaboration. Further experimental tests are proposed to clarify the
nature of the transition. In particular, the maxima expected in the statistical
model for the Xi/pi and Omega/pi ratios occur at slightly higher beam energies
than the maxima for the Lambda/pi and K+/pi+ ratios.
