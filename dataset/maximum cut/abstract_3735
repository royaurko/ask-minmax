The Clar number of a fullerene is the maximum number of independent resonant
hexagons in the fullerene. It is known that the Clar number of a fullerene with
n vertices is bounded above by [n/6]-2. We find that there are no fullerenes
whose order n is congruent to 2 modulo 6 attaining this bound. In other words,
the Clar number for a fullerene whose order n is congruent to 2 modulo 6 is
bounded above by [n/6]-3. Moreover, we show that two experimentally produced
fullerenes C80:1 (D5d) and C80:2 (D2) attain this bound. Finally, we present a
graph-theoretical characterization for fullerenes, whose order n is congruent
to 2 (respectively, 4) modulo 6, achieving the maximum Clar number [n/6]-3
(respectively, [n/6]-2).
