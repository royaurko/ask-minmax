Maximum likelihood estimators are often of limited practical use due to the
intensive computation they require. We propose a family of alternative
estimators that maximize a stochastic variation of the composite likelihood
function. Each of the estimators resolve the computation-accuracy tradeoff
differently, and taken together they span a continuous spectrum of
computation-accuracy tradeoff resolutions. We prove the consistency of the
estimators, provide formulas for their asymptotic variance, statistical
robustness, and computational complexity. We discuss experimental results in
the context of Boltzmann machines and conditional random fields. The
theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the
estimators when the computational resources are insufficient. They also
demonstrate that in some cases reduced computational complexity is associated
with robustness thereby increasing statistical accuracy.
