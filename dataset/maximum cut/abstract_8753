Generalizing the classical result of Bohr, we show that if an n-variable
power series converges in an n-circular bounded complete domain D and its sum
has modulus less than 1, then the sum of the maximum of the moduli of the terms
is less than 1 in the homothetic domain r*D, where r = 1 - (2/3)^(1/n). This
constant is near to the best one for the domain D = {z: |z_1| + ... + |z_n| <
1}.
