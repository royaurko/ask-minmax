The gluon propagator in Landau gauge is calculated in quenched QCD on a large
(32^3X64) lattice at beta=6.0. In order to assess finite volume and finite
lattice spacing artefacts, we also calculate the propagator on a smaller volume
for two different values of the lattice spacing. New structure seen in the
infrared region survives conservative cuts to the lattice data, and serves to
exclude a number of models that have appeared in the literature.
