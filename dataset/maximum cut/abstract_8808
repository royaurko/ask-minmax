We compute a parametric description of the totally mixed Nash equilibria of a
generic game in normal form with pre-fixed structure. Using this
representation, we show conditions under which a game has the maximum possible
number of this kind of equilibria. Then, we present a symbolic procedure that
allows us to describe and estimate the number of isolated totally mixed Nash
equilibria of an arbitrary game. Under certain assumptions, the algorithm
computes the exact number of these equilibria.
