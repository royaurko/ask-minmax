We investigate the sensitivity of the heavy ion mode of the LHC to Higgs
boson and Radion production via photon-photon fusion through the analysis of
the processes photon to photon photon, photon photon to b anti-b, and photon
photon to g g in peripheral heavy ion collisions. We suggest cuts to improve
the Higgs and Radion signal over standard model background ratio and determine
the capability of LHC to detect these particles production.
