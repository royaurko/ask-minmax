Laser-cooled neutral atoms from a low-velocity atomic source are guided via a
magnetic field generated between two parallel wires on a glass substrate. The
atoms bend around three curves, each with a 15-cm radius of curvature, while
traveling along a 10-cm-long track. A maximum flux of 2*10^6 atoms/sec is
achieved with a current density of 3*10^4 A/cm^2 in the
100x100-micrometer-cross-section wires. The kinetic energy of the guided atoms
in one transverse dimension is measured to be 42 microKelvin.
