We discuss the diagnostic potential of high cadence ultraviolet spectral data
when transient ionization is considered. For this we use high cadence UV
spectra taken during the impulsive phase of a solar flares (observed with
instruments on-board the Solar Maximum Mission) which showed excellent
correspondence with hard X-ray pulses. The ionization fraction of the
transition region ion O V and in particular the contribution function for the O
V 1371A line are computed within the Atomic Data and Analysis Structure, which
is a collection of fundamental and derived atomic data and codes which
manipulate them. Due to transient ionization, the O V 1371A line is enhanced in
the first fraction of a second with the peak in the line contribution function
occurring initially at a higher electron temperature than in ionization
equilibrium. The rise time and enhancement factor depend mostly on the electron
density. The fractional increase in the O V 1371A emissivity due to transient
ionization can reach a factor of 2--4 and can explain the fast response in the
line flux of transition regions ions during the impulsive phase of flares
solely as a result of transient ionization. This technique can be used to
diagnostic the electron temperature and density of solar flares observed with
the forth-coming Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph.
