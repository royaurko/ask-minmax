We compute the leading terms of the spectral action for orientable three
dimensional Bieberbach manifolds first, using two different methods: the
Poisson summation formula and the perturbative expansion. Assuming that the
cut-off function is not necessarily symmetric we find that that the scale
invariant part of the perturbative expansion might differ from the spectral
action of the flat three-torus by the eta invariant.
