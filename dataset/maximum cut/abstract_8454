Low-frequency Raman coupling coefficient of 11 different glasses is
evaluated. It is found that the coupling coefficient demonstrates a universal
linear frequency behavior near the boson peak maximum and a superlinear
behavior at very low frequencies. The last observation suggests vanishing of
the coupling coefficient when frequency tends to zero. The results are
discussed in terms of the vibration wavefunction that combines features of
localized and extended modes.
