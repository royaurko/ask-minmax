A qualitative study of the surface trapping of low-frequency non-radial
g-modes in rotating early-type stars is undertaken within the Cowling,
adiabatic and traditional approximations. It is demonstrated that, at
frequencies below a cut-off, waves cannot be fully trapped within the star, and
will leak through the surface. Expressions for the cut-off frequency are
derived in both the non-rotating and rotating cases; it is found from these
expressions that the cut-off frequency increases with the rotation rate for all
but prograde sectoral modes.
  The results are of possible relevance to the 53 Per and SPB classes of
variable star, which exhibit pulsation frequencies of the same order of
magnitude as the cut-off frequencies found for the stellar model. It is
suggested that observations either of an upper limit on variability periods
(corresponding to the cut-off), or of line-profile variations due to leaking
modes, may permit asteroseismological studies of the outer layers of these
systems.
