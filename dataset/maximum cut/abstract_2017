Coherent synchrotron emission by particles moving along semi-infinite tracks
is discussed, with a specific application to radio emission from air showers
induced by high-energy cosmic rays. It is shown that in general, radiation from
a particle moving along a semi-infinite orbit consists of usual synchrotron
emission and modified impulsive bremsstrahlung. The latter component is due to
the instantaneous onset of the curved trajectory of the emitting particle at
its creation. Inclusion of the bremsstrahlung leads to broadening of the
radiation pattern and a slower decay of the spectrum at the cut-off frequency
than the conventional synchrotron emission. Possible implications of these
features for air shower radio emission are discussed.
