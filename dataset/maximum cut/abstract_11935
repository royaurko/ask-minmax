Earlier investigation of Co_{0.2}Zn_{0.8}Fe_{1.95}Ho_{0.05}O_{4} spinel has
shown the existence of "super-ferromagnetic " clusters containing Fe^{3+} and
Ho^{3+} ions along with small size clusters of Fe^{3+} ions (Bhowmik et al, J.
Magn. Magn. Mater. {247}, 83 (2002)). Here, We report the static magnetic
response of these clusters. The experimental data suggests some interesting
magnetic features, such as, enhancement of magnetization; re-entrant magnetic
transitions with paramagnetic to ferromagnetic state below 225 K and
ferromagnetic to spin glass state below 120 K; appearance of field induced
ferromagnetism. We also observe an unusual maximum in the thermoremanent
magnetization (TRM) vs temperature data. Our measurements suggest that this
unusuality in TRM is related to the blocking of "super-ferromagnetic" clusters
,out of the ferromagnetic state, along their local anisotropy axis.
