The quasiclassical theory of a nanosize point contacts (PC) between two
ferromagnets is developed. The maximum available magnetoresistance values in PC
are calculated for ballistic versus diffusive transport through the area of a
contact. In the ballistic regime the magnetoresistance in excess of few
hundreds percents is obtained for the iron-group ferromagnets. The necessary
conditions for realization of so large magnetoresistance in PC, and the
experimental results by Garcia et al are discussed
