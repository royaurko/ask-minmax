So far the highly unstable phase of luminous blue variables (LBVs) has not
been understood well. It is still uncertain why and which massive stars enter
this phase. Investigating the variabilities by looking for a possible regular
or even (semi-)periodic behaviour could give a hint at the underlying mechanism
for these variations and might answer the question of where these variabilities
originate. Finding out more about the LBV phase also means understanding
massive stars better in general, which have (e.g. by enriching the ISM with
heavy elements, providing ionising radiation and kinetic energy) a strong and
significant influence on the ISM, hence also on their host galaxy. Photometric
and spectroscopic data were taken for the LBV Var C in M33 to investigate its
recent status. In addition, scanned historic plates, archival data, and data
from the literature were gathered to trace Var C's behaviour in the past. Its
long-term variability and periodicity was investigated. Our investigation of
the variability indicates possible (semi-)periodic behaviour with a period of
42.3 years for Var C. That Var C's light curve covers a time span of more than
100 years means that more than two full periods of the cycle are visible. The
critical historic maximum around 1905 is less strong but discernible even with
the currently rare historic data. The semi-periodic and secular structure of
the light curve is similar to the one of LMC R71. Both light curves hint at a
new aspect in the evolution of LBVs.
