The effects on CMB measurements of foreground contamination due to
synchrotron radiation, free-free emission and discrete sources are considered.
Estimates of the level and power spectrum of the Galactic fluctuations are made
using low frequency maps and recent Tenerife data. New methods for achieving a
frequency-based separation of Galactic and CMB components are discussed, and a
positive/negative maximum entropy algorithm shown to be particularly powerful
in this respect.
