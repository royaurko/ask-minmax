We propose a Bragg spectroscopy experiment to measure the onset of superfluid
pairing in ultracold trapped Fermi gases. In particular, we study two component
Fermi gases in the weak coupling BCS and BEC limits as well as in the strong
coupling unitarity limit. The low temperature Bragg spectrum exhibits a gap
directly related to the pair-breaking energy. Furthermore, the Bragg spectrum
has a large maximum just below the critical temperature when the gas is
superfluid in the BCS limit. In the unitarity regime, we show how the pseudogap
in the normal phase leads to a significant suppression of the low frequency
Bragg spectrum.
