We develop a high-order kinetic scheme for entropy-based moment models of a
one-dimensional linear kinetic equation in slab geometry. High-order spatial
reconstructions are achieved using the weighted essentially non-oscillatory
(WENO) method, and for time integration we use multi-step Runge-Kutta methods
which are strong stability preserving and whose stages and steps can be written
as convex combinations of forward Euler steps. We show that the moment vectors
stay in the realizable set using these time integrators along with a maximum
principle-based kinetic-level limiter, which simultaneously dampens spurious
oscillations in the numerical solutions. We present numerical results both on a
manufactured solution, where we perform convergence tests showing our scheme
converges of the expected order up to the numerical noise from the numerical
optimization, as well as on two standard benchmark problems, where we show some
of the advantages of high-order solutions and the role of the key parameter in
the limiter.
