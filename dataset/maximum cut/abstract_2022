A simple method for categorizing texts into predetermined text genre
categories using the statistical standard technique of discriminant analysis is
demonstrated with application to the Brown corpus. Discriminant analysis makes
it possible use a large number of parameters that may be specific for a certain
corpus or information stream, and combine them into a small number of
functions, with the parameters weighted on basis of how useful they are for
discriminating text genres. An application to information retrieval is
discussed.
