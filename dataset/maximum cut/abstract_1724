For a class $\mathcal{C}$ of binary linear codes, we write
$\theta_{\mathcal{C}}\colon (0,1) \to [0,\frac{1}{2}]$ for the
maximum-likelihood decoding threshold function of $\mathcal{C}$, the function
whose value at $R \in (0,1)$ is the largest bit-error rate $p$ that codes in
$\mathcal{C}$ can tolerate with a negligible probability of maximum-likelihood
decoding error across a binary symmetric channel. We show that, if
$\mathcal{C}$ is the class of cycle codes of graphs, then
$\theta_{\mathcal{C}}(R) \le \frac{(1-\sqrt{R})^2}{2(1+R)}$ for each $R$, and
show that equality holds only when $R$ is asymptotically achieved by cycle
codes of regular graphs.
