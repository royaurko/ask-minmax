We examine an ensemble of 48 simulated clusters to determine the effects of
small-scale density fluctuations and large-scale substructure on X-ray
measurements of the intracluster medium (ICM) mass. We measure RMS density
fluctuations in the ICM which can be characterized by a mean mass-weighted
clumping factor C = <rho^2>/<rho>^2 between 1.3 and 1.4 within a density
contrast of 500 times the critical density. These fluctuations arise from the
cluster history of accretion shocks and major mergers, and their presence
enhances the cluster's luminosity relative to the smooth case. We expect,
therefore, that ICM mass measurements utilizing models which assume uniform
density at a given radius carry a bias of order sqrt(C) = 1.16. We verify this
result by performing ICM mass measurements on X-ray images of the simulations
and finding the expected level of bias.
  The varied cluster morphologies in our ensemble also allow us to investigate
the effects of departures from spherical symmetry on our measurements. We find
that the presence of large-scale substructure does not further bias the
resulting gas mass unless it is pronounced enough to produce a second peak in
the image of at least 1% the maximum surface brightness. We analyze the subset
of images with no secondary peaks and find a bias of 9% and a Gaussian random
error of 4% in the derived mass.
