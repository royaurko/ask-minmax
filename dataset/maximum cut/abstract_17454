The application of HTS coated conductors in future fusion or accelerator
magnets is currently of increasing interest. High Lorentz forces and therefore
high hoop stresses act on the conductors in large coils. The conductor is
furthermore exposed to neutron radiation in fusion or accelerator magnets. The
expected neutron fluence over the desired lifetime of such magnets can be
simulated by irradiation experiments in a fission reactor. The coated
conductors were characterized in the pristine state and after irradiation to
the ITER design fluence. The sensitivity of the critical currents to applied
stress was measured in liquid nitrogen. The cold part of the set-up was
positioned between a rotatable split coil electro-magnet for assessing the
Ic-anisotropy up to 1.4T under maximum Lorentz force configuration. The
Ic-sensitivity to applied stress changed significantly in the
GdBCO/IBADconductors after irradiation, whereas nearly no change was observed
in the YBCO/RABiTS-conductor. Furthermore, Ic and Tc were strongly reduced in
the GdBCO/IBAD-sample after irradiation. The angular dependence of Ic changed
for both samples in different ways after the irradiation, but no change in the
angular dependence was observed upon applying stress. The high neutron capture
cross-section of Gd and the resulting strong reduction of Tc seem to be
responsible for the different stress dependence of Ic in irradiated Gd-123
coated conductors.
