We prove that 1-loop n-point NMHV superamplitudes in N=4 SYM theory are dual
conformal covariant for all numbers n of external particles (after
regularization and subtraction of IR divergences). This property was previously
established for n < 10 in arXiv:0808.0491. We derive an explicit representation
of these superamplitudes in terms of dual conformal cross-ratios. We also show
that all the 1-loop `box coefficients' obtained from maximal cuts of N^kMHV
n-point functions are covariant under dual conformal transformations.
