The existence of a random attractor for the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo system
defined on an unbounded domain is established. The pullback asymptotic
compactness of the stochastic system is proved by uniform estimates on
solutions for large space and time variables. These estimates are obtained by a
cut-off technique.
