We study the dynamics and equilibrium profile shapes of contact lines for
wetting in the case of a spatially inhomogeneous solid wall with stripe
defects. Using a phase-field model with conserved dynamics, we first
numerically determine the contact line behavior in the case of a stripe defect
of varying width. For narrow defects, we find that the maximum distortion of
the contact line and the healing length are related to the defect width, while
for wide defects, they saturate to constant values. This behavior is in
quantitative agreement with experimental data. In addition, we examine the
shape of the contact line between two stripe defects as a function of their
separation. Using the phase-field model, we also analytically estimate the
contact line configuration, and find good qualitative agreement with the
numerical results.
