Further to the proposal and application of a stochastic methodology and the
resulting first exit time distribution function to life table data we introduce
a theoretical framework for the estimation of the maximum deterioration age and
to explore on how "vitality," according to Halley and Strehler and Mildvan,
changes during the human lifetime. The mortality deceleration or mortality
leveling-off is also explored. The effect of the deterioration over time is
estimated as the expectation that an individual will survive from the
deterioration caused in his organism by the deterioration mechanism. A method
is proposed and the appropriate software was developed for the estimation of
life expectancy. Several applications follow. The method was applied to the
Halley life table data of Breslau. Extrapolations are done showing a gradual
improvement of vitality mechanisms during last centuries.
