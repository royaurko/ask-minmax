Based on FORS2-VLT long-slit spectroscopy, the analysis of the central
absorption line indices of 9 S0 galaxies in the Fornax Cluster is presented.
Central indices correlate with central velocity dispersions as observed in
ellipticals. However, the stellar population properties of these S0s indicates
that the observed trends are produced by relative differences in age and
alpha-element abundances and not in metallicity ([Fe/H]) as previous studies
have found in elliptical galaxies. The observed scatter in the line indices vs.
velocity dispersion relations can be partially explained by the
rotationally-supported nature of many of these systems. The presence of tighter
line indices vs. maximum (circular) rotational velocity relations confirms this
statement. It was also confirmed that the dynamical mass is the driving
physical property of all these correlations and in our Fornax S0s it has to be
estimated assuming rotational support.
