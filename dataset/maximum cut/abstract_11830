The present paper proposes a Statistical Mechanics approach to the inherent
states of glassy systems and granular materials, following the original ideas
developed by Edwards for granular materials. Two lattice models, a diluted Spin
Glass and a system of hard-spheres under gravity, introduced in the context of
glassy systems and granular materials, are evolved using a ``tap dynamics''
analogous to that of experiments on granular materials. The asymptotic
macrostates, reached by the system, are shown to be described by a single
thermodynamical parameter, and this parameter to coincide with the temperature,
called the ``configurational temperature'', predicted assuming that the
distribution among the inherent states satisfies the principle of maximum
entropy.
