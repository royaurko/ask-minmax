By referring to the procedures developed in the preceeding paper, we
re-analyze the L/E distribution for Fully Contained Events resulting from
quasi-elatic scattering (QEL) obtained from the Super-Kamiokande Experiment in
relation to their assumption that the direction of the incident neutrino
coincide with that of the produced leptons. As the result of it, we clarify
that they do not measure L_nu/E_nu distribution itself, but L_mu/E_nu
distribution, which cannot show the maximum oscillation existed in the original
L_nu/E_nu distribution, because L_nu could not be approximated by L_mu due to
the backscattering effect and the azimuthal angle effect in QEL.
