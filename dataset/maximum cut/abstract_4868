We study the resummation of large logarithmic perturbative corrections to the
partonic cross sections relevant for di-hadron production in hadronic
collisions, H1 H2 -> h1 h2 X, at high invariant mass of the produced hadron
pair. These corrections arise near the threshold for the partonic reaction and
are associated with soft-gluon emission. We perform the resummation to
next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, and show how to incorporate consistently
cuts in rapidity and transverse momentum of the observed particles. We present
numerical results for fixed-target and ISR regimes and find enhancements over
the next-to-leading order cross section, which significantly improve the
agreement between theoretical predictions and data.
