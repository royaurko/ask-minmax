We apply a hybrid Molecular Dynamics and mesoscopic simulation technique to
study the dynamics of two dimensional colloidal discs in confined geometries.
We calculate the velocity autocorrelation functions, and observe the predicted
$t^{-1}$ long time hydrodynamic tail that characterizes unconfined fluids, as
well as more complex oscillating behavior and negative tails for strongly
confined geometries. Because the $t^{-1}$ tail of the velocity autocorrelation
function is cut off for longer times in finite systems, the related diffusion
coefficient does not diverge, but instead depends logarithmically on the
overall size of the system.
