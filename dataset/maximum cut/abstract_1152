Geodesic motion in traversable Schwarzschild and Kerr thin-shell wormholes
constructed by the cut-and-paste method introduced by Visser (1989 Nucl. Phys.
B 328 203; 1995 Wormholes: from Einstein to Hawking (Woodbury, MN: American
Institute of Physics)) is studied. The orbits are calculated exactly in terms
of elliptic functions and visualized with the help of embedding diagrams.
