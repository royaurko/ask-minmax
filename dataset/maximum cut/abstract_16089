We have imaged a region of about 5' extent surrounding Sgr A* in the HI 21
cm-line absorption using the Very Large Array. A Gaussian decomposition of the
optical depth spectra at positions within about 2' (approx. 5 pc at 8.5 kpc) of
Sgr A* detects a wide line underlying the many narrow absorption lines. The
wide line has a mean peak optical depth of 0.32 +/- 0.12 centered at a mean
velocity of V(lsr) = -4 +/- 15 km/s. The mean full width at half maximum is 119
+/- 42 km/s. Such a wide line is absent in the spectra at positions beyond
about 2' from Sgr A*. The position-velocity diagrams in optical depth reveal
that the wide line originates in various components of the circumnuclear disk
(radius approx. 1.3') surrounding Sgr A*. These components contribute to the
optical depth of the wide line in different velocity ranges. The
position-velocity diagrams do not reveal any diffuse feature which could be
attributed to a large number of HI clouds along the line of sight to Sgr A*.
Consequently, the wide line has no implications either to a global population
of shocked HI clouds in the Galaxy or to the energetics of the interstellar
medium as was earlier thought.
