Augmented reality has became an useful tool in many areas from space
exploration to military applications. Although used theoretical principles are
well known for almost a decade, the augmented reality is almost exclusively
used in high budget solutions with a special hardware. However, in last few
years we could see rising popularity of many projects focused on deployment of
the augmented reality on different mobile devices. Our article is aimed on
developers who consider development of an augmented reality application for the
mainstream market. Such developers will be forced to keep the application
price, therefore also the development price, at reasonable level. Usage of
existing image processing software library could bring a significant cut-down
of the development costs. In the theoretical part of the article is presented
an overview of the augmented reality application structure. Further, an
approach for selection appropriate library as well as the review of the
existing software libraries focused in this area is described. The last part of
the article outlines our implementation of key parts of the augmented reality
application using the OpenCV library.
