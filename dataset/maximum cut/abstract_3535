We study, both numerically and analytically, a Binary-Agent-Resource (B-A-R)
model consisting of N agents who compete for a limited resource 1/2<L/N <1,
where L is the maximum available resource per turn for all N agents. As L
increases, the system exhibits well-defined plateaux regions in the success
rate which are separated from each other by abrupt transitions. Both the
maximum and the mean success rates over each plateau are 'quantized' -- for
example, the maximum success rate forms a well-defined sequence of simple
fractions as L increases. We present an analytic theory which explains these
surprising phenomena both qualitatively and quantitatively. The underlying
cause of this complex behavior is an interesting self-organized phenomenon in
which the system, in response to the global resource level, effectively avoids
particular patterns of historical outcomes.
