We report on three-dimensional (3D) MHD simulations of recurrent mini
CME-like eruptions in a small active region (AR), which is formed by the
dynamical emergence of a twisted (not kink unstable) flux tube from the solar
interior. The eruptions are developed as a result of repeated formation and
expulsion of new flux ropes due to continous emergence and reconnection of
sheared fieldlines along the polarity inversion line (PIL) of the AR. The
acceleration of the eruptions is triggered by tether-cutting reconnection at
the current sheet underneath the erupting field. We find that each explosive
eruption is followed by reformation of a sigmoidal structure and a subsequent
sigmoid-to-flare arcade transformation in the AR. These results might have
implications for recurrent CMEs and eruptive sigmoids/flares observations and
theoretical studies.
