Intermediate spin states that occur in electrostatic dots in the magnetic
field regime just beyond the maximum density droplet are investigated. The
5-electron system is studied with exact diagonalization and group theory. The
results indicate that the intermediate spin states are mixed symmetry states
with a superposition of 5- and 4-fold electron-molecule configurations. A
superposition of 5- and 4-fold correlation functions is found to reproduce the
exact mixed symmetry pair correlation function to around 2%.
