The maximum cardinality of an induced $2$-regular subgraph of a graph $G$ is
denoted by $c_{\rm ind}(G)$. We prove that if $G$ is an $r$-regular graph of
order $n$, then $c_{\rm ind}(G) \geq \frac{n}{2(r-1)} + \frac{1}{(r-1)(r-2)}$
and we prove that if $G$ is a cubic claw-free graph on order $n$, then $c_{\rm
ind}(G) > 13n/20$ and this bound is asymptotically best possible.
