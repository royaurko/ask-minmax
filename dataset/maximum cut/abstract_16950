We studied the pressure-induced superconductor CeIrSi$_3$ with the
non-centrosymmetric tetragonal structure under high pressure. The electrical
resistivity and ac heat capacity were measured in the same run for the same
sample. The critical pressure was determined to be $P_{\rm c}$ = 2.25 GPa,
where the antiferromagnetic state disappears. The heat capacity $C_{\rm ac}$
shows both antiferromagnetic and superconducting transitions at pressures close
to $P_{\rm c}$. On the other hand, the superconducting region is extended to
high pressures of up to about 3.5 GPa, with the maximum transition temperature
$T_{\rm sc}$ = 1.6 K around $2.5-2.7$ GPa. At 2.58 GPa, a large heat capacity
anomaly was observed at $T_{\rm sc}$ = 1.59 K. The jump of the heat capacity in
the form of ${\Delta}{C_{\rm ac}}/C_{\rm ac}(T_{\rm sc})$ is 5.7 $\pm$ 0.1.
This is the largest observed value among previously reported superconductors,
indicating the strong-coupling superconductivity. The electronic specific heat
coefficient at $T_{\rm sc}$ is, however, approximately unchanged as a function
of pressure, even at $P_{\rm c}$.
