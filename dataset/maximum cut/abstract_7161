We revisit in this work the problem of the maximum masses of magnetized White
Dwarfs (WD). The impact of a strong magnetic field onto the structure equations
is addressed. The pressures become anisotropic due to the presence of the
magnetic field and split into a parallel and perpendicular components. We first
construct stable solutions of TOV equations for the parallel pressures, and
found that physical solutions vanish for the perpendicular pressure when $B
\gtrsim 10^{13}$ G. This fact establishes an upper bound for a magnetic field
and the stability of the configurations in the (quasi) spherical approximation.
Our findings also indicate that it is not possible to obtain stable magnetized
WD with super Chandrasekhar masses because the values of the magnetic field
needed for them are higher than this bound. To proceed into the anisotropic
regime, we derived structure equations appropriated for a cylindrical metric
with anisotropic pressures. From the solutions of the structure equations in
cylindrical symmetry we have confirmed the same bound for $B \sim 10^{13} $ G,
since beyond this value no physical solutions are possible. Our tentative
conclusion is that massive WD, with masses well beyond the Chandrasekhar limit
do not constitute stable solutions and should not exist.
