Motivated by the achievements of the $X$-ray scattering technique, we
analyzed the profile of the light scattering intensity $R(q, \omega)$ at a
finite $q$ in a 2D Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Previous Raman scattering
studies at $q=0$ identified the two-magnon peak in $B_{1g}$ scattering
geometry. We found that the $B_{1g}$ peak disperses downwards at a finite $q$,
and its intensity increases, reaching its maximum at $q= q_0 = (0, \pi)$ and
symmetry related points. In addition, the intensity in the $A_{1g}$ geometry
becomes non-zero at a finite $q$, and also displays a two-magnon peak which
gains strength and disperses to larger frequencies with increasing $q$, and
reaches its highest intensity at $q_0$. We found that the profile of $R(q_0,
\omega)$ is equivalent in $A_{1g}$ and $B_{1g}$ geometries.
