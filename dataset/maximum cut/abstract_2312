The S-matrix in the static limit of a dispersion relation is a matrix of a
finite order N of meromorphic functions of energy $\omega$ in the plane with
cuts $(-\infty,-1],[+1,+\infty)$. In the elastic case it reduces to N functions
$S_{i}(\omega)$ connected by the crossing symmetry matrix A. The scattering of
a neutral pseodoscalar meson with an arbitrary angular momentum l at a source
with spin 1/2 is considered (N=2). The Regge trajectories of this model are
explicitly found.
