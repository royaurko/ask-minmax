There may be a high-energy cutoff of neutrino events in IceCube data. In
particular, IceCube does not observe either continuum events above 2 PeV, or
the Standard Model Glashow-resonance events expected at 6.3 PeV. There are also
no higher energy neutrino signatures in the ANITA and Auger experiments. This
absence of high-energy neutrino events motivates a fundamental restriction on
neutrino energies above a few PeV. We postulate a simple scenario to terminate
the neutrino spectrum that is Lorentz-invariance violating, but with a limiting
neutrino velocity that is always smaller than the speed of light. If the
limiting velocity of the neutrino applies also to its associated charged
lepton, then a significant consequence is that the two-body decay modes of the
charged pion are forbidden above two times the maximum neutrino energy, while
the radiative decay modes are suppressed at higher energies. Such stabilized
pions may serve as cosmic ray primaries.
