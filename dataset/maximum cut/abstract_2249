The cross-section for a charged pion pair production by two photons is
evaluated by using the low energy expression previously obtained from current
algebra and PCAC which involves an integral over a vector and axial-vector
spectral functions. Data on the latter obtained from tau-decay as measured by
the ALEPH collaboration is then inserted in the integral which is appropriately
modified in order to eliminate contributions near the cut in the duality
contour integral. The experimental behavior of the cross-section for
gamma-gamma into pi (+)-pi(-) is well reproduced at low energies.
