Carbon ion is the mostly common used particle in heavy ion radiotherapy. In
this paper, carbon ion dose in tumor treatment for human eye was simulated with
FLUKA code, 80 MeV/u carbon beam was irradiated into the human eye from two
directions, The first is from the lateral-forward direction which was a typical
therapeutic condition, maximum dose was deposited in the tumor volume. The
second one was that beam irradiated into eyes from the forward direction which
may cause certain medical accident. The calculated results are compared with
other reports. The agreement indicates that this method can be used for
treatment plan in heavy ion radiotherapy.
