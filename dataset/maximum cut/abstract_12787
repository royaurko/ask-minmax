A binary poset code of codimension M (of cardinality 2^{N-M}, where N is the
code length) can correct maximum M errors. All possible poset metrics that
allow codes of codimension M to be M-, (M-1)- or (M-2)-perfect are described.
Some general conditions on a poset which guarantee the nonexistence of perfect
poset codes are derived; as examples, we prove the nonexistence of R-perfect
poset codes for some R in the case of the crown poset and in the case of the
union of disjoin chains. Index terms: perfect codes, poset codes
