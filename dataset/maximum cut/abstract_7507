We present a model for the observed hierarchies among the Yukawa couplings of
the standard model in the context of an effective low energy theory with an
anomalous U(1) symmetry. This symmetry, a generic feature of superstring
compactification, is a remnant of the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation
mechanism. The gauge group is that of the standard model, augmented by X, the
anomalous U(1), and two family-dependent phase symmetries $Y^{(1)}$ and
$Y^{(2)}$. The correct hierarchies are reproduced only when $sin^2\theta_w=3/8$
at the cut-off. To cancel anomalies, right-handed neutrinos and other standard
model singlets must be introduced. Independently of the charges of the
right-handed neutrinos, this model produces the same neutrino mixing matrix and
an inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses. The heaviest is the electron neutrino
with a mass $\sim 1$ meV, and mixing of the order of $\lambda_c^3$ with each of
the other two neutrinos.
