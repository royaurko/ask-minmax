When combining the BCS expression of Tc with a shear modulus constant model,
we can demonstrate that Tc oscillates depending on the number of the cuprate
planes and that it reaches its first maximum for three planes. This is in good
agreement with experimental data and suggests that the electron- phonon
coupling is essential to the superconductivity of the cuprates.
