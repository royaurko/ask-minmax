We have investigated a sample of 5088 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Second Data Release in order to determine how the frequency and
properties of broad absorptions lines (BALs) depend on black hole mass,
bolometric luminosity, Eddington fraction (L/L_Edd), and spectral slope. We
focus only on high-ionization BALs and find a number of significant results.
While quasars accreting near the Eddington limit are more likely to show BALs
than lower $L/L_{Edd}$ systems, BALs are present in quasars accreting at only a
few percent Eddington. We find a stronger effect with bolometric luminosity,
such that the most luminous quasars are more likely to show BALs. There is an
additional effect, previously known, that BAL quasars are redder on average
than unabsorbed quasars. The strongest effects involving the quasar physical
properties and BAL properties are related to terminal outflow velocity. Maximum
observed outflow velocities increase with both the bolometric luminosity and
the blueness of the spectral slope, suggesting that the ultraviolet luminosity
to a great extent determines the acceleration. These results support the idea
of outflow acceleration via ultraviolet line scattering.
