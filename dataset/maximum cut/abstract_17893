The Acoustomagnetoelectric Effect (AME) in Graphene Nanoribbon (GNR) was
theoretically studied using the Boltzmann kinetic equation. On open circuit,
the general formular for Surface Acoustomagnetoelectric field
($\vec{E}_{SAME}$) in GNR with energy dispersion $\varepsilon(p)$ near the
Fermi point was calculated. The $E_{SAME}$ was found to depend on the magnetic
strength ($\eta$), $\alpha$ = ${\hbar \omega_q}/{E_g}$ and the energy gap
($E_g$). The expression for $\vec{E}_{SAME}$ was analyzed numerically for
varying width of GNR, magnetic strength ($\eta$) and $\alpha$ at different
sub-bands indices ($p_i$). It was noted that the dependence of $\vec{E}_{SAME}$
on the width of GNR increased to a saturation point of approximately
$15$Vcm$^{-1}$ and remained constant. For $E_{SAME}$ versus $\eta$, the
$E_{SAME}$ increases rapidly to a maximum point and then decayed to a constant
minimum value. The graph was modulated either by varying the width of GNR or
the sub-band index $p_i$ with an inversion occurring at $p_i = 6$. The
dependence of $E_{SAME}$ versus $\alpha$ was analyzed. The $E_{SAME}$ was
constant up to a point and sharply increased asymptotically at approximately
$\alpha = 1$. A $3$D graph of $\vec{E}_{SAME}$ with $\eta$ and width is also
presented. This study is relevant for investigating the properties of GNR.
