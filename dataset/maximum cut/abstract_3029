We report the transition towards a type 1 Seyfert experienced by the
classical type 2 Seyfert nucleus in NGC 7582. The transition, found at most 20
days from its maximum peak, presents a unique opportunity to study these rare
events in detail. At maximum the Ha line width is of about 12000 km/s. We
examine three scenarios that could potentially explain the transition: capture
of a star by a supermassive black hole, a reddening change in the surrounding
torus, and the radiative onset of a type IIn supernova exploding in a compact
nuclear/circumnuclear starburst.
