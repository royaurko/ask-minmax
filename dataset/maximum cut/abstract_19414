We present a census of the active black hole population at 1<z<2, by
constructing the bivariate distribution function of black hole mass and
Eddington ratio, employing a maximum likelihood fitting technique. The study of
the active black hole mass function (BHMF) and the Eddington ratio distribution
function (ERDF) allows us to clearly disentangle the active galactic nuclei
(AGN) downsizing phenomenon, present in the AGN luminosity function, into its
physical processes of black hole mass downsizing and accretion rate evolution.
We are utilizing type-1 AGN samples from three optical surveys (VVDS, zCOSMOS
and SDSS), that cover a wide range of 3 dex in luminosity over our redshift
interval of interest. We investigate the cosmic evolution of the AGN population
as a function of AGN luminosity, black hole mass and accretion rate. Compared
to z = 0, we find a distinct change in the shape of the BHMF and the ERDF,
consistent with downsizing in black hole mass. The active fraction or duty
cycle of type-1 AGN at z~1.5 is almost flat as a function of black hole mass,
while it shows a strong decrease with increasing mass at z=0. We are witnessing
a phase of intense black hole growth, which is largely driven by the onset of
AGN activity in massive black holes towards z=2. We finally compare our results
to numerical simulations and semi-empirical models and while we find reasonable
agreement over certain parameter ranges, we highlight the need to refine these
models in order to match our observations.
