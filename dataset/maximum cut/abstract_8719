Two-gluon radiative corrections to the $b\to c\ell\nu$ decay width have been
computed analytically as an expansion in terms of \frac{m_c}{m_b} << 1 in the
kinematical limit of zero lepton invariant mass. The obtained results match
smoothly with a previously known expansion around (1 - \frac{m_c}{m_b} << 1.
Together they describe the process $b\to c\ell\nu$ for all mass ratios
\frac{m_c}{m_b}.
