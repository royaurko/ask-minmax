Recently a powerful duality between color and kinematics has been proposed
for integrands of scattering amplitudes in quite general gauge theories. In
this paper the duality proposal is extended to the more general class of gauge
theory observables formed by form factors. After a discussion of the general
setup the existence of the duality is verified in two- and three-loop examples
in four dimensional maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory which involve
the stress energy tensor multiplet. In these cases the duality reproduces known
results in a particularly transparent and uniform way. As a non-trivial
application we obtain a very simple form of the integrand of the four-loop
two-point (Sudakov) form factor which passes a large set of unitarity cut
checks.
