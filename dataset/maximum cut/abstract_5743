It is shown, that initial conditions in the quasi-Heisenberg quantization
scheme can be set at an initial cosmological singularity per se. This
possibility is provided by finiteness of some quantities, namely momentums of
the dynamical variables, at a singularity, in spite of infinity of the
dynamical variables themselves. The uncertainty principle allows avoiding a
necessity to set values of the dynamical variables at singularity, as a wave
packet can be expressed through the finite momentums. The issue of a vacuum
energy, arising during evolution when the gravitational waves appear, is
addressed as well. It is shown that, in the certain gauge, the equations of
motion contain a difference of kinetic and potential energies of the field
oscillators. Thus, in this gauge, the leading divergent parts of the vacuum
energy in the equations of motion cancel each other. It is conjectured that the
UV cut-off allows physical interpretation of the weakly divergent part of the
vacuum energy.
