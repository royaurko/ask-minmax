The ferroelectric (Sm C$^*$) -- antiferroelectric (Sm C$^*_A$) -- reentrant
ferroelectric (re Sm C$^*$) phase temperature sequence was observed for system
with competing synclinic - anticlinic interactions. The basic properties of
this system are as follows (1) the Sm C$^*$ phase is metastable in temperature
range of the Sm C$^*_A$ stability (2) the double inversions of the helix
handedness at Sm C$^*$ -- Sm C$^*_A$ and Sm C$^*_A$% -- re-Sm C$^*$ phase
transitions were found (3) the threshold electric field that is necessary to
induce synclinic ordering in the Sm C$^*_A$ phase decreases near both Sm
C$^*_A$ -- Sm C$^*$ and Sm C$^*_A$ -- re-Sm C$^*$ phase boundaries, and it has
maximum in the middle of the Sm C$^*_A$ stability region. All these properties
are properly described by simple Landau model that accounts for nearest
neighboring layer steric interactions and quadrupolar ordering only.
