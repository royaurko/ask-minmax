We use the Millennium Simulation series to study how the dynamical state of
dark matter halos affects the relation between mass and concentration. We find
that a large fraction of massive systems are identified when they are
substantially out of equilibrium and in a particular phase of their dynamical
evolution: the more massive the halo, the more likely it is found at a
transient stage of high concentration. This state reflects the recent assembly
of massive halos and corresponds to the first pericentric passage of
recently-accreted material when, before virialization, the kinetic and
potential energies reach maximum and minimum values, respectively. This result
explains the puzzling upturn in the mass-concentration relation reported in
recent work for massive halos; indeed, the upturn disappears when only
dynamically-relaxed systems are considered in the analysis. Our results warn
against applying simple equilibrium models to describe the structure of rare,
massive galaxy clusters and urges caution when extrapolating scaling laws
calibrated on lower-mass systems, where such deviations from equilibrium are
less common. The evolving dynamical state of galaxy clusters ought to be
carefully taken into account if cluster studies are to provide precise
cosmological constraints.
