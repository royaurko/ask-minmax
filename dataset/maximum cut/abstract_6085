We present a continuous-time maximum likelihood estimation methodology for
credit rating transition probabilities, taking into account the presence of
censored data. We perform rolling estimates of the transition matrices with
exponential time weighting with varying horizons and discuss the underlying
dynamics of transition generator matrices in the long-term and short-term
estimation horizons.
