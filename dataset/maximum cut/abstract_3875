The acceleration time scale for the process of first-order Fermi acceleration
in relativistic shock waves with oblique magnetic field configurations is
investigated by the method of Monte Carlo particle simulations. We demonstrate
the presence of correlation between the particle energy gain at interaction
with the shock and the respective time elapsed since the previous interaction.
Because of that any derivation of the acceleration time scale can not use the
distribution of energy gains and the distribution of times separately. The time
scale discussed in the present paper, $T_{acc}^{(c)}$, is the one describing
the rate of change of the particle spectrum cut-off energy in the time
dependent evolution. It is derived using a simplified method involving small
amplitude particle momentum scattering and intended to model the situations
with anisotropic cosmic ray distributions. We consider shocks with parallel, as
well as oblique, sub- and super-luminal magnetic field configurations with
finite amplitude perturbations, $\delta B$. We got some interesting results
like non-monotonic changes of $T_{acc}^{(c)}$ with $\delta B$, which arises due
to the particle cross-field diffusion.
