The equation of state for neutron stars in a wide-density range at zero
temperature is constructed. The chiral quark-meson coupling model within
relativistic Hartree-Fock approximation is adopted for uniform nuclear matter.
The coupling constants are determined so as to reproduce the experimental data
of atomic nuclei and hypernuclei. In the crust region, nuclei are taken into
account within the Thomas-Fermi calculation. All octet baryons are considered
in the core region, while only $\Xi^{-}$ appears in neutron stars. The
resultant maximum mass of neutron stars is $1.95M_\odot$, which is consistent
with the constraint from the recently observed massive pulsar, PSR J1614-2230.
