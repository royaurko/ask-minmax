We provide a polyhedral description of the conditions for the existence of
the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for a hierarchical log-linear model. The
MLE exists if and only if the observed margins lie in the relative interior of
the marginal cone. Using this description, we give an algorithm for determining
if the MLE exists. If the tree width is bounded, the algorithm runs in
polynomial time. We also perform a computational study of the case of three
random variables under the no three-factor effect model.
