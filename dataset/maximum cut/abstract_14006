Saddle-node bifurcation occurs in a boost converter when parasitic inductor
resistance is modeled. Closed-form critical conditions of the bifurcation are
derived. If the parasitic inductor resistance is modeled, the saddle-node
bifurcation occurs in the voltage mode control or in the current mode control
with the voltage loop closed, but not in the current mode control with the
voltage loop open. If the parasitic inductor resistance is not modeled, the
saddle-node bifurcation does not occur, and one may be misled by the wrong
dynamics and the wrong steady-state solutions. The saddle-node bifurcation
still exists even in a boost converter with a popular type-III compensator.
When the saddle-node bifurcation occurs, multiple steady-state solutions may
coexist. The converter may operate with a voltage jump from one solution to
another. Care should be taken in the compensator design to ensure that only the
desired solution is stabilized. In industry practice, the solution with a
higher duty cycle (and thus the saddle-node bifurcation) may be prevented by
placing a limitation on the maximum duty cycle.
