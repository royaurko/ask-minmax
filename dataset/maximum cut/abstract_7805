In our previous work "An Algebraic Watchdog for Wireless Network Coding", we
proposed a new scheme in which nodes can detect malicious behaviors
probabilistically, police their downstream neighbors locally using overheard
messages; thus, provide a secure global "self-checking network". As the first
building block of such a system, we focused on a two-hop network, and presented
a graphical model to understand the inference process by which nodes police
their downstream neighbors and to compute the probabilities of misdetection and
false detection.
  In this paper, we extend the Algebraic Watchdog to a more general network
setting, and propose a protocol in which we can establish "trust" in coded
systems in a distributed manner. We develop a graphical model to detect the
presence of an adversarial node downstream within a general two-hop network.
The structure of the graphical model (a trellis) lends itself to well-known
algorithms, such as Viterbi algorithm, that can compute the probabilities of
misdetection and false detection. Using this as a building block, we generalize
our scheme to multi-hop networks. We show analytically that as long as the
min-cut is not dominated by the Byzantine adversaries, upstream nodes can
monitor downstream neighbors and allow reliable communication with certain
probability. Finally, we present preliminary simulation results that support
our analysis.
