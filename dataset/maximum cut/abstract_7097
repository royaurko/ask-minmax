We address the issue of stability of recently proposed significantly
super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. We present stable solutions of magnetostatic
equilibrium models for super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs pertaining to various
magnetic field profiles. This has been obtained by self-consistently including
the effects of the magnetic pressure gradient and total magnetic density in a
general relativistic framework. We estimate that the maximum stable mass of
magnetized white dwarfs could be more than 3 solar mass. This is very useful to
explain peculiar, overluminous type Ia supernovae which do not conform to the
traditional Chandrasekhar mass-limit.
