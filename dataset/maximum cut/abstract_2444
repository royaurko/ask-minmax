The phenomenon of Spin-Charge separation in non-Fermi liquids is well
understood only in certain solvable d=1 fermionic systems. In this paper we
furnish the first example of asymptotic Spin-Charge separation in a d=1 non
solvable model. This goal is achieved using Renormalization Group approach
combined with Ward-Identities and Schwinger-Dyson equations, corrected by the
presence of a bandwidth cut-offs. Such methods, contrary to bosonization, could
be in principle applied also to lattice or higher dimensional systems.
