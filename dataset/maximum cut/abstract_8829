The nonlinear model of pionic condensate in nuclei by G. Preparata can be
efficiently verified by investigation of the quasielastic knockout process of
pions out of nuclei by high energy electrons. First, a momentum distribution
(MD) of the collective pions has a bright maximum at q=0.3 Gev.Second the
excitation spectrum of a recoil nucleus is concentrated at low energies E
lesser than 1MeV. The results for the pion knockout from mesonic clouds of
individual nucleons are absolutely different. The latter results are presented
both for pion and rho-meson clouds localized on nucleons.
