Relativistic kinetic theory, based on the Grad method of moments as developed
by Israel and Stewart, is used to model viscous and thermal dissipation in
neutron star matter and determine an upper limit on the maximum mass of neutron
stars. In the context of kinetic theory, the equation of state must satisfy a
set of constraints in order for the equilibrium states of the fluid to be
thermodynamically stable and for perturbations from equilibrium to propagate
causally via hyperbolic equations. Application of these constraints to neutron
star matter restricts the stiffness of the most incompressible equation of
state compatible with causality to be softer than the maximally incompressible
equation of state that results from requiring the adiabatic sound speed to not
exceed the speed of light. Using three equations of state based on experimental
nucleon-nucleon scattering data and properties of light nuclei up to twice
normal nuclear energy density, and the kinetic theory maximally incompressible
equation of state at higher density, an upper limit on the maximum mass of
neutron stars averaging 2.64 solar masses is derived.
