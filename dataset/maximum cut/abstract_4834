We consider QCD radiative corrections to the production of W and Z bosons in
hadron collisions. We present a fully exclusive calculation up to
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD perturbation theory. To perform
this NNLO computation, we use a recently proposed version of the subtraction
formalism. The calculation includes the gamma-Z interference, finite-width
effects, the leptonic decay of the vector bosons and the corresponding spin
correlations. Our calculation is implemented in a parton level Monte Carlo
program. The program allows the user to apply arbitrary kinematical cuts on the
final-state leptons and the associated jet activity, and to compute the
corresponding distributions in the form of bin histograms. We show selected
numerical results at the Tevatron and the LHC.
