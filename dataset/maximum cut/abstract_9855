We show that the rescaled maximum of the discrete Gaussian Free Field (DGFF)
in dimension larger or equal to 3 is in the maximal domain of attraction of the
Gumbel distribution. The result holds both for the infinite-volume field as
well as the field with zero boundary conditions. We show that these results
follow from an interesting application of the Stein-Chen method from Arratia et
al. (1989).
