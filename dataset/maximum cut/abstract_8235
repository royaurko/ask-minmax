We present optical photometry and spectra of the super luminous type II/IIn
supernova CSS121015:004244+132827 (z=0.2868) spanning epochs from -30 days
(rest frame) to more than 200 days after maximum. CSS121015 is one of the more
luminous supernova ever found and one of the best observed. The photometric
evolution is characterized by a relatively fast rise to maximum (~40 days in
the SN rest frame), and by a linear post-maximum decline. The light curve shows
no sign of a break to an exponential tail. A broad Halpha is first detected at
~ +40 days (rest-frame). Narrow, barely-resolved Balmer and [O III] 5007 A
lines, with decreasing strength, are visible along the entire spectral
evolution. The spectra are very similar to other super luminous supernovae
(SLSNe) with hydrogen in their spectrum, and also to SN 2005gj, sometimes
considered a type Ia interacting with H-rich CSM. The spectra are also similar
to a subsample of H-deficient SLSNe. We propose that the properties of
CSS121015 are consistent with the interaction of the ejecta with a massive,
extended, opaque shell, lost by the progenitor decades before the final
explosion, although a magnetar powered model cannot be excluded. Based on the
similarity of CSS121015 with other SLSNe (with and without H), we suggest that
the shocked-shell scenario should be seriously considered as a plausible model
for both types of SLSN.
