We present the 15 micron luminosity function of type 1 AGN (QSO + Seyfert 1).
Our sample of 21 high-redshift sources is selected from the Preliminary
Analysis catalogue in the S1 field of the European Large Area ISO Survey
(ELAIS). To study the cosmological evolution of the AGN1 luminosity function,
our sample has been combined with a local sample of 41 sources observed by
IRAS. We find that the luminosity function of AGN1 at 15 micron is fairly well
represented by a double-power-law-function. There is evidence for significant
cosmological evolution consistent with a pure luminosity evolution (PLE) model
L(z) (1+z)^k, with k=3.0-3.3. The value of k depends on the existence or not of
an evolution cut-off at redshift ~2, and on the adopted cosmology. From the
luminosity function and its evolution we estimate a contribution of AGN1 to the
Cosmic Infrared Background (CIRB) of nuI_nu ~ 6 x 10^{-11}W m^{-2} sr^{-1} at
15 micron. This corresponds to ~2-3% of the total observed CIRB at this
wavelength. Under the usual assumptions of unified models for AGN, the expected
contribution of the whole AGN population to the CIRB at 15 micron is 10-15%.
