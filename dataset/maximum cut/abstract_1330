We study the electromagnetic radiation from a hot and slightly strong
interacting fireball system of quark-gluon plasma using the Boltzmann
distribution function for the incoming particles and Bose-Einstein distribution
for gluon in first calculation of electromagnetic radiation and Fermi-Dirac
distribution for quark, antiquark and Boltzmann distribution for gluon in our
second calculation. The thermal photon emission rate is found that it is
infrared divergent for massless quarks which are discussed by many contributors and
regulate this divergence using different cut-off in the qurak mass. However we
remove this divergence using the same technique of Braaten and Pisarski in the
thermal mass of the system by using our model calculation in the coupling
parameter. Thus the production rate of the thermal photon is found to be
smoothly worked by this cut-off technique of our model. The result is found to
be matched with the most of the theoretical calculations and it is in the
conformity with the experimental results of $200 AGeV$ S+Au collision of LHC.
