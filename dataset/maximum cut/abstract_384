y coating a cover layer with metallization of cut wire array, the
transmission of transverse electric waves (TE; the electric field is parallel
to the slits) through subwavelength slits in a thin metallic film is
significantly enhanced. An 800-fold enhanced transmission is obtained compared
to the case without the cut wires. It is demonstrated that a TE incident wave
is highly confined by the cut wires due to the excitation of the electric
dipole-like resonance, and then effectively squeezed into and through the
subwavelength slits.
