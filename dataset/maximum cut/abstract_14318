Using magnetization measurements, we show that point defects in graphene -
fluorine adatoms and irradiation defects (vacancies) - carry magnetic moments
with spin 1/2. Both types of defects lead to notable paramagnetism but no
magnetic ordering could be detected down to liquid helium temperatures. The
induced paramagnetism dominates graphene's low-temperature magnetic properties
despite the fact that maximum response we could achieve was limited to one
moment per approximately 1000 carbon atoms. This limitation is explained by
clustering of adatoms and, for the case of vacancies, by losing graphene's
structural stability.
