Sigma-phase intermetallic compound of Fe54Cr46 was investigated using DC and
AC magnetic susceptibility techniques. A clear-cut evidence was found that the
sample orders magnetically at Tc=23.5 K and its ground magnetic state is
constituted by a spin glass. The temperature at which the zero-field cooled
magnetization has its maximum decreases with an external magnetic field in line
with the Gabay-Toulouse prediction. The temperature at which the AC magnetic
susceptibility has its maximum does not depend on frequency which, in the light
of the mean-field theory, testifies to very long magnetic interactions.
