Multiple scattering theory is applied to low-energy electron collisions with
a complex target formed of two molecular scatterers. The total T-matrix is
expressed in terms of the T-matrix for each isolated molecule. We apply the
approach to elastic electron-(H2O)2 collisions. Following the method developed
in our previous work on crystalline ice, we impose a cut-off on the dipole
outside the R-matrix sphere and an energy dependent cut-off on the angular
momentum components of the monomer T-matrix. An R-matrix calculation of
electron-dimer collisions is performed in order to evaluate the accuracy of the
multiple scattering approach. The agreement between the two calculations is
very good.
