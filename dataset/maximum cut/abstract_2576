The formal mathematical theory of fair division has a rich history dating
back at least to Steinhaus in the 1940's. In recent work in this area, several
general classes of errors have appeared along with confusion about the
necessity and sufficiency of certain hypotheses. It is the purpose of this
article to correct the scientific record and to point out with concrete
examples some of the pitfalls that have led to these mistakes. These examples
may serve as guideposts for future work.
