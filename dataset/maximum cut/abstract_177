We present an extension of the spinor integration formalism of one loop
amplitudes from the double-cut to the single-cut case. This technique can be
applied for the computation of the tadpole coefficients. Moreover we describe
an off-shell continuation of one loop amplitudes that allows a finite
evaluation of the unitarity cuts in the channel of a single massive external
fermion.
