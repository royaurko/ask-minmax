We model-independently analyze the angular distributions of B -> K ll decays,
l = e, mu, for low dilepton mass using QCD factorization. Besides the decay
rate, we study the forward-backward asymmetry A_FB^l and a further observable,
F_H^l, which gives rise to a flat term in the angular distribution. We find
that in the Standard Model F_H^l ~ m_l^2, hence vanishing F_H^e and F_H^mu of
around 2% (exact value depends on cuts) with a very small theoretical
uncertainty of a few percent. We also give predictions for R_K, the ratio of B
-> K mu mu to B -> K ee decay rates. We analytically show using large recoil
symmetry relations that in the Standard Model R_K equals one up to lepton mass
corrections of the order 10^(-4). The New Physics reach of the observables from
the B -> K ll angular analysis is explored together with R_K and the B_s -> ll
and B -> X_s ll branching ratios for both l = e and l = mu. We find substantial
room for signals from (pseudo-) scalar and tensor interactions beyond the
Standard Model. Experimental investigations of the B -> K mu mu angular
distributions are suitable for the LHC environment and high luminosity B
factories, where also studies of the electron modes are promising.
