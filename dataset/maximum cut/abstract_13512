Dynamics of depletion and recovery of superconducting state in La2-xSrxCuO_4
thin films is investigated utilizing optical pump-probe and optical pump - THz
probe techniques as a function of temperature and excitation fluence. The
absorbed energy density required to suppress superconductivity is found to be
about 8 times higher than the thermodynamically determined condensation energy
density and nearly temperature independent between 4 and 25 K. These findings
indicate that during the time when superconducting state suppression takes
place (~0.7 ps), a large part (nearly 90%) of the energy is transferred to the
phonons with energy lower than twice the maximum value of of the SC gap and
only 10% is spent on Cooper pair breaking.
