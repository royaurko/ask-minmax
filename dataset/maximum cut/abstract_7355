We present a detailed analytical study of the propagation of ultra high
energy (UHE) particles in extragalactic magnetic fields. The crucial parameter
which affects the diffuse spectrum is the separation between sources. In the
case of a uniform distribution of sources with a separation between them much
smaller than all characteristic propagation lengths, the diffuse spectrum of
UHE particles has a {\em universal} form, independent of the mode of
propagation. This statement has a status of theorem. The proof is obtained
using the particle number conservation during propagation, and also using the
kinetic equation for the propagation of UHE particles. This theorem can be also
proved with the help of the diffusion equation. In particular, it is shown
numerically, how the diffuse fluxes converge to this universal spectrum, when
the separation between sources diminishes. We study also the analytic solution
of the diffusion equation in weak and strong magnetic fields with energy losses
taken into account. In the case of strong magnetic fields and for a separation
between sources large enough, the GZK cutoff can practically disappear, as it
has been found early in numerical simulations. In practice, however, the source
luminosities required are too large for this possibility.
