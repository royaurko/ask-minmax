We explore the ability of three-particle templates to distinguish color
neutral objects from QCD background. This method is particularly useful to
identify the standard model Higgs, as well as other massive neutral particles.
Simple cut-based analysis in the overlap distributions of the signal and
background is shown to provide a significant rejection power. By combining with
other discriminating variables, such as planar flow, and several variables that
depend on the partonic template, three-particle templates are used to
characterize the influence of gluon emission and color flow in collider events.
The performance of the method is discussed for the case of a highly boosted
Higgs in association with a leptonically-decaying W boson.
