Many vision based applications have used fingertips to track or manipulate
gestures in their applications. Gesture identification is a natural way to pass
the signals to the machine, as the human express its feelings most of the time
with hand expressions. Here a novel time efficient algorithm has been described
for fingertip detection. This method is invariant to hand direction and in
preprocessing it cuts only hand part from the full image, hence further
computation would be much faster than processing full image. Binary silhouette
of the input image is generated using HSV color space based skin filter and
hand cropping done based on intensity histogram of the hand image
