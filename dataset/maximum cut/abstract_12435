Strominger has derived the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the BTZ black hole
using asymptotic Virasoro algebra. We apply Strominger's method to a black hole
solution found by Martinez and Zanelli (MZ). This is a solution of
three-dimensional gravity with a conformal scalar field. The solution is not
$AdS_3$, but it is asymptotically $AdS_3$; therefore, it has the asymptotic
Virasoro algebra. We compute the central charge for the theory and compares
Cardy's formula with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. It turns out that the
functional form does agree, but the overall numerical coefficient does not.
This is because this approach gives the "maximum possible entropy" for the
numerical coefficient.
