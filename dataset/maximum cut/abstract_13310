Transiting planet discoveries have yielded a plethora of information
regarding the internal structure and atmospheres of extra-solar planets. These
discoveries have been restricted to the low-periastron distance regime due to
the bias inherent in the geometric transit probability. Monitoring known radial
velocity planets at predicted transit times is a proven method of detecting
transits, and presents an avenue through which to explore the mass-radius
relationship of exoplanets in new regions of period/periastron space. Here we
describe transit window calculations for known radial velocity planets,
techniques for refining their transit ephemerides, target selection criteria,
and observational methods for obtaining maximum coverage of transit windows.
These methods are currently being implemented by the Transit Ephemeris
Refinement and Monitoring Survey (TERMS).
