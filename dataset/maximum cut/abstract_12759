Atom chips use current flowing in lithographically patterned wires to produce
microscopic magnetic traps for atoms. The density distribution of a trapped
cold atom cloud reveals disorder in the trapping potential, which results from
meandering current flow in the wire. Roughness in the edges of the wire is
usually the main cause of this behaviour. Here, we point out that the edges of
microfabricated wires normally exhibit self-affine roughness. We investigate
the consequences of this for disorder in atom traps. In particular, we consider
how closely the trap can approach the wire when there is a maximum allowable
strength of the disorder. We comment on the role of roughness in future
atom--surface interaction experiments.
