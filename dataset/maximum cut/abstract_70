Structural and electronic characterization of (Ca0.67Sr0.33)Fe2As2 has been
performed as a func- tion of pressure up to 12 GPa using conventional and
designer diamond anvil cells. The compound (Ca0.67Sr0.33)Fe2As2 behaves
intermediate between its end members-CaFe2As2 and SrFe2As2- displaying a
suppression of magnetism and the onset of superconductivity. Like other members
of the AEFe2As2 family, (Ca0.67Sr0.33)Fe2As2 undergoes a pressure-induced
isostructural volume collapse, which we associate with the development of As-As
bonding across the mirror plane of the structure. This collapsed tetragonal
phase abruptly cuts off the magnetic state, giving rise to superconductivity
with a maximum Tc=22.2 K. The maximum Tc of the superconducting phase is not
strongly correlated with any structural parameter, but its proximity to the
abrupt suppression of magnetism as well as the volume collapse transition
suggests that magnetic interactions and structural inhomogeneity may play a
role in its development. The pressure-dependent evolution of the ordered states
and crystal structures in (Ca,Sr)Fe2As2 provides an avenue to understand the
generic behavior of the other members of the AEFe2As2 family.
