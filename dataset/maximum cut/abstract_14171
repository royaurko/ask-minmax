Through Variational Monte Carlo simulation we show the d-wave RVB pairing in
the Heisenberg model on triangular lattice can be better described in terms of
a two component order parameter. The fully gapped chiral d-wave RVB state,
which is predicted by the mean field theory to be the unique minimum of
variational energy in the two dimensional representation space of d-wave
pairing, is found to be actually a local maximum and the true minimum of energy
is reached by the non-chiral $d_{xy}$ state with line nodes. We also find that
the usual Gutzwiller approximation, which enjoys great success for the square
lattice system, fails badly on the triangular lattice as a result of the
geometric frustration inherent of the system. An improved version of the
Gutzwiiler approximation is proposed and is found to give a much better results
than the usual one.
