We describe the first version (v1.00) of the code HFBRAD which solves the
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock or Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov equations in the
coordinate representation within the spherical symmetry. A realistic
representation of the quasiparticle wave functions on the space lattice allows
for performing calculations up to the particle drip lines. Zero-range
density-dependent interactions are used in the pairing channel. The pairing
energy is calculated by either using a cut-off energy in the quasiparticle
spectrum or the regularization scheme proposed by A. Bulgac and Y. Yu.
