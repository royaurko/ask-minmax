We describe the production and characterization of microelectromagnets made
for trapping and manipulating atomic ensembles. The devices consist of 7
fabricated parallel copper conductors 3 micrometer thick, 25mm long, with
widths ranging from 3 to 30 micrometer, and are produced by electroplating a
sapphire substrate. Maximum current densities in the wires up to 6.5 * 10^6 A /
cm^2 are achieved in continuous mode operation. The device operates
successfully at a base pressure of 10^-11 mbar. The microstructures permit the
realization of a variety of magnetic field configurations, and hence provide
enormous flexibility for controlling the motion and the shape of Bose-Einstein
condensates.
