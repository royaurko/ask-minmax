We found that the conductivity of the two-dimensional electron system in
Si-MOS structures is limited to a maximum value, G_{max}, as either density
increases or temperature decreases. This value G_{max} is weakly disorder
dependent and ranging from 100 to 140 e^2/h for samples whose mobilities differ
by a factor of 4.
