We give a new definition of dimension spectrum for non-regular spectral
triples and compute the exact (i.e. non only the asymptotics) heat-trace of
standard Podles spheres $S^2_q$ for $0<q<1$, study its behavior when $q\to 1$
and fully compute its exact spectral action for an explicit class of cut-off
functions.
