The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) is a unified theory of
biodiversity that predicts a large number of macroecological patterns using
only information on the species richness, total abundance, and total metabolic
rate of the community. We evaluated four major predictions of METE
simultaneously at an unprecedented scale using data from 60 globally
distributed forest communities including over 300,000 individuals and nearly
2000 species. METE successfully captured 96% and 89% of the variation in the
species abundance distribution and the individual size distribution, but
performed poorly when characterizing the size-density relationship and
intraspecific distribution of individual size. Specifically, METE predicted a
negative correlation between size and species abundance, which is weak in
natural communities. By evaluating multiple predictions with large quantities
of data, our study not only identifies a mismatch between abundance and body
size in METE, but also demonstrates the importance of conducting strong tests
of ecological theories.
