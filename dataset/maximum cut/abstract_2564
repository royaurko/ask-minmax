We study the spectral densities of (pseudo)scalar currents at finite
temperature in general case when mass of two quarks are different. Such
spectral densities are necessary for the phenomenological investigation of
hadronic parameters. We use quark propagator at finite temperature and show
that an additional branch cut arises in spectral density, which corresponds to
particle absorption from the medium. The obtained results at T \rightarrow 0
limit are in good agreement with the vacuum results.
