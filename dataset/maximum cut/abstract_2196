This talk outlines the derivation of a high-energy, transverse momentum
cut-off, solution of QCD in which the Regge pole and ``single gluon''
properties of the pomeron are directly related to the confinement and chiral
symmetry breaking properties of the hadron spectrum. In first approximation,
the pomeron is a single reggeized gluon plus a ``wee parton'' component that
compensates for the color and particle properties of the gluon. This solution
corresponds to a supercritical phase of Reggeon Field Theory.
