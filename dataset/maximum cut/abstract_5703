The traditional approximate formula for neutrino oscillation in matter which
is obtained from the expansion in terms of the ratio of mass square differences
$\alpha=\Delta m_{21}^{2}/\Delta m_{31}^{2}\approx0.03$, first proposed by
Cervera, et al and Freund, turns out to be an accurate formula for accelerator
neutrino experiments. It is accurate not only at energies well above the solar
resonance as required by the validity of the $\alpha-$expansion but also at
energies near the solar resonance which is just the case of the T2K experiment.
Due to the non-perturbative effect of the solar resonance, the
$\alpha-$expansion in this case is invalid but this formula was recently used
in T2K. This paper analytically justifies the use of this formula in T2K by
careful dealing with the singularity originated from the branch cut in the
roots of the equation for the eigenvalues. Besides, we also propose some simple
but more accurate formulae which provide possible alternatives to the
traditional formula.
