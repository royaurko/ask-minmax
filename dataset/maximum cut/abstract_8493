The spin dynamics of GdI_2 have been investigated by ESR spectroscopy. The
temperature dependences of the resonance field and ESR intensity are well
described by the model for the spin susceptibility proposed by Eremin et al.
[Phys. Rev. B 64, 064425 (2001)]. The temperature dependence of the resonance
linewidth shows a maximum similar to the electrical resistance and is discussed
in terms of scattering processes between conduction electrons and localized
spins.
