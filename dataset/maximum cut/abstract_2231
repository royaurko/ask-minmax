We study production of t \bar{t} via W^+ W^--fusion, including the relevant
backgrounds at the proposed Linear Collider (an e^+ e^- collider with \sqrt{S}
= 1.5 TeV) in the context of a Higssless Standard Model (HSM), i.e. a nonlinear
SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y chiral Lagrangian, including dimension five W^+ W^- t
\bar{t} interactions. Deviation from the HSM predictions can be used to
constrain the coefficients of these operators to an order of 10^-1 (divided by
the cut-off scale \Lambda = 3.1 TeV) with a 95% C.L..
