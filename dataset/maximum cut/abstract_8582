We generalize univariate multipoint evaluation of polynomials of degree n at
sublinear amortized cost per point. More precisely, it is shown how to evaluate
a bivariate polynomial p of maximum degree less than n, specified by its n^2
coefficients, simultaneously at n^2 given points using a total of O(n^{2.667})
arithmetic operations. In terms of the input size N being quadratic in n, this
amounts to an amortized cost of O(N^{0.334}) per point.
