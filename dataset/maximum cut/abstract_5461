Electromechanical and magnetoelectric properties of Metglas/LiNbO3/Metglas
trilayers have been studied in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 0.4 MHz. A
trilayer of Metglas/PMN-PT/Metglas prepared in the same way was used as a
reference. Though PMN-PT has much larger charge piezocoefficients than LiNbO3
(LNO), the direct magnetoelectric voltage coefficient is found to be comparable
in both trilayers due to the much lower dielectric permittivity of LNO. The
magnitude of the direct magnetoelectric effect in the LNO trilayers is about
0.4 V/cm*Oe in the quasistatic regime and about 90 V/cm*Oe at electromechanical
resonance. Calculations show that the magnetoelectric properties can be
significantly improved (up to 500 V/cm*Oe) via controlling the cut angle of
LNO, choosing the appropriate thickness ratio of the
ferroelectric/ferromagnetic layers, and a better bonding between Metglas and
LNO. Advantages of using LiNbO3-type ferroelectrics in magnetoelectric
composites are discussed.
