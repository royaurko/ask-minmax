Haim Judah has asked me to speak on the future of set theory, so, as the next
millennium is coming, to speak on set theory in the next millennium. But we
soon cut this down to set theory in the next century. Later on I thought I had
better cut it down to dealing with the next decade, but I suspect I will speak
on what I hope to try to prove next year, or worse - what I have done in the
last year (or twenty). It seems I am not particularly suitable for such a
lecture, as I have repeatedly preferred to try to prove another theorem rather
than to prepare the lecture (or article); so why did I agree at all to such a
doubtful endeavor? Well, under the hypothesis that I had some moral obligation
to help Haim in the conference (and the proceedings) and you should not let a
friend down, had I been given the choice to help with organizing the
dormitories, writing a lengthy well written expository paper or risking making
a fool of myself in such a lecture, I definitely prefer the last.
