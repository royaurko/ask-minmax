Accurate and comprehensible knowledge about the position of branch cuts is
essential for correctly working with multi-valued functions, such as the square
root and logarithm. We discuss the new tools in Maple 17 for calculating and
visualising the branch cuts of such functions, and others built up from them.
The cuts are described in an intuitive and accurate form, offering substantial
improvement on the descriptions previously available.
