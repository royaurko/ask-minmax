Numerical relativity has recently yielded a plethora of results about kicks
from spinning mergers which has, in turn, vastly increased our knowledge about
the spin interactions of black hole systems. In this work we use black hole
perturbation theory to calculate accurately the gravitational waves emanating
from the end of the plunging stage of an extreme mass ratio merger in order to
further understand this phenomenon. This study focuses primarily on spin
induced effects with emphasis on the maximally spinning limit and the
identification of possible causes of generic behavior.
  We find that gravitational waves emitted during the plunging phase exhibit
damped oscillatory behavior, corresponding to a coherent excitation of
quasi-normal modes by the test particle. This feature is universal in the sense
that the frequencies and damping time do not depend on the orbital parameters
of the plunging particle. Furthermore, the observed frequencies are distinct
from those associated with the usual free quasi-normal ringing. Our calculation
suggests that a maximum in radiated energy and momentum occurs at spin
parameters equal to $a/M=0.86$ and $a/M=0.81$, respectively for the plunge
stage of a polar orbit. The dependence of linear momentum emission on the angle
at which a polar orbit impacts the horizon is quantified. One of the advantages
of the perturbation approach adopted here is that insight into the actual
mechanism of radiation emission and its relationship to black hole ringing is
obtained by carefully identifying the dominant terms in the expansions used.
