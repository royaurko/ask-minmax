In this paper we consider the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling at
Jupiter-like exoplanets with internal plasma sources such as volcanic moons,
and we have determined the best candidates for detection of these radio
emissions by estimating the maximum spectral flux density expected from planets
orbiting stars within 25 pc using data listed in the NASA/IPAC/NExScI Star and
Exoplanet Database (NStED). In total we identify 91 potential targets, of which
40 already host planets and 51 have stellar X-ray luminosity 100 times the
solar value. In general, we find that stronger planetary field strength,
combined with faster rotation rate, higher stellar XUV luminosity, and lower
stellar wind dynamic pressure results in higher radio power. The top two
targets for each category are $\epsilon$ Eri and HIP 85523, and CPD-28 332 and
FF And.
