We investigate Arp 295, a pair of interacting spirals at z=0.023. We measure
scalelengths 5.24 kpc for Arp 295a and 2.52 kpc for 295b. There is a much
smaller Im galaxy associated with the larger spiral. Arp 295b is asymmetric
with the disk more extended eastwards but with the brightest star-formation
regions on the west side of the nucleus. The spectrum of Arp 295b shows strong
emission lines with [OII]3727 prominent. We measure the total H-alpha line
luminosities of Arp 295b and Arp 295c as 4.69x 10^{41} and 6.76x 10^{40}
ergs/s, corresponding to star-formation rates 3.7 and 0.53 solar masses/year.
  We map the kinematics of Arp 295b in H-alpha with the Manchester Echelle
Spectrograph. The maximum disk rotation velocity is 252.6 km/s. The rotation
curve of Arp 295b is very asymmetric. The east (approaching) side has a higher
radial velocity than the west with the maximum difference 5 arcsec from the
nucleus, where it is 88 km/s or a factor 1.675. The slowed rotation on the
western side of the nucleus may have locally enhanced star-formation.
