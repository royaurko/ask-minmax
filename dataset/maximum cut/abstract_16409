A Space-Time Block Code (STBC) in $K$ symbols (variables) is called $g$-group
decodable STBC if its maximum-likelihood decoding metric can be written as a
sum of $g$ terms such that each term is a function of a subset of the $K$
variables and each variable appears in only one term. In this paper we provide
a general structure of the weight matrices of multi-group decodable codes using
Clifford algebras. Without assuming that the number of variables in each group
to be the same, a method of explicitly constructing the weight matrices of
full-diversity, delay-optimal $g$-group decodable codes is presented for
arbitrary number of antennas. For the special case of $N_t=2^a$ we construct
two subclass of codes: (i) A class of $2a$-group decodable codes with rate
$\frac{a}{2^{(a-1)}}$, which is, equivalently, a class of Single-Symbol
Decodable codes, (ii) A class of $(2a-2)$-group decodable with rate
$\frac{(a-1)}{2^{(a-2)}}$, i.e., a class of Double-Symbol Decodable codes.
Simulation results show that the DSD codes of this paper perform better than
previously known Quasi-Orthogonal Designs.
