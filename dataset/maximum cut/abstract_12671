An accurate theory describing adiabatic following of the dark, nonabsorbing
state in the three-level system is developed. An analytical solution for the
wave function of the particle experiencing Raman excitation is found as an
expansion in terms of the time varying nonadiabatic perturbation parameter. The
solution can be presented as a sum of adiabatic and nonadiabatic parts. Both
are estimated quantitatively. It is shown that the limiting value to which the
amplitude of the nonadiabatic part tends is equal to the Fourier component of
the nonadiabatic perturbation parameter taken at the Rabi frequency of the
Raman excitation. The time scale of the variation of both parts is found. While
the adiabatic part of the solution varies slowly and follows the change of the
nonadiabatic perturbation parameter, the nonadiabatic part appears almost
instantly, revealing a jumpwise transition between the dark and bright states.
This jump happens when the nonadiabatic perturbation parameter takes its
maximum value.
