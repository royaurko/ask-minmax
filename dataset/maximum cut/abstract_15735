Spatially resolved velocity profiles are presented for nine faint field
galaxies in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1, based on moderate-resolution
spectroscopy obtained with the Keck 10 m telescope. These data were augmented
with high-resolution HST images from WFPC2, which provided V and I photometry,
galaxy type, orientation, and inclination. The effects of seeing, slit width,
and slit misalignment with respect to galaxy major axis were modeled along with
inclination for each source, in order to derive a maximum circular velocity
from the observed rotation curve. The lowest redshift galaxy, though highly
elongated, shows a distorted low-amplitude rotation curve that suggests a
merger in progress seen perpendicular to the collision path. The remaining
rotation curves appear similar to those of local galaxies in both form and
amplitude, implying that some massive disks were in place at z ~ 1. The key
result is that the kinematics of these distant galaxies show evidence for only
a modest increase in luminosity of delta M_B < 0.6 compared to
velocity-luminosity (Tully-Fisher) relations for local galaxies.
