We reconsider quarkonium production in a field-theoretical setting and we
show that the lowest-order mechanism for heavy-quarkonium production receives
in general contributions from two different cuts. The first one corresponds to
the usual colour-singlet mechanism. The second one has not been considered so
far. We treat it in a gauge-invariant manner, and introduce new 4-point
vertices, suggestive of the colour-octet mechanism. These new objects enable us
to go beyond the static approximation. We show that the contribution of the new
cut can be as large as the usual colour-singlet mechanism at high transverse
momentum for J/psi. In the psi' case, theoretical uncertainties are shown to be
large and agreement with data is possible.
