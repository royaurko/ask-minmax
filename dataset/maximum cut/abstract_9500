This paper consider an MMLE (Modified Maximum Likelihood Estimation) based
scheme to estimate software reliability using exponential distribution. The
MMLE is one of the generalized frameworks of software reliability models of Non
Homogeneous Poisson Processes (NHPPs). The MMLE gives analytical estimators
rather than an iterative approximation to estimate the parameters. In this
paper we proposed SPC (Statistical Process Control) Charts mechanism to
determine the software quality using inter failure times data. The Control
charts can be used to measure whether the software process is statistically
under control or not.
