The effects of Ir doping on the thermoelectric properties of Pt1-xIrxSb2 (x =
0, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1) with pyrite structure were studied. Measurements of
electrical resistivity rho, Seebeck coefficient S, and thermal conductivity
kappa were conducted. The results showed an abrupt change from semiconducting
behavior without Ir (x = 0) to metallic behavior at x = 0.01. The sample with x
= 0.01 exhibited large S and low rho, resulting in a maximum power factor
(S^2/rho) of 43 muW/cmK^2 at 400 K. The peculiar "pudding mold"-type electronic
band dispersion could explain the enhanced thermoelectric properties in the
metallic state.
