This paper is concerned with the study of the Strong Maximum Principle for
semicontinuous viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear, second-order parabolic
integro-differential equations. We study separately the propagation of maxima
in the horizontal component of the domain and the local vertical propagation in
simply connected sets of the domain. We give two types of results for
horizontal propagation of maxima: one is the natural extension of the classical
results of local propagation of maxima and the other comes from the structure
of the nonlocal operator. As an application, we use the Strong Maximum
Principle to prove a Strong Comparison Result of viscosity sub and
supersolution for integro-differential equations.
