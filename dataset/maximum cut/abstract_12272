We study the back reaction effect of massless minimally coupled scalar field
at finite temperatures in the background of Einstein universe. Substituting for
the vacuum expectation value of the components of the energy-momentum tensor on
the RHS of the Einstein equation, we deduce a relationship between the radius
of the universe and its temperature. This relationship exhibit a maximum
temperature, below the Planck scale, at which the system changes its behaviour
drastically. The results are compared with the case of a conformally coupled
field. An investigation into the values of the cosmological constant exhibit a
remarkable difference between the conformally coupled case and the minimally
coupled one.
