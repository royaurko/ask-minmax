V-BLAST detection method suffers large computational complexity due to its
successive detection of symbols. In this paper, we propose a modified V-BLAST
algorithm to decrease the computational complexity by reducing the number of
detection iterations required in MIMO communication systems. We begin by
showing the existence of a maximum number of iterations, beyond which, no
significant improvement is obtained. We establish a criterion for the number of
maximum effective iterations. We propose a modified algorithm that uses the
measured SNR to dynamically set the number of iterations to achieve an
acceptable bit-error rate. Then, we replace the feedback algorithm with an
approximate linear function to reduce the complexity. Simulations show that
significant reduction in computational complexity is achieved compared to the
ordinary V-BLAST, while maintaining a good BER performance.
