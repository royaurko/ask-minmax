We present a method for reconstructing the photon number distribution from
the homodyne statistics based on maximization of the likelihood function
derived from the exact statistical description of a homodyne experiment. This
method incorporates in a natural way the physical constraints on the
reconstructed quantities, and the compensation for the nonunit detection
efficiency.
