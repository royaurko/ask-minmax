Exceptionally bright quasars with redshifts up to z=6.28 have recently been
discovered. Quasars are thought to be powered by the accretion of gas onto
supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. Their maximum (Eddington)
luminosity is proportional to the mass of the black hole, and so these bright
quasars are inferred to have black holes with masses of more than a few billion
solar masses. The existence of such massive black holes poses a challenge to
models for the formation of structures in the early Universe, as it requires
that the black holes would grow so massive in less than a billion years after
the Big Bang. Here we show that up to a third of known quasars with z~6 will
have their observed flux magnified by a factor of 10 or more through
gravitational lensing by galaxies along the line of sight. The inferred
abundance of quasar host galaxies, as well as the luminosity density provided
by the quasars, are therefore substantially overestimated.
