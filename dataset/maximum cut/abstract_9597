We consider upper bounds on the error probability in channel coding. We
derive an improved maximum-likelihood union bound, which takes into account
events where the likelihood of the correct codeword is tied with that of some
competitors. We compare this bound to various previous results, both
qualitatively and quantitatively. With respect to maximal error probability of
linear codes, we observe that when the channel is additive, the derivation of
bounds, as well as the assumptions on the admissible encoder and decoder,
simplify considerably.
