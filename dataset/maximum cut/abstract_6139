We show within a very simple framework that different measures of
fluctuations lead to uncertainty relations resulting in contradictory
conclusions. More specifically we focus on Tsallis and Renyi entropic
uncertainty relations and we get that the minimum uncertainty states of some
uncertainty relations are the maximum uncertainty states of closely related
uncertainty relations, and vice versa.
