We investigate the entanglement transfer from a bipartite continuous-variable
(CV) system to a pair of localized qubits assuming that each CV mode couples to
one qubit via the off-resonance Jaynes-Cummings interaction with different
interaction times for the two subsystems. First, we consider the case of the CV
system prepared in a Bell-like superposition and investigate the conditions for
maximum entanglement transfer. Then we analyze the general case of two-mode CV
states that can be represented by a Schmidt decomposition in the Fock number
basis. This class includes both Gaussian and non Gaussian CV states, as for
example twin-beam (TWB) and pair-coherent (TMC, also known as two-mode-coher
ent) states respectively. Under resonance conditions, equal interaction times
for both qubits and different initial preparations, we find that the
entanglement transfer is more efficient for TMC than for TWB states. In the
perspective of applications such as in cavity QED or with superconducting
qubits, we analyze in details the effects of off-resonance interactions
(detuning) and different interaction times for the two qubits, and discuss
conditions to preserve the entanglement transfer.
