We prove that the finite representation property holds for representation by
partial functions for the signature consisting of composition, intersection,
antidomain and range. It follows that the finite representation property holds
for any expansion of this signature with the fixset, preferential union,
maximum iterate and opposite operators. The proof shows that for all these
signatures the size of base required is bounded by a double-exponential
function of the size of the algebra. We also give an example of a signature for
which the finite representation property fails to hold for representation by
partial functions.
