The recent calculation on the suppression of the power at low multipoles in
the CMB spectrum due to an IR cut-off presented in hep-th/0406019 does not take
into account the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) term, which is crucial in models
aiming to the explanation of the present acceleration of the Universe. We show
that the ISW contribution to low multipoles is tipically much greater than the
SW term, for an IR cut-off comparable to the present Hubble radius.
