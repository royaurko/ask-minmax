We present a calculation of next-to-leading order QCD corrections to gamma jj
production via weak-boson fusion at a hadron collider in the form of a flexible
parton-level Monte Carlo program which allows us to study cross sections and
distributions within experimentally relevant selection cuts. The radiative
corrections are found to be moderate with residual scale uncertainties being
considerably improved beyond tree level. The sensitivity of the reaction to
anomalous W+ W- gamma couplings is investigated.
