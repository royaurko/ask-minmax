We suggest a holographic energy model in which the energy coming from spatial
curvature, matter and radiation can be obtained by using the particle horizon
for the infrared cut-off. We show the consistency between the holographic
dark-energy model and the holographic energy model proposed in this paper.
Then, we give a holographic description of the universe.
