The complete electroweak radiative O(\alpha) corrections to the Drell-Yan
process at large invariant dimuon mass have been studied. All formulas for the
cross sections and kinematical restrictions are presented in explicit form, for
the simplification of calculation and coding the theta- and delta-functions are
actively used. The FORTRAN code READY for the numerical analysis in the high
energy region corresponding to the future experiments at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider has been constructed. To simulate the detector acceptance we used the
standard CMS detector cuts. The radiative corrections are found to become large
at high dimuon mass M, the complete corrections at "bare" setup change the
dimuon mass distribution up to ~ -5.6% (-23.2%; -35.3%) at the LHC energy and
M=1 (3; 5)TeV.
