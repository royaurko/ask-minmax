We calculate one-loop corrections to the single-top-quark production via
$q\overline{q}' \to t\overline b$ at the Fermilab Tevatron from the
Pseudo-Goldstone bosons ( PGBs ) in the framework of one generation
technicolor model. The maximum correction to the total cross section for the
single-top-quark production is found to reach -2.4% relative to the
tree-level cross section, which may be observable at a high-luminosity
Tevatron.
