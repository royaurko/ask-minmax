Numerical simulations of light curves of variable DA white dwarfs (ZZ Ceti
stars) predict flux amplitudes with surface distributions different from the
spherical harmonics of the pulsation mode in deeper layers. In contrast to the
results of the perturbation analysis by Goldreich and Wu this is also true for
the fundamental period of the flux variation. As a consequence normalized
amplitude spectra depend not only on the mode number l but also on pulsation
amplitude and inclination. Another new result is that with increasing amplitude
of the pressure variation below the convection zone the flux variation at the
surface goes through a maximum and then decreases again.
