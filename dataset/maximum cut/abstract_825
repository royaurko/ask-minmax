Recently, it was shown that in inclusive B -> Xs l+ l- decay, an angular
decomposition provides three independent (q^2 dependent) observables. A
strategy was formulated to extract all measurable Wilson coefficients in B ->
Xs l+ l- from a few simple integrals of these observables in the low q^2
region. The experimental measurements in the low q^2 region require a cut on
the hadronic invariant mass, which introduces a dependence on nonperturbative b
quark distribution functions. The associated hadronic uncertainties could
potentially limit the sensitivity of these decays to new physics. We compute
the nonperturbative corrections to all three observables at leading and
subleading order in the power expansion in \Lambda_QCD/m_b. We find that the
subleading power corrections give sizeable corrections, of order -5% to -10%
depending on the observable and the precise value of the hadronic mass cut.
They cause a shift of order -0.05 GeV^2 to -0.1 GeV^2 in the zero of the
forward-backward asymmetry.
