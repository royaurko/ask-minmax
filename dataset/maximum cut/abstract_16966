This paper concerns a modified approach of compressing Short Bengali Text
Message for small devices. The prime objective of this research technique is to
establish a low complexity compression scheme suitable for small devices having
small memory and relatively lower processing speed. The basic aim is not to
compress text of any size up to its maximum level without having any constraint
on space and time, rather than the main target is to compress short messages up
to an optimal level which needs minimum space, consume less time and the
processor requirement is lower. We have implemented Character Masking,
Dictionary Matching, Associative rule of data mining and Hyphenation algorithm
for syllable based compression in hierarchical steps to achieve low complexity
lossless compression of text message for any mobile devices. The scheme to
choose the diagrams are performed on the basis of extensive statistical model
and the static Huffman coding is done through the same context.
