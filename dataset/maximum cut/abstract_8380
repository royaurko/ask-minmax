We present the theory of the leading edge gap in the normal state of
underdoped high-$T_c$ materials. The consideration is based on a magnetic
scenario for cuprates. We show that as doping decreases, the increasing
interaction with paramagnons gives rise to a near destruction of the Fermi
liquid and this in turn yields precursors to $d-$wave pairing. We argue that
the leading edge gap at $\sim 30 meV$ and a broad maximum in the spectral
function at $\sim150 meV$ are byproducts of the same physical phenomenon.
