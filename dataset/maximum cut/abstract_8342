Anthropic principles were grown from the problem of fine tuning. Although
anthropic principles have been discussed in cosmology for years there is no
exact definition for fine tuning. Starting from the supposed similarity in the
topologies of chaotic and fine tuned regions of the proper phase spaces, we
introduce an alternative Lyapunov indicator for the measure of fine tuning.
This fine-tuning indicator expresses the decrease of life-bearing potentiality
of a universe with the increase of the difference from the physical constants
of the universe with maximum life-bearing potentiality.
