We present the results of numerical simulations of shock wave-driven jets in
the solar atmosphere. The dependence of observable quantities like maximum
velocity and deceleration on parameters such as the period and amplitude of
initial disturbances and the inclination of the magnetic field is investigated.
Our simulations show excellent agreement with observations, and shed new light
on the correlation between velocity and deceleration and on the regional
differences found in observations.
