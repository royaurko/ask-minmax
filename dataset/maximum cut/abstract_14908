A programme to observe all A dwarfs in open clusters brighter than V=6.5 mag
of various ages and in the field was initiated several years ago. In this work
we present the current status of microturbulent velocity for A and F dwarfs. We
have performed high resolution high signal-to-noise spectroscopy of stars well
distributed in mass along the Main Sequence. Microturbulent velocities are
derived iteratively by fitting grids of synthetic spectra calculated in LTE to
observed spectra of 61 A field stars, 55 A and 58 F in open clusters (Pleiades,
Coma Berenices, Hyades and the Ursa Major moving group). We compared our
results to recent works and found a good agreement with their analytical
formulation for the standard microturbulence. Our results show a broad maximum
for microturbulent velocities in the range A5V to about A9V and a decrease (to
$\sim 1$ km/s) for cooler and hotter stars as indicated in Smalley (2004).We
also present a comparison to preliminary science results of Lobel et al. (2013)
for the Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey.
