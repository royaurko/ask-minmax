In this paper we derive both the leading order finite size corrections for
twist-2 and twist-3 operators and the next-to-leading order finite-size
correction for twist-2 operators in beta-deformed SYM theory. The obtained
results respect the principle of maximum transcendentality as well as
reciprocity. We also find that both wrapping corrections go to zero in the
large spin limit. Moreover, for twist-2 operators we studied the pole structure
and compared it against leading BFKL predictions.
