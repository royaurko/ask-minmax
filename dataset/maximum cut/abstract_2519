We introduce a new class of jet algorithms designed to return conical jets
with a variable Delta R radius. A specific example, in which Delta R scales as
1/pT, proves particularly useful in capturing the kinematic features of a wide
variety of hard scattering processes. We implement this Delta R scaling in a
sequential recombination algorithm and test it by reconstructing resonance
masses and kinematic endpoints. These test cases show 10-20% improvements in
signal efficiency compared to fixed Delta R algorithms. We also comment on cuts
useful in reducing continuum jet backgrounds.
