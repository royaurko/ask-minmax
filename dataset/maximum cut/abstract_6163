We introduce a novel technique for grabbing water with a flexible solid. This
new passive pipetting mechanism was inspired by floating flowers and relies
purely on the coupling of the elasticity of thin plates and the hydrodynamic
forces at the liquid interface. Developing a theoretical model has enabled us
to design petal-shaped objects with maximum grabbing capacity.
