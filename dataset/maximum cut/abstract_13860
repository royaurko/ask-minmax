In this paper we present results from a test of a small Liquid Argon Large
Electron Multiplier Time Projection Chamber (LAr LEM-TPC). This detector
concept provides a 3D-tracking and calorimetric device capable of charge
amplification, suited for next-generation neutrino detectors and possibly
direct Dark Matter searches. During a test of a 3~lt chamber equipped with a
10$\times$10~cm$^2$ readout, cosmic muon data was recorded during three weeks
of data taking. A maximum gain of 6.5 was achieved and the liquid argon was
kept pure enough to ensure 20~cm drift (O(ppb)~O$_2$ equivalent).
