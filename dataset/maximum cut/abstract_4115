We consider one model of a black hole radiation, in which the equation of
motion of a matter field is modified to cut off high frequency modes. The
spectrum in the model has already been analytically derived in low frequency
range, which has resulted in the Planckian distributin of the Hawking
temperature. On the other hand, it has been numerically shown that its spectrum
deviates from the thermal one in high frequency range. In this paper, we
analytically derive the form of the deviation in the high frequency range. Our
result can qualitatively explain the nature of the numerically calculated
spectrum. The origin of the deviation is clarified by a simple discussion.
