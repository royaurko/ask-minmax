We have studied the interaction of vectors mesons within the hidden gauge
formalism and applied it to the particular case of the $\rho \rho$ interaction.
We find a strong attraction in the isospin, spin channels I,S=0,0 and 0,2,
which is enough to bind the $\rho \rho$ system. We also find that the
attraction in the I,S=0,2 channel is much stronger than in the 0,0 case. The
states develop a width when the $\rho$ mass distribution is considered, and
particularly when the $\pi \pi$ decay channel is turned on. Using a
regularization scheme with cut offs of natural size, we obtain results in fair
agreement with the mass and the width of the $f_0(1370)$ and $f_2(1270)$ meson
states, providing a natural explanation of why the tensor state is more bound
than the scalar and offering a new picture for these states, which would be
dynamically generated from the $\rho \rho$ interaction or, in simpler words,
$\rho \rho$ molecular states.
