We present optical and near-infrared light curves of SN 2001el from 310 to
445 days past maximum light, obtained with the Very Large Telescope. The
late-time optical (UBVRI) light curves decay in a nearly linear fashion with
decay time scales of 1.43\pm0.14, 1.43\pm0.06, 1.48\pm0.06, 1.45\pm0.07, and
1.03\pm0.07 magnitudes (per hundred days) in the U, B, V, R and I bands,
respectively. In contrast, in the near-infrared (JHKs) bands the time evolution
of the flux appears to be nearly constant at these epochs. We measure decline
rates (per hundred days) of 0.19\pm0.10 and 0.17\pm0.11 magnitudes in the J and
H bands, respectively. We construct a UVOIR light curve, and find that the
late-time luminosity has a decay time scale nearly consistent with complete
depostion of positron kinetic energy. The late-time light curves of the normal
type Ia SN 2001el demonstrate the increased importance of the near-infrared
contribution. This was previously observed in the peculiar SN 2000cx, and the
results for SN 2001el thus ensure that the conclusions previously based on a
single peculiar event are applicable to normal type Ia supernovae. The measured
late-time UVOIR decline rate suggests that a majority of the positrons are
trapped within the ejecta. This results does not favor the predictions of a
weak and/or radially combed magnetic field configuration.
