The d-dimensional string generated gravity models lead to Einstein-Maxwell
equations with quadratic order correction term called the Gauss-Bonnet term. We
calculate the quasinormal modes for the d-dimensional charged black hole in the
framework of this model. The quasinormal spectrum essentially depends upon the
Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter $\alpha$ which is related to the string scale,
and is totally different from that for black holes derived from Einstein
action. In particular, at large $\alpha$ the quasinormal modes are proportional
to $\alpha$, while as $\alpha$ goes to zero the qusinormal modes approach their
Schwarzschild values. In contrary to Einstein theory black hole behavior, the
damping rate of the charged GB black hole as a function of charge does not
contain a chracteristic maximum, but instead the monotonic falling down is
observed. In addition, there have been obtained an asymptotic formula for large
multipole numbers.
