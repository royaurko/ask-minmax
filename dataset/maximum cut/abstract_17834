Frame Slotted Aloha (FSA) protocol has been widely applied in Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) systems as the de facto standard in tag identification.
However, very limited work has been done on the stability of FSA despite its
fundamental importance both on the theoretical characterisation of FSA
performance and its effective operation in practical systems. In order to
bridge this gap, we devote this paper to investigating the stability properties
of FSA by focusing on two physical layer models of practical importance, the
models with single packet reception and multipacket reception capabilities.
Technically, we model the FSA system backlog as a Markov chain with its states
being backlog size at the beginning of each frame. The objective is to analyze
the ergodicity of the Markov chain and demonstrate its properties in different
regions, particularly the instability region. By employing drift analysis, we
obtain the closed-form conditions for the stability of FSA and show that the
stability region is maximised when the frame length equals the backlog size in
the single packet reception model and when the ratio of the backlog size to
frame length equals in order of magnitude the maximum multipacket reception
capacity in the multipacket reception model. Furthermore, to characterise
system behavior in the instability region, we mathematically demonstrate the
existence of transience of the backlog Markov chain.
