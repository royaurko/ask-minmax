While ideal photonic crystals would support modes with a vanishing group
velocity, state-of-the art structures have still only provided a slow-down by
roughly two orders of magnitude. We find that the induced density of states
caused by lifetime broadening of the electromagnetic modes results in the group
velocity acquiring a finite value above zero at the band gap edges, while
attaining superluminal values within the band gap. Simple scalings of the
minimum and maximum group velocities with the imaginary part of the dielectric
function or, equivalently, the linewidth of the broadened states, are
presented. The results obtained are entirely general and may be applied to any
effect which results in a broadening of the electromagnetic states, such as
loss, disorder, finite-size effects, etc. This significantly limits the
reduction in group velocity attainable via photonic crystals.
