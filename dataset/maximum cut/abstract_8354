Using the Thermodynamic Formalism, we introduce a Gibbsian model for the
identification of regular grammars based only on positive evidence. This model
mimics the natural language acquisition procedure driven by prosody which is
here represented by the thermodynamical potential. The statistical question we
face is how to estimate the incidenc e matrix of a subshift of finite type from
a sample produced by a Gibbs state whose potential is known. The model
acquaints for both the robustness of t he language acquisition procedure and
language changes. The probabilistic appr oach we use avoids invoking ad-hoc
restrictions as Berwick's Subset Principle.
