We develop a unified approach to both infrared and ultraviolet asymptotics of
the fermion Green functions in the condensed matter systems that allow for an
effective description in the framework of the Quantum Electrodynamics. By
applying a path integral representation to the previously suggested form of the
physical electron propagator we demonstrate that in the massless case this
gauge invariant function features a "stronger-than-a-pole" branch-cut
singularity instead of the conjectured Luttinger-like behavior. The obtained
results alert one to the possibility that construction of physically relevant
amplitudes in the effective gauge theories might prove more complex than
previously thought.
