Let F be a family of subsets of an n-element set not containing four distinct
members such that A union B is contained in C intersect D. It is proved that
the maximum size of F under this condition is equal to the sum of the two
largest binomial coefficients of order n. The maximum families are also
characterized. A LYM-type inequality for such families is given, too.
