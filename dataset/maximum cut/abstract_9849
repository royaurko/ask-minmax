This paper presents a general theoretical framework of penalized
quasi-maximum likelihood (PQML) estimation in stationary multiple time series
models when the number of parameters possibly diverges. We show the oracle
property of the PQML estimator under high-level, but tractable, assumptions,
comprising the first half of the paper. Utilizing these results, we propose in
the latter half of the paper a method of sparse estimation in high-dimensional
vector autoregressive (VAR) models. Finally, the usability of the sparse
high-dimensional VAR model is confirmed with a simulation study and an
empirical analysis on a yield curve forecast.
