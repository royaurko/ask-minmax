The distribution of the orbits of close-in exoplanets shows evidence for
on-going removal and destruction by tides. Tides raised on a planet's host star
cause the planet's orbit to decay, even after the orbital eccentricity has
dropped to zero. Comparison of the observed orbital distribution and
predictions of tidal theory show good qualitative agreement, suggesting tidal
destruction of close-in exoplanets is common. The process can explain the
observed cut-off in small a-values, the clustering of orbital periods near
three days, and the relative youth of transiting planets. Contrary to previous
considerations, a mechanism to stop the inward migration of close-in planets at
their current orbits is not necessarily required. Planets nearing tidal
destruction may be found with extremely small a, possibly already stripped of
any gaseous envelope. The recently discovered CoRoT-Exo-7 b may be an example
of such a planet and will probably be destroyed by tides within the next few
Gyrs. Also, where one or more planets have already been accreted, a star may
exhibit an unusual composition and/or spin rate.
