We searched for narrow H$\alpha$ in a high-resolution spectrum of SN 1994D
taken 10 days before maximum, and found none. We estimate the limit this places
on the progenitor mass loss, and find that it is competitive with recent radio
limits, and excludes the highest-mass-loss-rate symbiotic systems as possible
progenitors of the normal Type Ia SN 1994D.
