We study Finsler PL spaces, that is simplicial complexes glued out of
simplices cut off from some normed spaces. We are interested in the class of
Finsler PL spaces featuring local uniqueness of geodesics (for complexes made
of Euclidean simplices, this property is equivalent to local CAT(0)). Though
non-Euclidean normed spaces never satisfy CAT(0), it turns out that they share
many common features. In particular, a globalization theorem holds: in a
simply-connected Finsler PL space local uniqueness of geodesics implies the
global one. However the situation is more delicate here: some basic convexity
properties do not extend to the PL Finsler case.
