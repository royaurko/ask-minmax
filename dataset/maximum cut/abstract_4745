Taking the MSSM as an effective low-energy theory, with a cut-off scale of a
few TeV, can make significant modifications to the predictions concerning the
Higgs and stop sectors. We investigate the consequences of such a scenario for
electroweak baryogenesis. We find that the window for MSSM baryogenesis is
extended and, most important, can be made significantly more natural.
Specifically, it is possible to have one stop lighter than the top and the
other significantly lighter than TeV simultaneously with the Higgs mass above
the LEP bound. In addition, various aspects concerning CP violation are
affected. Most notably, it is possible to have dynamical phases in the bubble
walls at tree level, providing CP violating sources for Standard Model
fermions.
