Radial, angular and total correlation energies are calculated for four
two-electron systems with atomic numbers Z=0-3 confined within an impenetrable
sphere of radius R. We report accurate results for the non-relativistic,
restricted Hartree-Fock and radial limit energies over a range of confinement
radii from 0.05 - 10 a0. At small R, the correlation energies approach limiting
values that are independent of Z while at intermediate R, systems with Z > 1
exhibit a characteristic maximum in the correlation energy resulting from an
increase in the angular correlation energy which is offset by a decrease in the
radial correlation energy.
