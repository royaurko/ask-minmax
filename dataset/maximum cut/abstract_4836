For the whole class of linear term rewriting systems, we define
\emph{bottom-up rewriting} which is a restriction of the usual notion of
rewriting. We show that bottom-up rewriting effectively inverse-preserves
recognizability and analyze the complexity of the underlying construction. The
Bottom-Up class (BU) is, by definition, the set of linear systems for which
every derivation can be replaced by a bottom-up derivation. Membership to BU
turns out to be undecidable, we are thus lead to define more restricted
classes: the classes SBU(k), k in N of Strongly Bottom-Up(k) systems for which
we show that membership is decidable. We define the class of Strongly Bottom-Up
systems by SBU = U_{k in \} SBU(k). We give a polynomial sufficient condition
for a system to be in $\SBU$. The class SBU contains (strictly) several classes
of systems which were already known to inverse preserve recognizability: the
inverse left-basic semi-Thue systems (viewed as unary term rewriting systems),
the linear growing term rewriting systems, the inverse
Linear-Finite-Path-Ordering systems.
