Highly sensitive magnetic susceptibility techniques were used to measure the
superconducting transition temperatures in S up to 231($\pm$5) GPa. S
transforms to a superconductor with T$_c$ of 10 K and has a discontinuity in
T_c dependence at 160 GPa corresponding to bco to beta-Po phase transition.
Above this pressure T_c in S has a maximum reaching about 17.3(+/-0.5) K at 200
GPa and then slowly decreases with pressure to 15 K at 230 GPa.
 This trend in the pressure dependence parallels the behavior of the heavier
members Se and Te. Superconductivity in Se was also observed from 15 to 25 GPa
with T_c changing from 4 to 6 K and above 150 GPa with T_c of 8 K.
Similiarities in the T_c dependences for S, Se, and Te, and the implications
for oxygen are discussed.
