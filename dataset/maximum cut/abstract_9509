Ferrite cavities are used in synchrotrons and storage rings if the maximum RF
frequency is in the order of a few MHz. We present a simple model for
describing ferrite cavities. The most important parameters are defined, and the
material properties are discussed. Several practical aspects are summarized,
and the GSI SIS18 ferrite cavity is presented as an example.
