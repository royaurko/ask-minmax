A possibility of jet energy scale setting by help of ``p p -> Z0+jet+X''
process at LHC is studied. The effect of new set of cuts, proposed in our
previous works, on the improvement of the Pt balance between Z0 boson and jet
is demonstrated. The distributions of the selected events over Z0 transverse
momentum and jet pseudorapidity are presented. A possibility of background
events suppression by use of the "Z0+jet" events selection criteria is shown.
  It is also found that the samples of "Z0+jet" events, gained with the cuts
for the jet energy calibration, may have enough statistics for determining the
gluon distribution inside a proton in the region of 2*10^{-4} < x < 1.0$ with
0.9*10^3 < Q^2 < 4*10^4 (GeV/c)^2.
  Monte Carlo events produced by the PYTHIA 5.7 generator are used here.
