The analysis of the solving complexity of random 3-SAT instances using the
Davis-Putnam-Loveland-Logemann (DPLL) algorithm slightly below threshold is
presented. While finding a solution for such instances demands exponential
effort with high probability, we show that an exponentially small fraction of
resolutions require a computation scaling linearly in the size of the instance
only. We compute analytically this exponentially small probability of easy
resolutions from a large deviation analysis of DPLL with the Generalized Unit
Clause search heuristic, and show that the corresponding exponent is smaller
(in absolute value) than the growth exponent of the typical resolution time.
Our study therefore gives some quantitative basis to heuristic restart solving
procedures, and suggests a natural cut-off cost (the size of the instance) for
the restart.
