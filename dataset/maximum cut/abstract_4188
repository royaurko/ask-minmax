The intermediate mass Higgs (IMH) can be abundantly produced through the
process $e^-\gamma \rightarrow W^-H\nu$ at TeV $e^-\gamma$ colliders, which are
realized by the laser back-scattering method. We search for the signature of
$W^-H \rightarrow (jj)(b\bar b)$ plus missing transverse momentum, with and
without considering the $b$-tagging. We also analyse all the potential
backgrounds from $e^-\gamma \rightarrow W^-Z\nu,\,W^-W^+e^-,\,ZZe^-,\, \bar t
b\nu$ and $t\bar t e^-$. With our selective acceptance cuts these backgrounds
are reduced to a manageable level. We find that for the entire intermediate
mass range 60 -- 150~GeV the Higgs discovery should be viable. We also present
detail formulas for the helicity amplitudes of these processes.
