We present spectra for 14 high-redshift (0.17 < z < 0.83) supernovae, which
were discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project as part of a campaign to
measure cosmological parameters. The spectra are used to determine the redshift
and classify the supernova type, essential information if the supernovae are to
be used for cosmological studies. Redshifts were derived either from the
spectrum of the host galaxy or from the spectrum of the supernova itself. We
present evidence that these supernovae are of Type Ia by matching to spectra of
nearby supernovae. We find that the dates of the spectra relative to maximum
light determined from this fitting process are consistent with the dates
determined from the photometric light curves, and moreover the spectral
time-sequence for SNe Type Ia at low and high redshift is indistinguishable. We
also show that the expansion velocities measured from blueshifted CaHK are
consistent with those measured for low-redshift Type Ia supernovae. From these
first-level quantitative comparisons we find no evidence for evolution in SNIa
properties between these low- and high-redshift samples. Thus even though our
samples may not be complete, we conclude that there is a population of SNe Ia
at high redshift whose spectral properties match those at low redshift.
