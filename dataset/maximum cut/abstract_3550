We consider the integral of fractional Brownian motion (IFBM) and its
functionals $\xi_T$ on the intervals $(0,T)$ and $(-T,T)$ of the following
types: the maximum $M_T$, the position of the maximum, the occupation time
above zero etc. We show how the asymptotics of $P(\xi_T<1)=p_T, T\to \infty$,
is related to the Hausdorff dimension of Lagrangian regular points for the
inviscid Burgers equation with FBM initial velocity. We produce computational
evidence in favor of a power asymptotics for $p_T$. The data do not reject the
hypothesis that the exponent $\theta$ of the power law is related to the
similarity parameter $H$ of fractional Brownian motion as follows: $\theta
=-(1-H)$ for the interval $(-T,T)$ and $\theta =-H(1-H)$ for $(0,T)$. The point
0 is special in that IFBM and its derivative both vanish there.
