We consider the degree/diameter problem for graphs embedded in a surface,
namely, given a surface $\Sigma$ and integers $\Delta$ and $k$, determine the
maximum order $N(\Delta,k,\Sigma)$ of a graph embeddable in $\Sigma$ with
maximum degree $\Delta$ and diameter $k$. We introduce a number of
constructions which produce many new largest known planar and toroidal graphs.
We record all these graphs in the available tables of largest known graphs.
Given a surface $\Sigma$ of Euler genus $g$ and an odd diameter $k$, the
current best asymptotic lower bound for $N(\Delta,k,\Sigma)$ is given by
\[\sqrt{\frac{3}{8}g}\Delta^{\lfloor k/2\rfloor}.\] Our constructions produce
new graphs of order \[\begin{cases}6\Delta^{\lfloor k/2\rfloor}& \text{if
$\Sigma$ is the Klein bottle}\\
\(\frac{7}{2}+\sqrt{6g+\frac{1}{4}}\)\Delta^{\lfloor k/2\rfloor}&
\text{otherwise,}\end{cases}\] thus improving the former value by a factor of
4.
