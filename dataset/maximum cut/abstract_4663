Data collected by the D0 detector at a p-pbar center-of-mass energy of 1.96
TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider have been used to search for pair
production of the lightest supersymmetric partner of the top quark decaying
into $b \ell \tilde{\nu}$. The search is performed in the $\ell\ell' = e\mu$
and $\mu \mu$ final states. No evidence for this process has been found in data
samples of approximately 400 pb^-1. The domain in the
[$M(\tilde{t}_1),M(\tilde{\nu})$] plane excluded at the 95% C.L. is
substantially extended by this search.
