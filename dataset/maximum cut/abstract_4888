We reformulate the second-order Schrodinger equation as a set of two coupled
first order differential equations, a so-called "Shabat-Zakharov system",
(sometimes called a "Zakharov-Shabat" system). There is considerable
flexibility in this approach, and we emphasise the utility of introducing an
"auxiliary condition" or "gauge condition" that is used to cut down the degrees
of freedom. Using this formalism, we derive the explicit (but formal) general
solution to the Schrodinger equation. The general solution depends on three
arbitrarily chosen functions, and a path-ordered exponential matrix. If one
considers path ordering to be an "elementary" process, then this represents
complete quadrature, albeit formal, of the second-order linear ODE.
