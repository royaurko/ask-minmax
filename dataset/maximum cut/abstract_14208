In this paper, we address the design of codes which achieve modulation
diversity in block fading single-input single-output (SISO) channels with
signal quantization at receiver and low-complexity decoding. With an
unquantized receiver, coding based on algebraic rotations is known to achieve
modulation coding diversity. On the other hand, with a quantized receiver,
algebraic rotations may not guarantee diversity. Through analysis, we propose
specific rotations which result in the codewords having equidistant
component-wise projections. We show that the proposed coding scheme achieves
maximum modulation diversity with a low-complexity minimum distance decoder and
perfect channel knowledge. Relaxing the perfect channel knowledge assumption we
propose a novel training/estimation and receiver control technique to estimate
the channel. We show that our coding/training/estimation scheme and minimum
distance decoding achieve an error probability performance similar to that
achieved with perfect channel knowledge.
