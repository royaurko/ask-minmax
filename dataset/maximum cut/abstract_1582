We consider radiative corrections to polarization observables in elastic
electron-proton scattering, in particular, for the polarization transfer
measurements of the proton form factor ratio $\mu G_E/G_M$. The corrections are
of two types: two-photon exchange (TPE) and bremsstrahlung (BS); in the present
work we pay special attention to the latter. Assuming small missing energy or
missing mass cut-off, the correction can be represented in a model-independent
form, with both electron and proton radiation taken into account. Numerical
calculations show that the contribution of the proton radiation is not
negligible. Overall, at high $Q^2$ and energies the total correction to $\mu
G_E/G_M$ grows, but is dominated by TPE. At low energies both TPE and BS may be
significant; the latter amounts to ~ 0.01 for some reasonable cut-off choices.
