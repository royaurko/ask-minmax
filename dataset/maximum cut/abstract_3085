We perform numerical simulations of the gravitational collapse of a
spherically symmetric scalar field. For those data that just barely do not form
black holes we find the maximum curvature at the position of the central
observer. We find a scaling relation between this maximum curvature and
distance from the critical solution. The scaling relation is analogous to that
found by Choptuik for black hole mass for those data that do collapse to form
black holes. We also find a periodic wiggle in the scaling exponent.
