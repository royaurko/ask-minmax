We present a new analytic time dependent solution of cubic string field
theory at the lowest order in the level truncation scheme. The tachyon profile
we have found is a bounce in time, a $C^{\infty}$ function which represents an
almost exact solution, with an extremely good degree of accuracy, of the
classical equations of motion of the truncated string field theory. Such a
finite energy solution describes a tachyon which at $x^0=-\infty$ is at the
maximum of the potential, at later times rolls toward the stable minimum and
then up to the other side of the potential toward the inversion point and
thenback to the unstable maximum for $x^0\to+\infty$. The energy-momentum
tensor associated with this rolling tachyon solution can be explicitly
computed. The energy density is constant, the pressure is an even function of
time which can change sign while the tachyon rolls toward the minimum of its
potential. A new form of tachyon matter is realized which might be relevant for
cosmological applications.
