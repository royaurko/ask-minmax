A semi-quantitative estimate of the prehadron production time based on recent
preliminary HERMES data on hadron transverse momentum broadening in nuclear DIS
is presented. The obtained production time can well explain the data except for
their dependence on the photon virtuality, which remains a challenge to current
theoretical models. A few mechanisms that may contribute to its explanation are
suggested, along with possible experimental tests. The average time scale at
HERMES is found to be of the order of 4-5 fm, comparable to heavy nuclei radii,
so that by suitable kinematic cuts it will be possible to study both the case
in which hadronization starts inside and the case in which it starts outside
the nucleus. A comparison with recent CLAS preliminary data, which
qualitatively but not quantitatively agree with HERMES, is performed.
