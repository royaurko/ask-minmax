We report here on a sequence of 28 observations of the binary pulsar system
PSR B1259-63/SS2883 at four radio frequencies made with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array around the time of the 2000 periastron passage. Observations made
on 2000 Sep 1 show that the pulsar's apparent rotation measure (RM) reached a
maximum of $-14800 \pm 1800$ rad m$^{-2}$, some 700 times the value measured
away from periastron, and is the largest astrophysical RM measured. This value,
combined with the dispersion measure implies a magnetic field in the Be star's
wind of 6 mG. We find that the light curve of the unpulsed emission is similar
to that obtained during the 1997 periastron but that differences in detail
imply that the emission disc of the Be star is thicker and/or of higher
density. The behaviour of the light curve at late times is best modelled by the
adiabatic expansion of a synchrotron bubble formed in the pulsar/disc
interaction. The expansion rate of the bubble $\sim 12$ km s$^{-1}$ is
surprisingly low but the derived magnetic field of 1.6 G close to that
expected.
