A new method of calculating pairing correlations in coordinate space with
finite range interactions is presented. In the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)
approach the mean field part is derived from a Skyrme-type force whereas the
pairing field is constructed with a Gogny force. An iterative scheme is used
for solving the integro-differential HFB equations via the introduction of a
local equivalent potential. The method is illustrated on the case of the
nucleus $^{18}$C. It is shown that the results are insensitive to the cut off
value in the quasiparticle spectrum if this value is above 100 MeV.
