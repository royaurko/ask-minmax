We study a simple extension of Linde's hybrid inflation model, with the
inflaton mass term replaced by the most general renormalizable potential for
$\phi$. The unprocessed power spectrum of density perturbations can have two
minima and one maximum, roughly corresponding to two steep regions separated by
a somewhat flat region in $V(\phi)$. In the examples studied here, sufficient
amount of inflation and normalization to COBE require a vacuum scale of
$10^{16}$ GeV and a $\phi$ mass of $10^{13}$ GeV. Depending on the initial
value of $\phi$, our model can give either less ($\sim n<1$) or more ($\sim
n>1$) power on small scales compared to the scale-invariant spectrum ($n=1$),
given the normalization to COBE.
