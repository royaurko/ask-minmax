We present X-ray analysis of two Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries: V444 Cyg and CD
Cru using the data from observations with XMM-Newton. The X-ray light curves
show the phase locked variability in both binaries, where the flux increased by
a factor of $\sim 2$ in the case of V444 Cyg and $\sim 1.5$ in the case of CD
Cru from minimum to maximum. The maximum luminosities in the 0.3--7.5 keV
energy band were found to be $5.8\times10^{32}$ and $2.8\times10^{32}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ for V444 Cyg and CD Cru, respectively. X-ray spectra of these stars
confirmed large extinction and revealed hot plasma with prominent emission line
features of highly ionized Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe, and are found to be
consistent with a two-temperature plasma model. The cooler plasma at a
temperature of $\sim$ 0.6 keV was found to be constant at all phases of both
binaries, and could be due to a distribution of small-scale shocks in
radiation-driven outflows. The hot components in these binaries were found to
be phase dependent. They varied from 1.85 to 9.61 keV for V444 Cyg and from
1.63 to 4.27 keV for CD Cru. The absorption of the hard component varied with
orbital phase and found to be maximum during primary eclipse of V444 Cyg. The
high plasma temperature and variability with orbital phase suggest that the
hard-component emission is caused by a colliding wind shock between the binary
components.
