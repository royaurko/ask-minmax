Context: Acceleration in coronal mass ejection driven shocks is currently
considered the primary source of large solar energetic particle events.
  Aims: The solar wind, which feeds shock-accelerated particles, includes
numerous ion populations, which offer much insight into acceleration processes.
We present first simulations of shock-accelerated minor ions, in order to
explore trapping dynamics and acceleration timescales in detail.
  Methods: We have simulated diffusive shock acceleration of minor ions (3He2+,
4He2+, 16O6+ and 56Fe14+) and protons using a Monte Carlo method, where
self-generated Alfv\'enic turbulence allows for repeated shock crossings and
acceleration to high energies.
  Results: We present the effect of minor ions on wave generation, especially
at low wavenumbers, and show that it is significant. We find that maximum ion
energy is determined by the competing effects of particle escape due to
focusing in an expanding flux tube and trapping due to the amplified
turbulence. We show the dependence of cut-off energy on the particle charge to
mass ratio to be approximately (Q/A)^1.5.
  Conclusions: We suggest that understanding the acceleration of minor ions at
coronal shocks requires simulations which allow us to explore trapping dynamics
and acceleration timescales in detail, including evolution of the turbulent
trapping boundary. We conclude that steady-state models do not adequately
describe the acceleration of heavy ions in coronal shocks.
