We extend the event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm from hard-sphere interactions
to the micro-canonical ensemble (constant potential energy) for general
potentials. This event-driven Monte Carlo algorithm is non-local,
rejection-free, and allows for the breaking of detailed balance. The algorithm
uses a discretized potential, but its running speed is asymptotically
independent of the discretization. We implement the algorithm for the cut-off
linear potential, and discuss its possible implementation directly in the
continuum limit.
