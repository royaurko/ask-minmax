We describe a method for the accurate calculation of bound-state and
resonance energies for one-dimensional potentials. We calculate the shape
resonances for symmetric two-barrier potentials and compare them with those
coming from the Siegert approximation, the complex scaling method and the
box-stabilization method. A comparison of the Breit-Wigner profile and the
transmission coefficient about its maximum illustrates that the agreement is
better the sharper the resonance.
