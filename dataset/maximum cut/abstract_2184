We study the potential of the LEP200 collider for chargino production and the
possibility of the determination of some fundamental SUSY parameters through
the relation with this study. Total cross sections for two basic signatures of
pair chargino production and for main backgrounds are calculated. The set of
kinematic cuts is proposed for the effective background suppression and
extraction of the signal. Calculations and the MC simulation performed give the
limits on chargino and neutralino masses that could be obtained at LEP200 with
$\sqrt s =$ 200 GeV.
