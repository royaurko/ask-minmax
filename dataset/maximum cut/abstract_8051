The pulsar IGR J16393-4643 belongs to a class of highly absorbed supergiant
HMXBs, characterised by very high column density of absorbing matter. We
present the results of the simultaneous broad-band pulsation and spectrum
analysis, from a 44 kilosec Suzaku observation of the source. The orbital
intensity profile created with the SWIFT-BAT light-curve shows an indication of
IGR J16393-4643 being an eclipsing system with a short eclipse semi-angle
$\theta_{E} \sim$ 17$^{\circ}$. For a supergiant companion star with a 20
R$_{\odot}$ radius, this implies an inclination of the orbital plane in the
range of 39$^{\circ}$-57$^{\circ}$, whereas for a main sequence B star as the
companion with a 10 R$_{\odot}$ radius, the inclination of the orbital plane is
in the range of 60$^{\circ}$-77$^{\circ}$. Pulse profiles created for different
energy bands, have complex morphology which shows some energy dependence and
increases in pulse fraction with energy. We have also investigated broad-band
spectral characteristics, for phase averaged and resolving the pulse phase into
peak phase and trough phase. The phase averaged spectrum has a very high N$_{H}
(\sim 3 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) and is described by power-law ($\Gamma \sim$
0.9) with a high energy cut-off above 20 keV. We find a change in the spectral
index in the peak phase and trough phase, implying an underlying change in the
source spectrum.
