A maximum principle for C^0 null hypersurfaces is obtained and used to derive
a splitting theorem for spacetimes which contain null lines. As a consequence
of this null splitting theorem, it is proved that an asymptotically simple
vacuum (Ricci flat) spacetime which contains a null line is isometric to
Minkowski space.
