The modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are used to study some fundamental
problems for the high temperature superconductors. The derivations of these
fundamental equations are summarized and the layered features of the sample
were taken into consideration and the relation between the coherence length and
the separation distance of the layers. The domain wall energy, the maximum
supercurrent and the parallel critical field of high temerature superconducting
thin film were evaluated. Comparison with previous works is given
