A sizeable difference in the differential production cross section of top-
compared to antitop-quark production, denoted charge asymmetry, has been
observed at the Tevatron. The experimental results seem to exceed the theory
predictions based on the Standard Model by a significant amount and have
triggered a large number of suggestions for "new physics". In the present paper
the Standard Model predictions for Tevatron and LHC experiments are revisited.
This includes a reanalysis of electromagnetic as well as weak corrections,
leading to a shift of the asymmetry by roughly a factor 1.1 when compared to
the results of the first papers on this subject. The impact of cuts on the
transverse momentum of the top-antitop system is studied. Restricting the ttbar
system to a transverse momentum less than 20 GeV leads to an enhancement of the
asymmetries by factors between 1.3 and 1.5, indicating the importance of an
improved understanding of the $t\bar t$-momentum distribution. Predictions for
similar measurements at the LHC are presented, demonstrating the sensitivity of
the large rapidity region both to the Standard Model contribution and effects
from "new physics".
