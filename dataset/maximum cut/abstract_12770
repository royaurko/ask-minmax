"Extended Clifford algebras" are introduced as a means to obtain low ML
decoding complexity space-time block codes. Using left regular matrix
representations of two specific classes of extended Clifford algebras, two
systematic algebraic constructions of full diversity Distributed Space-Time
Codes (DSTCs) are provided for any power of two number of relays. The left
regular matrix representation has been shown to naturally result in space-time
codes meeting the additional constraints required for DSTCs. The DSTCs so
constructed have the salient feature of reduced Maximum Likelihood (ML)
decoding complexity. In particular, the ML decoding of these codes can be
performed by applying the lattice decoder algorithm on a lattice of four times
lesser dimension than what is required in general. Moreover these codes have a
uniform distribution of power among the relays and in time, thus leading to a
low Peak to Average Power Ratio at the relays.
