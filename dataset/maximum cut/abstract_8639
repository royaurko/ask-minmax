We investigate the masses of 0+ and 2+ glueballs in SU(2) lattice gauge
theory using abelian projection to the maximum abelian gauge. We calculate
glueball masses using both abelian links and monopole operators. Both methods
reproduce the known full SU(2) results quantitatively. Positivity problems
present in the abelian projection are discussed. We study the dependence of the
glueball masses on magnetic current loop size, and find that the 0+ state
requires a much greater range of sizes than does the 2+ state.
