We propose a fast and efficient bispectrum statistic for Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) temperature anisotropies to constrain the amplitude of the
primordial non-Gaussian signal measured in terms of the non-linear coupling
parameter f_NL. We show how the method can achieve a remarkable computational
advantage by focussing on subsets of the multipole configurations, where the
non-Gaussian signal is more concentrated. The detection power of the test,
increases roughly linearly with the maximum multipole, as shown in the ideal
case of an experiment without noise and gaps. The CPU-time scales as l_{max}^3
instead of l_{max}^5 for the full bispectrum which for Planck resolution
l_{max} \sim 3000 means an improvement in speed of a factor 10^7 compared to
the full bispectrum analysis with minor loss in precision. We find that the
introduction of a galactic cut partially destroys the optimality of the
configuration, which will then need to be dealt with in the future. We find for
an ideal experiment with l_{max}=2000 that upper limits of f_{NL}<8 can be
obtained at 1 sigma. For the case of the WMAP experiment, we would be able to
put limits of |f_{NL}|<40 if no galactic cut were present. Using the real data
with galactic cut, we obtain an estimate of -80<f_{NL}<80 and -160<f_{NL}<160
at 1 and 2 sigma respectively.
