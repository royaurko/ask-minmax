It is shown that there exist non-singular cubic surfaces in CP^3 containing 5
twistor lines. This is the maximum number of twistor fibres that a non-singular
cubic can contain. Cubic surfaces in CP^3 with 5 twistor lines are classified
up to transformations preserving the conformal structure of S^4.
