Our study on the cut-off effects in quenched light hadron spectroscopy and
pion scattering length with the fixed point action is extended by results
obtained at a lattice spacing a=0.102 fm in a box of size L=1.8 fm. The cut-off
effects are small, but clearly seen as the resolution is increased from a=0.153
fm to a=0.102 fm. In the quark mass region where the errors are small and under
control, our results on the APE plot lie close to the extrapolated numbers of
the CP-PACS Collaboration.
