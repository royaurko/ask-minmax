The effect of strain on the resistivity and thermopower of ferromagnetic
manganites has been examined based on the model that incorporates the
electron-lattice interaction through the Jahn-Teller effect and an effective
hopping determined by nearest neighbour spin-spin correlation of t2g electrons.
The metal insulator transition temperature associated with resistivity
decreases with increase in strain. In the presence of large strain the system
remains in the semiconducting state. Thermopower (S) is positive and increasing
function of strain and it exhibits a maximum with temperature. The temperature
where maximum of S appears, shifts towards higher (lower) value with in the
presence of magnetic field (strain). A large magneto-thermopower that depends
on strain is obtained around metal-insulator transition.
