We study the entanglement evolution between two harmonic oscillators having
different free frequencies each leaking into an independent bath. We use an
exact solution valid in the weak coupling limit and in the short time
non-Markovian regime. The reservoirs are identical and characterized by an
Ohmic spectral distribution with Lorents-Drude cut-off. This work is an
extension of the case reported in [Phys. Rev. A 80, 062324 (2009)] where the
oscillators have the same free frequency.
