We report associated high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
and transport measurements on a series of isolated multiwalled carbon
nanotubes. HRTEM observations, by revealing relevant structural features of the
tubes, shed some light on the variety of observed transport behaviors, from
semiconducting to quasi-metallic type. Non Ohmic behavior is observed for
certain samples which exhibit "bamboo like" structural defects. The resistance
of the most conducting sample, measured down to 20 mK, exhibits a pronounced
maximum at 0.6 K and strong positive magnetoresistance.
