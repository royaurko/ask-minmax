This paper sets out to explain: 1. Why the speed of light c is a constant and
is the maximum speed at which any moving entity can travel. 2. Why time elapsed
is different for a moving entity relative to a stationary entity. 3. Why there
has been confusion between the wave and particle nature of an entity. 4. The
relation between the speed of light c, Planck's constant k and time 5. An
expression for Mass using this notation 6. The derivation for De Broglie's
theorem 7. Indeterminacy of position
