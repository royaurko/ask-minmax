We study the effects of splayed columnar pins on the vortex motion using
realistic London Langevin simulations. At low currents vortex creep is strongly
suppressed, whereas the critical current j_c is enhanced only moderately.
Splaying the pins generates an increasing energy barrier against vortex
hopping, and leads to the forced entanglement of vortices, both of which
suppress creep efficiently. On the other hand splaying enhances kink nucleation
and introduces intersecting pins, which cut off the energy barriers. Thus the
j_c enhancement is strongly parameter sensitive. We also characterize the angle
dependence of j_c, and the effect of different splaying geometries.
