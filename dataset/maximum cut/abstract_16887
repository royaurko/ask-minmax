It is well known that the Space-time Block Codes (STBCs) from Complex
orthogonal designs (CODs) are single-symbol decodable/symbol-by-symbol
decodable (SSD). The weight matrices of the square CODs are all unitary and
obtainable from the unitary matrix representations of Clifford Algebras when
the number of transmit antennas $n$ is a power of 2. The rate of the square
CODs for $n = 2^a$ has been shown to be $\frac{a+1}{2^a}$ complex symbols per
channel use. However, SSD codes having unitary-weight matrices need not be
CODs, an example being the Minimum-Decoding-Complexity STBCs from
Quasi-Orthogonal Designs. In this paper, an achievable upper bound on the rate
of any unitary-weight SSD code is derived to be $\frac{a}{2^{a-1}}$ complex
symbols per channel use for $2^a$ antennas, and this upper bound is larger than
that of the CODs. By way of code construction, the interrelationship between
the weight matrices of unitary-weight SSD codes is studied. Also, the coding
gain of all unitary-weight SSD codes is proved to be the same for QAM
constellations and conditions that are necessary for unitary-weight SSD codes
to achieve full transmit diversity and optimum coding gain are presented.
