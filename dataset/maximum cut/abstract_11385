We report optical, radio and X-ray observations of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1
galaxy RX J1702.5+3247. The soft (0.1-2 keV) X-ray flux, measured by BeppoSAX,
is characterized by strong variability on short time scales (< 500 sec). The
most extreme amplitude variations require a radiative efficiency exceeding the
maximum for a Kerr black hole, implying the presence of relativistic effects. A
comparison with archival ROSAT data reveals long term temporal and spectral
variability. The 0.1-10 keV spectrum is equally well fitted either by an
ionized reflection disk model, or by a broken power law plus a Gaussian line,
consistent with a hydrogen-like iron line at 6.97 keV from a highly ionized
accretion disk.
