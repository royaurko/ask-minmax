OFDM signals demonstrates high fluctuations termed as Peak to Average Power
Ratio (PAPR).The problem of OFDM is the frequent occurrence of high Peaks in
the time domain signal which in turn reduces the efficiency of transmit high
power amplifier.In this paper we discussed clipping and filtering technique
which is easy to implement and reduces the amount of PAPR by clipping the peak
of the maximum power signal.This technique clips the OFDM signal to a
predefined threshold and uses a filter to eliminate the out-of-band
radiation.Moreover, analysis of PAPR is given by varying different filters.The
study is focused to reduce PAPR by iterative clipping and filtering method. The
symbol error rate performances for different modulation techniques have been
countered.Each clipping noise sample is multiplied by a window
function(e.g.Hanning,Kaiser, or Hamming) to suppress the out-of-band noise.It
is shown that clipping and different filtering techniques for improvement in
the SER performance and provides further reduction in PAPR.
