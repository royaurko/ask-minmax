Given a numerical semigroup $S = < a_1, a_2,..., a_t>$ and $s\in S$, we
consider the factorization $s = c_1 a_1 + c_2 a_2 +... + c_t a_t$ where
$c_i\ge0$. Such a factorization is {\em maximal} if $c_1+c_2+...+c_t$ is a
maximum over all such factorizations of $s$. We show that the number of maximal
factorizations, varying over the elements in $S$, is always bounded. Thus, we
define $\dx(S)$ to be the maximum number of maximal factorizations of elements
in $S$. We study maximal factorizations in depth when $S$ has embedding
dimension less than four, and establish formulas for $\dx(S)$ in this case.
