The dependences of the maximum and the half-width of near band-edge
photoluminescence of semi-insulating undoped GaAs crystals at 77K on the
concentration of background acceptor impurities and the level of excitation in
the range from 3x1021 to 6x1022 quantum/(cm2/s) are investigated. The observed
dependences are explained by formation of the density tails of states as a
result of fluctuations of impurity concentration and participation of localized
states of the donor impurity band in radiative transitions. Reduction of
many-particle interaction at increasing of N can be connected with increasing
of shielding of charge carriers by atoms of impurity.
