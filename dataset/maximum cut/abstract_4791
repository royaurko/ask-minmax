For points in SUSY parameter space where the sneutrino is lighter than the
lightest chargino and next-to-lightest neutralino, its direct mass
determination from sneutrino pair production process at e+e- collider is
impossible since it decays invisibly. In such a scenario the sneutrino can be
discovered and its mass determined from measurements of two-body decays of
charginos produced in pairs at the ILC. Using the event generator WHIZARD we
study the prospects of measuring sneutrino properties in a realistic ILC
environment. In our analysis we include beamstrahlung, initial state radiation,
a complete account of reducible backgrounds from SM and SUSY processes, and a
complete matrix-element calculation of the SUSY signal which encompasses all
irreducible background and interference contributions. We also simulate photon
induced background processes using exact matrix elements. Radiation effects and
the cuts to reduce background strongly modify the edges of the lepton energy
spectra from which the sneutrino and chargino mass are determined. We discuss
possible approaches to measure the sneutrino mass with optimal precision.
