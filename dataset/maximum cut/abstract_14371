An edge-colored graph is rainbow if all its edges are colored with distinct
colors. For a fixed graph $H$, the rainbow Tur\'an number
$\mathrm{ex}^{\ast}(n,H)$ is defined as the maximum number of edges in a
properly edge-colored graph on $n$ vertices with no rainbow copy of $H$. We
study the rainbow Tur\'an number of even cycles, and prove that for every fixed
$\varepsilon > 0$, there is a constant $C(\varepsilon)$ such that every
properly edge-colored graph on $n$ vertices with at least $C(\varepsilon) n^{1
+ \varepsilon}$ edges contains a rainbow cycle of even length at most $2 \lceil
\frac{\ln 4 - \ln \varepsilon}{\ln (1 + \varepsilon)} \rceil$. This partially
answers a question of Keevash, Mubayi, Sudakov, and Verstra\"ete, who asked how
dense a graph can be without having a rainbow cycle of any length.
