We make an inventory of the baryonic and gravitating mass in structures
ranging from the smallest galaxies to rich clusters of galaxies. We find that
the fraction of baryons converted to stars reaches a maximum between M500 =
1E12 and 1E13 Msun, suggesting that star formation is most efficient in bright
galaxies in groups. The fraction of baryons detected in all forms deviates
monotonically from the cosmic baryon fraction as a function of mass. On the
largest scales of clusters, most of the expected baryons are detected, while in
the smallest dwarf galaxies, fewer than 1% are detected. Where these missing
baryons reside is unclear.
