Gravity can become strong at the TeV scale in the theory of extra dimensions.
An effective Lagrangian can be used to describe the gravitational interactions
below a cut-off scale. In this work, we study the diphoton production in
$\gamma\gamma$, $p\bar p$, and $e^+ e^-$ collisions in the model of low scale
gravity. Since in the standard model photon-photon scattering only occurs via
box diagrams, the cross section is highly suppressed. Thus, photon-photon
scattering opens an interesting opportunity for studying the new gravity
interaction, which allows tree-level photon couplings. In addition, we also
examine the diphoton production at hadronic and $e^+ e^-$ colliders. We derive
the limits on the cut-off scale from the available diphoton data and also
estimate the sensitivity reach in Run II at the Tevaton and at the future
linear $e^+ e^-$ colliders.
