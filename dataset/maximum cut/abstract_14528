In previous work, we have predicted novel effects, such as exchange
broadening, anomalous scaling of the localization length and a blue shift of
the absorption spectrum with increasing disorder strength, for static disorder
models described by stable distributions with stability index {\alpha}<1. The
main points of the Comment are that the outliers introduced by heavy tails in
the disorder distribution (i) do not lead to deviations from the conventional
scaling law for the half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the absorption
spectrum and (ii) do not lead to non-universality of the distribution of
localization lengths. We show below that the findings reported by us in the
Letter are correct and that the wrong conclusions of the Comment arise from
focusing on small {\sigma} values.
