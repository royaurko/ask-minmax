We consider estimation of a sparse parameter vector that determines the
covariance matrix of a Gaussian random vector via a sparse expansion into known
"basis matrices". Using the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, we
derive lower bounds on the variance of estimators with a given mean function.
This includes unbiased estimation as a special case. We also present a
numerical comparison of our lower bounds with the variance of two standard
estimators (hard-thresholding estimator and maximum likelihood estimator).
