We present a theoretical study on the superconductivity in
\beta'-(BEDT-TTF)_2ICl_2 at Tc=14.2K under high hydrostatic pressure found by
Taniguchi et al., which is the highest record among organic superconductors.
Its electronic structure is well expressed by the anisotropic triangular
lattice Hubbard model at half filling. In the present work, we study this
effective model by using the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation. In the
obtained phase diagram, the superconductivity with d_{x^2-y^2} like symmetry is
realized next to the antiferromagnetic (AF) insulating phase, as a result of
the 1D-2D dimensional crossover driven by the pressure. The obtained maximum Tc
is 16-18K. In addition, the superconductivity in \beta-(BEDT-TTF)_2X is also
understood in the same framework.
