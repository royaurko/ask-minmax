In this contribution to Light Cone 2014, three average transverse momentum
quantities are discussed: the Sivers shift, the dijet imbalance, and the $p_T$
broadening. The definitions of these quantities involve integrals over all
transverse momenta that are overly sensitive to the region of large transverse
momenta, which conveys little information about the transverse momentum
distributions of quarks and gluons inside hadrons. TMD factorization naturally
suggests alternative definitions of such integrated quantities, using
Bessel-weighting and rapidity cut-offs, with the conventional definitions as
limiting cases. The regularized quantities are given in terms of integrals over
the TMDs of interest that are well-defined and moreover have the advantage of
being amenable to lattice evaluations.
