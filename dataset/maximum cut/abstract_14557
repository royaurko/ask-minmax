50nm thick nanogranular polycrystalline dysprosium thin films have been
prepared via ultra-high vacuum DC sputtering on SiO2 and Si wafers. The maximum
in-plane spontaneous magnetization at T = 4K was found to be MS4K = 3.28T for
samples deposited on wafers heated to 350C with a Neel point of TN = 173K and a
ferromagnetic transition at TC = 80K, measured via zero field cooled field
cooled magnetization measurements, close to single crystal values. The slightly
reduced magnetization is explained in the light of a metastable face centered
cubic crystal phase which occurred at the seed interface and granularity
related effects, that are still noticeably influential despite an in-plane
magnetic easy axis. As deposited samples showed reduced magnetization of MS4K =
2.26T, however their ferromagnetic transition shifted to a much higher
temperature of TC = 172K and the antiferromagnetic phase was completely
suppressed probably as a result of strain.
