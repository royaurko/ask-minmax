The purpose of this work is to investigate the role of the lattice in the
optical Kubo sum rule in the cuprates. We compute conductivities, optical
integrals W, and \Delta W between superconducting and normal states for 2-D
systems with lattice dispersion typical of the cuprates for four different
models -- a dirty BCS model, a single Einstein boson model, a marginal Fermi
liquid model, and a collective boson model with a feedback from
super-conductivity on a collective boson. The goal of the paper is two-fold.
First, we analyze the dependence of W on the upper cut-off w_c placed on the
optical integral because in experiments W is measured up to frequencies of
order bandwidth. For a BCS model, the Kubo sum rule is almost fully reproduced
at w_c equal to the bandwidth. But for other models only 70%-80% of Kubo sum
rule is obtained up to this scale and even less so for \Delta W, implying that
the Kubo sum rule has to be applied with caution. Second, we analyze the sign
of \Delta W. In all models we studied \Delta W is positive at small w_c, then
crosses zero and approaches a negative value at large w_c, i.e. the optical
integral in a superconductor is smaller than in a normal state. The point of
zero crossing, however, increases with the interaction strength and in a
collective boson model becomes comparable to the bandwidth at strong coupling.
We argue that this model exhibits the behavior consistent with that in the
cuprates.
