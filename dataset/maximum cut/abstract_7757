We consider the nonlinear propagation of electrostatic wave packets in an
ultra-relativistic (UR) degenerate dense electron-ion plasma, whose dynamics is
governed by the nonlocal two-dimensional nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger-like
equations. The coupled set of equations are then used to study the modulational
instability (MI) of a uniform wave train to an infinitesimal perturbation of
multi-dimensional form. The condition for the MI is obtained, and it is shown
that the nondimensional parameter, $\beta\propto\lambda_C n_0^{1/3}$ (where
$\lambda_C$ is the reduced Compton wavelength and $n_0$ is the particle number
density), associated with the UR pressure of degenerate electrons, shifts the
stable (unstable) regions at $n_{0}\sim10^{30}$ cm$^{-3}$ to unstable (stable)
ones at higher densities, i.e. $n_{0}\gtrsim7\times10^{33}$. It is also found
that {the} higher the values of $n_{0}$, the lower is the growth rate of MI
with cut-offs at lower wave numbers of modulation. Furthermore, the dynamical
evolution of the wave packets is studied numerically. We show that either they
disperse away or they blowup in a finite time, when the wave action is below or
above the threshold. The results could be useful for understanding the
properties of modulated wave packets and their multi-dimensional evolution in
UR degenerate dense plasmas, such as those in the interior of white dwarfs
{and/or} pre-Supernova stars.
