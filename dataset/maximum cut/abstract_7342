The evolution of high redshift galaxies in the two Hubble Deep Fields, HDF-N
and HDF-S, is investigated using a cloning technique that replicates z~ 2-3 U
dropouts to higher redshifts, allowing a comparison with the observed B and V
dropouts at higher redshifts (z ~ 4-5). We treat each galaxy selected for
replication as a set of pixels that are k-corrected to higher redshift,
accounting for resampling, shot-noise, surface-brightness dimming, and the
cosmological model. We find evidence for size evolution (a 1.7x increase) from
z ~ 5 to z ~ 2.7 for flat geometries (Omega_M+Omega_LAMBDA=1.0). Simple scaling
laws for this cosmology predict that size evolution goes as (1+z)^{-1},
consistent with our result. The UV luminosity density shows a similar increase
(1.85x) from z ~ 5 to z ~ 2.7, with minimal evolution in the distribution of
intrinsic colors for the dropout population. In general, these results indicate
less evolution than was previously reported, and therefore a higher luminosity
density at z ~ 4-5 (~ 50% higher) than other estimates. We argue the present
technique is the preferred way to understand evolution across samples with
differing selection functions, the most relevant differences here being the
color cuts and surface brightness thresholds (e.g., due to the (1+z)^4 cosmic
surface brightness dimming effect).
