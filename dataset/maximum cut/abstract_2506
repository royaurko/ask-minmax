We propose an holographic quintessence and tachyon models of dark energy. The
correspondence between the quintessence and tachyon energy densities with the
holographic density, allows the reconstruction of the potentials and the
dynamics for the quintessence and tachyon fields, in flat FRW background. The
proposed infrared cut-off for the holographic energy density works for two
cases of the constant $\alpha$: for $\alpha<1$ we reconstructed the holographic
quintessence model in the region before the $\omega=-1$ crossing for the EoS
parameter. The cosmological dynamics for $\alpha>1$ was also reconstructed for
the holographic quintessence and tachyon models.
