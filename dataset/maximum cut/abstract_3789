We present here results on the composite luminosity functions of galaxies in
the clusters of galaxies selected from the SDSS Cut and Enhance cluster catalog
(CE; Goto et al. 2001). We construct the composite luminosity function in the
five SDSS bands, u,g,r,i and z, using 204 CE clusters ranging from z=0.02 to
z=0.25. We use photometric redshifts to construct composite luminosity
functions. The robustness of the weighting scheme was tested using Monte Carlo
simulation. We find the slope of composite LFs become flatter toward redder
color band. Comparing with field LFs of SDSS (Blanton et al. 2001), cluster LFs
have brighter characteristic magnitude and flatter slopes in g, r, i and z
bands. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cluster LF has
two distinct underlying populations i.e. the bright end of the LF is dominated
by bright early types that follow a gaussian--like luminosity distribution,
while the faint--end of the cluster LF is a steep power--law like function
dominated by star--forming (bluer) galaxies. We also study the composite
luminosity functions for early--type and late--type galaxies using profile
fits, a concentration parameter and u-r color to classify galaxy morphology.
The strong dependence of LF on galaxy morphology is found.The faint end slope
of the LF is always flatter for early--type galaxies than late--type regardless
of passband and methodology. These results are consistent with the hypothesis
that the cluster region are dominated by bright elliptical galaxies.
