We give lower bounds on the maximum possible girth of an $r$-uniform,
$d$-regular hypergraph with at most $n$ vertices, using the definition of a
hypergraph cycle due to Berge. These differ from the trivial upper bound by an
absolute constant factor (viz., by a factor of between $3/2+o(1)$ and $2
+o(1)$). We also define a random $r$-uniform `Cayley' hypergraph on $S_n$ which
has girth $\Omega (\sqrt{\log |S_n|})$ with high probability, in contrast to
random regular $r$-uniform hypergraphs, which have constant girth with positive
probability.
