We study the infrared behaviour of lattice SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb
gauge in terms of the ghost propagator, the Coulomb potential and the
transversal and the time-time component of the equal-time gluon propagator. In
particular, we focus on the Gribov problem and its impact on the observables.
We observe that the simulated annealing method is advantageous for fixing the
Coulomb gauge in large volumes. We study finite size and discretization
effects. While finite size effects can be controlled by the cone cut, and the
ghost propagator and the Coulomb potential become scaling functions with the
cylinder cut, the equal-time gluon propagator does not show scaling in the
considered range of the inverse coupling constant. The ghost propagator is
infrared enhanced. The Coulomb potential is now extended to considerably lower
momenta and shows a more complicated infrared regime. The Coulomb string
tension satisfies Zwanziger's inequality, but its estimate can be considered
only preliminary because of the systematic Gribov effect that is particularly
strong for the Coulomb potential.
