We present the results of our study of the emission from the transient
burster MX 0836-42 using its observations by the INTEGRAL and RXTE X-ray and
gamma-ray observatories in the period 2003-2004. The source's broadband X-ray
spectrum in the energy range 3-120 keV has been obtained and investigated for
the first time. We have detected 39 X-ray bursts from this source. Their
analysis shows that the maximum 3-20 keV flux varies significantly from burst
to burst, F ~ (0.5-1.5)x10^{-8} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. Using the flux at the
maximum of the brightest detected burst, we determined an upper limit for the
distance to the source, D ~ 8 kpc.
