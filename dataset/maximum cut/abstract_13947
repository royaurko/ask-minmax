A set $W\subseteq V(G)$ is called a resolving set, if for each two distinct
vertices $u,v\in V(G)$ there exists $w\in W$ such that $d(u,w)\neq d(v,w)$,
where $d(x,y)$ is the distance between the vertices $x$ and $y$. The minimum
cardinality of a resolving set for $G$ is called the metric dimension of $G$,
and denoted by $\beta(G)$. In this paper, we prove that in a connected graph
$G$ of order $n$, $\beta(G)\leq n-\gamma(G)$, where $\gamma(G)$ is the
domination number of $G$, and the equality holds if and only if $G$ is a
complete graph or a complete bipartite graph $K_{s,t}$, $ s,t\geq 2$. Then, we
obtain new bounds for $\beta(G)$ in terms of minimum and maximum degree of $G$.
