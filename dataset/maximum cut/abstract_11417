Winged, or X-shaped, radio sources form a small class of morphologically
peculiar extragalactic sources. We present multi-frequency radio observations
of two such sources. We derive maximum ages since any re-injection of fresh
particles of 34 and 17Myr for the wings of 3C223.1 and 3C403, respectively,
based on the lack of synchrotron and inverse Compton losses. On morphological
grounds we favour an explanation in terms of a fast realignment of the jet axis
which occurred within a few Myr. There is no evidence for merger activity, and
the host galaxies are found to reside in no more than poor cluster
environments. A number of puzzling questions remain about those sources: in
particular, although the black hole could realign on sufficiently short
timescales, the origin of the realignment is unknown.
