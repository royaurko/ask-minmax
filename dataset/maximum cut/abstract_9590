The Neyman and Scott (1948) model is widely used to demonstrate a serious
weakness of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method: it can give rise to
inconsistent estimators. The primary objective of this paper is to revisit this
example with a view to demonstrate that the culprit for the inconsistent
estimation is not the ML method but an ill-defined statistical model. It is
also shown that a simple recasting of this model renders it well-defined and
the ML method gives rise to consistent and asymptotically efficient estimators.
