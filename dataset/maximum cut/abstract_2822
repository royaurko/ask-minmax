We study the polynomial representation of the rational Cherednik algebra of
type $A_{n-1}$ with generic parameter in characteristic $p$ for $p \mid n$. We
give explicit formulas for generators for the maximal proper graded submodule,
show that they cut out a complete intersection, and thus compute the Hilbert
series of the irreducible quotient. Our methods are motivated by taking
characteristic $p$ analogues of existing characteristic $0$ results.
