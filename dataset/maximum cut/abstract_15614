Let $q_{\min}(G)$ stand for the smallest eigenvalue of the signless Laplacian
of a graph $G$ of order $n.$ This paper gives some results on the following
extremal problem:
  How large can $q_\min\left( G\right) $ be if $G$ is a graph of order $n,$
with no complete subgraph of order $r+1?$
  It is shown that this problem is related to the well-known topic of making
graphs bipartite. Using known classical results, several bounds on $q_{\min}$
are obtained, thus extending previous work of Brandt for regular graphs.
  In addition, using graph blowups, a general asymptotic result about the
maximum $q_{\min}$ is established. As a supporting tool, the spectra of the
Laplacian and the signless Laplacian of blowups of graphs are calculated.
