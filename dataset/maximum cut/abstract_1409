Given a continuous viscosity solution of a Dirichlet-type Hamilton-Jacobi
equation, we show that the distance function to the conjugate locus which is
associated to this problem is locally semiconcave on its domain. It allows us
to provide a simple proof of the fact that the distance function to the cut
locus associated to this problem is locally Lipschitz on its domain. This
result, which was already an improvement of a previous one by Itoh and Tanaka,
is due to Li and Nirenberg. Finally, we give applications of our results in
Riemannian geometry. Namely, we show that the distance function to the
conjugate locus on a Riemannian manifold is locally semiconcave. Then, we show
that if a Riemannian manifold is a deformation of the round sphere, then all
its tangent nonfocal domains are strictly uniformly convex.
