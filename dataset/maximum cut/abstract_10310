The product of the branching ratios of the standard model (SM) Higgs boson in
all decay channels available below the top-antitop threshold is observed to be
a Gaussian distribution of the Higgs boson mass with a maximum centered at
m_H~125 GeV, i.e. exactly at the mass value where a new boson has been
discovered at the Large Hadron Collider. Such an intriguing observation is
seemingly driven by the different m_H-power dependence of the Higgs
decay-widths into gauge bosons and fermions with steep anti-correlated
evolutions in the transition region m_H~(m_W,2m_W) below the WW decay
threshold. No other SM Higgs mass value has a better combined signal-strength
for the whole set of decay channels. Speculative consequences of taking this
feature as indicative of an underlying physical principle, that would force the
Higgs mass to be that which maximizes its decay probabilities to all the SM
particles simultaneously, are also discussed as a means to provide possible
constraints for theoretical extensions of the SM.
