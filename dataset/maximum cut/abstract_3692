Zipf's law, and power laws in general, have attracted and continue to attract
considerable attention in a wide variety of disciplines - from astronomy to
demographics to software structure to economics to linguistics to zoology, and
even warfare. A recent model of random group formation [RGF] attempts a general
explanation of such phenomena based on Jaynes' notion of maximum entropy
applied to a particular choice of cost function. In the present article I argue
that the cost function used in the RGF model is in fact unnecessarily
complicated, and that power laws can be obtained in a much simpler way by
applying maximum entropy ideas directly to the Shannon entropy subject only to
a single constraint: that the average of the logarithm of the observable
quantity is specified.
