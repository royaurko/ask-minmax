Upper bounds on the maximum number of minimal codewords in a binary code
follow from the theory of matroids. Random coding provide lower bounds. In this
paper we compare these bounds with analogous bounds for the cycle code of
graphs. This problem (in the graphic case) was considered in 1981 by Entringer
and Slater who asked if a connected graph with $p$ vertices and $q$ edges can
have only slightly more that $2^{q-p}$ cycles. The bounds in this note answer
this in the affirmative for all graphs except possibly some that have fewer
than $2p+3\log_2(3p)$ edges. We also conclude that an Eulerian (even) graph has
at most $2^{q-p}$ cycles unless the graph is a subdivision of a 4-regular graph
that is the edge-disjoint union of two Hamiltonian cycles, in which case it may
have as many as $2^{q-p}+p$ cycles.
