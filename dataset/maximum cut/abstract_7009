In this paper we present a theoretical performance analysis of the maximum
ratio combining (MRC) rule for channel-aware decision fusion over
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels for (conditionally) dependent
and independent local decisions. The system probabilities of false alarm and
detection conditioned on the channel realization are derived in closed form and
an approximated threshold choice is given. Furthermore, the channel-averaged
(CA) performances are evaluated in terms of the CA system probabilities of
false alarm and detection and the area under the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) through the closed form of the conditional moment
generating function (MGF) of the MRC statistic, along with Gauss-Chebyshev (GC)
quadrature rules. Furthermore, we derive the deflection coefficients in closed
form, which are used for sensor threshold design. Finally, all the results are
confirmed through Monte Carlo simulations.
