The assumption of angular ordering in gluon radiation is essential to obtain
quantitative results concerning gluonic behaviors. In order to prove the
validity of this assumption, we have applied our momentum space flux-tube
formalism to check out the angular dependences of gluon radiation. We have
calculated the probability amplitudes to get new gluon, and have found that the
new gluon is generally expected to have the maximum amplitude when it is
produced between the momentum directions of the last two partons.
