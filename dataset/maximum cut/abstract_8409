We investigate the Kramers-Wannier approximation for the three-dimensional
(3D) Ising model. The variational state is represented by an effective 2D Ising
model, which contains two variational parameters. We numerically calculate the
variational partition function using the corner transfer matrix renormalization
group (CTMRG) method, and find its maximum with respect to the variational
parameters. The calculated transition point $K_{\rm c} = 0.2184$ is only 1.5%
less than the true $K_{\rm c}$; the result is better than that obtained by the
corner transfer tensor renormalization group (CTTRG) approach. The calculated
phase transition is mean-field like.
