It is well-recognized that the presence of magnetic fields will lead to
anisotropic energy cascade and dissipation of astrophysical turbulence. With
the diffusion approximation and linear dissipation rates, we study the cascade
and damping of Alfv\'en-cyclotron fluctuations in solar plasmas numerically.
For an isotropic case the steady-state turbulence spectra are nearly isotropic
in the inertial range and can be fitted by a single power-law function with a
spectral index of -3/2, similar to the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan phenomenology.
Beyond the MHD regime the kinetic effects make the spectrum softer at higher
wavenumbers. In the dissipation range the turbulence spectrum cuts off at the
wavenumber, where the damping rate becomes comparable to the cascade rate, and
the cutoff wavenumber changes with the wave propagation direction. The angle
averaged turbulence spectrum of the isotropic model resembles a broken
power-law. Taking into account the Doppler effects, the model naturally
reproduces the broken power-law turbulence spectra observed in the solar wind
and predicts that a higher break frequency always comes along with a softer
dissipation range spectrum that may be caused by the increase of the turbulence
intensity, the reciprocal of the plasma \beta, and/or the angle between the
solar wind velocity and the mean magnetic field. These predictions can be
tested by detailed comparisons with more accurate observations.
