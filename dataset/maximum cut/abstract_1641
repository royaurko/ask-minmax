We make analytic derivation for maximum masses of stable boson stars formed
by scalar fields with any higher order self-interactions and show that those
are equivalent to numerical results. It is shown that the contribution of the
higher order self-interaction terms to the maximum mass decreases as
$(m/M_p)^2$ power.
