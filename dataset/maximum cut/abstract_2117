We present a preliminary study of a chiral-gauge-invariant Wilson term for
the Standard Model on a lattice. In the strong coupling limit for doublers,
this Wilson term shows that the doublers of leptons (quarks) are anti-baryons
(anti-leptoquarks), and they are decoupled by getting gauge invariant masses.
We discuss that the possibility of achieving the low-energy Standard Model
could be realized by the ``three-fermion-cuts'' at the weak coupling limit for
normal modes, where baryons and leptoquarks dissolve into their constituents.
