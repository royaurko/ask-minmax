It is shown that the accelerated expansion of the universe in the framework
of the relativistic theory of gravitation can be achieved by the introduction
of the quintessential term in the energy-momentum tensor. The value of the
minimum scaling factor and the modern observational data for the density and
state parameters of the matter give the rough estimations for the maximum
graviton mass and the maximum scaling factor. The former can be very low in the
case of the primordial inflation and the latter can be extremely large for the
scalar field model of the quintessence. In any case, the massive graviton stops
the second inflation and provide the closed cosmological scenario in the
agreement with the causality principle inherent to the theory.
