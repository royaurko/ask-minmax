By means of the molecular dynamics simulation on gradual cooling processes,
we investigate magnetic properties of classical spin systems only with the
magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, which we call dipolar systems. Focusing on
their finite-size effect, particularly their boundary geometry dependence, we
study two finite dipolar squares cut out from a square lattice with $\Phi=0$
and $\pi/4$, where $\Phi$ is an angle between the direction of the lattice axis
and that of the square boundary. Distinctly different results are obtained in
the two dipolar squares. In the $\Phi=0$ square, the ``from-edge-to-interior
freezing'' of spins is observed. Its ground state has a multi-domain structure
whose domains consist of the two among infinitely (continuously) degenerated
Luttinger-Tisza (LT) ground-state orders on a bulk square lattice, i.e., the
two antiferromagnetically aligned ferromagnetic chains (af-FMC) orders directed
in parallel to the two lattice axes. In the $\Phi=\pi/4$ square, on the other
hand, the freezing starts from the interior of the square, and its ground state
is nearly in a single domain with one of the two af-FMC orders. These geometry
effects are argued to originate from the anisotropic nature of the
dipole-dipole interaction which depends on the relative direction of sites in a
real space of the interacting spins.
