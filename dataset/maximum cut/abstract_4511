Radiatively induced SU(2) symmetry breaking is shown to be a genuine feature
of SU(2) x O(N) globally symmetric renormalisable field theories in the large N
limit, describing interaction of a complex SU(2) doublet, O(N)-singlet field
with an SU(2) singlet, O(N) vector. Symmetry breaking solutions are found even
when all fields have positive renormalised squared mass. The emerging novel
mechanism of symmetry breaking can reproduce with a choice of N~300 the
standard range of the electroweak condensate and the Higgs mass occurring in
the extended Higgs dynamics of an SU(2) symmetric Gauge+Higgs model.
