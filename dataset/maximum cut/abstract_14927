In this work, a new fast-decodable space-time block code (STBC) is proposed.
The code is full-rate and full-diversity for 4x2 multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) transmission. Due to the unique structure of the codeword, the proposed
code requires a much lower computational complexity to provide
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding performance. It is shown that the ML decoding
complexity is only O(M^{4.5}) when M-ary square QAM constellation is used.
Finally, the proposed code has highest minimum determinant among the
fast-decodable STBCs known in the literature. Simulation results prove that the
proposed code provides the best bit error rate (BER) performance among the
state-of-the-art STBCs.
