The 1D and 2D Bose-condensation of trapped atoms in a gravitational field are
considered. The deformation of the finite parabolic potential in this field is
modeling via the combination of two rectangular 1D and 2D traps, for which the
cut-off and the re-definition of spectrum are taken into account. A
Bose-condensation T_c shift by the gravity is calculated. A sign and a
magnitude of it in a deformed trap depends on the order of including the
gravitational field. The special choice of this order may describe three
consistent Bose-condensations with different temperatures. These transitions
may be associated with a transportation of a trap on the cycle (I) Earth-(II)
Space-(III) Earth.
