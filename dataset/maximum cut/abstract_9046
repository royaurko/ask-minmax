We present analytic methods for extracting a class of bulk geometries given
information of certain physical quantities in the boundary CFT. More
specifically we look at singular correlators and entanglement entropy in the
CFT to provide information of null and spacelike geodesics repectively in the
bulk. We show that static spherically symmetric, asymptotically AdS spacetimes
which do not admit null circular orbits can be fully recovered, and that any
spacetime can be recovered up to the local maximum of the potential. We provide
analytical and numerical examples to verify the methods used.
