The dynamical evolution of small systems undergoing a chiral symmetry
breaking transition in the course of rapid expansion is discussed. The time
evolution of the dynamical correlation length for trajectories passing through
a second-order critical point is extracted. It is shown that while the maximum
value of the correlation length is bound from above by dynamical effects, the
time interval during which it is near its maximum grows steadily with the
system size and with decreasing expansion rate.
