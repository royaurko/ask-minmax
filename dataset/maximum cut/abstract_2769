We derive a formula for the index of a Dirac operator on an incomplete edge
space satisfying a "geometric Witt condition." We accomplish this by cutting
off to a smooth manifold with boundary, applying the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index
theorem, and taking a limit. We deduce corollaries related to the existence of
positive scalar curvature metrics on incomplete edge spaces.
