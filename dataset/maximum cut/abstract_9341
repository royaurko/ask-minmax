Using the classical estimation method of moments, we propose a new
semiparametric estimation procedure for multi-parameter copula models.
Consistency and asymptotic normality of the obtained estimators are
established. By considering an Archimedean copula model, an extensive
simulation study, comparing these estimators with the pseudo maximum
likelihood, rho-inversion and tau-inversion ones, is carried out. We show that,
with regards to the other methods, the moment based estimation is quick and
simple to use with reasonable bias and root mean squared error.
