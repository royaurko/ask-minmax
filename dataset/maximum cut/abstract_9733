We consider a series of configurations defined by fibers of a given base
configuration. We prove that Markov degree of the configurations is bounded
from above by the Markov complexity of the base configuration. As important
examples of base configurations we consider incidence matrices of graphs and
study the maximum Markov degree of configurations defined by fibers of the
incidence matrices. In particular we give a proof that the Markov degree for
two-way transportation polytopes is three.
