The general perturbative expression for the lateral Casimir force between two
plates covered by longitudinal corrugations of arbitrary shape is obtained.
This expression is applicable for corrugation periods larger than the
separation distance. The cases of asymmetric corrugations are considered, which
allow to increase the maximum to minimum force ratio and affect the character
of equilibrium points. This opens new opportunities to control the lateral
Casimir forces for use in microelectromechanical devices based entirely on the
vacuum fluctuation properties.
