The commuting graph of a finite non-commutative semigroup $S$, denoted
$\cg(S)$, is a simple graph whose vertices are the non-central elements of $S$
and two distinct vertices $x,y$ are adjacent if $xy=yx$. Let $\mi(X)$ be the
symmetric inverse semigroup of partial injective transformations on a finite
set $X$. The semigroup $\mi(X)$ has the symmetric group $\sym(X)$ of
permutations on $X$ as its group of units. In 1989, Burns and Goldsmith
determined the clique number of the commuting graph of $\sym(X)$. In 2008,
Iranmanesh and Jafarzadeh found an upper bound of the diameter of
$\cg(\sym(X))$, and in 2011, Dol\u{z}an and Oblak claimed (but their proof has
a GAP) that this upper bound is in fact the exact value.
  The goal of this paper is to begin the study of the commuting graph of the
symmetric inverse semigroup $\mi(X)$. We calculate the clique number of
$\cg(\mi(X))$, the diameters of the commuting graphs of the proper ideals of
$\mi(X)$, and the diameter of $\cg(\mi(X))$ when $|X|$ is even or a power of an
odd prime. We show that when $|X|$ is odd and divisible by at least two primes,
then the diameter of $\cg(\mi(X))$ is either 4 or 5. In the process, we obtain
several results about semigroups, such as a description of all commutative
subsemigroups of $\mi(X)$ of maximum order, and analogous results for
commutative inverse and commutative nilpotent subsemigroups of $\mi(X)$. The
paper closes with a number of problems for experts in combinatorics and in
group or semigroup theory.
