We present a unified picture of outflowing gas from the X-ray binary system
Hercules X-1/HZ Herculis. We suggest that the outflowing gas (a wind) causes UV
emission seen in mid-eclipse, narrow UV absorption lines, and broad UV P Cygni
lines. Observations with the FOS and STIS spectrographs on the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) show UV emission lines in the middle of X-ray eclipse, when the
X-ray heated atmosphere of the normal star and accretion disk should be
entirely hidden from view. Narrow absorption lines (FWHM~50 km/s) blueshifted
by 500 km/s during observations in 1998 and by 400 km/s during observations in
1999 were seen from phi=0.0-0.3. The line velocity was constant to within 20
km/s. The P Cygni profiles from Hercules~X-1 have optical depths tau<1 with a
maximum expansion velocity of 600 km/s, and are seen in the resonance lines N V
1238.8,1242.8, Si IV 1393.7,1402.8, and C IV 1548.2, 1550.8. We discuss whether
this wind originates in the accretion disk or on the companion star, and how
the relevant ions can survive X-ray ionization by the neutron star.
