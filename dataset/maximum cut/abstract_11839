We present a theoretical study of electrorotation (ER) of two spherical
particles under the action of a rotating electric field. When the two particles
approach and finally touch, the mutual polarization interaction between the
particles leads to a change in the dipole moment of the individual particle and
hence the ER spectrum, as compared to that of the well-separated particles. The
mutual polarization effects are captured by the method of multiple images. From
the theoretical analysis, we find that the mutual polarization effects can
change the characteristic frequency at which the maximum angular velocity of
electrorotation occurs. The numerical results can be understood in the spectral
representation theory.
