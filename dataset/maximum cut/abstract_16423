We study the scattering of massless scalar waves by a Kerr black hole by
letting plane monochromatic waves impinge on the black hole. We calculate the
relevant scattering phase-shifts using the
 Pruefer phase-function method, which is computationally efficient and reliable
also for high frequencies and/or large values of the angular multipole indices
(l,m). We use the obtained phase-shifts and the partial-wave approach to
determine differential cross sections and deflection functions. Results for
off-axis scattering (waves incident along directions misaligned with the black
hole's rotation axis) are obtained for the first time. Inspection of the
off-axis deflection functions reveals the same scattering phenomena as in
Schwarzschild scattering. In particular, the cross sections are dominated by
the glory effect and the forward (Coulomb) divergence due to the long-range
nature of the gravitational field. In the rotating case the overall diffraction
pattern is ``frame-dragged'' and as a result the glory maximum is not observed
in the exact backward direction. We discuss the physical reason for this
behaviour, and explain it in terms of the distinction between prograde and
retrograde motion in the Kerr gravitational field. Finally, we also discuss the
possible influence of the so-called superradiance effect on the scattered
waves.
