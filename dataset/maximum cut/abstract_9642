We show that the hot spots conjecture of J. Rauch holds for acute triangles
if one of the angles is not larger than $\pi/6$. More precisely, we show that
the second Neumann eigenfunction on those acute triangles has no maximum or
minimum inside the domain. We first simplify the problem by showing that
absence of critical points on two sides implies no critical points inside a
triangle. This result applies to any acute triangle and might help prove the
conjecture for arbitrary acute triangles. Then we show that there are no
critical points on two sides assuming one small angle. We also establish
simplicity for the second Neumann eigenvalue for all non-equilateral triangles.
