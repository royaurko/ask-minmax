During the last decade ground-based very high-energy gamma-ray astronomy
achieved a remarkable advancement in the development of the observational
technique for the registration and study of gamma-ray emission above 100 GeV.
It is widely believed that the next step in its future development will be the
construction of telescopes of substantially larger size than the currently used
10 m class telescopes. This can drastically improve the sensitivity of the
ground-based detectors for gamma rays of energy from 10 to 100 GeV. Based on
Monte Carlo simulations of the response of a single stand-alone 30 m imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (IACT) the maximal rejection power against
background cosmic ray showers for low energy gamma-rays was investigated in
great detail. An advanced Bayesian multivariate analysis has been applied to
the simulated Cherenkov light images of the gamma-ray- and proton-induced air
showers. The results obtained here quantitatively testify that the separation
between the signal and background images degrades substantially at low
energies, and consequently the maximum overall quality factor can only be about
3.1 for gamma rays in the 10-30 GeV energy range. Various selection criteria as
well as optimal combinations of the standard image parameters utilized for
effective image separation have been also evaluated.
