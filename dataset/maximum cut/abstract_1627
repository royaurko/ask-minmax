A pizza is a pair of planar convex bodies $A\subseteq B$,where $B$ represents
the dough and $A$ the topping of the pizza. A partition of a pizza by straight
lines is a succession of double operations:a cut by a full straight line,
followed by a Euclidean move of one of theresulting pieces; then the procedure
is repeated.The final partition is said to be fair if each resulting slice has
the same amount of $A$ and the same amount of $B$.This note proves that, given
an integer $n\geq2$, there exists a fair partition by straight lines of any
pizza $(A,B)$ into $n$ parts if and onlyif $n$ is even.The proof uses the
following result:For any planar convex bodies $A, B$ with $A\subseteq B$, and
any$\alpha\in\,]0,\frac12[\,$, there exists an $\alpha$-section of $A$ which is
a$\beta$-section of $B$ for some $\beta\geq\alpha$. (An $\alpha$-section of $A$
is a straight line cutting $A$ into two parts, one of which has area
$\alpha|A|$.)The question remains open if the word "planar" is dropped.
