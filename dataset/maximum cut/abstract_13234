Some principles in the distribution of Centaurs and the "Scattered Disk"
objects, as well as the Kuiper belt objects for its semi-major axes,
eccentricities and inclinations of the orbits have been investigated. It has
been established, that more than a half from them move on the resonant orbits
and that is what has been predicted earlier. The divergence of the maximum in
the observable distribution of the objects of the Kuiper belt for the
semi-major axes with an exact orbital resonance has been interpreted.
