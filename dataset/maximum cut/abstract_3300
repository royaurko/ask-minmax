Let $m$, $n$, and $k$ be integers satisfying $0 < k \leq n < 2k \leq m$. A
family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ is called an $(m,n,k)$-intersecting family if
$\binom{[n]}{k} \subseteq \mathcal{F} \subseteq \binom{[m]}{k}$ and any pair of
members of $\mathcal{F}$ have nonempty intersection. Maximum $(m,k,k)$- and
$(m,k+1,k)$-intersecting families are determined by the theorems of
Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado and Hilton-Milner, respectively. We determine the maximum
families for the cases $n = 2k-1, 2k-2, 2k-3$, and $m$ sufficiently large.
