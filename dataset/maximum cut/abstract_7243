The very recent paper Anastasiou and Reinert (2015) has derived explicit
bounds for the bounded Wasserstein distance between the exact, unknown
distribution of maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) and the asymptotic normal
distribution. In the present paper, we propose a novel approach to this
fundamental issue by combining the Delta method, Stein's method, Taylor
expansions and conditional expectations, for the situations where the MLE can
be expressed as a function of a sum of independent and identically distributed
terms. This encompasses in particular the broad exponential family of
distributions. We will show that, in all these cases, our bounds improve on (or
are at least as good as) the Anastasiou-Reinert bounds in terms of sharpness
and simplicity.
