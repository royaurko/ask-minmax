We report a measurement of the inclusive electron energy spectrum for
semileptonic decays of B mesons in a data sample of 52 million Y4S -> BBar
decays collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy
B-meson factory at SLAC. We determine the branching fraction, first, second,
and third moments of the spectrum for lower cut-offs on the electron energy
between 0.6 and 1.5 GeV. We measure the partial branching fraction to be Br(B
-> X e nu, E_e>0.6 GeV) = (10.36 +-0.06(stat.) +-0.23(sys))%.
