We estimate the fidelity of solar neighborhood (D < 100 pc) catalogs soon to
be derived from Pan-STARRS astrometric data. We explore two quantities used to
measure catalog quality: completeness, the fraction of desired sources included
in a catalog; and reliability, the fraction of entries corresponding to desired
sources. We show that the main challenge in identifying nearby objects with
Pan-STARRS will be reliably distinguishing these objects from distant stars,
which are vastly more numerous. We explore how joint cuts on proper motion and
parallax will impact catalog reliability and completeness. Using synthesized
astrometry catalogs, we derive optimum parallax and proper motion cuts to build
a census of the solar neighborhood with the Pan-STARRS 3 Pi Survey. Depending
on the Galactic latitude, a parallax cut pi / sigma pi > 5 combined with a
proper motion cut ranging from mu / sigma mu > 1-8 achieves 99% reliability and
60% completeness.
