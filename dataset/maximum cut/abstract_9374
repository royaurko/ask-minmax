Starting from the two-point covariance function derived in [1], we have
developed a toy model to investigate the effect of gluonic fluctuations on the
transverse energy profile predicted by MC-KLN Color-Glass Condensate initial
conditions. We find that the effect of these fluctuations on the eccentricity
harmonics varies strongly with the correlation length and consequently the
value of the fixed saturation momentum Qs used in [1]. Using approximate values
for the minimum and maximum saturation momenta probed at RHIC in Au-Au
collisions, we estimate the increase in the eccentricity coefficients resulting
from gluonic fluctuations is as large as 10 to 20 percent in central
collisions.
