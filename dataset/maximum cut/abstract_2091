By a suitable transformation, we derive the rotating Goedel universe from a
static one and we show, how rotation may be implemented geometrically. The
rotation law turns out to be a differential one. By increasing distance from
the rotation axis the velocity of a rotating point will exceed the velocity of
light and the cosmos has a cut-off radius. Thus, closed time-like curves do not
occur in the Goedel universe.
