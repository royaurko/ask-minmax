We find the series of example theories for which the relativistic limit of
maximum tension $F_{max} = c^4/4G$ represented by the entropic force can be
abolished. Among them the varying constants theories, some generalized entropy
models applied both for cosmological and black hole horizons as well as some
generalized uncertainty principle models.
