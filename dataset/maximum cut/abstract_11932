We look at chaotic systems evolving in fractal phase space. The entropy
change in time due to the fractal geometry is assimilated to the information
growth through the scale refinement. Due to the incompleteness, at any scale,
of the information calculation in fractal support, the incomplete normalization
$\sum_ip_i^q=1$ is applied throughout the paper. It is shown that the
information growth is nonadditive and is proportional to the trace-form
$\sum_ip_i-\sum_ip_i^q$ so that it can be connected to several nonadditive
entropies. This information growth can be extremized to give, for
non-equilibrium systems, power law distributions of evolving stationary state
which may be called ``maximum entropic evolution''.
