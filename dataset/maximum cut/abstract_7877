We investigate the scope of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in probing the
parameter space of a 4-Site (4S) model supplemented by one composite Higgs
state. We concentrate on the yield of `mixed' di-boson production giving three
leptons and missing (transverse) energy in the final state, i.e., events
induced via the sub-process $q\bar q' -> l^+\nu_l l^{'+}l^{'-}$ +
${\rm{c.c.}}$, where $q,q'$ are quarks and $l,l'=e,\mu$ in all possible
combinations, signature which enables the production in the intermediate steps
of all additional -- with respect to the Standard Model (SM) -- neutral and
charged gauge bosons belonging to the spectrum of this scenario, all of which
in resonant topologies. We not only find this channel to be accessible over the
background but also show that, after a dedicated cut-based analysis,
kinematical reconstruction of all such resonances is always possible. We
finally compare the yield of the mixed di-boson mode to that of the `charged'
di-boson one and find that the former is of lesser scope than the latter at
smaller gauge boson masses but it overcomes it at higher values, thereby
revealing itself a viable search mode covering new regions of parameter space.
