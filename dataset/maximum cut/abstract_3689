Studies of quarkonium spectral functions at finite temperature, based on an
approach combining QCD sum rules and the maximum entropy method are briefly
reviewed. QCD sum rules for heavy quarkonia incorporate finite temperature
effects in form of changing values of gluonic condensates that appear in the
operator product expansion. These changes depend on the energy density and
pressure at finite temperature, which we extract from quenched lattice QCD
calculations. The maximum entropy method then allows us to obtain the most
probable spectral function from the sum rules, without having to introduce any
specific assumption about its functional form. Our findings suggest that the
charmonium ground states of both S-wave and P-wave channels dissolve into the
continuum already at temperatures around or slightly above the critical
temperature T_c, while the bottomonium states are less influenced by
temperature effects, surviving up to about 2.5 T_c or higher for S-wave and up
to about 2.0 T_c for P-wave states.
