We show that the two sets of self-dual Yang-Mills equations in 8-dimensions
proposed in (E.Corrigan, C.Devchand, D.B.Fairlie and J.Nuyts, {\it Nuclear
Physics} {\bf B214}, 452-464, (1983)) form respectively elliptic and
overdetermined elliptic systems under the Coulomb gauge condition. In the
overdetermined case, the Yang-Mills fields can depend at most on $N$ arbitrary
constants, where $N$ is the dimension of the gauge group. We describe a
subvariety ${\cal P}_8 $ of the skew-symmetric $8\times 8$ matrices by an
eigenvalue criterion and we show that the solutions of the elliptic equations
of Corrigan et al. are among the maximal linear submanifolds of ${\cal P}_8$.
We propose an eight order action for which the elliptic set is a maximum.
