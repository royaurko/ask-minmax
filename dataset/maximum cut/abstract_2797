The present work deals with a detailed study of interacting holographic dark
energy model for three common choices of the interaction term. Also, two
standard choices of IR cut-off, namely, Ricci length scale and radius of the
event horizon are considered here. Finally, the cosmographic parameters are
presented both analytically and graphically.
