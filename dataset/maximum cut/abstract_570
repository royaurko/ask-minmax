We present preliminary results for the correlation- and spectral functions of
different meson channels on the lattice. The main focus lies on gaining control
over cut-off as well as on the finite-volume effects. Extrapolations of
screening masses above the deconfining temperature are guided by the result of
the free ($T=\infty$) case on the lattice and in the continuum. We study the
quenched non-perturbatively improved Wilson-clover fermion as well as the
hypercube fermion action which might show less cut-off effects.
