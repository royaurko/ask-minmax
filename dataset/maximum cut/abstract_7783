We investigate the approach to the universal regime of the dilute unitary
Fermi gas as the density is reduced to zero in a lattice model. To this end we
study the chemical potential, superfluid order parameter and internal energy of
the attractive Hubbard model in three different lattices with densities of
states (DOS) which share the same low-energy behavior of fermions in
three-dimensional free space: a cubic lattice, a "Bethe lattice" with a
semicircular DOS, and a "lattice gas" with parabolic dispersion and a sharp
energy cut-off that ensures the normalization of the DOS. The model is solved
using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, that treats directly the thermodynamic limit
and arbitrarily low densities, eliminating finite-size effects. At densities of
the order of one fermion per site the lattice and its specific form dominate
the results. The evolution to the low-density limit is smooth and it does not
allow to define an unambiguous low-density regime. Such finite-density effects
are significantly reduced using the lattice gas, and they are maximal for the
three-dimensional cubic lattice. Even though dynamical mean-field theory is
bound to reduce to the more standard static mean field in the limit of zero
density due to the local nature of the self-energy and of the vertex functions,
it compares well with accurate Monte Carlo simulations down to the lowest
densities accessible to the latter.
