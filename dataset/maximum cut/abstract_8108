Large-scale analyses of stellar samples comprised of cool, solar-like
oscillators now commonly utilize the so-called asteroseismic scaling relations
to estimate fundamental stellar properties. In this paper we present a test of
the scaling relation for the global asteroseismic parameter $\nu_{\rm max}$,
the frequency at which a solar-like oscillator presents its strongest observed
pulsation amplitude. The classic relation assumes that this characteristic
frequency scales with a particular combination of surface gravity and effective
temperature that also describes the dependence of the cut-off frequency for
acoustic waves in an isothermal atmosphere, i.e., $\nu_{\rm max} \propto
gT_{\rm eff}^{-1/2}$. We test how well the oscillations of cool main-sequence
and sub-giant stars adhere to this relation, using a sample of asteroseismic
targets observed by the NASA \emph{Kepler} Mission. Our results, which come
from a grid-based analysis, rule out departures from the classic $gT_{\rm
eff}^{-1/2}$ scaling dependence at the level of $\simeq 1.5\,\rm per cent$ over
the full $\simeq 1560\,\rm K$ range in $T_{\rm eff}$ that we tested. There is
some uncertainty over the absolute calibration of the scaling. However, any
variation with $T_{\rm eff}$ is evidently small, with limits similar to those
above.
