We report on an experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen,
Switzerland measuring x rays from muon transfer from deuterium to helium. Both
the ground state transfer via the exotic dmu3,4He* molecules and the excited
state transfer from mud* were measured. The use of CCD detectors allowed x rays
from 1.5 keV to 11 keV to be detected with sufficient energy resolution to
separate the transitions to different final states in both deuterium and
helium. The x-ray peaks of the dmu3He* and dmu4He* molecules were measured with
good statistics. For the D2+3He mixture, the peak has its maximum at E_dmu3He =
6768 +- 12 eV with FWHM Gamma_dmu3He = 863 +- 10 eV. Furthermore the radiative
branching ratio was found to be kappa_dmu3He = 0.301 +- 0.061. For the D_2+4He
mixture, the maximum of the peak lies at E_dmu4He = 6831 +- 8 eV and the FWHM
is Gamma_dmu4He = 856 +- 10 eV. The radiative branching ratio is kappa_dmu4He =
0.636 +- 0.097. The excited state transfer is limited by the probability to
reach the deuterium ground state, q_1s. This coefficient was determined for
both mixtures: q^3He_1s = 68.9 +- 2.7% and q^4He_1s = 90.1 +- 1.5.
