A class of squeezed boson and fermion states is studied with particular
emphasis on the nature of entanglement. We first investigate the case of
bosons, considering two-mode squeezed states. Then we construct the fermion
version to show that such states are maximum entangled, for both bosons and
fermions. To achieve these results, we demonstrate some relations involving
squeezed boson states. The generalization to the case of fermions is made by
using Grassmann variables.
