Wireless communication is the fastest growing area of the communication
industry. To keep swiftness with the indefinite increase in customers' demands
and expectations, and the market competition among companies for the services
offered,there is need for higher data rate along with reliable communication at
low cost so that the applications can reach all. Until now, many technical
challenges remain in designing robust and fast wireless systems that deliver
the performance necessary to support emerging applications, due to the fact
that wireless channels are frequency selective, power-limited, susceptible to
noise and interference. Demand for high data rate and increasing applications
offered by a wireless device calls for an effective method. Due to limit on the
available bandwidth, there is a need for exploiting the available bandwidth in
a way so that we get maximum advantage. Multiple-Input Multiple-Output system
does exactly this thing by multiplying the data rate without any expansion in
the bandwidth. This system utilizes the spatial diversity property of the multi
channel system. The reliable transmission requires symbols to be effectively
recovered at the receiving end. V-BLAST detection technique is employed for
this purpose. This paper depicted the advantages of using multiple antennas by
exploiting signal diversity offered by multipath effect and the system offers
high spectral efficiency.
