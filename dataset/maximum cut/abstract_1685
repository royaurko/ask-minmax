Finding the maximum clique is a known NP-Complete problem and it is also hard
to approximate. This work proposes two efficient algorithms to obtain it.
Nevertheless, the first one is able to fins the maximum for some special cases,
while the second one has its execution time bounded by the number of cliques
that each vertex belongs to.
