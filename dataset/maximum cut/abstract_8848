An adaptive kernel method in the Bayesian framework together with a new
simulation program for Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) have been
applied to the analysis of RBS data. Even in the case of strongly overlapping
RBS peaks a depth profile reconstruction without noise fitting has been
achieved. The adaptive kernel method leads to the simplest depth profile
consistent with the data. Erosion and redeposition rates of carbon divertor
plates in the fusion experiment ASDEX Upgrade could be determined by
RBS-analysis of thin film probes before and after exposition to plasma
discharges.
