Any cutting-edge scientific research project requires a myriad of
computational tools for data generation, management, analysis and
visualization. Python is a flexible and extensible scientific programming
platform that offered the perfect solution in our recent comparative genomics
investigation (J. B. Lucks, D. R. Nelson, G. Kudla, J. B. Plotkin. Genome
landscapes and bacteriophage codon usage, PLoS Computational Biology, 4,
1000001, 2008). In this paper, we discuss the challenges of this project, and
how the combined power of Biopython, Matplotlib and SWIG were utilized for the
required computational tasks. We finish by discussing how python goes beyond
being a convenient programming language, and promotes good scientific practice
by enabling clean code, integration with professional programming techniques
such as unit testing, and strong data provenance.
