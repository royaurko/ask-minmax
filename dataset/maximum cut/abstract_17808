Warped extra-dimension models in which the Higgs boson is allowed to
propagate in the bulk of a compact AdS$_5$ space are conjectured to be dual to
models featuring a partially composite Higgs boson. They offer a framework with
which to investigate the implications of changing the scaling dimension of the
Higgs operator, which can be used to reduce the constraints from electroweak
precision data. In the context of such models, we calculate the cross section
for Higgs production in gluon fusion and the $H\to\gamma\gamma$ decay rate and
show that they are finite (at one-loop order) as a consequence of gauge
invariance. The extended scalar sector comprising the Kaluza-Klein excitations
of the Standard Model scalars is constructed in detail. The largest effects are
due to virtual KK fermions, whose contributions to the cross section and decay
rate introduce a quadratic sensitivity to the maximum allowed value $y_\ast$ of
the random complex entries of the 5D anarchic Yukawa matrices. We find an
enhancement of the gluon-fusion cross section and a reduction of the
$H\to\gamma\gamma$ rate as well as of the tree-level Higgs couplings to
fermions and electroweak gauge bosons. We perform a detailed study of the
correlated signal strengths for different production mechanisms and decay
channels as functions of $y_\ast$, the mass scale of Kaluza-Klein resonances
and the scaling dimension of the composite Higgs operator.
