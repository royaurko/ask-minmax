Measurements of the Xi- and anti-Xi+ masses, mass differences, lifetimes and
lifetime differences are presented. The anti-Xi+ sample used is much larger
than those used previously for such measurements. In addition, the Xi
production rates in Z -> b anti-b and Z -> q anti-q events are compared and the
position xi* of the maximum of the xi distribution in Z -> q anti-q events is
measured.
