We report a new interpretation of the millimeter-wave polarization of the
protoplanetary disk around HL Tau with self-polarization. We successfully
reproduce the observed polarization signature with self-scattered light of dust
grains. The detected polarization can be explained only if dust grains have a
maximum size of around 150 ${\rm \mu m}$. This is a strong constraint on grain
size in the early stage of a circumstellar disk. The obtained grain size
contradicts to previously expected grain size, which is millimeter. The
inferred grain size is too small to be trapped at gas pressure bumps, and
therefore it requires planet formation theory to explain the mechanism to stop
the grain growth or it might suggest the dust grains are no longer spherical
but highly porous.
