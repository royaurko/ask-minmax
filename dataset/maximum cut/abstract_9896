We consider utility maximisation problem for exponential Levy models and HARA
utilities in presence of illiquid asset. This illiquid asset is modelled by an
option of European type on another risky asset which is correlated with the
first one. Under some hypothesis on Levy processes, we give the expressions for
information processes figured in maximum utility formula. As applications, we
consider Black-Scholes models with correlated Brownian Motions, and also
Black-Scholes models with jump part represented by Poisson process.
