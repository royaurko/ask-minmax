We study the effects of holographic renormalisation on an AdS/QCD inspired
description of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. Our model is a 5D slice
of AdS_5 geometry containing a bulk scalar and SU(2) times SU(2) gauge fields.
The scalar field obtains a VEV which represents a condensate that triggers
electroweak symmetry breaking. Fermion fields are constrained to live on the UV
brane and do not propagate in the bulk. The two-point functions are
holographically renormalised through the addition of boundary counterterms.
Measurable quantities are then expressed in terms of well defined physical
parameters, free from any spurious dependence on the UV cut-off. A complete
study of the precision parameters is carried out and bounds on physical
quantities derived. The large-N scaling of results is discussed.
