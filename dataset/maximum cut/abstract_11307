We report the first detection of the gravitationally lensed quasar Q2237+0305
in X-rays. With a ROSAT/HRI exposure of 53 ksec taken in Nov./Dec. 1997, we
found a count rate of 0.006 counts per second for the combined four images.
This corresponds to an X-ray flux of $2.2\times10^{-13} erg/cm^2$/sec and an
X-ray luminosity of $4.2\times10^{45}$erg/sec (in the ROSAT energy window
0.1-2.4 keV). The ROSAT/HRI detector is not able to resolve spatially the four
quasar images (maximum separation 1.8 arcsec). The analysis is based on about
330 source photons. The signal is consistent with no variability, but with low
significance. This detection is promising in view of the upcoming X-ray
missions with higher spatial/spectral resolution and/or collecting power
(Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM and ASTRO-E).
