This paper is devoted to a rigorous analysis of exponential convergence of
polynomial interpolation and spectral differentiation based on the
Gegenbauer-Gauss and Gegenbauer-Gauss-Lobatto points, when the underlying
function is analytic on and within an ellipse. Sharp error estimates in the
maximum norm are derived.
