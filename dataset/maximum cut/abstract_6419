The thermal conductivity of isotopically enriched 28Si (enrichment better
than 99.9%) was redetermined independently in three laboratories by high
precision experiments on a total of 4 samples of different shape and degree of
isotope enrichment in the range from 5 to 300 K with particular emphasis on the
range near room temperature. The results obtained in the different laboratories
are in good agreement with each other. They indicate that at room temperature
the thermal conductivity of isotopically enriched 28Si exceeds the thermal
conductivity of Si with a natural, unmodified isotope mixture by 10&#61617;2 %.
This finding is in disagreement with an earlier report by Ruf et al. At
&#61566;26 K the thermal conductivity of 28Si reaches a maximum. The maximum
value depends on sample shape and the degree of isotope enrichment and exceeds
the thermal conductivity of natural Si by a factor of &#61566;8 for a 99.982%
28Si enriched sample. The thermal conductivity of Si with natural isotope
composition is consistently found to be &#61566;3% lower than the values
recommended in the literature.
