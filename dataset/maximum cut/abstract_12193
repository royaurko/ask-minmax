We study numerically the dynamics of a one-electron wave packet in a
two-dimensional random lattice with long-range correlated diagonal disorder in
the presence of a uniform electric field. The time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger
equation is used for this purpose. We find that the wave packet displays
Bloch-like oscillations associated with the appearance of a phase of
delocalized states in the strong correlation regime. The amplitude of
oscillations directly reflects the bandwidth of the phase and allows to measure
it. The oscillations reveal two main frequencies whose values are determined by
the structure of the underlying potential in the vicinity of the wave packet
maximum.
