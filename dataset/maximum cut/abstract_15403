We present a statistical model which is able to capture some interesting
features exhibited in the Brazilian test. The model is based on breakable
elements which break when the force experienced by the elements exceed their
own load capacity. In this model when an element breaks, the capacity of the
neighboring elements are decreased by a certain amount assuming weakening
effect around the defected zone. We numerically investigate the stress-strain
behavior, the strength of the system, how it scales with the system size and
also it's fluctuation for both uniformly and weibull distributed breaking
threshold of the elements in the system. We find that the strength of the
system approaches it's asymptotic value $\sigma_c=1/6$ and $\sigma_c=5/18$ for
uniformly and Weibull distributed breaking threshold of the elements
respectively. We have also shown the damage profile right at the point when the
stress-strain curve reaches at it's maximum and then it is compared with our
experimental observations.
