In this paper, we consider multi-sensor classification when there is a large
number of unlabeled samples. The problem is formulated under the multi-view
learning framework and a Consensus-based Multi-View Maximum Entropy
Discrimination (CMV-MED) algorithm is proposed. By iteratively maximizing the
stochastic agreement between multiple classifiers on the unlabeled dataset, the
algorithm simultaneously learns multiple high accuracy classifiers. We
demonstrate that our proposed method can yield improved performance over
previous multi-view learning approaches by comparing performance on three real
multi-sensor data sets.
