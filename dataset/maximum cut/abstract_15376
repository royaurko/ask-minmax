In many practical parameter estimation problems, prescreening and parameter
selection are performed prior to estimation. In this paper, we consider the
problem of estimating a preselected unknown deterministic parameter chosen from
a parameter set based on observations according to a predetermined selection
rule, $\Psi$. The data-based parameter selection process may impact the
subsequent estimation by introducing a selection bias and creating coupling
between decoupled parameters. This paper introduces a post-selection mean
squared error (PSMSE) criterion as a performance measure. A corresponding
Cram\'er-Rao-type bound on the PSMSE of any $\Psi$-unbiased estimator is
derived, where the $\Psi$-unbiasedness is in the Lehmann-unbiasedness sense.
The post-selection maximum-likelihood (PSML) estimator is presented .It is
proved that if there exists an $\Psi$-unbiased estimator that achieves the
$\Psi$-Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB), i.e. an $\Psi$-efficient estimator, then it is
produced by the PSML estimator. In addition, iterative methods are developed
for the practical implementation of the PSML estimator. Finally, the proposed
$\Psi$-CRB and PSML estimator are examined in estimation after parameter
selection with different distributions.
