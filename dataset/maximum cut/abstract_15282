A widely-used tool for binary classification is the Support Vector Machine
(SVM), a supervised learning technique that finds the "maximum margin" linear
separator between the two classes. While SVMs have been well studied in the
batch (offline) setting, there is considerably less work on the streaming
(online) setting, which requires only a single pass over the data using
sub-linear space. Existing streaming algorithms are not yet competitive with
the batch implementation. In this paper, we use the formulation of the SVM as a
minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem to provide a streaming SVM algorithm based
off of the blurred ball cover originally proposed by Agarwal and Sharathkumar.
Our implementation consistently outperforms existing streaming SVM approaches
and provides higher accuracies than libSVM on several datasets, thus making it
competitive with the standard SVM batch implementation.
