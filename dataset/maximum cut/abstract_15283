Axion-like particles (ALPs) are a common prediction of certain theories
beyond the Standard Model and couple to photons in the presence of external
magnetic fields. As a consequence, photon-ALP conversions could lead to an
enhancement of the flux of extragalactic gamma-ray sources that is otherwise
attenuated due to the interactions with background radiation fields. The
magnetic fields traversed by the gamma rays are often turbulent and frequently
modelled with a simple domain-like structure. Given a maximum mixing between
photons and ALPs, we show that in such models realisations of the fields exist
for which the photon-ALP oscillation probability vanishes. This behaviour does
not occur in more sophisticated magnetic-field models.
