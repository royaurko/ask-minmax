Shape constrained densities are encountered in many nonparametric estimation
problems. The classes of monotone or convex (and monotone) densities can be
viewed as special cases of the classes of k-monotone densities. A density g is
said to be k-monotone if its successive derivatives up to order k-2 are
alternately negative or positive, with the k-2 derivative convex (or concave)
according as k is even (or odd) respectively. g is simply nonincreasing if k=1.
These classes of shape constrained densities bridge the gap between the classes
of monotone (1-monotone) and convex decreasing (2-monotone) densities for which
asymptotic results are known, and the class of completely monotone densities
with k infinite.
  In this series of four papers we consider both (nonparametric) Maximum
Likelihood estimators and Least Squares estimators of a k-monotone density. In
this first part (part 1), we prove existence of the estimators and give
characterizations. We also establish consistency properties, and show that the
estimators are splines of order k (degree k-1) with simple knots. We further
provide asymptotic minimax risk lower bounds for estimating a k-monotone
density g_0 (x_0) and its derivatives g_0^{(j)}(x_0), for j=1, ..., k-1, at a
fixed point x_0 under the assumption that the k-th derivative of g_0 at x_0 is
non-zero.
