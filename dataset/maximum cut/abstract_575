A gauge-symmetric approach to effective Lagrangians is described with special
emphasis on derivations of effective low-energy Lagrangians from QCD. The
examples we discuss are based on exact rewritings of cut-off QCD in terms of
new collective degrees of freedom. These cut-off Lagrangians are thus
``effective'' in the sense that they explicitly contain some of the physical
long-distance degrees of freedom from the outset.(Talk presented by P.H.
Damgaard at the workshop on ``Quantum Field Theoretical Methods in High Energy
Physics'', Kyffhauser, Germany, Sept. 1993. To appear in those proceedings).
