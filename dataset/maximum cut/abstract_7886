The MINER$\nu$A experiment investigates neutrino interactions with nucleons
needed for an understanding of electroweak interactions of hadrons. Since
nuclear targets are being used many-body effects may affect the extracted cross
sections and the energy reconstruction. The latter is essential for the
extraction of neutrino oscillation properties. We investigate the influence of
nuclear effects on neutrino interaction cross sections and make predictions for
charged current quasielastic (QE) scattering, nucleon-knock-out and pion- and
kaon-production on a CH target. The Giessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck
(GiBUU) model is used for the description of neutrino-nucleus reactions.
Integrated and differential cross sections for inclusive neutrino scattering,
QE processes and particle production for the MINER$\nu$A neutrino flux are
calculated. The influence of final state interactions on the identification of
these processes is discussed. In particular, energy and $Q^2$ reconstruction
for the MINER$\nu$A flux are critically examined. The $Q^2$ dependence of the
inclusive cross sections is found to be sensitive to the energy reconstruction.
Cut-offs in flux distributions have a large effect. Final state interactions
affect the pion kinetic energy spectra significantly and increase the kaon
cross sections by cross feeding from other channels.
