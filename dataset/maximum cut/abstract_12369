Unintegrated gluon densities in nuclei, dipole-nucleus cross-sections and
quark densities are numerically investigated in the high-colour limit, with the
scattering on a heavy nucleus exactly described by the sum of fan diagrams of
BFKL pomerons. The initial condition for the evolution in rapidity is quickly
forgotten, and the gluon density presents a "supersaturation" pattern, as
previous studies indicated. Both dipole-nucleus cross-sections and quark
densities present the expected saturation features. Identifying the position in
transverse momentum $l$ of the maximum of the gluon distribution with the
saturation momentum $Q_s(y,b)$, at large rapidities all distributions depend
only on one variable $[l/Q_s(y,b)]$ or $[rQ_s(y,b)]$.
