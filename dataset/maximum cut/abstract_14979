We report the results of a computer simulation study of the thermodynamic
properties and the thermal conductivity of supercooled water as a function of
pressure and temperature using the TIP4P-2005 water model. The thermodynamic
properties can be represented by a two-structure equation of state consistent
with the presence of a liquid-liquid critical point in the supercooled region.
Our simulations confirm the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity,
not only at atmospheric pressure, as previously found for the TIP5P water
model, but also at elevated pressures. This anomalous behavior of the thermal
conductivity of supercooled water appears to be related to the maximum of the
isothermal compressibility or the minimum of the speed of sound. However, the
magnitudes of the simulated thermal conductivities are sensitive to the water
model adopted and appear to be significantly larger than the experimental
thermal conductivities of real water at low temperatures.
