Many theoretical and experimental results on the reach of the Large Hadron
Collider are based on the mSUGRA-inspired scenario with universal soft
supersymmetry breaking parameters at the apparent gauge coupling unification
scale. We study signals for supersymmetric models in which the sparticle mass
range is compressed compared to mSUGRA, using cuts like those employed by ATLAS
for 2010 data. The acceptance and the cross-section times acceptance are found
for several model lines that employ a compression parameter to smoothly
interpolate between the mSUGRA case and the extreme case of degenerate gaugino
masses at the weak scale. For models with moderate compression, the reach is
not much worse, and can even be substantially better, than the mSUGRA case. For
very compressed mass spectra, the acceptances are drastically reduced,
especially when a more stringent effective mass cut is chosen.
