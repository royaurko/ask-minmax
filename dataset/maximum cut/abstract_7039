This paper describes the analysis of quantitative characteristics of frequent
sets and association rules in the posts of Twitter microblogs related to
different event discussions. For the analysis, we used a theory of frequent
sets, association rules and a theory of formal concept analysis. We revealed
the frequent sets and association rules which characterize the semantic
relations between the concepts of analyzed subjects. The support of some
frequent sets reaches its global maximum before the expected event but with
some time delay. Such frequent sets may be considered as predictive markers
that characterize the significance of expected events for blogosphere users. We
showed that the time dynamics of confidence in some revealed association rules
can also have predictive characteristics. Exceeding a certain threshold may be
a signal for corresponding reaction in the society within the time interval
between the maximum and the probable coming of an event. In this paper, we
considered two types of events: the Olympic tennis tournament final in London,
2012 and the prediction of Eurovision 2013 winner.
