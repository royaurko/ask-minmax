We present new accurate measurements of the differential cross section
$\sigma(\theta)$ and the proton analyzing power $A_{y}$ for proton-$^{3}$He
elastic scattering at various energies. A supersonic gas jet target has been
employed to obtain these low energy cross section measurements. The
$\sigma(\theta)$ distributions have been measured at $E_{p}$ = 0.99, 1.59,
2.24, 3.11, and 4.02 MeV. Full angular distributions of $A_{y}$ have been
measured at $E_{p}$ = 1.60, 2.25, 3.13, and 4.05 MeV. This set of
high-precision data is compared to four-body variational calculations employing
realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) and three-nucleon (3N) interactions. For the
unpolarized cross section the agreement between the theoretical calculation and
data is good when a $3N$ potential is used. The comparison between the
calculated and measured proton analyzing powers reveals discrepancies of
approximately 50% at the maximum of each distribution. This is analogous to the
existing ``$A_{y}$ Puzzle'' known for the past 20 years in nucleon-deuteron
elastic scattering.
