We consider spatially coupled code ensembles. A particular instance are
convolutional LDPC ensembles. It was recently shown that, for transmission over
the memoryless binary erasure channel, this coupling increases the belief
propagation threshold of the ensemble to the maximum a-posteriori threshold of
the underlying component ensemble. This paved the way for a new class of
capacity achieving low-density parity check codes. It was also shown
empirically that the same threshold saturation occurs when we consider
transmission over general binary input memoryless channels.
  In this work, we report on empirical evidence which suggests that the same
phenomenon also occurs when transmission takes place over a class of channels
with memory. This is confirmed both by simulations as well as by computing EXIT
curves.
