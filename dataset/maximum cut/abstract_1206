In this paper for studying the anisotropic strange quark stars, we assume
that the radial pressure inside the anisotropic star is a superposition of
pressure in an isotropic case plus a Gaussian perturbation term. Considering a
proportionality between electric charge density and the density of matter, we
solve the TOV equation for different cases numerically. Our results indicate
that anisotropy increases the maximum mass $M_{max}$ and also its corresponding
radius $R$ for a typical strange quark star. According to our calculations, an
anisotropy amplitude of $A=3\times10^{33}Nm^{-2}$ with a standard deviation of
$\sigma=3\times10^{3}m$ leads to a neutron star of 1.97$M_{\odot}$.
Furthermore, electric charge not only increases the maximum mass and its
corresponding radius, but also raises up the anisotropy factor. We can see that
the tangential pressure $p_{t}$ and anisotropy factor $\Delta$ unlike the
radial pressure $p_{r}$ have a maximum on the surface and this maximum
increases by adding electric charge effect. However, we show that anisotropy
can be more effective than electric charge in rasing maximum mass of strange
quark stars.
