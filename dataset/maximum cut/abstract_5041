Precise measurement of the Higgs boson properties is an important issue of
the International Linear Collider (ILC) experiment to verify the particles mass
generation mechanism that the coupling strength between the Higgs boson and the
fermions or vector bosons are proportional to the mass of each particle. Thus
the measurement of the branching ratio of the Higgs boson an important issue to
understand the mass of each particle. In this analysis, measurement accuracy of
the Higgs boson branching ratio in the ZH->qqH hadronic decay mode was studied
with the cut-based analysis in Higgs mass of M_{H}=120 GeV at the
center-of-mass energy of \sqrt{s}=250 GeV with the ILD detector model. From the
analysis, we estimate the measurement accuracy of the relative Higgs boson
branching ratio of BR(H->cc)$ to BR(H->bb) as 13.68\%.
