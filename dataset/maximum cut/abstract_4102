The development of autonomous molecular computers capable of making
independent decisions in vivo regarding local drug administration may
revolutionize medical science. Recently Benenson at el (2004) have envisioned
one form such a ``smart drug'' may take by implementing an in vitro scheme, in
which a long DNA state molecule is cut repeatedly by a restriction enzyme in a
manner dependent upon the presence of particular short DNA ``rule molecules.''
To analyze the potential of their scheme in terms of the kinds of computations
it can perform, we study an abstraction assuming that a certain class of
restriction enzymes is available and reactions occur without error. We also
discuss how our molecular algorithms could perform with known restriction
enzymes. By exhibiting a way to simulate arbitrary circuits, we show that these
``Benenson automata'' are capable of computing arbitrary Boolean functions.
Further, we show that they are able to compute efficiently exactly those
functions computable by log-depth circuits. Computationally, we formalize a new
variant of limited width branching programs with a molecular implementation.
