Diffusion-enhanced and desorption-limited growth regimes of Ga-assisted GaAs
nanowires were identified. In the latter regime, the number of vertical NWs
with a narrow length distribution was increased by raising the growth
temperature. The maximum axial growth rate; which can be quantified by the
supplied rate of As atoms, is achieved when a dynamical equilibrium state is
maintained in Ga droplets i.e. the number of impinging As atoms on the droplet
surface is equivalent to that of direct deposited Ga atoms combining with the
diffusing ones. The contribution of Ga diffusion to the wire growth was
evidenced by the diameter-dependent NW axial growth rate.
