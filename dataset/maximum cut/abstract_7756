The production of W+ W- b bbar from e+ e- collisions at energies close to the
t tbar threshold is dominated by the resonant process with a nearly on-shell t
tbar intermediate state. The W b pairs in the final state can also be reached
through the decay of off-shell tops or through background processes containing
no or only single top quarks. This non-resonant production starts to contribute
at NLO to the W+ W- b bbar total cross section in the non-relativistic
power-counting v ~ alpha_s ~ sqrt(alpha_EW). The NLO non-resonant corrections
presented in this talk represent the non-trivial NLO electroweak corrections to
the e+ e- -> W+ W- b bbar cross section in the top anti-top resonance region.
In contrast to the QCD corrections which have been calculated (almost) up to
NNNLO, the parametrically larger NLO electroweak contributions have not been
completely known so far, but are mandatory for the required accuracy at a
future linear collider. We consider the total cross section of the e+ e- -> W+
W- b bbar process and additionally implement cuts on the invariant masses of
the W+ b and W- bbar pairs.
