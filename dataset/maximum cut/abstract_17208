We investigate whether the subhalos of Lambda-CDM galaxy halos have
potentials consistent with the observed properties of Milky Way satellites,
particularly those with high-quality photometric and kinematic data: Fornax,
Leo I, Sculptor, Sextans, and Carina. We compare spherical models with
isotropic velocity dispersion tensors to the observed, circularly averaged star
counts, line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles and line-of-sight velocity
distributions. We identify subhalos within the six high-resolution dark matter
halos of the Aquarius Project for which the spherically averaged potentials
result in excellent fits to each of the five galaxies. In particular, our
simple one-integral models reproduce the observations in the inner regions,
proving that these data are fully consistent with Lambda-CDM expectations and
do not require cored dark matter distributions. For four of the five satellites
the fits require moderately cusped {\it stellar} density profiles. The star
count data for Leo I, however, do require a cored distribution of star counts.
Current data suggest that these five satellites may be hosted by Lambda-CDM
subhalos with maximum circular velocities in the range 10 to 30 km/s.
