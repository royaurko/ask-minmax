We propose using spontaneous Raman scattering from an optically driven
Bose-Einstein condensate as a source of atom-photon pairs whose internal states
are maximally entangled. Generating entanglement between a particle which is
easily transmitted (the photon) and one which is easily trapped and coherently
manipulated (an ultracold atom) will prove useful for a variety of
quantum-information related applications. We analyze the type of entangled
states generated by spontaneous Raman scattering and construct a geometry which
results in maximum entanglement.
