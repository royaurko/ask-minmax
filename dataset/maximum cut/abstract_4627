An interest for the low-energy range of the nonextensive distribution
function arises from the study of radiative recombination in electron cooling
devices in particle accelerators, whose experimentally measured reaction rates
are much above the theoretical prediction. The use of generalized
distributions, that differ from the Maxwellian in the low energy part (due to
subdiffusion between electron and ion bunches), may account for the observed
rate enhancement. In this work, we consider the isotropic distribution function
and we propose a possible experiment for verifying the existence of a cut-off
in the generalized momentum distribution, by measuring the spectrum of the
X-rays emitted from radiative recombination reactions.
