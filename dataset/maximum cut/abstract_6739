Recent searches of gravitational-wave (GW) data raise the question of what
maximum GW energies could be emitted during gamma-ray flares of highly
magnetized neutron stars (magnetars). The highest energies (\sim 10^{49} erg)
predicted so far come from a model [K. Ioka, Mon. Not. Roy. Astron. Soc. 327,
639 (2001)] in which the internal magnetic field of a magnetar experiences a
global reconfiguration, changing the hydromagnetic equilibrium structure of the
star and tapping the gravitational potential energy without changing the
magnetic potential energy. The largest energies in this model assume very
special conditions, including a large change in moment of inertia (which was
observed in at most one flare), a very high internal magnetic field, and a very
soft equation of state. Here we show that energies of 10^{48}-10^{49} erg are
possible under more generic conditions by tapping the magnetic energy, and we
note that similar energies may also be available through cracking of exotic
solid cores. Current observational limits on gravitational waves from magnetar
fundamental modes are just reaching these energies and will beat them in the
era of advanced interferometers.
