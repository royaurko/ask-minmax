The mechanical response of a wet granular layer to imposed shear is studied
experimentally at low applied normal stress. The granular material is immersed
in water and the shear is applied by sliding a plate resting on the upper
surface of the layer. We monitor simultaneously the horizontal and the vertical
displacements of the plate to submicron accuracy with millisecond time
resolution. The relations between the plate displacement, the dilation of the
layer and the measured frictional force are analyzed in detail. When slip
begins, the dilation increases exponentially over a slip distance comparable to
the particle radius. We find that the total dilation and the steady state
frictional force do not depend on the driving velocity, but do depend linearly
on the applied normal stress. The frictional force also depends linearly on the
dilation rate (rather than the dilation itself), and reaches a maximum value
during the transient acceleration. We find that the layer can temporarily
sustain a shear stress that is in excess of the critical value that will
eventually lead to slip. We describe an empirical model that describes much of
what we observe. This model differs in some respects from those used previously
at stresses 10^6 times larger.
