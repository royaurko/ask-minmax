We present medium resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectra, covering 1.1 to 3.4
microns, of the normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2014J in M82 obtained with
the FLITECAM instrument aboard SOFIA approximately 17-25 days after maximum B
light. Our 2.8-3.4 micron spectra may be the first ~3 micron spectra of a SN Ia
ever published. The spectra spanning the 1.5-2.7 micron range are characterized
by a strong emission feature at ~1.77 microns with a full width at half maximum
of ~11,000-13,000 km/s. We compare the observed FLITECAM spectra to the recent
non-LTE delayed detonation models of Dessart et al. (2014) and find that the
models agree with the spectra remarkably well in the 1.5-2.7 micron wavelength
range. Based on this comparison we identify the ~1.77 micron emission peak as a
blend of permitted lines of Co II. Other features seen in the 2.0 - 2.5 micron
spectra are also identified as emission from permitted transitions of Co II.
However, the models are not as successful at reproducing the spectra in the 1.1
- 1.4 micron range or between 2.8 and 3.4 microns. These observations
demonstrate the promise of SOFIA by allowing access to wavelength regions
inaccessible from the ground, and serve to draw attention to the usefulness of
the regions between the standard ground-based NIR passbands for constraining SN
models.
