Platelet-like single crystals of the Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2 series having lateral
dimensions up to 15 mm and thickness up to 0.5 mm were obtained from the high
temperature solution growth technique using Sn flux. Upon Co doping, the c-axis
of the tetragonal unit cell decreases, while the a-axis shows a less
significant variation. Pristine CaFe2As2 shows a combined spin-density-wave and
structural transition near T = 166 K which gradually shifts to lower
temperatures and splits with increasing Co-doping. Both transitions terminate
abruptly at a critical Co-concentration of xc = 0.075. For x \geq 0.05,
superconductivity appears at low temperatures with a maximum transition
temperature TC of around 20 K. The superconducting volume fraction increases
with Co concentration up to x = 0.09 followed by a gradual decrease with
further increase of the doping level. The electronic phase diagram of
Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2 (0 \leq x \leq 0.2) series is constructed from the
magnetization and electric resistivity data. We show that the low-temperature
superconducting properties of Co-doped CaFe2As2 differ considerably from those
of BaFe2As2 reported previously. These differences seem to be related to the
extreme pressure sensitivity of CaFe2As2 relative to its Ba counterpart.
