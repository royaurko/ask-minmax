In this paper we argue that policies are an increasing concern for
organizations that are operating a web site. Examples of policies that are
relevant in the domain of the web address issues such as privacy of personal
data, accessibility for the disabled, user conduct, e-commerce, and
intellectual property. Web site policies--and the overarching concept of web
site governance--are cross-cutting concerns that have to be addressed and
implemented at different levels (e.g., policy documents, legal statements,
business processes, contracts, auditing, and software systems). For web sites,
policies are also reflected in the legal statements that the web site posts,
and in the behavior and features that the web site offers to its users. Both
policies and software tend to evolve independently, but at the same time they
both have to be kept in sync. This is a practical challenge for operators of
web sites that is poorly addressed right now and is, we believe, a promising
avenue for future research. In this paper, we discuss various challenges that
policy poses for web sites with an emphasis on privacy and data protection and
identify open issues for future research.
