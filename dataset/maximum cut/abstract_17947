We explore the connection between the central supermassive blackholes (SMBH)
in galaxies and the dark matter halo through the relation between the masses of
the SMBHs and the maximum circular velocities of the host galaxies, as well as
the relationship between stellar velocity dispersion of the spheroidal
component and the circular velocity. Our assumption here is that the circular
velocity is a proxy for the mass of the dark matter halo. We rely on a
heterogeneous sample containing galaxies of all types. The only requirement is
that the galaxy has a direct measurement of the mass of its SMBH and a direct
measurement of its circular velocity and its velocity dispersion. Previous
studies have analyzed the connection between the SMBH and dark matter halo
through the relationship between the circular velocity and the bulge velocity
dispersion, with the assumption that the bulge velocity dispersion stands in
for the mass of the SMBH, via the well{}-established SMBH mass{}-bulge velocity
dispersion relation. Using intermediate relations may be misleading when one is
studying them to decipher the active ingredients of galaxy formation and
evolution. We believe that our approach will provide a more direct probe of the
SMBH and the dark matter halo connection. We find that the correlation between
the mass of supermassive blackholes and the circular velocities of the host
galaxies is extremely weak, leading us to state the dark matter halo may not
play a major role in regulating the blackhole growth in the present Universe.
