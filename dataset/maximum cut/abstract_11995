We discuss necessary conditions for the existence of probability distribution
on particle configurations in $d$-dimensions i.e. a point process, compatible
with a specified density $\rho$ and radial distribution function $g({\bf r})$.
In $d=1$ we give necessary and sufficient criteria on $\rho g({\bf r})$ for the
existence of such a point process of renewal (Markov) type. We prove that these
conditions are satisfied for the case $g(r) = 0, r < D$ and $g(r) = 1, r > D$,
if and only if $\rho D \leq e^{-1}$: the maximum density obtainable from
diluting a Poisson process. We then describe briefly necessary and sufficient
conditions, valid in every dimension, for $\rho g(r)$ to specify a
determinantal point process for which all $n$-particle densities, $\rho_n({\bf
r}_1, ..., {\bf r}_n)$, are given explicitly as determinants. We give several
examples.
