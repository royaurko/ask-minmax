The process $p p \to Z \gamma + X \to \ell^- \ell^+ \gamma + X$, where $\ell$
denotes a lepton, is calculated to order $\alpha_s$. Total and differential
cross sections, with acceptance cuts imposed on the leptons and photon, are
given for the Tevatron and LHC center of mass energies. In general, invariant
mass and angular distributions are simply scaled up in magnitude by the QCD
radiative corrections, whereas in transverse momentum distributions, the QCD
radiative corrections increase with the transverse momentum.
