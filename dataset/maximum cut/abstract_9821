Neuronal brain activity in response to repeated stimuli can be perceived
using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this paper, we develop a
statistical model for fMRI data that estimates both the associated haemodynamic
response function and the within and between trial variability through maximum
likelihood estimation. We discuss our results in the context of other
model-driven approaches, extending models already popular in the literature,
while removing the need for some of their assumptions. We consider an
application to the motor cortex activity caused by a subject pressing a button
and observe that the response changes significantly with task and through time.
