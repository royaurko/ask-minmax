We derive a general and closed-form result for the success probability in
multiple-antenna (MIMO) heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets), utilizing a
novel Toeplitz matrix representation. This main result, which is equivalently
the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) distribution, includes multiuser MIMO,
single-user MIMO and per-tier biasing for $K$ different tiers of randomly
placed base stations (BSs). The large SIR limit of this result admits a simple
closed form that is accurate at moderate SIRs, e.g., above 5-10 dB. These
results reveal that the SIR-invariance property of SISO HetNets does not hold
for MIMO HetNets; instead the success probability may decrease as the network
density increases. We prove that the maximum success probability is achieved by
activating only one tier of BSs, while the maximum area spectral efficiency
(ASE) is achieved by activating all the BSs. This reveals a unique tradeoff
between the ASE and link reliability in multiuser MIMO HetNets. To achieve the
maximum ASE while guaranteeing a certain link reliability, we develop efficient
algorithms to find the optimal BS densities. It is shown that as the link
reliability requirement increases, more BSs and more tiers should be
deactivated.
