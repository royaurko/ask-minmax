Cumulant oscillations, or $H_q$ moment oscillations, appear if the KNO
multiparticle distribution decreases at large z, $z\equiv n/ <n>$, faster than
the exponential, $exp(-D z^\mu)$, with $\mu > 1$. In nucleus-nucleus
interactions this behaviour is related to the limitation in the average number
of elementary central collisions (or average number of strings centrally
produced), due to the finite number of nucleons involved. Colour deconfinement,
via percolating string fusion, will drastically decrease the fraction of
centrally produced strings and increase the cut-off parameter $\mu$: Moment
oscillations will be displaced to smaller q and the width of the KNO
distribution and forward-backward particle correlations will become smaller.
