We give a breezy, qualitative overview of some of our recent results on
studying jet stopping in strongly-coupled plasmas using gauge-gravity duality.
Previously, people have found that the maximum stopping distance in such
plasmas scales with energy as E^{1/3}. We show that there is an important
distinction between typical and maximum stopping distances. For the
strongly-coupled excitations that we study, we find that the typical stopping
distance scales with energy as E^{1/4}.
