In this paper we complete our re-assessment of the production of W boson
pairs at the LHC, by calculating analytic results for the gg -> W+ W- -> (\nu l
l\nu) process including the effect of massive quarks circulating in the loop.
Together with the one-loop amplitudes containing the first two generations of
massless quarks propagating in the loop, these diagrams can give a significant
contribution with a large flux of gluons. One of the component parts of this
calculation is the production of a standard model Higgs boson, gg -> H and its
subsequent decay, H -> W+(-> \nu l) W-(-> l \nu). We will quantify the
importance of the interference between the Higgs boson production process and
the gluon-induced continuum production in the context of searches for the Higgs
boson at the Tevatron and the LHC. For instance, for mH < 140 GeV the effect of
the interference typically results in around a 10% reduction in the expected
number of Higgs signal events. The majority of this interference is due to
non-resonant contributions. Therefore cuts on the transverse mass such as those
currently used by the ATLAS collaboration reduce the destructive interference
to about a 1% effect. We advocate that a cut on the maximum transverse mass be
used in future Higgs searches in this channel.
