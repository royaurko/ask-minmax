Blue primordial power spectra have spectral index $n>1$ and arise naturally
in the recently proposed hybrid inflationary scenario. An observational upper
limit on {\em n} is derived by normalizing the spectrum at the quadrupole scale
and considering the possible overproduction of Planck mass relics formed in the
final stage of primordial black hole evaporation. In the inflationary Universe
with the maximum reheating temperature compatible with the observed quadrupole
anisotropy, the upper limit is $n=1.4$, but it is slightly weaker for lower
reheat temperatures. This limit applies over 57 decades of mass and is
therefore insensitive to cosmic variance and any gravitational wave
contribution to the quadrupole anisotropy. It is also independent of the dark
matter content of the Universe and therefore the bias parameter. In some
circumstances, there may be an extended dust-like phase between the end of
inflation and reheating. In this case, primordial black holes form more
abundantly and the upper limit is $n=1.3$.
