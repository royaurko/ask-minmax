The temperature dependent evolution of the renormalization effect in
optimally-doped Bi2212 along the nodal direction has been studied via
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Fine structure is observed in the
real part of the self-energy (Re$\Sigma$), including a subkink and maximum,
suggesting that electrons couple to a spectrum of bosonic modes, instead of
just one mode. Upon cooling through the superconducting phase transition, the
fine structures of the extracted Re$\Sigma$ exhibit a two-processes evolution
demonstrating an interplay between kink renormalization and superconductivity.
We show that this two-process evolution can be qualitatively explained by a
simple Holstein model in which a spectrum of bosonic modes is considered.
