Properties of rotating neutron stars with the use of relativistic mean-field
theory are considered. The performed analysis of neutron star matter is based
on the nonlinear Lgrangian density. The presence of nonlinear interaction of
vector mesons modifies the density dependence of the rho field and influences
bulk parameters of neutron stars. The observed quasi-periodic X-ray
oscillations of low mass X-ray binaries can be used in order to constrain the
equation of state of neutron star matter. Having assumed that the maximum
frequency of the quasi periodic oscillations originates at the circular orbit
it is possible to estimate masses and radii of neutron stars.
