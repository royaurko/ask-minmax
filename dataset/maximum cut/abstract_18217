We obtain an unbiased estimate of the global Hubble constant H0 in the volume
of cz<12000km/s in the region of Pisces-Perseus. The Tully-Fisher (TF) relation
is applied to a magnitude limited sample of 441 spirals selected from the
Arecibo 21cm catalog. The photometry data were calibrated with CCD observations
and we achieve 0.13mag for the photometric internal error. We use a maximum
likelihood method for the TF analysis. Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate that
our method reproduces a given H0 at the 95% confidence level. By applying the
method to our sample galaxies, we obtain the unbiased global Hubble constant
H0=65+-2(+20,-14) km/s/Mpc; the first and the second terms represent the
internal random error and the external errors, respectively. We also find a
good agreement for our H0 with those recently obtained via Cepheid observation,
the TF relation and supernovae. Hubble velocities of the spirals inferred from
our H0 show no significant systematic difference from those given in the Mark
III catalog. The same analysis for H0 is carried out using r-band photometry
data of the Pisces-Perseus region given by Willick et al.(1997). We obtain a
global H0 which is consistent with that obtained from our B-band analysis. A
bulk motion in the Pisces-Perseus region is briefly discussed, based on our
calibration of H0. Our r-band TF analysis supports the notion of a coherent
streaming motion of the Pisces-Perseus ridge with -200km/s with respect to the
CMB, in agreement with most modern studies.
