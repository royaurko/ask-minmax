We rewrite the zero-counting formula within the critical strip of the Riemann
zeta function as a cumulative density distribution; this subsequently allows us
to formally derive an integral expression for the Li coefficients associated
with the Riemann xi-function which, in particular, indicate that their
positivity criterion is obeyed, whereby entailing the criticality of the
non-trivial zeros. We conjecture the validity of this and related expressions
without the need for the Riemann Hypothesis and also offer a physical
interpretation of the result and discuss the Hilbert-Polya approach.
