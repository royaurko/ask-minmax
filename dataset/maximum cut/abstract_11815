Improved trapped fields are reported for bulk melt-textured YBa2Cu3O7-x
(YBCO) material in the temperature range between 20 K and 50 K. Trapped fields
up to 12.2 T were obtained at 22 K on the surface of single YBCO disks (with Ag
and Zn additions). In YBCO mini-magnets, maximum trapped fields of 16 T (at 24
K) and of 11.2 T (at 47 K) were achieved using (Zn + Ag) and Zn additions,
respectively. In all cases, the YBCO disks were encapsulated in steel tubes in
order to reinforce the material against the large tensile stress acting during
the magnetizing process and to avoid cracking. We observed cracking not only
during the magnetizing process, but also as a consequence of flux jumps due to
thermomagnetic instabilities in the temperature range betweeen 20 K and 30 K.
