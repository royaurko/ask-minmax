Up-to-now known characteristics of radio pulsars, such as mass limits,
magnetic field intensity, rotational period, and maximum radiation are mainly
of empirical nature. Applying the Expansive Nondecelerative Universe model
(ENU) into the issue allows to offer a deeper theoretical explanation of the
known parameters and to estimate their limits. Using the ENU approach the
following values related to synchrotron radiation emitting radio pulsars were
estimated: the lower and upper limits of magnetic field intensity are B(min) =
8.6 x 10^6 T, and B(max) = 9.4 x 10^8 T, respectively, the maximum rotation
period reaches 3.9 s, the maximum radiation output of a pulsar is P(max) = 5.6
x 10^29 W (all the values relate to radio pulsars with 1.4 solar masses and
radius 1.0 x 10^4 m and are mass and radius dependent). These values are in
accordance with the experimental observations.
