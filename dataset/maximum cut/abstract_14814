In this paper we study a broad class of distribution functions which is
defined by means of reflected generalized beta distribution. This class
includes that of Beta-generated distribution as a special case. In particular,
we use this class to extend the Inverse Weibull distribution in order to obtain
the Reflected Generalized Beta Inverse Weibull Distribution.For this new
distribution, moments, entropy, order statistics and a reliability measure are
derived. The link between the Inverse Weibull and the Dagum distribution is
generalized. Then the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters are
examined and the observed Fisher information matrix provided. Finally, the
usefulness of the model is illustrated by means of an application to real data.
