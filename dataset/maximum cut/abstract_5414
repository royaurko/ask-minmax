We consider the ratio of the correlation function of an hexagon light-like
Wilson loop with one local operator over the expectation value of the Wilson
loop within the strong-coupling regime of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We choose
the hexagon Wilson loop within a class of minimal solutions obtained by cutting
and gluing light-like quadrangle loops. These surfaces do not have an
interpretation in terms of dual scattering amplitudes but they still exhibit
general features of the mixed correlation function. In the case of a regular
null hexagon conformal symmetry constrains the space-time dependence of the
correlator up to a function of three conformal cross-ratios. We obtain the
leading-order contribution to the correlation function in the semiclassical
approximation of large string tension, and express the result in terms of three
conformal ratios in the case where the local operator is taken to be the
dilaton. We include the analysis of an irregular Wilson loop obtained after a
boost of the regular hexagon.
