Randomness is viewed through an analogy between a physical quantity, density
of gas, and a mathematical construct -- probability density. Boltzmann's
deduction of equilibrium distribution of ideal gas placed in an external
potential field than provides a way of viewing probability density from a
perspective of forces/potentials, hidden behind it.
