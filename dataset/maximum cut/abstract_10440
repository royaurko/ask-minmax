A hybrid thermal lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is presented to simulate
thermal multiphase flows with phase change based on an improved pseudopotential
LB approach [Q. Li, K. H. Luo, and X. J. Li, Phys. Rev. E 87, 053301 (2013)].
The present model does not suffer from the spurious term caused by the
forcing-term effect, which was encountered in some previous thermal LB models
for liquid-vapor phase change. Using the model, the liquid-vapor boiling
process is simulated. The boiling curve together with the three boiling stages
(nucleate boiling, transition boiling, and film boiling) is numerically
reproduced in the LB community for the first time. The numerical results show
that the basic features and the fundamental characteristics of boiling heat
transfer are well captured, such as the severe fluctuation of transient heat
flux in the transition boiling and the feature that the maximum heat transfer
coefficient lies at a lower wall superheat than that of the maximum heat flux.
Furthermore, the effects of the heating surface wettability on boiling heat
transfer are investigated. It is found that an increase in contact angle
promotes the onset of boiling but reduces the critical heat flux, and makes the
boiling process enter into the film boiling regime at a lower wall superheat,
which is consistent with the findings from experimental studies.
