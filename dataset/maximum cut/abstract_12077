We correct the proof of Brundobler-Elser formula (BEF) provided in [2004
\textit{J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys.} \textbf{37} 4069] and continued in
Appendix of [2005 \textit{J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys.} \textbf{38} 907].
After showing that some changes of variables employed in these articles are
used erroneously, we propose an alternative change of variables which solves
the problem. In our proof, we reveal the connection between the BEF for a
general $N$-level Landau-Zener system and the exactly solvable bow-tie model.
The special importance of the diabatic levels with maximum/minimum slope is
emphasized throughout.
