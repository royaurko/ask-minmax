We present a class of relativistic solutions of cold compact anisotropic
stars in hydrostatic equilibrium in the framework of higher dimensions using
spheroidal geometry. The solutions obtained with Vaidya-Tikekar metric are used
to construct stellar models of compact objects and studied their physical
features. The effects of anisotropy and extra dimensions on the global
properties namely, compactness, mass, radius, equation of state are determined
in higher dimensions in terms of the spheroidicity parameter ($\lambda$). It is
noted that for a given configuration, compactness of a star is found smaller in
higher dimensions compared to that in four space-time dimensions. It is also
noted that the maximum mass of compact objects increase with the increase of
space-time dimensions which however attains a maximum when $D=5$ for a large
($\lambda=100$), thereafter it decreases as one increases number of extra
dimensions. The effect of extra dimensions on anisotropy is also studied.
