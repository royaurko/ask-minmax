EGRET data are usually analysed on the basis of the Maximum-Likelihood method
\cite{ma96} in a search for point sources in excess to a model for the
background radiation (e.g. \cite{hu97}). This method depends strongly on the
quality of the background model, and thus may have high systematic
uncertainties in region of strong and uncertain background like the Galactic
Center region. Here we show images of such regions obtained by the quantified
Maximum-Entropy method. We also discuss a possible further use of MEM in the
analysis of problematic regions of the sky.
