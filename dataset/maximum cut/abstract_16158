We examine the relative fractions of passive (Type 1), quiet-SF (Type 2) and
active-SF (Type 3+4) galaxies as a function of luminosity and number of
neighbours in several volume limited samples selected from the 2dFGRS.
Neighbours are counted within 1 $h_{75}^{-1}$ Mpc projected distance, and $\pm$
1000 km s$^{-1}$ depth. We apply a maximum magnitude difference criterion and
require neighbours to be fainter than the galaxy itself. We show that, whatever
the environment, passive galaxies dominate in bright samples and active-SF
galaxies in faint samples, whereas quiet-SF galaxies never dominate. We further
show that in bright samples (M$_{B}$ -- 5 $\log$ $h_{75}$ $\leq$$
  - 19$) the fraction of passive galaxies grows steadily with fainter neighbour
density, whereas in faint samples a threshold like dependence is observed. This
suggests that the spectral-type / density ($\approx$ morphology / density)
relation extends to intermediate dense environment, but only in the surrounding
of luminous galaxies and that it reflects an enhancement of the number of
satellites rather than stronger clustering among galaxies themselves. Our
analysis indicates that, in general, luminosity is a good tracer of a galaxy
halo mass and that it dominates over environment (satellite density) in setting
the spectral type mix of a population. However, minority populations exist,
such as luminous SF galaxies and faint passive galaxies, whose luminosity is an
unfair tracer of halo mass.
