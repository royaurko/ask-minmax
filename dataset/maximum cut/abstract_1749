Eukaryotic cell development has been optimized by natural selection to obey
maximal intracellular flux of messenger proteins. This, in turn, implies
maximum Fisher information on angular position about a target nuclear pore
complex (NPR). The cell is simply modeled as spherical, with cell membrane (CM)
diameter 10 micron and concentric nuclear membrane (NM) diameter 6 micron. The
NM contains about 3000 nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Development requires
messenger ligands to travel from the CM-NPC-DNA target binding sites. Ligands
acquire negative charge by phosphorylation, passing through the cytoplasm over
Newtonian trajectories toward positively charged NPCs (utilizing positive
nuclear localization sequences). The CM-NPC channel obeys maximized mean
protein flux F and Fisher information I at the NPC, with first-order delta I =
0 and approximate 2nd-order delta I = 0 stability to environmental
perturbations. Many of its predictions are confirmed, including the dominance
of protein pathways of from 1-4 proteins, a 4nm size for the EGFR protein and
the approximate flux value F =10^16 proteins/m2-s. After entering the nucleus,
each protein ultimately delivers its ligand information to a DNA target site
with maximum probability, i.e. maximum Kullback-Liebler entropy HKL. In a
smoothness limit HKL approaches IDNA/2, so that the total CM-NPC-DNA channel
obeys maximum Fisher I. Thus maximum information approaches non-equilibrium,
one condition for life.
