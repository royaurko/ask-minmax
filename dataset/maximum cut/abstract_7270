A broad band X-, gamma-ray spectral study of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7172 is
presented. We use our ASCA observations from May 1995 and combine these with
the CGRO OSSE data from March 1995. The only Seyfert 2 galaxy previously to
have been modelled over such a broad spectral range is NGC 4945. We find that
the most probable model for the data is an absorbed power law, being affected
by a high energy exponential cut-off. The power law is flat with Gamma = 1.54
\pm 0.13, while N_H = (8.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{22} cm$^{-2}$. An Fe K$\alpha$ emission
line is not required by the fits. The observed flux in the 2-10 keV range is
F_{2-10} = (4.75\pm 0.09) 10^{-11} erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to
a small increase since the Ginga measurement in October 1989. The spectral
index of the underlying power law of NGC 7172 appears actually to have varied
from 1.85 to 1.5 since the Ginga observations in 1989. The e-folding energy is
relatively well constrained and lies at 140 ^{+310} _{-70} keV. We note,
however, that the CGRO OSSE spectral shape appears to be variable on a time
scale of weeks.
