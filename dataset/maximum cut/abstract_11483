In three-dimensional electromagnetic configurations that result from unstable
resistive tearing modes particles can efficiently be accelerated to
relativistic energies. To prove this resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations
are used as input configurations for successive test particle simulations. The
simulations show the capability of three-dimensional non-linearly evolved
tearing modes to accelerate particles perpendicular to the plane of the
reconnecting magnetic field components. The simulations differ considerably
from analytical approaches by involving a realistic three-dimensional electric
field with a non-homogenous component parallel to the current direction. The
resulting particle spectra exhibit strong pitch-angle anisotropies. Typically,
about 5-8 % of an initially Maxwellian distribution is accelerated to the
maximum energy levels given by the macroscopic generalized electric potential
structure. Results are shown for both, non-relativistic particle acceleration
that is of interest, e.g., in the context of auroral arcs and solar flares, and
relativistic particle energization that is relevant, e.g., in the context of
active galactic nuclei.
