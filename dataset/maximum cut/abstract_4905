We report design and subsequent fabrication of an intrinsically gain
flattened Erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) based on a highly asymmetrical
and concentric dual-core fiber, inner core of which was only partially doped.
Phase-resonant optical coupling between the two cores was so tailored through
optimization of its refractive index profile parameters that the longer
wavelengths within the C-band experience relatively higher amplification
compared to the shorter wavelengths thereby reducing the difference in the
well-known tilt in the gains between the shorter and longer wavelength regions.
The fabricated EDFA exhibited a median gain ?28 dB (gain excursion below
$\pm$2.2 dB within the C-band) when 16 simultaneous standard signal channels
were launched by keeping the I/P level for each at ?20 dBm/ channel. Such EDFAs
should be attractive for deployment in metro networks, where economics is a
premium, because it would cut down the cost on gain flattening filter head.
