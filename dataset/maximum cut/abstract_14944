We describe an ab-initio Disordered Local Moment Theory for materials with
quenched static compositional disorder traversing first order magnetic phase
transitions. It accounts quantitatively for metamagnetic changes and the
magnetocaloric effect. For perfect stoichiometric B2-ordered FeRh, we calculate
the transition temperature of the ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition to
be $T_t =$ 495K and a maximum isothermal entropy change in 2 Tesla of $|\Delta
S|= 21.1$ J~K$^{-1}$~kg$^{-1}$. A large (40\%) component of $|\Delta S|$ is
electronic. The transition results from a fine balance of competing electronic
effects which is disturbed by small compositional changes - e.g. swapping just
2\% Fe of `defects' onto the Rh sublattice makes $T_t$ drop by 290K. This
hypersensitivity explains the narrow compositional range of the transition and
impurity doping effects.
