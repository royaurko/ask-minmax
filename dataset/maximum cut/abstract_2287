We investigate the quark-lepton symmetric gauge group in five dimensions,
with the gauge symmetry broken by a combination of orbifold compactification of
the extra dimension and the Higgs mechanism. The gauge sector of the model is
investigated and contrasted with the four dimensional case. We obtain lower
bounds on the mass of the exotic gauge bosons, the inverse compactification
scale and the exotic leptons. Light neutrinos are obtained without requiring
any scale larger than a TeV. However an ultra-violet cut-off of order $10^{11}$
GeV is required to suppress proton decay inducing non-renormalizable operators.
