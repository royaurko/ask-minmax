Time-resolved CCD photometry is presented of the recently-discovered (V~15 at
maximum light) eruptive variable star in Taurus, which we dub VS0329+1250. A
total of ~20 hr of data obtained over six nights reveals superhumps in the
light curves, confirming the star as a member of the SU UMa class of dwarf
novae. The superhumps recur with a mean period of 0.053394(7) days (76.89 min),
which represents the shortest superhump period known in a classical SU UMa
star. A quadratic fit to the timings of superhump maxima reveals that the
superhump period was increasing at a rate given by dP/dt ~ (2.1 +/- 0.8) x
10^{-5} over the course of our observations. An empirical relation between
orbital period and the absolute visual magnitude of dwarf novae at maximum
light, suggests that VS0329+1250 lies at a distance of ~1.2 +/- 0.2 kpc.
