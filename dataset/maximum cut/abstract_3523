We present optical light curves of five Type Ia supernovae (2002er, 2002fk,
2003cg, 2003du, 2003fk). The photometric observations were performed in a set
of intermediate-band filters. SNe 2002er, 2003du appear to be normal SN Ia
events with similar light curve shapes, while SN 2003kf shows the behavior of a
brighter SN Ia with slower decline rate after maximum. The light curves of SN
2003cg is unusual; they show a fast rise and dramatic decline near maximum and
do not display secondary peak at longer wavelengths during 15-30 days after
maximum light. This suggests that SN 2003cg is likely to be an intrinsically
subluminous, 91bg-like SN Ia. Exploration of SN Ia feature lines through
intermediate-band photometry is briefly discussed.
