We test the statistical isotropy of the universe by analyzing the
distribution of WISE extragalactic sources that were also observed by 2MASS. We
pay particular attention to color cuts and foreground marginalization in order
to cull a uniform sample of extragalactic objects and avoid stars. We detect a
dipole gradient in the number-counts with an amplitude of $\sim$0.05, somewhat
larger than expectations based on local structures corresponding to the depth
and (independently measured) bias of our WISE-2MASS sources. The direction of
the dipole, $(l,b)\simeq (310\,^{\circ}, -15\,^{\circ})$, is in reasonably good
agreement with that found previously in the (shallower) 2MASS Extended Source
Catalog alone. Interestingly, the dipole direction is not far from the
direction of the dipolar modulation in the CMB found by Planck, and also fairly
closely matches large-scale-structure bulk-flow directions found by various
groups using galaxies and type Ia supernovae. It is difficult, however, to draw
specific conclusions from the near-agreement of these directions.
