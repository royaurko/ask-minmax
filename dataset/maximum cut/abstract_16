What is the shape of the 2D convex region P from which, when 2 mutually
congruent convex pieces with maximum possible area are cut out, the highest
fraction of the area of P is left over? When P is restricted to the set of all
possible triangular shapes, our computational search yields an approximate
upper bound of 5.6% on the area wasted when any triangle is given its best
(most area utilizing) partition into 2 convex pieces. We then produce evidence
for the general convex region which wastes the most area for its best convex
2-partition not being a triangle and briefly discuss some further
generalizations of the question.
