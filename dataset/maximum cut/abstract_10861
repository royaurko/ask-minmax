We present and discuss the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of the
peculiar SN1998bw, associated with GRB980425, through an analysis of optical
and near IR data collected at ESO-La Silla. The spectroscopic data, spanning
the period from day -9 to day +376 (relative to B maximum), have shown that
this SN was unprecedented, although somewhat similar to SN1997ef. Maximum
expansion velocities as high as 3x10^4 km/s to some extent mask its resemblance
to other Type Ic SNe. At intermediate phases, between photospheric and fully
nebular, the expansion velocities (~10^4 km/s) remained exceptionally high
compared to those of other recorded core-collapse SNe at a similar phase. The
mild linear polarization detected at early epochs suggests the presence of
asymmetry in the emitting material. The degree of asymmetry, however, cannot be
decoded from these measurements alone. The HeI 1.083 mu and 2.058 mu lines are
identified and He is suggested to lie in an outer region of the envelope. The
temporal behavior of the fluxes and profiles of emission lines of MgI]4571A,
[OI]6300,6364A and a feature ascribed to Fe are traced to stimulate future
modeling work.
