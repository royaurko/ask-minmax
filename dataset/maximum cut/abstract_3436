We investigate activities that have different periods of duration. We define
the profit intensity as a measure of this economic category. The profit
intensity in a repeated trading has a unique property of attaining its maximum
at a fixed point regardless of the shape of demand curves for a wide class of
probability distributions of random reverse transaction (ie closing of the
position). This type of market games is often considered in the research aiming
at finding an algorithm that maximizes profit of a trader who negotiates prices
with the Rest of the World (a collective opponent) that posses a definite and
objective supply profile. Such idealization neglects the sometimes important
influence of an individual trader on the demand/supply profile of the Rest of
the World and in extreme cases questions the very idea of demand/supply
profile. Therefore we put forward a trading model in which the demand/supply
profile of the Rest of the World induces the (rational) trader to
(subjectively) presume that he/she lacks (almost) all knowledge concerning the
market but his/hers average frequency of trade. This point of view introduces
maximum entropy principles into the model and broadens the range of economics
phenomena that can be perceived as a sort of thermodynamical system. As a
consequence, the profit intensity has a fixed point:the profit in tensity
reaches its maximum when the probability of transaction is given by the Golden
Ratio rule $\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$.
