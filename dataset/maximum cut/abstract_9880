In this paper, we introduce a new class of bivariate distributions by
compounding the bivariate generalized exponential and power-series
distributions.
  This new class contains some new sub-models such as the bivariate generalized
exponential distribution, the bivariate generalized exponential-poisson,
-logarithmic, -binomial and -negative binomial distributions. We derive
different properties of the new class of distributions. The EM algorithm is
used to determine the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. We
illustrate the usefulness of the new distributions by means of an application
to a real data set.
