A new computer program named CutLHCO is introduced, whose function is the
implementation of generic data selection cuts on collider event specification
files in the standardized .lhco format. This software is intended to fill an
open market niche for a lightweight yet flexible "consumer-level" alternative
to the ROOT data analysis framework. The primary envisioned application is as a
filter on output produced by the PGS4 and DELPHES detector simulations, which
are themselves lightweight alternatives to the GEANT4 based solutions favored
by the large LHC experiments. All process control instructions are provided via
a compact and powerful card file input syntax that efficiently facilitates the
reasonable approximation of most event selection strategies and specialized
discovery statistics commonly employed by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations. The
structure, function, invocation and usage of the most recent CutLHCO 2.0
program version are documented thoroughly, including a detailed deconstruction
of several example card file specifications. The associated software is
simultaneously being made available for free public download.
