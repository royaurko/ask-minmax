Using a metric perturbation method, we study gravitational waves from a test
particle scattered by a spherically symmetric relativistic star. We calculate
the energy spectrum and the waveform of gravitational waves for axial modes.
Since metric perturbations in axial modes do not couple to the matter fluid of
the star, emitted waves for a normal neutron star show only one peak in the
spectrum, which corresponds to the orbital frequency at the turning point,
where the gravitational field is strongest. However, for an ultracompact star
(the radius $R \lesssim 3M$), another type of resonant periodic peak appears in
the spectrum. This is just because of an excitation by a scattered particle of
axial quasinormal modes, which were found by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari. This
excitation comes from the existence of the potential minimum inside of a star.
We also find for an ultracompact star many small periodic peaks at the
frequency region beyond the maximum of the potential, which would be due to a
resonance of two waves reflected by two potential barriers (Regge-Wheeler type
and one at the center of the star). Such resonant peaks appear neither for a
normal neutron star nor for a Schwarzschild black hole. Consequently, even if
we analyze the energy spectrum of gravitational waves only for axial modes, it
would be possible to distinguish between an ultracompact star and a normal
neutron star (or a Schwarzschild black hole).
