The capabilities of the ATLAS detector to measure the $B_{s}^{0}$
oscillations in proton-proton interactions at the Large Hadron Collider were
evaluated. $B_{s}^{0}$ candidates in the $D_{s}^{-} \pi^{+}$ and $D_{s}^{-}
a_{1}^{+}$ decay modes from semileptonic exclusive events were fully simulated
and reconstructed, using a detailed detector description. The sensitivity and
the expected accuracy for the measurement of the oscillation frequency were
derived from unbinned maximum likelihood amplitude fits as functions of the
integrated luminosity. A detailed treatment of the systematic uncertainties was
performed. The dependence of the measurement sensitivity on various parameters
was also evaluated.
