We generalize the one electron attosecond streaking camera to time-resolve
the correlated two-electron escape dynamics during a collision process
involving a deep core electron. The collision process is triggered by an XUV
attosecond pulse and probed by a weak infrared field. The principle of our
two-electron streak camera is that by placing the maximum of the vector
potential of the probing field at the time of collision we get the maximum
splitting of the inter-electronic angle of escape. We thus identify the time of
collision.
