We present a preliminary analysis of an extensive set of optical observations
of the Type Ia SN 2005hk. We show that the evolution of SN 2005hk closely
follows that of the peculiar SN 2002cx. SN 2005hk is more luminous than SN
2002cx, while still under-luminous compared to normal Type Ia supernovae. The
spectrum at 9 days before maximum is dominated by conspicuous Fe III and Ni III
lines, and the Si II 6355 line is also clearly visible. All these features have
low velocity (~6000 km/s). The near maximum spectra show lines of Si II, S II,
Fe II, Fe III, as well as other intermediate mass and iron group elements.
Analysis with the code for synthetic spectra SYNOW indicates that all these
spectral lines have similar velocities.
