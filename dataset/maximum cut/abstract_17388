Although it has important ramifications for both the formation of star
clusters and their subsequent dynamical evolution, rotation remains a largely
unexplored characteristic of young star clusters (few Myr). Using multi-epoch
spectroscopic data of the inner regions of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) obtained as part of the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey, we search for
rotation of the young massive cluster R136. From the radial velocities of 36
apparently single O-type stars within a projected radius of 10 pc from the
centre of the cluster, we find evidence, at the 95% confidence level, for
rotation of the cluster as a whole. We use a maximum likelihood method to fit
simple rotation curves to our data and find a typical rotational velocity of ~3
km/s. When compared to the low velocity dispersion of R136, our result suggests
that star clusters may form with at least ~20% of the kinetic energy in
rotation.
