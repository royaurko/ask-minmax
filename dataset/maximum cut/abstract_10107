In a bipartite max-min LP, we are given a bipartite graph $\myG = (V \cup I
\cup K, E)$, where each agent $v \in V$ is adjacent to exactly one constraint
$i \in I$ and exactly one objective $k \in K$. Each agent $v$ controls a
variable $x_v$. For each $i \in I$ we have a nonnegative linear constraint on
the variables of adjacent agents. For each $k \in K$ we have a nonnegative
linear objective function of the variables of adjacent agents. The task is to
maximise the minimum of the objective functions. We study local algorithms
where each agent $v$ must choose $x_v$ based on input within its
constant-radius neighbourhood in $\myG$. We show that for every $\epsilon>0$
there exists a local algorithm achieving the approximation ratio ${\Delta_I (1
- 1/\Delta_K)} + \epsilon$. We also show that this result is the best possible
-- no local algorithm can achieve the approximation ratio ${\Delta_I (1 -
1/\Delta_K)}$. Here $\Delta_I$ is the maximum degree of a vertex $i \in I$, and
$\Delta_K$ is the maximum degree of a vertex $k \in K$. As a methodological
contribution, we introduce the technique of graph unfolding for the design of
local approximation algorithms.
