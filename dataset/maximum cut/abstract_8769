In order to obtain solutions to problem $$ {{array}{c} -\Delta
u=\dfrac{A+h(x)} {|x|^2}u+k(x)u^{2^*-1}, x\in {\mathbb R}^N, u>0
\hbox{in}{\mathbb R}^N, {and}u\in {\mathcal D}^{1,2}({\mathbb R}^N), {array}.
$$ $h$ and $k$ must be chosen taking into account not only the size of some
norm but the shape. Moreover, if $h(x)\equiv 0$, to reach multiplicity of
solution, some hypotheses about the local behaviour of $k$ close to the points
of maximum are needed.
