We introduce a method to compute particle detector transition probability in
spacetime regions of general curved spacetimes provided that the curvature is
not above a maximum threshold. In particular we use this method to compare the
response of two detectors, one in a spherically symmetric gravitational field
and the other one in Rindler spacetime to compare the Unruh and Hawking
effects: We study the vacuum response of a detector freely falling through a
stationary cavity in a Schwarzschild background as compared with the response
of an equivalently accelerated detector traveling through an inertial cavity in
the absence of curvature. We find that as we set the cavity in further radiuses
from the black hole, the thermal radiation measured by the detector approaches
the quantity recorded by the detector in Rindler background showing in which
way and at what scales the equivalent principle is recovered in the
Hawking-Unruh effect. I.e. when the Hawking effect in a Schwarzschild
background becomes equivalent to the Unruh effect in Rindler spacetime.
