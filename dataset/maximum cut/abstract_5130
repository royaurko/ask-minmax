We use the clump giants of the disk as standard candles calibrated from
Hipparcos parallaxes in order to map their distribution with two new near-IR
surveys of the Galactic plane: UKIDSS-GPS and VVV. We explore different
selection cuts of clump giants. We conclude that there is an edge of the
stellar disk of the Milky Way at R=13.9+/-0.5kpc along various lines of sight
across the galaxy. The effect of the warp is considered, taking fields at
different longitudes and above and below the plane. We demonstrate that the
edge of the stellar disk of the Milky Way can now be mapped in the near
infrared in order to test different models, and to establish our own place
within the galaxy.
