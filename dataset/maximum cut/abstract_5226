The low-momentum interaction $V_{\text{low-k}}$ derived from realistic models
of the nucleon-nucleon interaction is presented in a separable form. This
separable force is supported by a contact interaction in order to achieve the
saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter. Bulk properties of nuclear
matter and finite nuclei are investigated for the separable form of
$V_{\text{low-k}}$ and two different parameterizations of the contact term. The
accuracy of the separable force in Hartree-Fock calculations with respect to
the original interaction $V_{\text{low-k}}$ is discussed. For a cutoff
parameter $\Lambda$ of 2 fm$^{-1}$ a representation by a rank 2 separable force
yields a sufficient accuracy, while higher ranks are required for larger
cut-off parameters. The resulting separable force is parameterized in a simple
way to allow for an easy application in other nuclear structure calculations.
