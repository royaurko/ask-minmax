A classical (or quantum) second order superintegrable system is an integrable
n-dimensional Hamiltonian system with potential that admits 2n-1 functionally
independent second order constants of the motion polynomial in the momenta, the
maximum possible. Such systems have remarkable properties: multi-integrability
and multi-separability, an algebra of higher order symmetries whose
representation theory yields spectral information about the Schroedinger
operator, deep connections with special functions and with QES systems. Here we
announce a complete classification of nondegenerate (i.e., 4-parameter)
potentials for complex Euclidean 3-space. We characterize the possible
superintegrable systems as points on an algebraic variety in 10 variables
subject to six quadratic polynomial constraints. The Euclidean group acts on
the variety such that two points determine the same superintegrable system if
and only if they lie on the same leaf of the foliation. There are exactly 10
nondegenerate potentials.
