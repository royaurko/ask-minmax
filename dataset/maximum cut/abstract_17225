We analyzed radio and X-ray observations of GRS 1915+105, between May 1995
and June 2006, focusing on the times characterized by radio flares and cycles
of hard dips-soft spikes in the X-ray lightcurve. Assuming these flares to be
discrete ejections, we applied a plasmon model to the radio data, with good
agreement with the lightcurves. We fitted a total of 687 radio flares with a
standard model of a plasmon. We found that the distribution of width is
t_0=1160 s with an rms deviation of 360 s, while that of the amplitude is
S_{max}=59 mJy with an rms deviation of 28 mJy. The distribution of width is
thus rather peaked, while that of the amplitude not.
  Regarding radio and X-ray links, this study confirms previous observations on
smaller datasets, namely that X-ray cycles of hard dips-soft spikes are always
followed by radio flares. A strong correlation is found between the length of
X-ray "dips" in the X-ray lightcurves, and the amplitude and fluence of the
subsequent radio oscillations. A model of an exponential rise of the form L_{15
GHz}(Delta t) = L_{max} (1-exp(-(Delta t - Delta t_{min})/tau) is in good
agreement with the observations, with the maximum fluence L_{max} of the order
70 Jy.s, and the characteristic time tau of the order 200-500 s. We discuss
possible physical interpretations of this correlation, regarding the nature of
the ejected material, and the physical process responsible for the ejection.
