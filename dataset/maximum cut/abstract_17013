Several past searches for gravitational waves from a selection of known
pulsars have been performed with data from the science runs of the Laser
Inferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) gravitational wave detectors.
So far these have lead to no detection, but upper limits on the gravitational
wave amplitudes have been set. Here we study our intrinsic ability to detect,
and estimate the gravitational wave amplitude for non-accreting pulsars. Using
spin-down limits on emission as a guide we examine amplitudes that would be
required to observe known pulsars with future detectors (Advanced LIGO,
Advanced Virgo and the Einstein Telescope), assuming that they are triaxial
stars emitting at precisely twice the known rotation frequency. Maximum allowed
amplitudes depend on the stars' equation of state (e.g. a normal neutron star,
a quark star, a hybrid star) and the theoretical mass quadrupoles that they can
sustain. We study what range of quadrupoles, and therefore equations of state,
would be consistent with being able to detect these sources. For globular
cluster pulsars, with spin-downs masked by accelerations within the cluster, we
examine what spin-down values gravitational wave observations would be able to
set. For all pulsars we also alternatively examine what internal magnetic
fields they would need to sustain observable ellipticities.
