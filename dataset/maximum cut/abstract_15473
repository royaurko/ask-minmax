An effective integration method based on the classical solution to the Jacobi
inversion problem, using Kleinian ultra-elliptic functions, is presented for
quasi-periodic two-phase solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation. The two-phase solutions with real quasi-periods are known to form a
two-dimensional torus, modulo a circle of complex phase factors, that can be
expressed as a ratio of theta functions. In this paper, the two-phase solutions
are explicitly parametrized in terms of the branch points on the genus-two
Riemann surface of the theta functions. Simple formulas, in terms of the
imaginary parts of the branch points, are obtained for the maximum modulus and
the minimum modulus of the two-phase solution.
