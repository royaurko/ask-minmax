We use data from the U.S. Naval Observatory fourth CCD Astrograph Catalog
(UCAC4) in combination with photometry from the AAVSO Photometric All-Sky
Survey (APASS) and Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) to identify stars within
25 pc of the Sun. A sample of nearby stars with accurate trigonometric
parallaxes from the Research Consortium On Nearby Stars (RECONS) is used to
generate a set of 16 new photometric color-$M_{K{_s}}$ relations that provide
distance estimates with uncertainties of 15\%. This work expands the available
suites of well-calibrated photometric distance relations that can be used to
identify nearby stellar systems.
  The distance relations are used with quality cuts to extract an initial
sample of stars from the UCAC4 estimated to be within 25 pc. Color, proper
motion and existing literature sources are then used to obtain a clean sample
of red dwarfs, while limiting the amount of contamination from background
giants, resulting in a sample of 1761 candidate nearby stars within 25 pc. Of
these, 339 are new discoveries with no previously known published parallax or
distance estimate, primarily with proper motions less than 0.2 arcsec/year.
Five stars are estimated to be within 10 pc, with the nearest, TYC 3980 1081 1
with V$=$ 10.50, estimated to be at 5.93 pc. That several hundred new stars
have been revealed so close to the Sun illustrates once again that there is
considerable work yet to be done to map the solar neighborhood, and that
additional nearby stars are likely still to be discovered.
