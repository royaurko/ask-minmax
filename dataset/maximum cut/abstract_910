A conjecture of Richter and Salazar about graphs that are critical for a
fixed crossing number $k$ is that they have bounded bandwidth. A weaker
well-known conjecture of Richter is that their maximum degree is bounded in
terms of $k$. In this note we disprove these conjectures for every $k\ge 171$,
by providing examples of $k$-crossing-critical graphs with arbitrarily large
maximum degree.
