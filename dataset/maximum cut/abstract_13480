The edit distance between two graphs on the same labeled vertex set is the
size of the symmetric difference of the edge sets. The edit distance function
of hereditary property, $\mathcal{H}$, is a function of $p\in[0,1]$ and is the
limit of the maximum normalized distance between a graph of density $p$ and
$\mathcal{H}$.
  This paper uses localization, for computing the edit distance function of
various hereditary properties. For any graph $H$, ${\rm Forb}(H)$ denotes the
property of not having an induced copy of $H$. We compute the edit distance
function for ${\rm Forb}(H)$, where $H$ is any so-called split graph, and the
graph $H_9$, a graph first used to describe the difficulties in computing the
edit distance function.
