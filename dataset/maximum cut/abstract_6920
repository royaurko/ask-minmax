We examine the classic problem of homogeneous nucleation and growth by
deriving and analyzing a fully discrete stochastic master equation. Upon
comparison with results obtained from the corresponding mean-field
Becker-D\"{o}ring equations we find striking differences between the two
corresponding equilibrium mean cluster concentrations. These discrepancies
depend primarily on the divisibility of the total available mass by the maximum
allowed cluster size, and the remainder. When such mass incommensurability
arises, a single remainder particle can "emulsify" or "disperse" the system by
significantly broadening the mean cluster size distribution. This finite-sized
broadening effect is periodic in the total mass of the system and can arise
even when the system size is asymptotically large, provided the ratio of the
total mass to the maximum cluster size is finite. For such finite ratios we
show that homogeneous nucleation in the limit of large, closed systems is not
accurately described by classical mean-field mass-action approaches.
