The drawbacks in the formulations of random infinite divisibility in Sandhya
(1991, 1996), Gnedenko and Korelev (1996), Klebanov and Rachev (1996), Bunge
(1996) and Kozubowski and Panorska (1996) are pointed out. For any given
Laplace transform, we conceive random (N) infinite divisibility w.r.t a class
of probability generating functions derived from the Laplace transform itself.
This formulation overcomes the said drawbacks, and the class of probability
generating functions is useful in transfer theorems for sums and maximums in
general. Generalizing the concepts of attraction (and partial attraction) in
the classical and the geometric summation setup to our formulation we show that
the domains of attraction (and partial attraction)in all these setups are same.
We also establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence to
infinitely divisible laws from that of an N-sum and conversely, that is an
analogue of Theorem.4.6.5 in Gnedenko and Korelev (1996, p.149). The role of
the divisibiltiy of N and the Laplace transform on that of this formulation is
also discussed.
