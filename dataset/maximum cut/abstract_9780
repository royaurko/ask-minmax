The paper titled "Tripartite entanglement versus tripartite nonlocality in
3-qubit GHZ-class states", (Physical Review Letters 102, 250404 (2009)), does
very important work on studying the nature of Svetlichny Inequalities (which
are Bell-type inequalities) and sheds light on some important properties and
relationship between Svetlichny inequality and tripartite entanglement. It
derives a result for the maximum expectation value of Svetlichny operator for
GGHZ and MS states. In this comment, it is put forth that there is probably a
mistake in the central result derived in the paper.
