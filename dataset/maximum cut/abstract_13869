Quasiperiodic pinning arrays, as recently demonstrated theoretically and
experimentally using a five-fold Penrose tiling, can lead to a significant
enhancement of the critical current Ic as compared to "traditional" regular
pinning arrays. However, while regular arrays showed only a sharp peak in
Ic(Phi) at the matching flux Phi1 and quasiperiodic arrays provided a much
broader maximum at Phi<Phi1, both types of pinning arrays turned out to be
inefficient for fluxes larger than Phi1. We demonstrate theoretically and
experimentally the enhancement of Ic(Phi) for Phi>Phi1 by using non-Penrose
quasiperiodic pinning arrays. This result is based on a qualitatively different
mechanism of flux pinning by quasiperiodic pinning arrays and could be
potentially useful for applications in superconducting micro-electronic devices
operating in a broad range of magnetic fields.
