In this paper we analyze the maximum entropy image deconvolution. We show
that given the Lagrange multiplier a closed form can be obtained for the image
parameters. Using this solution we are able to provide better understanding of
some of the known behavior of the maximum entropy algorithm. The solution also
yields a very efficient implementation of the maximum entropy deconvolution
technique used in the AIPS package. It requires the computation of a single
dirty image and inversion of an elementary function per pixel.
