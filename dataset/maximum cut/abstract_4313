We calculate general moments of the lepton energy spectrum in inclusive
semileptonic B -> X_c l \nu decay. Moments which allow the determination of
mb^{1S} and lambda1 with theoretical uncertainties Delta(mb^{1S}) ~ 0.04 GeV
and Delta(lambda1) ~ 0.05 GeV^2 are presented. The short distance 1S mass is
used to extract a mass parameter free of renormalon ambiguities. Moments which
are insensitive to mb and lambda1 and therefore test the size of the 1/mb^3
matrix elements and the validity of the OPE are also presented. Finally, we
give an expression for the total branching ratio with a lower cut on the lepton
energy, which allows one to eliminate a source of model dependence in current
determinations of |Vcb| from B -> X_c l \nu decay.
