Recent numerical simulations address a conjecture by Shapiro that when two
neutron stars collide head-on from rest at infinity, sufficient thermal
pressure may be generated to support the hot remnant in quasi-static
equilibrium against collapse prior to neutrino cooling. The conjecture is meant
to apply even when the total remnant mass exceeds the maximum mass of a cold
neutron star. One set of simulations seems to corroborate the conjecture, while
another, involving higher mass progenitors each very close to the maximum mass,
does not. In both cases the total mass of the remnant exceeds the maximum mass.
We point out numerical subtleties in performing such simulations when the
progenitors are near the maximum mass; they can explain why the simulations
might have difficulty assessing the conjecture in such high-mass cases.
