The dispersion laws of Langmuir and transverse waves are calculated in the
relativistic non-magnetized formalism for several isotropic particle
distributions: thermal, power-law, relativistic Lorentzian $\kappa,$ and hybrid
$\beta$. For Langmuir waves the parameters of superluminal undamped, subluminal
damped principal and higher modes are determined for a range of distribution
parameters. The undamped and principal damped modes are found to match
smoothly. Principal damped and second damped modes are found not to match
smoothly. The presence of maximum wavenumber is discovered above that no
longitudinal modes formally exist. The higher damped modes are discovered to be
qualitatively different for thermal and certain non-thermal distributions.
Consistently with the known results, the Landau damping is calculated to be
stronger for non-thermal power-law-like distributions. The dispersion law is
obtained for the single undamped transverse mode. The analytic results for the
simplest distributions are provided.
