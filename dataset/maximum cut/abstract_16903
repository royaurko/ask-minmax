CdZnTe (CZT) is a wide bandgap II-VI semiconductor developed for the
spectroscopic detection of X-rays and {\gamma}-rays at room temperature. The
Swift Burst Alert Telescope is using an 5240 cm2 array of 2 mm thick CZT
detectors for the detection of 15-150 keV X-rays from Gamma-Ray Bursts. We
report on the systematic tests of thicker (\geq 0.5 cm) CZT detectors with
volumes between 2 cm3 and 4 cm3 which are potential detector choices for a
number of future X-ray telescopes that operate in the 10 keV to a few MeV
energy range. The detectors contacted in our laboratory achieve Full Width Half
Maximum energy resolutions of 2.7 keV (4.5%) at 59 keV, 3 keV (2.5%) at 122 keV
and 4 keV (0.6%) at 662 keV. The 59 keV and 122 keV energy resolutions are
among the world-best results for \geq 0.5 cm thick CZT detectors. We use the
data set to study trends of how the energy resolution depends on the detector
thickness and on the pixel pitch. Unfortunately, we do not find clear trends,
indicating that even for the extremely good energy resolutions reported here,
the achievable energy resolutions are largely determined by the properties of
individual crystals. Somewhat surprisingly, we achieve the reported results
without applying a correction of the anode signals for the depth of the
interaction. Measuring the interaction depths thus does not seem to be a
pre-requisite for achieving sub-1% energy resolutions at 662 keV.
