Assuming that the neutrino mass matrix is diagonalized by the tribimaximal
mixing matrix, we explore the textures for the charged lepton mass matrix that
render an $U_{PMNS}$ lepton mixing matrix consistent with data. In particular
we are interested in finding the textures with the maximum number of zeros. We
explore the cases of real matrices with three and four zeros and find that only
ten matrices with three zeros provide solutions in agreement with data. We
present the successful Yukawa textures including the relative sizes of their
non-zero entries as well as some new and interesting relations among the
entries of these textures in terms of the charged lepton masses. We also show
that these relations can be obtained directly from a parametrization of the
charged lepton mixing matrix $U_l$.
