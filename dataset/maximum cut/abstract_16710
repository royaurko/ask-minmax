The magnetic properties of superconducting Ru1-xSr2GdCu2O8 (x=0, 0.02) and
non-superconducting RuSr2Gd1-xCexCu2O8 (x=0.07, 0.1) were investigated by means
of magnetocaloric experiments with complementary magnetoresistivity and ac
susceptibility measurements. The isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient M_{T}(B)
assumes positive values in a broad range of temperatures (20K<T<231 K) and
magnetic fields (0<B<13 T), i.e. also in the magnetically ordered state
(T_{m}=132 K for RuSr2GdCu2O8 and T_{m}=150 K for RuSr2Gd0.93Ce0.07Cu2O8),
which indicates no gain in the system's magnetic entropy with increasing
magnetic field. The maximum in the M_{T}(B) dependence was observed for
RuSr2GdCu2O8 in a temperature vicinity of T_{m}, which indicates a
ferromagnetic character of the accessed magnetic correlations. No spontaneous
ferromagnetic order was revealed as the M_{T} assumes limiting zero values at
zero magnetic field for the whole range of investigated temperatures.
Temperature dependencies of the specific heat reveal the magnetic-field-induced
positive temperature shift of the anomaly associated with the magnetic
transition in the Ru spin system. The M_{T}(B) dependencies and the
magnetoresistivity data suggest that the magnetic system may be inhomogeneous.
