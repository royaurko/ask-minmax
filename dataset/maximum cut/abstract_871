The collisional thick target model, wherein a large number of electrons are
accelerated down a flaring loop, can be used to explain many observed
properties of solar flares. In this study, we focus on the sensitivity of GOES
flare classification to the properties of the thick target model. Using a
hydrodynamic model with RHESSI-derived electron beam parameters, we explore the
effects of the beam energy flux (or total non-thermal energy), the cut-off
energy, and the spectral index of the electron distribution on the soft X-rays
(SXRs) observed by GOES. We conclude that (1) the GOES class is proportional to
the non-thermal energy $E^{\alpha}$ for $\alpha \approx 1.7$ in the low energy
passband (1-8 \AA) and $\approx 1.6$ in the high energy passband (0.5-4 \AA);
(2) the GOES class is only weakly dependent on the spectral index in both
passbands; (3) increases in the cut-off will increase the flux in the 0.5-4
\AA\ passband, but decrease the flux in the 1-8 \AA\ passband, while decreases
in the cut-off will cause a decrease in the 0.5-4 \AA\ passband and a slight
increase in the 1-8 \AA\ passband.
