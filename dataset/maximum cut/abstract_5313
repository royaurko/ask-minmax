Girard's Light linear logic (LLL) characterized polynomial time in the
proof-as-program paradigm with a bound on cut elimination. This logic relied on
a stratification principle and a "one-door" principle which were generalized
later respectively in the systems L^4 and L^3a. Each system was brought with
its own complex proof of Ptime soundness.
  In this paper we propose a broad sufficient criterion for Ptime soundness for
linear logic subsystems, based on the study of paths inside the proof-nets,
which factorizes proofs of soundness of existing systems and may be used for
future systems. As an additional gain, our bound stands for any reduction
strategy whereas most bounds in the literature only stand for a particular
strategy.
