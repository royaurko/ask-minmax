We have compiled and analyzed historical Korean meteor and meteor shower
records in three Korean official history books, Samguksagi which covers the
three Kingdoms period (57 B.C -- A.D. 935), Goryeosa of Goryeo dynasty (A.D.
918 -- 1392), and Joseonwangjosillok of Joseon dynasty (A.D. 1392 -- 1910). We
have found 3861 meteor and 31 meteor shower records. We have confirmed the
peaks of Perseids and an excess due to the mixture of Orionids, north-Taurids,
or Leonids through the Monte-Carlo test. The peaks persist from the period of
Goryeo dynasty to that of Joseon dynasty, for almost one thousand years. Korean
records show a decrease of Perseids activity and an increase of
Orionids/north-Taurids/Leonids activity. We have also analyzed seasonal
variation of sporadic meteors from Korean records. We confirm the seasonal
variation of sporadic meteors from the records of Joseon dynasty with the
maximum number of events being roughly 1.7 times the minimum. The Korean
records are compared with Chinese and Japanese records for the same periods.
Major features in Chinese meteor shower records are quite consistent with those
of Korean records, particularly for the last millennium. Japanese records also
show Perseids feature and Orionids/north-Taurids/Leonids feature, although they
are less prominent compared to those of Korean or Chinese records.
