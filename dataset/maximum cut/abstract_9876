This study proposes a robust estimator for stochastic frontier models by
integrating the idea of Basu et al. [1998, Biometrika 85, 549-559] into such
models. We verify that the suggested estimator is strongly consistent and
asymptotic normal under regularity conditions and investigate robust
properties. We use a simulation study to demonstrate that the estimator has
strong robust properties with little loss in asymptotic efficiency relative to
the maximum likelihood estimator. A real data analysis is performed for
illustrating the use of the estimator.
