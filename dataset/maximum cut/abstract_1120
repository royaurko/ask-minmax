Contact interactions always lead to attractive behaviour. Arguments are
presented to show why a repulsive interacting system, e.g. Bose gases, cannot
be described by contact interactions and corresponding treatments are possibly
obscured by the appearance of bound states. The usually used cut-offs are
identified as finite range parameters.
