In order to study the distribution of gas and ionizing radiation around eta
Car and their implications for its likely companion star, we have examined
high-excitation emission lines of [Ne III], [Fe III], etc., in spectra obtained
with the HST/STIS instrument during 1998-2004. Our principal results, some of
them unexpected, are: (1) The high-excitation fluxes varied systematically and
non-trivially throughout eta Car's 5.5-year spectroscopic cycle. Instead of
rising to a plateau after the 1998 "event," they changed continuously with a
maximum in mid-cycle. (2) At one significant location a brief, strong secondary
maximum occurred just before the 2003.5 spectroscopic event. (3) These emission
lines are strongly concentrated at the "Weigelt knots" several hundred AU
northwest of the star. With less certainty, [Ne III] appears to be somewhat
more concentrated than [Fe III]. (4) A faster, blue-shifted component of each
feature appears concentrated near the star and elongated perpendicular to the
system's bipolar axis. This structure may be related to the equatorial outflow
and/or to dense material known to exist along our line of sight to the star.
(5) Using the photoionization program Cloudy, we estimated the range of
parameters for the hot secondary star that would give satisfactory
high-excitation line ratios in the ejecta. Teff = 39000 K and L = 400000 Lsun,
for example, would be satisfactory. The allowed region in parameter space is
wider (and mostly less luminous) than some previous contributors suggested.
