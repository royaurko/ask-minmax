A first comparison has been made between the pulse-shape discrimination
characteristics of a novel $^{4}$He-based pressurized scintillation detector
and a NE-213 liquid-scintillator reference detector using an Am/Be mixed-field
neutron and gamma-ray source and a high-resolution scintillation-pulse
digitizer. In particular, the capabilities of the two fast neutron detectors to
discriminate between neutrons and gamma-rays were investigated. The NE-213
liquid-scintillator reference cell produced a wide range of scintillation-light
yields in response to the gamma-ray field of the source. In stark contrast, due
to the size and pressure of the $^{4}$He gas volume, the $^{4}$He-based
detector registered a maximum scintillation-light yield of 750~keV$_{ee}$ to
the same gamma-ray field. Pulse-shape discrimination for particles with
scintillation-light yields of more than 750~keV$_{ee}$ was excellent in the
case of the $^{4}$He-based detector. Above 750~keV$_{ee}$ its signal was
unambiguously neutron, enabling particle identification based entirely upon the
amount of scintillation light produced.
