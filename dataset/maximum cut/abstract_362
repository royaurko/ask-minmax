A new kind of cut diagram is introduced to sum Feynman diagrams with
nonabelian vertices. Unlike the Cutkosky diagrams which compute the
discontinuity of single Feynman diagrams, the nonabelian cut diagrams represent
a resummation of both the real and the imaginary parts of Feynman diagrams
related by permutations. Several applications of the technique are reported,
including a resolution of the apparent inconsistency of the baryon problem in
large-$N_c$ QCD, a simplified calculation of high-energy low-order QCD
diagrams, and progress made with this technique on the unitarization of the
BFKL equation.
