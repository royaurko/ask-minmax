The need to estimate smooth probability distributions (a.k.a. probability
densities) from finite sampled data is ubiquitous in science. Many approaches
to this problem have been described, but none is yet regarded as providing a
definitive solution. Maximum entropy estimation and Bayesian field theory are
two such approaches. Both have origins in statistical physics, but the
relationship between them has remained unclear. Here I unify these two methods
by showing that every maximum entropy density estimate can be recovered in the
infinite smoothness limit of an appropriate Bayesian field theory. I also show
that Bayesian field theory estimation can be performed without imposing any
boundary conditions on candidate densities, and that the infinite smoothness
limit of these theories recovers the most common types of maximum entropy
estimates. Bayesian field theory is thus seen to provide a natural test of the
validity of the maximum entropy null hypothesis. Bayesian field theory also
returns a lower entropy density estimate when the maximum entropy hypothesis is
falsified. The computations necessary for this approach can be performed
rapidly for one-dimensional data, and software for doing this is provided.
Based on these results, I argue that Bayesian field theory is poised to provide
a definitive solution to the density estimation problem in one dimension.
