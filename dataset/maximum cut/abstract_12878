On a laboratory-scale testing platform of impinging entrained-flow gasifier
with four opposed burners, the flame images for diesel combustion and
gasification process were measured with a single charge coupled device (CCD)
camera. The two-dimensional multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis was
employed to investigate the multifractal nature of the flame images. Sound
power-law scaling in the annealed average of detrended fluctuations was
unveiled when the order $q>0$ and the multifractal feature of flame images were
confirmed. Further analyses identified two multifractal parameters, the minimum
and maximum singularity $\alpha_{\min}$ and $\alpha_{\max}$, serving as
characteristic parameters of the multifractal flames. These two characteristic
multifractal parameters vary with respect to different experimental conditions.
