We investigate the transfer function of the discretized perfect lens in
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and transfer matrix (TMM) simulations; the
latter allow to eliminate the problems associated with the explicit time
dependence in FDTD simulations. We argue that the peak observed in the FDTD
transfer function near the maximum parallel momentum $k_{\|,\mathrm{max}}$ is
due to finite time artifacts. We also find the finite discretization mesh acts
like imaginary deviations from $\mu=\epsilon=-1$ and leads to a cross-over in
the transfer function from constance to exponential decay around
$k_{\|,\mathrm{max}}$ limiting the attainable super-resolution. We propose a
simple qualitative model to describe the impact of the discretization.
$k_{\|,\mathrm{max}}$ is found to depend logarithmically on the mesh constant
in qualitative agreement with the TMM simulations.
