Water and ice Cherenkov telescopes of the present and future aim for the
detection of a neutrino signal from extraterrestrial sources at energies E>PeV.
Some of the most promising extragalactic sources are Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN). In this paper, the neutrino flux from two kinds of AGN sources will be
estimated assuming photohadronic interactions in the jet of the AGN. The first
analyzed sample contains FR-II radio galaxies while the second AGN type
examined are blazars. The result is highly dependent on the proton's index of
the energy spectrum. To normalize the spectrum, the connection between neutrino
and disk luminosity will be used by applying the jet-disk symbiosis model from
Falcke and Biermann (1995). The maximum proton energy and thus, also the
maximum neutrino energy of the source is connected to its disk luminosity,
which was shown by Lovelace (1976) and was confirmed by Falcke et al. (1995).
