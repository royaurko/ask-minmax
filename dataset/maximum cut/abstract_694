By identifying a family of corner cutting schemes as a dimension elevation
process of Gelfond-Bezier curves, we give a Muntz type condition for the
convergence of the generated control polygons to the underlying curve. The
surprising emergence of the Muntz condition in the problem raises the question
of a possible connection between the density questions of nested Chebyshev
spaces and the convergence of the corresponding dimension elevation algorithms.
