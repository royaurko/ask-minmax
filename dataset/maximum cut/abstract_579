SUSY events in which a light stop decays to a chargino may manage to pass the
cuts designed for top counting experiments at the Tevatron with no significant
diminution of signal. Events in which a top decays via stop are detected with
fair efficiency compared to SM top events when $\stop\into b\wino$. More
importantly, direct pair production of light stops contributes significantly to
the cut samples. Many SUSY models with stops lighter than 100 GeV are viable
even for $\Gamma(t\into\stop) \approx \Gamma(t\into bW)$.
