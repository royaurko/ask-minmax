In this work, two different methods for extracting the mass of a new quark
from the (pseudo) data are compared: the classical cut-based method and the
matrix element method. As a concrete example a fourth family up type quark is
searched in p-p collisions of 7 TeV center of mass energy. We have shown that
even with very small number of events, Matrix Element Method gives better
estimations for the mass value and its error, especially for event samples in
which Signal to Background ratio is greater than 0.2.
