We report the use of an optical interference holographic setup with a
five-beam configuration, consisting of four side beams and one central beam
from the same half space, to fabricate woodpile and diamond structures for the
use as photonic bandgap materials in which electromagnetic waves are forbidden
in the bandgap. By exploiting the advantage of the binarization of the
interference pattern, using intensity cut-off, either linear or circular
central beam can be used. More importantly, the beam configurations can be
easily implemented experimentally as compared to other configurations in which
the interfering beams are counter-propagating from both half spaces.
