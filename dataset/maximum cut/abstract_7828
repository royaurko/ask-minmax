We revisit the state of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect measurements
in light of newly available data and address criticisms about the measurements
which have recently been raised. We update the data set previously assembled by
Giannantonio et al. to include new data releases for both the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) and the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. We find
that our updated results are consistent with previous measurements. By fitting
a single template amplitude, we now obtain a combined significance of the ISW
detection at the 4.4 sigma level, which fluctuates by 0.4 sigma when
alternative data cuts and analysis assumptions are considered. We also make new
tests for systematic contaminations of the data, focusing in particular on the
issues raised by Sawangwit et al. Amongst them, we address the rotation test,
which aims at checking for possible systematics by correlating pairs of
randomly rotated maps. We find results consistent with the expected data
covariance, no evidence for enhanced correlation on any preferred axis of
rotation, and therefore no indication of any additional systematic
contamination. We publicly release the results, the covariance matrix, and the
sky maps used to obtain them.
