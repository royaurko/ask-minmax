A new EAS Cherenkov light array, Tunka-133, with ~1 km^2 geometrical area has
been installed at the Tunka Valley (50 km from Lake Baikal) in 2009. The array
permits a detailed study of cosmic ray energy spectrum and mass composition in
the energy range 10^16 - 10^18 eV with a uniform method. We describe the array
construction, DAQ and methods of the array calibration.The method of energy
reconstruction and absolute calibration of measurements are discussed. The
analysis of spatial and time structure of EAS Cherenkov light allows to
estimate the depth of the EAS maximum X_max. The results on the all particles
energy spectrum and the mean depth of the EAS maximum X_max vs. primary energy
derived from the data of two winter seasons (2009 -- 2011), are presented.
Preliminary results of joint operation of the Cherenkov array with antennas for
detection of EAS radio signals are shown. Plans for future upgrades --
deployment of remote clusters, radioantennas and a scintillator detector
network and a prototype of the HiSCORE gamma-telescope -- are discussed.
