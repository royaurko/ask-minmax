In this work we consider the renormalization of the chiral two-pion exchange
potential with explicit delta-excitations for nucleon-nucleon scattering at
next-to-leading (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO). Due to the
singular nature of the chiral potentials, correlations between different
partial waves are generated. In particular we show that two-body scattering by
a short distance power like singular attractive interaction can be renormalized
in all partial waves with a single counterterm, provided the singularities are
identical. A parallel statement holds in the presence of tensor interactions
when the eigenpotentials in the coupled channel problem also coincide. While
this construction reduces the total number of counterterms to eleven in the
case of nucleon-nucleon scattering with chiral two-pion exchange interactions
with delta degrees of freedom, the differences in the scattering phases as
compared to the case with the uncorrelated partial wave renormalization become
smaller as the angular momentum is increased in the elastic scattering region.
