Digital image correlation of laser-ablated platinum nanoparticles on the
surface of a polycrystalline metal (nickel-based superalloy Rene 88DT) was used
to obtain the local strain behavior from an in situ scanning electron
microscope tensile experiment at room temperature. By fusing this information
with crystallographic orientations from EBSD, a subsequent analysis shows that
the average maximum shear strain tends to increase with increasing Schmid
factor. Additionally, the range of the extreme values for the maximum shear
strain also increases closer to the grain boundary, signifying that grain
boundaries and triple junctions accumulate plasticity at strains just beyond
yield in polycrystalline Rene 88DT. In situ experiments illuminating
microstructure-property relationships of this ilk may be important for
understanding damage nucleation in polycrystalline metals at high temperatures.
