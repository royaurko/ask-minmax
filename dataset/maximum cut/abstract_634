We develop the regularity theory of the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann
equation with cut-off and hard potentials (for instance, hard spheres), by (i)
revisiting the Lp-theory to obtain constructive bounds, (ii) establishing
propagation of smoothness and singularities, (iii) obtaining estimates about
the decay of the sin- gularities of the initial datum. Our proofs are based on
a detailed study of the "regularity of the gain operator". An application to
the long-time behavior is presented.
