We present a new strategy to uncover light, quasi-degenerate Higgsinos, a
likely ingredient in a natural supersymmetric model. Our strategy focuses on
Higgsinos with inter-state splittings of O(5-50) GeV that are produced in
association with a hard, initial state jet and decay via off-shell gauge bosons
to two or more leptons and missing energy, $pp \to j + \text{MET}\, + 2^+\,
\ell$. The additional jet is used for triggering, allowing us to significantly
loosen the lepton requirements and gain sensitivity to small inter-Higgsino
splittings. Focusing on the two-lepton signal, we find the seemingly large
backgrounds from diboson plus jet, $\bar tt$ and $Z/\gamma^* + j$ can be
reduced with careful cuts, and that fake backgrounds appear minor. For Higgsino
masses $m_{\chi}$ just above the current LEP II bound ($\mu \simeq 110\,$) GeV
we find the significance can be as high as 3 sigma at the LHC using the
existing 20 fb$^{-1}$ of 8 TeV data. Extrapolating to LHC at 14 TeV with 100
fb$^{-1}$ data, and as one example $M_1 = M_2 = 500$ GeV, we find 5 sigma
evidence for $m_{\chi} \lesssim\, 140\,$ GeV and 2 sigma evidence for $m_{\chi}
\lesssim\, 200\,$ GeV . We also present a reinterpretation of ATLAS/CMS monojet
bounds in terms of degenerate Higgsino ($\delta m_{\chi} \ll 5\,$) GeV plus jet
production. We find the current monojet bounds on $m_{\chi}$ are no better than
the chargino bounds from LEP II.
