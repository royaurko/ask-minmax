This article reports nine Solar Energetic Particle events detected by the
instrument NINA between October 1998 and April 1999. NINA is a silicon-based
particle detector mounted on-board the Russian satellite Resurs-01-N4, which
has flown at an altitude of about 800 km in polar inclination since July 1998.
For every solar event the power-law He4 spectrum across the energy interval
10--50 MeV/n was reconstructed, and spectral indexes, gamma, from 1.8 to 6.8
extracted. Data of He3 and He4 were used to determine the He3/He4 ratio, that
for some SEP events indicated an enrichment in He3. For the 1998 November 7
event the ratio reached a maximum value of 0.33+- 0.06, with spectral indexes
of gamma = 2.5 +- 0.6 and gamma = 3.7 +- 0.3 for He3 and He4, respectively. The
He3/He4 ratio averaged over the remaining events was 0.011 +- 0.004. For all
events the deuterium-to-proton ratio was determined. The average value over all
events was (3.9+-1.4) 10^{-5} across the energy interval 9--12 MeV/n. For one
event (1998 November 24) this ratio yielded approximately 10 times higher than
normal coronal values. Upper limits on the H3/H1 counting ratio for all events
were determined. For the 1998 November 14 SEP event the high flux of heavy
particles detected made it possible to reconstruct the carbon and oxygen flux.
