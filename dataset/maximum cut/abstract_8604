An approximation to Einstein's field equations in Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM)
canonical formalism is presented which corresponds to the magneto-hydrodynamics
(MHD) approximation in electrodynamics. It results in coupled elliptic
equations which represent the maximum of elliptic-type structure of Einstein's
theory and naturally generalizes previous conformal-flat truncations of the
theory. The Hamiltonian, in this approximation, is identical with the
non-dissipative part of the Einsteinian one through the third post-Newtonian
order. The proposed scheme, where stationary spacetimes are exactly reproduced,
should be useful to construct {\em realistic} initial data for general
relativistic simulations as well as to model astrophysical scenarios, where
gravitational radiation reaction can be neglected.
