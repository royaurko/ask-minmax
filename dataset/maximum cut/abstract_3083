This letter derives the asymptotic symbol error rate (SER) and outage
probability of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) maximum ratio combining
(MRC) systems. We consider Rayleigh fading channels with both transmit and
receive spatial correlation. Our results are based on new asymptotic
expressions which we derive for the p.d.f. and c.d.f. of the maximum eigenvalue
of positive-definite quadratic forms in complex Gaussian matrices. We prove
that spatial correlation does not affect the diversity order, but that it
reduces the array gain and hence increases the SER in the high SNR regime.
