We study monopoles and vortices in SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a 24**4
lattice at beta=2.50. We find a value of fundamental string tension from
monopoles in the maximum Abelian gauge consistent with the full SU(2) value.
Using direct and indirect center gauges, we find fundamental string tension
values from P-vortices which are larger than the full SU(2) result. After a
single cooling sweep, the string tensions from monopoles and P-vortices are all
30% lower than the full SU(2) value, while the U(1) string tension in the
maximum Abelian gauge remains consistent with the full SU(2) result. Blocking
the lattice after cooling does not restore the low values of string tension
found with monopoles and vortices.
