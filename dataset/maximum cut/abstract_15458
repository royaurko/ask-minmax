This paper is split into three parts. In part I, we microscopically derive
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory from BCS theory for translation-invariant systems
in which multiple types of superconductivity may coexist. Our motivation are
unconventional superconductors. We allow the ground state of the effective gap
operator $K_{T_c}+V$ to be $n$-fold degenerate and the resulting GL energy then
couples $n$ order parameters. In part II, we study the microscopically derived
GL theories for spherically symmetric $V$ in some exemplary cases: (a) pure
$d$-wave order parameters and (b) mixed $(s+d)$-wave order parameters, in two
and three dimensions. In part III, we present explicit choices of spherically
symmetric $V$ which can produce ground state sectors of $K_{T_c}+V$ of
arbitrary angular momentum, for open sets of parameter values. This is in stark
contrast with the Schr\"odinger case $-\nabla^2+V$, in which the ground state
is always non-degenerate. Along the way, we prove the following fact about
Bessel functions: At its first maximum, a half-integer Bessel function is
strictly larger than all other half-integer Bessel functions.
