CU Vir and V901 Ori belong among these few magnetic chemically peculiar stars
whose rotation periods vary on timescales of decades. We aim to study the
stability of the periods in CU Vir and V901 Ori using all accessible
observational data containing phase information. We collected all available
relevant archived observations supplemented with our new measurements of these
stars and analysed the period variations of the stars using a novel method that
allows for the combination of data of diverse sorts. We found that the shapes
of their phase curves were constant, while the periods were changing. Both
stars exhibit alternating intervals of rotational braking and acceleration. The
rotation period of CU Vir was gradually shortening until the year 1968, when it
reached its local minimum of 0.52067198 d. The period then started increasing,
reaching its local maximum of 0.5207163 d in the year 2005. Since that time the
rotation has begun to accelerate again. We also found much smaller period
changes in CU Vir on a timescale of several years. The rotation period of V901
Ori was increasing for the past quarter-century, reaching a maximum of 1.538771
d in the year 2003, when the rotation period began to decrease. A theoretically
unexpected alternating variability of rotation periods in these stars would
remove the spin-down time paradox and brings a new insight into structure and
evolution of magnetic upper-main-sequence stars.
