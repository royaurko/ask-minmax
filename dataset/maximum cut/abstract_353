Some puzzles which arise in matrix models with multiple cuts are presented.
They are present in the smoothed eigenvalue correlators of these models. First
a method is described to calculate smoothed eigenvalue correlators in random
matrix models with eigenvalues distributed in a single-cut, previous known
results are reproduced. The method is extended to symmetric two-cut random
matrix models. The correlators are written in a form suitable for application
to mesoscopic systems. Connections are made with the smooth correlators derived
using the Orthogonal Polynomial (OP) method. A few interesting observations are
made regarding even and odd density-density correlators and cross-over
correlators in $Z_2$ symmetric random matrix models.
