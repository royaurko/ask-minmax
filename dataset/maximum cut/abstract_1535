Background: Heavy atomic nuclei are often described using the
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) method. In principle, this approach takes into
account Pauli effects and pairing correlations while other correlation effects
are mimicked through the use of effective density-dependent interactions.
  Purpose: Investigate the influence of higher order correlation effects on
nuclear binding energies using Skyrme's effective interaction.
  Methods: A cut-off in relative momenta is introduced in order to remove
ultraviolet divergences caused by the zero-range character of the interaction.
Corrections to binding energies are then calculated using the
quasiparticle-random-phase approximation (QRPA) and second order many-body
perturbation theory (MBPT2).
  Result: Contributions to the correlation energies are evaluated for several
isotopic chains and an attempt is made to disentangle which parts give rise to
fluctuations that may be difficult to incorporate on the HFB level. The
dependence of the results on the cut-off is also investigated.
  Conclusions: The improved interaction allows explicit summations of
perturbation series which is useful for the description of some nuclear
observables. However, refits of the interaction parameters are needed to obtain
more quantitative results.
