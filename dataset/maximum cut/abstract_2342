The spectrum of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Quantum Mechanics (SYMQM) in D=4
dimensions for SU(2) gauge group is computed for a maximal number of bosonic
quanta $B\le60$ in the two-fermion sector with the angular momentum $j=0$. We
analyse the eigenfunctions of discrete and continuous spectra, test the scaling
relation for the continuous spectrum and confirm the dispersion relation to
high accuracy.
