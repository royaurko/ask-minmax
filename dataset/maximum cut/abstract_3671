A solid object can be coated by a nonwetting liquid since a receding contact
line cannot exceed a critical speed. We theoretically investigate this forced
wetting transition for axisymmetric menisci on fibers of varying radii. First,
we use a matched asymptotic expansion and derive the maximum speed of
dewetting. For all radii we find the maximum speed occurs at vanishing apparent
contact angle. To further investigate the transition we numerically determine
the bifurcation diagram for steady menisci. It is found that the meniscus
profiles on thick fibers are smooth, even when there is a film deposited
between the bath and the contact line, while profiles on thin fibers exhibit
strong oscillations. We discuss how this could lead to different experimental
scenarios of film deposition.
