We study the properties of the Green's functions of the fermions in the
extremal charged dilatonic black hole proposed by Gubser and Rocha [Phys. Rev.
D \textbf{81}, 046001 (2010)]. We find that many properties seem to be in
agreement with that of Fermi liquid. Especially, the dispersion relation is
linear. It is very different from that found in the extremal
Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m (RN) black hole for massless fermion, which is
obviously non-Fermi liquid due to a nonlinear dispersion relation. However, for
another scaling behavior of the height of $ImG_{11}$ at the maximum, the
scaling exponent is not one, which is at odds with that found in the RN black
hole.
