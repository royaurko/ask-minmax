The intrinsic Josephson effect in the high-Tc superconductors is studied
using the layered two-dimensional t-J model. The d.c.Josephson current which
flows perpendicular to the t-J planes is obtained within the mean-field
approximation and the Gutzwiller approximation. We find that the Josephson
current has its maximum near the optimum doping region as a function of the
doping rate.
