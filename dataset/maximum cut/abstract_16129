Terminal wind velocity and mass loss rate are the most fundamental parameters
of stellar winds. Unfortunately, their determination calls for high resolution
spectroscopy in a range of wavelengths spanning from the ultraviolet to the
infrared. For weak and/or distant objects, this becomes unfeasible.
Nevertheless, it is possible to obtain an accurate estimate of these parameters
through a simplified study of the formation processes of resonant lines which
show P Cyg profiles. In this case, the line profile is a complex function of 6
parameters, with the radiative transport treatment becoming relatively
inexpensive. However, preforming a 6 dimensional parameter fit raises a number
of problems if one seeks an objective and automatic procedure to yield the
optimal values, from which wind velocities and mass loss rates can be
estimated.
  Useing a Likelihood function to construct a well defined statistical
estimator of the goodness of fit which corresponds to a given model, we turn to
a genetic algorithm through which we find the global maximum of the 6
dimensional Likelihood hyper-surface. We here present the implementation of the
method, its successful testing with synthetic line profiles, where the answer
is known in advance, together with first results of its application to real
data
