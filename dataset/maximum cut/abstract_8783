This article gives an overview of the developments in controlled diffusion
processes, emphasizing key results regarding existence of optimal controls and
their characterization via dynamic programming for a variety of cost criteria
and structural assumptions. Stochastic maximum principle and control under
partial observations (equivalently, control of nonlinear filters) are also
discussed. Several other related topics are briefly sketched.
