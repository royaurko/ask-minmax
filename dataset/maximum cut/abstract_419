We show how Feynman diagrams may be evaluated to take advantage of recent
developments in the application of Cutkosky rules to the calculation of
one-loop amplitudes. A sample calculation of gg->gH, previously calculated by
Ellis et al., is presented illustrating this equivalence. This example
demonstrates the use of cutting rules for massive amplitudes.
