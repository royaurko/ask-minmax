Even a cursory inspection of the Hodge plot associated with Calabi-Yau
threefolds that are hypersurfaces in toric varieties reveals striking
structures. These patterns correspond to webs of elliptic-K3 fibrations whose
mirror images are also elliptic-K3 fibrations. Such manifolds arise from
reflexive polytopes that can be cut into two parts along slices corresponding
to the K3 fibers. Any two half-polytopes over a given slice can be combined
into a reflexive polytope. This fact, together with a remarkable relation on
the additivity of Hodge numbers, explains much of the structure of the observed
patterns.
