Error exponents characterize the exponential decay, when increasing message
length, of the probability of error of many error-correcting codes. To tackle
the long standing problem of computing them exactly, we introduce a general,
thermodynamic, formalism that we illustrate with maximum-likelihood decoding of
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes on the binary erasure channel (BEC) and
the binary symmetric channel (BSC). In this formalism, we apply the cavity
method for large deviations to derive expressions for both the average and
typical error exponents, which differ by the procedure used to select the codes
from specified ensembles. When decreasing the noise intensity, we find that two
phase transitions take place, at two different levels: a glass to ferromagnetic
transition in the space of codewords, and a paramagnetic to glass transition in
the space of codes.
