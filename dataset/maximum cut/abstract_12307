The neutrino experiment KARMEN at the beam stop neutrino source ISIS
investigates the oscillation channel numubar->nuebar in the appearance mode by
looking for p(nuebar,e+)n reactions. An analysis of data collected from
February 1997 through March 2000 with the KARMEN2 experimental setup reveals 11
candidate events in good agreement with the background expectation of 12.3+-0.6
events. Hence, there is no indication of an oscillation signal. A maximum
likelihood analysis of the data leads to an upper limit (at 90% confidence
level) for the mixing angle of sin^2(2theta) < 1.3x10^-3 at large Dm^2 and Dm^2
< 0.049 eV^2 for sin^2(2theta)=1. The anomaly in the time spectrum of events
induced by nue and numubar seen in the KARMEN1 data could not be confirmed with
the KARMEN2 data.
