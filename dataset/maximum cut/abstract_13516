The aim of this paper is to refine some results concerning the blow-up of
solutions of the exponential reaction-diffusion equation. We consider solutions
that blow-up in finite time, but continue to exist as weak solutions beyond the
blow-up time. The main result is that these solutions become regular
immediately after the blow-up time. This result improves on that of Fila,
Matano and Pol\'acik, who consider radially nonincreasing solutions, whereas no
such assumption is needed here. Under certain additional assumptions we also
obtain that the regularization is asymptotically selfsimilar.
  Moreover, we consider the question of blow-up rate for radial solutions of
the two-dimensional problem and prove that the blow-up is of type I, provided
that the maximum of the solution is attained at the origin.
