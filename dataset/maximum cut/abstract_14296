NdFeAsO0.88F0.12 belongs to the recently discovered family of high-TC
iron-based superconductors. The influence of high pressure on transport
properties of this material has been studied. Contrary to La-based compounds,
we did not observe a maximum in TC under pressure. Under compression, TC drops
rapidly as a linear function of pressure with the slope k = -2.8 \pm 0.1 K /
GPa. The extrapolated value of TC at zero pressure is about TC (0) = 51.7 \pm
0.4 K. At pressures higher than ~18.4 GPa, the superconducting state disappears
at all measured temperatures. The resistance changes slope and shows a turn-up
behavior, which may be related to the Kondo effect or a weak localization of
two-dimensional carriers below ~45 K that is above TC and thus competing with
the superconducting phase. The behavior of the sample is completely reversible
at the decompression. On the bases of our experimental data, we propose a
tentative P-T phase diagram of NdFeAsO0.88F0.12.
