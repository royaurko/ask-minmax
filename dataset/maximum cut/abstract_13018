We present point-contact spectroscopy data for junctions between a normal
metal and the newly discovered F-doped superconductor
LaO$_{0.9}$F$_{0.1-\delta}$FeAs (F-LaOFeAs). A zero-bias conductance peak was
observed and its shape and magnitude suggests the presence of Andreev bound
states at the surface of F-LaOFeAs, which provides a possible evidence of an
unconventional pairing symmetry with a nodal gap function. The maximum gap
value $\Delta_0\approx3.9\pm0.7$meV was determined from the measured spectra,
in good agreement with the recent experiments on specific heat and lower
critical field.
