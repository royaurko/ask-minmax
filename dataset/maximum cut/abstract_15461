The concept of monochromatic connectivity was introduced by Caro and Yuster.
A path in an edge-colored graph is called a \emph{monochromatic path} if all
the edges on the path are colored the same. An edge-coloring of $G$ is a
\emph{monochromatic connection coloring} ($MC$-coloring, for short) if there is
a monochromatic path joining any two vertices in $G$. The \emph{monochromatic
connection number}, denoted by $mc(G)$, is defined to be the maximum number of
colors used in an $MC$-coloring of a graph $G$. In this paper, we study the
monochromatic connection number on the lexicographical, strong, Cartesian and
direct product and present several upper and lower bounds for these products of
graphs.
