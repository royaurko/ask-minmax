A lattice-gas cellular automaton (LGCA) model is used to simulate rippling
and aggregation in myxobacteria. An efficient way of representing cells of
different cell size, shape and orientation is presented that may be easily
extended to model later stages of fruiting body formation. This LGCA model is
designed to investigate whether a refractory period, a minimum response time, a
maximum oscillation period and non-linear dependence of reversals of cells on
C-factor are necessary assumptions for rippling. It is shown that a refractory
period of 2-3 minutes, a minimum response time of up to 1 minute and no maximum
oscillation period best reproduce rippling in the experiments of {\it
Myxoccoccus xanthus}. Non-linear dependence of reversals on C-factor is
critical at high cell density. Quantitative simulations demonstrate that the
increase in wavelength of ripples when a culture is diluted with non-signaling
cells can be explained entirely by the decreased density of C-signaling cells.
This result further supports the hypothesis that levels of C-signaling
quantitatively depend on and modulate cell density. Analysis of the
interpenetrating high density waves shows the presence of a phase shift
analogous to the phase shift of interpenetrating solitons. Finally, a model for
swarming, aggregation and early fruiting body formation is presented.
