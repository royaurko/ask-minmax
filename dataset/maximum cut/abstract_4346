We report the OPE-based predictions for a number of lepton energy and
hadronic mass moments in the inclusive semileptonic B -> X_c \ell\nu decays
with a lower cut on the charged lepton energy. We rely on the direct OPE
approach where no expansion in the charm mass is employed and the theoretical
input is a limited set of underlying OPE parameters including m_b and m_c. A
Wilsonian treatment with a `hard' cutoff is applied using running low-scale
masses m_Q(\mu) and kinetic expectation value \mu_\pi^2(\mu). This leaves for
perturbative corrections only genuinely short-distance effects and makes them
numerically small. Predictions are also given for the modified hadronic moments
of the kinematic variable \cal N_X^2 which is a combination of M_X^2 and E_X.
Measurement of such moments would allow a more reliable extraction of
higher-order nonperturbative heavy quark parameters from experiment.
