The relative sidereal variation in the arrival direction of primary cosmic
ray nuclei of median energy 10 TeV was measured using downward, through-going
muons detected with the Super-Kamiokande-I detector. The projection of the
anisotropy map onto the right ascension axis has a first harmonic amplitude of
$(6.64 \pm 0.98 {stat.} \pm 0.55 {syst.}) \times 10^{-4}$ and a phase at
maximum at $(33.2^\circ \pm 8.2^\circ {stat.} \pm 5.1^\circ {syst.})$ right
ascension. A sky map in equatorial coordinates indicates an excess region in
the constellation of Taurus and a deficit region toward Virgo. The excess
region is centered at $(\alpha_T, \delta_T) = (75^\circ \pm 7^\circ, -5^\circ
\pm 9^\circ)$ with a half opening angle $\chi_T = (39 \pm 7)^\circ$; the excess
flux is ($0.104 \pm 0.020$)% above the isotropic expectation. The corresponding
parameters for the deficit region are $(\alpha_V, \delta_V) = (205^\circ \pm
7^\circ, 5^\circ \pm 10^\circ)$, $\chi_V = (54 \pm 7)^\circ$, and $(-0.094 \pm
0.014)$%. The data do not allow us to rule out a pure dipole form for the
anisotropy (allowed at 13% confidence level); they are better described by the
excess and deficit cones described above. We explored the implications under
the assumption that the true anisotropy is not distorted too much by the
analysis filter so that it is well-described by the observed excess and deficit
cones.
