We discuss the structure of teleportation. By associating matrices to the
preparation and measurement states, we show that for a unitary transformation M
there is a full teleportation procedure for obtaining M|S> from a given state
|S>. The key to this construction is a diagrammatic intepretation of matrix
multiplication that applies equally well to a topological composition of a
maximum and a minimum that underlies the structure of the teleportation. This
paper is a preliminary report on joint work with H. Carteret and S. Lomonaco.
