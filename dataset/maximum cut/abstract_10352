While the performance of maximum ratio combining (MRC) is well understood for
a single isolated link, the same is not true in the presence of interference,
which is typically correlated across antennas due to the common locations of
interferers. For tractability, prior work focuses on the two extreme cases
where the interference power across antennas is either assumed to be fully
correlated or fully uncorrelated. In this paper, we address this shortcoming
and characterize the performance of MRC in the presence of spatially-correlated
interference across antennas. Modeling the interference field as a Poisson
point process, we derive the exact distribution of the signal-to-interference
ratio (SIR) for the case of two receive antennas, and upper and lower bounds
for the general case. Using these results, we study the diversity behavior of
MRC and characterize the critical density of simultaneous transmissions for a
given outage constraint. The exact SIR distribution is also useful in
benchmarking simpler correlation models. We show that the full-correlation
assumption is considerably pessimistic (up to 30% higher outage probability for
typical values) and the no-correlation assumption is significantly optimistic
compared to the true performance.
