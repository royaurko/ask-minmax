We report on detailed room temperature and low temperature transport
properties of double-gate Si MOSFETs with the Si well thickness in the range
7-17 nm. The devices were fabricated on silicon-on-insulator wafers utilizing
wafer bonding, which enabled us to use heavily doped metallic back gate. We
observe mobility enhancement effects at symmetric gate bias at room
temperature, which is the finger print of the volume inversion/accumulation
effect. An asymmetry in the mobility is detected at 300 K and at 1.6 K between
the top and back interfaces of the Si well, which is interpreted to arise from
different surface roughnesses of the interfaces. Low temperature peak
mobilities of the reported devices scale monotonically with Si well thickness
and the maximum low temperature mobility was 1.9 m2/Vs, which was measured from
a 16.5 nm thick device. In the magneto transport data we observe single and two
sub-band Landau level filling factor behavior depending on the well thickness
and gate biasing.
