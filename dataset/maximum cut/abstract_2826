We discuss the possibility of non-exponential Auger decay of atoms irradiated
by X-ray photons. This effect can occur at times, which are greater than the
lifetime of a system under consideration. The mechanism for non-exponential
depletion of an initial quasi-stationary state is the cutting of the electron
energy spectrum of final continuous states at small energies. Then the Auger
decay amplitude obeys power-law dependence on long observation times.
