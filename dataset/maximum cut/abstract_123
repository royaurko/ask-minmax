We study the phase behavior of diblock copolymers in presence of an external
electric field. We employ self-consistent field theory and treat the relevant
Maxwell equation as an additional self-consistent equation. Because we do not
treat the electric field perturbatively, we can examine its effects even when
its magnitude is large. The electric field couples to the system's morphology
only through the difference between the dielectric constants of the two blocks.
We find that an external field aligns a body-centered cubic phase along the
(111) direction, reducing its symmetry group to $R{\bar 3}m$. Transitions
between this phase and the disordered or hexagonal phases can occur for
external electric fields ranging from a minimum to a maximum value beyond which
the $R{\bar 3m}$ phase disappears completely. This electric-field range depends
on diblock architecture and temperature. We present several cuts through the
phase diagram in the space of temperature, architecture and applied field,
including one applicable to a system recently studied.
