We study the density of fixed strongly connected subtournaments on 5 vertices
in large tournaments. We determine the maximum density asymptotically for five
tournaments as well as unique extremal sequences for each tournament. As a
byproduct we also characterize tournaments that are recursive blow-ups of a
3-cycle as tournaments that avoid three specific tournaments of size 5.
