The temperature dependence of the zero-field susceptibilities of 2D and 3D
Ising lattices with anisotropic coupling is analyzed. Infinite 2D and 3D
lattices are approximated, respectively, by ensembles of independent L x oo and
L x L x oo chain clusters that are infinitely long in the strong-coupling (J)
direction. This approach is used as a basis for a quantitative description of
available experimental data on the magnetic susceptibilities of the 2D
anisotropic Ising magnet [(CH_3)_3NH]FeCl_3*2H_2O (FeTAC) and the
quasi-one-dimensional 3D magnets CoCl_2*2NC_5H_5 and FeCl_2*2NC_5H_5 in the
entire experimental temperature range. A method is proposed for determining the
relative interchain coupling strength J'/J from the maximum susceptibility
value, which improves the accuracy of estimates for J'/J by more than an order
of magnetude.
