High pressure electrical resistance and x-ray diffraction measurements have
been performed on ruthenium-doped Ba(Fe0.9Ru0.1)2As2, up to pressures of 32 GPa
and down to temperatures of 10 K, using designer diamond anvils under
quasi-hydrostatic conditions. At 3.9 GPa, there is an evidence of
pressure-induced superconductivity with Tc onset of 24 K and zero resistance at
Tc zero of ~14.5 K. The superconducting transition temperature reaches maximum
at ~5.5 GPa and then decreases gradually with increase in pressure before
completely disappearing above 11.5 GPa. Upon increasing pressure at 200 K, an
isostructural phase transition from a tetragonal (I4/mmm) phase to a collapsed
tetragonal phase is observed at 14 GPa and the collapsed phase persists up to
at least 30 GPa. The changes in the unit cell dimensions are highly anisotropic
across the phase transition and are qualitatively similar to those observed in
undoped BaFe2As2 parent.
