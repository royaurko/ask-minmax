One-loop amplitudes are to a large extent determined by their unitarity cuts
in four dimensions. We show that the remaining rational terms can be obtained
from the ultraviolet behaviour of the amplitude, and determine universal form
factors for these rational parts by applying reduction techniques to the
Feynman diagrammatic representation of the amplitude. The method is valid for
massless and massive internal particles. We illustrate this method by
evaluating the rational terms of the one-loop amplitudes for gg --> H, the
4-photon and 4-gluon amplitude, the amplitude for 2 photons plus 3 gluons and
the 6-photon amplitude.
