We critically examine the definition of dijet cross sections at large
rapidity intervals in hadron-hadron collisions, taking proper account of the
various cuts applied in a realistic experimental setup. We argue that the
dependence of the cross section on the precise definition of the parton
momentum fractions and the presence of an upper bound on the momentum transfer
cannot be neglected, and we provide the relevant modifications to the
analytical formulae by Mueller and Navelet. We also point out that the choice
of equal transverse momentum cuts on the tagging jets can spoil the possibility
of a clean extraction of signals of BFKL physics.
