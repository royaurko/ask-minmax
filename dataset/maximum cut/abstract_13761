Sheared toroidal flows can cause bifurcations to zero-turbulent-transport
states in tokamak plasmas. The maximum temperature gradients that can be
reached are limited by subcritical turbulence driven by the parallel velocity
gradient. Here it is shown that q/\epsilon (magnetic field pitch/inverse aspect
ratio) is a critical control parameter for sheared tokamak turbulence. By
reducing q/\epsilon, far higher temperature gradients can be achieved without
triggering turbulence, in some instances comparable to those found
experimentally in transport barriers. The zero-turbulence manifold is mapped
out, in the zero-magnetic-shear limit, over the parameter space (\gamma_E,
q/\epsilon, R/L_T), where \gamma_E is the perpendicular flow shear and R/L_T is
the normalised inverse temperature gradient scale. The extent to which it can
be constructed from linear theory is discussed.
