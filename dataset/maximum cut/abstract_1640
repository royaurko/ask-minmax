In this paper, we first introduce the concept of elementary linear subspace,
which has similar properties to those of a set of coordinates. We then use
elementary linear subspaces to derive properties of maximum rank distance (MRD)
codes that parallel those of maximum distance separable codes. Using these
properties, we show that, for MRD codes with error correction capability t, the
decoder error probability of bounded rank distance decoders decreases
exponentially with t^2 based on the assumption that all errors with the same
rank are equally likely.
