We report the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed QSO, at a redshift z
= 1.689, with four QSO components in a cross-shaped arrangement around a bright
galaxy. The maximum separation between images is 2.6 arcsec, enabling a
reliable decomposition of the system. Three of the QSO components have g =
19.6, while component A is about 0.6 mag brighter. The four components have
nearly identical colours, suggesting little if any dust extinction in the
foreground galaxy. The lensing galaxy is prominent in the i band, weaker in r
and not detected in g. Its spatial profile is that of an elliptical galaxy with
a scale length of $\sim$ 12 kpc. Combining the measured colours and a mass
model for the lens, we estimate a most likely redshift range of 0.3 < z < 0.4.
Predicted time delays between the components are $\la$ 10 days. The QSO shows
evidence for variability, with total g band magnitudes of 17.89 and 17.71 for
two epochs separated by $\sim 2$ months. However, the relative fluxes of the
components did not change, indicating that the variations are intrinsic to the
QSO rather than induced by microlensing.
