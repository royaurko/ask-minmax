The linear stability of a stratified shear flow for smooth density profiles
is studied. This work focuses on the nature of the stability boundaries of
flows in which both Kelvin-Helmholtz and Holmboe instabilities are present. For
a fixed Richardson number the unstable modes are confined to finite bands
between a smallest and a largest marginally unstable wavenumber. The results in
this paper indicate that the stability boundary for small wavenumbers is
comprised of neutral modes with phase velocity equal to the maximum/minimum
wind velocity whereas the other stability boundary, for large wavenumbers, is
comprised of singular neutral modes with phase velocity in the range of the
velocity shear. We show how these stability boundaries can be evaluated without
solving for the growth rate over the entire parameter space as was previously
done. The results indicate further that there is a new instability domain that
has not been previously noted in the literature. The unstable modes, in this
new instability domain, appear for larger values of the Richardson number and
are related to the higher harmonics of the internal gravity wave spectrum.
