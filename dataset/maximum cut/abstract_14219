This paper provides detailed comparisons of chemical reaction mechanisms of
H2 applicable at high preheat temperatures and pressures relevant to gas
turbine and particularly Alstom's reheat gas turbine conditions. It is shown
that the available reaction mechanisms exhibit large differences in several
important elementary reaction coefficients. The reaction mechanisms are
assessed by comparing ignition delay and laminar flame speed results obtained
from CHEMKIN with available data, however, the amount of data at these
conditions is scarce and a recommended candidate among the mechanisms can
presently not be selected. Generally, the results with the GRI-Mech and Leeds
mechanisms deviate from the Davis, Li, O'Conaire, Konnov and San Diego
mechanisms, but there are also significant deviations between the latter five
mechanisms that altogether are better adapted to hydrogen. The differences in
ignition delay times between the dedicated hydrogen mechanisms (O'Conaire, Li
and Konnov) range from approximately a maximum factor of 2 for the H2-air
cases, to more than a factor 5 for the H2/O2/AR cases. The application of the
computed ignition delay time to reheat burner development is briefly discussed.
