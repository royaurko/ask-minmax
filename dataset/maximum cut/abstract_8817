A simple model of the effect of polymer concentration on the amount of drag
reduction in turbulence is presented, simulated and analyzed. The qualitative
phase diagram of drag coefficient vs. Reynolds number (Re) is recaptured in
this model, including the theoretically elusive onset of drag reduction and the
Maximum Drag Reduction (MDR) asymptote. The Re-dependent drag and the MDR are
analytically explained, and the dependence of the amount of drag on material
parameters is rationalized.
