The optical properties of focused ion beam-engraved perfectly aligned and
spatially controlled multi-quantum-well InGaN-GaN nanopillars were
investigated. Crystalline MQW nanopillars with a diameter of 30 to 95 nm and
high aspect ratios showed a maximum of three-fold enhancement in emission
intensity per unit active area. A light emitting contour map of Taiwan is drawn
with a nanopillar structure to demonstrate the site control of the technique
adopted in the present study. Raman scattering studies were used to
characterize the newly created surfaces. Unknown peaks in GaN and InGaN
nanostructures are identified for surface optical (SO) phonon modes with proper
assignments of wave vectors using multiple excitations, and the SO mode for the
ternary phase is reported for the first time.
