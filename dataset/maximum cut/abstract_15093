In this paper, we consider the relaying of orthogonal space time block codes
(OSTBCs) in a two-way amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) relay system with estimated channel state information (CSI). A simple
four phase protocol is used for training and OSTBC data transmission. Decoding
of OSTBC data at a user terminal is performed by replacing the exact CSI by the
estimated CSI, in a maximum likelihood decoder. Tight approximations for the
moment generating function (m.g.f.) of the received signal-to-noise ratio at a
user is derived under Rayleigh fading by ignoring the higher order noise terms.
Analytical average error performance of the considered cooperative scheme is
derived by using the m.g.f. expression. Moreover, the analytical diversity
order of the considered scheme is also obtained for certain system
configurations. It is shown by simulations and analysis that the channel
estimation does not affect the diversity order of the OSTBC based two-way AF
MIMO relay system.
