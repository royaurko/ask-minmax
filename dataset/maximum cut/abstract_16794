We describe an astrometric and spectroscopic campaign to confirm the youth
and association of a complete sample of candidate wide companions in Taurus and
Upper Sco. Our survey found fifteen new binary systems (3 in Taurus and 12 in
Upper Sco) with separations of 3-30" (500-5000 AU) among all of the known
members with masses of 2.5-0.012 Msun. The total sample of 49 wide systems in
these two regions conforms to only some expectations from field multiplicity
surveys. Higher-mass stars have a higher frequency of wide binary companions,
and there is a marked paucity of wide binary systems near the substellar
regime. However, the separation distribution appears to be log-flat, rather
than declining as in the field, and the mass ratio distribution is more biased
toward similar-mass companions than the IMF or the field G dwarf distribution.
The maximum separation also shows no evidence of a limit at <5000 AU until the
abrupt cessation of any wide binary formation at system masses of ~0.3 Msun. We
attribute this result to the post-natal dynamical sculpting that occurs for
most field systems; our binary systems will escape to the field intact, but
most field stars are formed in denser clusters and do not. In summary, only
wide binary systems with total masses <0.3 Msun appear to be "unusually wide".
