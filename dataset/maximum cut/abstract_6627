COSY data on the cross section of the reaction pp -> {pp}_s pi^0, where
{pp}_s is the proton pair in the 1S0 state at small excitation energy
E_{pp}=0-3 MeV, recently obtained for beam energies 0.5 - 2.0 GeV are analyzed
within the one-pion exchange model. The model is based on the subprocess pi^0 p
-> pi^0 p and final state pp-interaction. A broad maximum observed in the
energy dependence of the cross section at 0.5 - 1.4 GeV in the forward
direction is explained by this model as a dominant contribution of the isospin
3/2 in the pi^0 p-rescattering. The second maximum observed at 2 GeV is
underpredicted within the model by one order of magnitude.
