In the theory of thermonuclear reaction rates, analytical evaluation of
thermonuclear functions for non-resonant reactions, including cases with
cut-off and depletion of the tail of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
function were considered in a series of papers by Mathai and Haubold (1988). In
the present paper we study more general classes of thermonuclear functions by
introducing a pathway parameter alpha, so that when alpha --> 1 the
thermonuclear functions in the Maxwell-Boltzmannian case are recovered. We will
also give interpretations for the pathway parameter alpha in the case of
cut-off and in terms of moments.
