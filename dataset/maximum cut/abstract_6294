Apparent (radiation) radius of neutron star,R_\infty, depends on the star
gravitational mass in quite a different way than the standard coordinate radius
in the Schwarzschild metric, R. We show that, for a broad set of equations of
state of dense matter,
  R_\infty(M_max) for the configurations with maximum allowable masses is very
close to the absolute lower bound on R_\infty at fixed M, resulting from the
very definition of R_\infty.
  Also, the value of R_infty at given M, corresponding to the maximum
compactness (minimum R) of neutron star consistent with general relativity and
condition v_sound<c, is only 0.6% higher than this absolute lower bound.
Theoretical predictions for R_\infty are compared with existing observational
estimates of the apparent radii of neutron stars.
