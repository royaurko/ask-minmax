Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are axisymmetric systems to first order; their
observed properties are likely strong functions of inclination with respect to
our line of sight, yet the specific inclinations of all but a few AGN are
generally unknown. By determining the inclinations and geometries of nearby
Seyfert galaxies using the kinematics of their narrow-line regions (NLRs), and
comparing them with observed properties, we find strong correlations between
inclination and total hydrogen column density, infrared color, and H-beta
full-width at half maximum (FWHM). These correlations provide evidence that the
orientation of AGN with respect to our line of sight affects how we perceive
them, beyond the Seyfert type dichotomy. They can also be used to constrain 3D
models of AGN components such as the broad-line region and torus. Additionally,
we find weak correlations between AGN luminosity and several modeled NLR
parameters, which suggests that the NLR geometry and kinematics are dependent
to some degree on the AGN's radiation field.
