We report on the itinerant ferromagnetic superconductor UGe_2 through
^73Ge-NQR measurements under pressure (P). The P dependence of the NQR spectrum
signals a first-order transition from the low-temperature (T) and low-P
ferromagnetic phase (FM2) to high-T and high-P one (FM1) around a critical
pressure of P_x ~ 1.2 GPa. The superconductivity exhibiting a maximum value of
T_sc=0.7 K at P_x ~ 1.2 GPa, was found to take place in connection with the
P-induced first-order transition. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate
1/T_1 has probed the ferromagnetic transition, exhibiting a peak at the Curie
temperature as well as a decrease without the coherence peak below T_sc. These
results reveal the uniformly coexistent phase of ferromagnetism and
unconventional superconductivity with a line-node gap. We remark on an intimate
interplay between the onset of superconductivity and the underlying electronic
state for the ferromagnetic phases.
