Room temperature powder x-ray diffraction measurements have been carried out
on polycrystalline samples of CuxV2O5 with x = 0.33, 0.40, 0.50, 0.55 and 0.60,
prepared by solid state reaction in evacuated quartz tubes. All the samples
were found to be in single-phase monoclinic structure. Rietveld full profile
refinement of the x-ray diffraction data yielded the lattice parameters and
fractional atom coordinates. Maximum entropy inversion of the diffraction data
was done in order to obtain the variation in the spatial electron density
distribution as a function of copper composition. These density maps show
progressive positional and charge disorders in the V-O network induced by
addition of copper. It is shown that the electrons donated by copper atoms are
transferred to the specific vanadium atom sites.
