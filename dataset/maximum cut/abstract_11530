Understanding the processes which create and destroy $^{22}$Na is important
for diagnosing classical nova outbursts. Conventional $^{22}$Na(p,$\gamma$)
studies are complicated by the need to employ radioactive targets. In contrast,
we have formed the particle-unbound states of interest through the heavy-ion
fusion reaction, $^{12}$C($^{12}$C,n)$^{23}$Mg and used the Gammasphere array
to investigate their radiative decay branches. Detailed spectroscopy was
possible and the $^{22}$Na(p,$\gamma$) reaction rate has been re-evaluated. New
hydrodynamical calculations incorporating the upper and lower limits on the new
rate suggest a reduction in the yield of $^{22}$Na with respect to previous
estimates, implying a reduction in the maximum detectability distance for
$^{22}$Na $\gamma$ rays from novae.
