The stability features of steady states of the spherically symmetric
Einstein-Vlasov system are investigated numerically. We find support for the
conjecture by Zeldovich and Novikov that the binding energy maximum along a
steady state sequence signals the onset of instability, a conjecture which we
extend to and confirm for non-isotropic states. The sign of the binding energy
of a solution turns out to be relevant for its time evolution in general. We
relate the stability properties to the question of universality in critical
collapse and find that for Vlasov matter universality does not seem to hold.
