Path Integral Monte Carlo was used to calculate the Bose-Einstein condensate
fraction at the surface of a helium film at $T=0.77 K$, as a function of
density. Moving from the center of the slab to the surface, the condensate
fraction was found to initially increase with decreasing density to a maximum
value of 0.9 before decreasing. Long wavelength density correlations were
observed in the static structure factor at the surface of the slab. Finally, a
surface dispersion relation was calculated from imaginary-time density-density
correlations.
