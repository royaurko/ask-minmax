We study the kinetics of domain growth of fluid mixtures quenched from a
disordered to a lamellar phase. At low viscosities, in two dimensions, when
hydrodynamic modes become important, dynamical scaling is verified in the form
 $C(\vec k, t) \sim L^{\alpha} f[(k-k_M)L]$ where $C$ is the structure factor
with maximum at $k_M$ and
 $L$ is a typical length changing from power law to logarithmic growth at late
times. The presence of extended defects can explain the behavior of $L$.
Three-dimensional simulations confirm that diffuse grain boundaries inhibit
complete ordering of lamellae. Applied shear flow alleviates frustration and
gives power-law growth at all times.
