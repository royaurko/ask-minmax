The Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) for the deconvolution of radio
interferometry images is mathematically well based and presents a number of
advantages over the usual CLEAN deconvolution, such as appreciably higher
resolution. The application of MEM for polarisation imaging remains relatively
little studied. CLEAN and MEM intensity and polarisation techniques are
discussed in application to recently obtained 18cm VLBA polarisation data for a
sample of Active Galactic Nuclei.
