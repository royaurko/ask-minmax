The latitudinal distributions of the yearly mean rotation rates measured
respectively by Suzuki in 1998 and 2012 and Pulkkinen $\&$ Tuominen in 1998 are
utilized to investigate internal-cycle variation of solar differential
rotation. The rotation rate at the solar Equator seems to decrease since cycle
10 onwards. The coefficient $B$ of solar differential rotation, which
represents the latitudinal gradient of rotation, is found smaller in the
several years after the minimum of a solar cycle than in the several years
after the maximum time of the cycle, and it peaks several years after the
maximum time of the solar cycle. The internal-cycle variation of the solar
rotation rates looks similar in profile to that of the coefficient $B$. A new
explanation is proposed to address such a solar-cycle related variation of the
solar rotation rates. Weak magnetic fields may more effectively reflect
differentiation at low latitudes with high rotation rates than at high
latitudes with low rotation rates, and strong magnetic fields may more
effectively repress differentiation at relatively low latitudes than at high
latitudes. The internal-cycle variation is inferred to the result of both the
latitudinal migration of the surface torsional pattern and the repression of
strong magnetic activity to differentiation.
