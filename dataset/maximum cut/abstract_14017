In this paper results of scintillation properties measurements of pure and
Ce3+-doped strontium fluoride crystals are presented. We measure light output,
scintillation decay time profile and temperature stability of light output.
X-ray excited luminescence outputs corrected for spectral response of
monochromator and photomultiplier for pure SrF2 and SrF2-0.3 mol.% Ce3+ are
approximately 95% and 115% of NaI-Tl emission output, respectively. A photopeak
with a 10% full width at half maximum is observed at approximately 84% the
light output of a NaI-Tl crystal after correction for spectral response of
photomultiplier, when sample 10x10 mm of pure SrF2 crystal is excited with 662
KeV photons. Corrected light output of SrF2-0.3 mol.% Ce3+ under 662 KeV photon
excitation is found at approximately 64% the light output of the NaI-Tl
crystal.
