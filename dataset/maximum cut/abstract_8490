Condensation occurs in nonequilibrium steady states when a finite fraction of
particles in the system occupies a single lattice site. We study condensation
transitions in a one-dimensional zero-range process with a single defect site.
The system is analysed in the grand canonical and canonical ensembles and the
two are contrasted. Two distinct condensation mechanisms are found in the grand
canonical ensemble. Discrepancies between the infinite and large but finite
systems' particle current versus particle density diagrams are investigated and
an explanation for how the finite current goes above a maximum value predicted
for infinite systems is found in the canonical ensemble.
