The first results from the LHC on jets plus missing energy provide powerful
new data to test SUSY models. Initial theoretical interpretations of these data
have concentrated on gravity mediation, usually the CMSSM and its variations.
In this paper we confront a large class of gauge mediation models with these
new data. More precisely we consider models of pure general gauge mediation
(pure GGM) and confront them with the recent experimental results of the ATLAS
collaboration. We use Herwig++ and RIVET, incorporating the full set of
experimental cuts, to calculate the signal rates and compare them to the data.
Although based on only 35pb^{-1} of integrated luminosity, we show that these
new data probe and exclude a portion of previously allowed parameter space of
GGM. In addition we investigate the viability of standard SUSY benchmark
points, including the Snowmass, CMS and ATLAS sets which encompass other
mediation scenarios such as gravity, anomaly and gaugino mediation.
