Utilizing a SU(2) gauge symmetry technique in the quasiclassical diffusive
regime, we theoretically study finite-sized two-dimensional intrinsic
spin-orbit coupled superconductor/normal-metal/superconductor (S/N/S) hybrid
structures with a single spin-active interface. We consider intrinsic
spin-orbit interactions (ISOIs) that are confined within the N wire and absent
in the s-wave superconducting electrodes (S). Using experimentally feasible
parameters, we demonstrate that the coupling of the ISOIs and spin moment of
the spin-active interface results in maximum singlet-triplet conversion and
accumulation of spin current density at the corners of the N wire nearest the
spin-active interface. By solely modulating the superconducting phase
difference, we show how the opposing parities of the charge and spin currents
provide an effective venue to experimentally examine pure edge spin currents
not accompanied by charge currents. These effects occur in the absence of
externally imposed fields, and moreover are insensitive to the arbitrary
orientations of the interface spin moment. The experimental implementation of
these robust edge phenomena are also discussed.
