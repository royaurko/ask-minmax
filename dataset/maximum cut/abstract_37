We report on the \textit{Fermi}-LAT observations of the Geminga pulsar, the
second brightest non-variable GeV source in the $\gamma$-ray sky and the first
example of a radio-quiet $\gamma$-ray pulsar. The observations cover one year,
from the launch of the $Fermi$ satellite through 2009 June 15. A data sample of
over 60,000 photons enabled us to build a timing solution based solely on
$\gamma$ rays. Timing analysis shows two prominent peaks, separated by $\Delta
\phi$ = 0.497 $\pm$ 0.004 in phase, which narrow with increasing energy. Pulsed
$\gamma$ rays are observed beyond 18 GeV, precluding emission below 2.7 stellar
radii because of magnetic absorption. The phase-averaged spectrum was fitted
with a power law with exponential cut-off of spectral index $\Gamma$ = (1.30
$\pm$ 0.01 $\pm$ 0.04), cut-off energy $E_{0}$ = (2.46 $\pm$ 0.04 $\pm$ 0.17)
GeV and an integral photon flux above 0.1 GeV of (4.14 $\pm$ 0.02 $\pm$ 0.32)
$\times$ 10$^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The first uncertainties are statistical
and the second are systematic. The phase-resolved spectroscopy shows a clear
evolution of the spectral parameters, with the spectral index reaching a
minimum value just before the leading peak and the cut-off energy having maxima
around the peaks. Phase-resolved spectroscopy reveals that pulsar emission is
present at all rotational phases. The spectral shape, broad pulse profile, and
maximum photon energy favor the outer magnetospheric emission scenarios.
