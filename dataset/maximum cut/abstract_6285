A simple binary model for Mkn~501 is considered under the assumption that the
TeV and X-ray periodicity of $\sim 23$ days, observed during the flaring state
in 1997, may be basically interpreted as a doppler-shifted flux modulation due
to the orbital motion of the relativistic jet. For the typical jet properties
inferred from emission models, we find an intrinsic orbital period of $(6-14)$
yrs and a centre-of-mass distance of $(2-3.5) \times 10^{16}$ cm, the binary
thus being a very close system. If the binary separation corresponds to that at
which gravitational radiation becomes dominant, one may obtain a maximum
allowed primary mass of $\sim 10^8 M_{\odot}$ and a corresponding maximum
allowed secondary mass in the range of $\sim (1-9)\times 10^7 M_{\odot}$
assuming that gas accretion occurs on around the salpeter time scale.
Interestingly such values agree with the black hole masses expected from merger
scenarios.
