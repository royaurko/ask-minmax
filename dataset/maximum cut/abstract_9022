We report the giant carrier mobility in single crystals of FeSb2. Nonlinear
field dependence of Hall resistivity is well described with the two-carrier
model. Maximum mobility values in high mobility band reach ~10^5 cm^2/Vs at 8
K, and are ~10^2 cm^2/Vs at the room temperature. Our results point to a class
of materials with promising potential for applications in solid state
electronics.
