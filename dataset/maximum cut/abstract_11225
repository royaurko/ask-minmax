We calculate static properties of non-rotating neutron stars (NS's) using a
microscopic equation of state (EOS) for asymmetric nuclear matter, derived from
the Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone many-body theory with explicit three-body forces.
We use the Argonne AV14 and the Paris two-body nuclear force, implemented by
the Urbana model for the three-body force. We obtain a maximum mass
configuration with $ M_{max} = 1.8 M_{\sun}$ ($M_{max} = 1.94 M_{\sun}$) when
the AV14 (Paris) interaction is used. They are both consistent with the
observed range of NS masses. The onset of direct Urca processes occurs at
densities $n \geq 0.65~fm^{-3}$ for the AV14 potential and $n \geq
0.54~fm^{-3}$ for the Paris potential. Therefore, NS's with masses above
$M^{Urca} = 1.4 M_{\sun}$ for the AV14 and $M^{Urca} = 1.24 M_{\sun}$ for the
Paris potential can undergo very rapid cooling, depending on the strength of
superfluidity in the interior of the NS. The comparison with other microscopic
models for the EOS shows noticeable differences.
