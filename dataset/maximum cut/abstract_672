In the multiverse, as in AdS, light-cones relate bulk points to boundary
scales. This holographic UV-IR connection defines a preferred global time
cut-off that regulates the divergences of eternal inflation. An entirely
different cut-off, the causal patch, arises in the holographic description of
black holes. Remarkably, I find evidence that these two regulators define the
same probability measure in the multiverse. Initial conditions for the causal
patch are controlled by the late-time attractor regime of the global
description.
