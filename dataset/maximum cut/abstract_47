We report a new approach for the design and fabrication of thin wave plates
with high transmission in the terahertz (THz) regime. The wave plates are based
on strongly birefringent cut-wire pair metamaterials that exhibit refractive
indices of opposite signs for two orthogonal polarization components of an
incident wave. As specific examples, we fabricated and investigated a quarter-
and a half-wave plate that revealed a peak intensity transmittance of 74% and
58% at 1.34 THz and 1.3 THz, respectively. Furthermore, the half wave plate
displayed a maximum figure of merit (FOM) of 23 at 1.3 THz where the refractive
index was -1.7. This corresponds to one of the highest FOMs reported at THz
frequencies so far. The presented results evidence that negative index
materials enter an application stage in terms of optical components for the THz
technology.
