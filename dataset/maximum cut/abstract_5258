Results are reported from a search for low-multiplicity neutrino bursts in
the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO). Such bursts could indicate detection of
a nearby core-collapse supernova explosion. The data were taken from Phase I
(November 1999 - May 2001), when the detector was filled with heavy water, and
Phase II (July 2001 - August 2003), when NaCl was added to the target. The
search was a blind analysis in which the potential backgrounds were estimated
and analysis cuts were developed to eliminate such backgrounds with 90%
confidence before the data were examined. The search maintained a greater than
50% detection probability for standard supernovae occurring at a distance of up
to 60 kpc for Phase I and up to 70 kpc for Phase II. No low-multiplicity bursts
were observed during the data-taking period.
