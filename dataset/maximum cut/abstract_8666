Erraticity analysis of multiparticle production data is introduced as a way
of extracting the maximum amount of information on self-similar fluctuations.
It is presented as the next logical step to take beyond the intermittency
analysis. An erraticity spectrum $e(\alpha)$ can be determined analogous to the
multifractal spectrum $f(\alpha)$. An analytical example is presented to
elucidate the method of analysis and the type of results that can be obtained.
