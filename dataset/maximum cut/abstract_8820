We calculate the total cross section for $\pi N \to J/\Psi N$ based on
$\rho$-meson exchange. On the basis of this calculation we predict a maximal
reaction rate arising from the OZI-violating $J/\Psi{\leftrightarrow}\rho\pi$
vertex in tree-level. Our estimate for the maximum reaction rate is still one
order of magnitude smaller than the existing predictions which were based on
the other OZI-violating mechanisms.
