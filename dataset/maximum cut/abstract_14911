We investigate the magnetic field dependence of the Hall and the bend
resistances for a ballistic Hall bar structure containing a pn-junction
sculptured from a bilayer of graphene. The electric response is obtained using
the billiard model and we investigate the cases of bilayer graphene with and
without a band gap. Two different conduction regimes are possible: $i$) both
sides of the junction have the same carrier type, and $ii$) one side of the
junction is n-type while the other one is p-type. The first case shows Hall
plateau-like features in the Hall resistance that fade away as the band gap
opens. The second case exhibits a bend resistance that is asymmetric in
magnetic field as a consequence of snake states along the pn-interface, where
the maximum is shifted away from zero magnetic field.
