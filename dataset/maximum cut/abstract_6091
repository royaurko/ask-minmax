We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry of a classical nova,
V2362 Cyg (= Nova Cygni 2006). V2362 Cyg experienced a peculiar rebrightening
with a long duration from 100 to 240 d after the maximum of the nova. Our
multicolor observation indicates an emergence of a pseudophotosphere with an
effective temperature of 9000 K at the rebrightening maximum. After the
rebrightening maximum, the object showed a slow fading homogeneously in all of
the used bands for one week. This implies that the fading just after the
rebrightening maximum ( less or equal 1 week ) was caused by a slowly shrinking
pseudophotosphere. Then, the NIR flux drastically increased, while the optical
flux steeply declined. The optical and NIR flux was consistent with blackbody
radiation with a temperature of 1500 K during this NIR rising phase. These
facts are likely to be explained by dust formation in the nova ejecta. Assuming
an optically thin case, we estimate the dust mass of 10^(-8) -- 10^(-10)
M_solar, which is less than those in typical dust-forming novae. These results
support the senario that a second, long-lasting outflow, which caused the
rebrightening, interacted with a fraction of the initial outflow and formed
dust grains.
