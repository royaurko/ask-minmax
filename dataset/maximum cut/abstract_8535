The magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity of n-type
BaTi{1-x}Nb{x}O3 have been measured over a wide temperature range. It is found
that, for 0 < x < 0.2, dopant electrons form immobile spin singlet small
bipolarons with binding energy around 110 meV. For x = 0.2, a maximum in the
electrical resistivity around 15 K indicates a crossover from band to hopping
transport of the charge carriers, a phenomenon expected but rarely observed in
real polaronic systems.
