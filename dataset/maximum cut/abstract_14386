In this paper, we introduce a new class of distributions which is obtained by
compounding the extended Weibull and power series distributions. The
compounding procedure follows the same set-up carried out by Adamidis and
Loukas (1998) and defines at least new 68 sub-models. This class includes some
well-known mixing distributions, such as the Weibull power series (Morais and
Barreto-Souza, 2010) and exponential power series (Chahkandi and Ganjali, 2009)
distributions. Some mathematical properties of the new class are studied
including moments and generating function. We provide the density function of
the order statistics and obtain their moments. The method of maximum likelihood
is used for estimating the model parameters and an EM algorithm is proposed for
computing the estimates. Special distributions are investigated in some detail.
An application to a real data set is given to show the flexibility and
potentiality of the new class of distributions.
