The bulk of air showers initiated by very high energy cosmic rays exhibits a
longitudinal development in depth with a single well-defined shower maximum.
However, a small fraction of showers has a profile that differs considerably
from this average behaviour. In extreme cases, such anomalous longitudinal
profiles can even have two distinct shower maxima. We discuss the properties of
the primary interactions that lead to such profiles. Simulations are used to
estimate the rate of anomalous profiles in dependence of primary energy, mass,
and characteristic features of hadronic multiparticle production at very high
energies.
