We study the extreme statistics of N non-intersecting Brownian motions
(vicious walkers) over a unit time interval in one dimension. Using
path-integral techniques we compute exactly the joint distribution of the
maximum M and of the time \tau_M at which this maximum is reached. We focus in
particular on non-intersecting Brownian bridges ("watermelons without wall")
and non-intersecting Brownian excursions ("watermelons with a wall"). We
discuss in detail the relationships between such vicious walkers models in
watermelons configurations and stochastic growth models in curved geometry on
the one hand and the directed polymer in a disordered medium (DPRM) with one
free end-point on the other hand. We also check our results using numerical
simulations of Dyson's Brownian motion and confront them with numerical
simulations of the Polynuclear Growth Model (PNG) and of a model of DPRM on a
discrete lattice. Some of the results presented here were announced in a recent
letter [J. Rambeau and G. Schehr, Europhys. Lett. 91, 60006 (2010)].
