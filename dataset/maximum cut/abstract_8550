Tl-doped PbTe (Pb_{1-x}Tl_{x}Te) is an anomalous superconductor with a
remarkably high maximum T_c value given its relatively low carrier
concentration. Here, we present results of systematic measurements of
superconducting parameters for this material, for Tl concentrations up to x =
1.4%. We find that it is a Type II, weak-coupled BCS superconductor in the
dirty limit and discuss implications for the applicability of the charge Kondo
model recently proposed to account for superconductivity in this system.
