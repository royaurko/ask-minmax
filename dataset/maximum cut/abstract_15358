In 2013 Rams-Sch\"utt corrected Segre's 1943 proof that a smooth quartic
surface in projective space contains at most 64 lines. Moreover, they found
counterexamples to Segre's statement that a line on a quartic can meet at most
18 other lines. We extend the bound of 64 lines to K3 quartic surfaces, i.e.
quartics admitting only isolated rational double points as singularities, over
a field of characteristic zero. We obtain a sharp bound for the number of lines
meeting a given line, finding two new configurations in which a line meets 19
or 20 other lines. We provide several explicit examples, both of these new
phenomena and of K3 quartic surfaces with at least one singular point
containing many lines.
