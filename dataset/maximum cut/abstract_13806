The inclusive dijet production double differential cross section as a
function of the dijet invariant mass and of the largest absolute rapidity of
the two jets with the largest transverse momentum in an event is measured in
proton anti-proton collisions at sqrt{s} = 1.96 TeV using 0.7 fb^{-1}
integrated luminosity collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron
Collider. The measurement is performed in six rapidity regions up to a maximum
rapidity of 2.4. Next-to-leading order perturbative QCD predictions are found
to be in agreement with the data.
