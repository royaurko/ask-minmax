We study the effect of application of new set of cuts, proposed in our
previous works, on the improvement of accuracy of the jet energy calibration
with p p->photon+Jet+X process at Tevatron. Monte Carlo events produced by the
PYTHIA 5.7 generator are used for this aim. The selection criteria for
photon+Jet event samples that would provide a good balance of photon and jet
transverse momenta and would allow to reduce the background are described. The
distributions of these events over photon transverse momenta and jet
pseudorapidity are presented. The features of photon+Jet events in the central
calorimeter region of the D0 detector (eta_jet < 0.7) are exposed. The
efficiency of the cuts used for background suppression is demonstrated.
  It is shown that the samples of photon+Jet events, gained with the cuts for
the jet energy calibration, may have enough statistics for determining the
gluon distribution inside a proton in the region of x < 10^{-3} and of Q^2 by
one order higher than that studied at HERA.
