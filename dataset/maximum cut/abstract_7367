We develop a potential algorithm to relate the depth development of ultra
high energy extensive air showers and the time delay for individual muons. The
time distributions sampled at different positions at ground level by a large
air shower array are converted into distributions of production distances using
an approximate relation between production distance, transverse distance and
time delay. The method is naturally restricted to inclined showers where muons
dominate the signal at ground level but could be extended to vertical showers
provided that the detectors used can separate the muon signal from electrons
and photons. We explore the accuracy and practical uncertainties involved in
the proposed method. For practical purposes only the muons that fall outside
the central region of the shower can be used, and we establish cuts in
transverse distance. The method is tested using simulated showers by comparing
the production distance distributions obtained using the method with the actual
distances in the simulated showers. It could be applied in the search of
neutrinos to increase the acceptance to highly penetrating particles, as well
as for unraveling the relative compositions of protons and heavy nuclei. We
also illustrate that the obtained depth distributions have minimum width when
both the arrival direction and the core position are well reconstructed.
