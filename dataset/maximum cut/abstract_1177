In this paper, we derive a physical argument for the existence of
Period-luminosity and period-luminosity-colour relations at maximum light. We
examine in detail a sample of Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and
compare the variance of some PL and PLC type distance indicators based on mean
and maximum light. We show that a PLC relation based on maximum light leads to
a distance estimator with a dispersion about $10 \%$ smaller than its
counterpart using mean light. We also show that a PLC type relation constructed
using observations at both maximum and mean light has a significantly $( > 50
\%)$ smaller dispersion than a PLC relation using either maximum or mean light
alone. A comparable $( > 30 \%)$ reduction in the dispersion of the
corresponding distance estimator, however, in this case requires the relation
be applied to a large $( n > 30)$ group of equidistant Cepheids in, e.g., a
distant galaxy. Recent HST observations of IC4182, M81 and M100 already provide
suitable candidate data sets for this relation.
