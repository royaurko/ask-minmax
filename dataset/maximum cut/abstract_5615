While the Semantic Web currently can exhibit provenance information by using
the W3C PROV standards, there is a "missing link" in connecting PROV to storing
and querying for dynamic changes to RDF graphs using SPARQL. Solving this
problem would be required for such clear use-cases as the creation of version
control systems for RDF. While some provenance models and annotation techniques
for storing and querying provenance data originally developed with databases or
workflows in mind transfer readily to RDF and SPARQL, these techniques do not
readily adapt to describing changes in dynamic RDF datasets over time. In this
paper we explore how to adapt the dynamic copy-paste provenance model of
Buneman et al. [2] to RDF datasets that change over time in response to SPARQL
updates, how to represent the resulting provenance records themselves as RDF in
a manner compatible with W3C PROV, and how the provenance information can be
defined by reinterpreting SPARQL updates. The primary contribution of this
paper is a semantic framework that enables the semantics of SPARQL Update to be
used as the basis for a 'cut-and-paste' provenance model in a principled
manner.
