To build upon the goals of the upcoming INTEGRAL mission, the next generation
soft gamma-ray (0.2-20 MeV) observatory will require improved sensitivity to
nuclear line emission while maintaining high spectral resolution. We present
the simulated performance of a germanium Compton telescope (GCT) design, which
will allow a factor of ten improvement in sensitivity over INTEGRAL/SPI. We
also discuss a number of issues concerning reconstruction techniques and event
cuts, and demonstrate how these affect the overall performance of the
telescope.
