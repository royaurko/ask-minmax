The clustering coefficient of a vertex in a graph is the proportion of
neighbours of the vertex that are adjacent. The minimum clustering coefficient
of a graph is the smallest clustering coefficient taken over all vertices. A
complete structural characterization of those locally connected graphs, with
minimum clustering coefficient 1/2 and maximum degree at most 6, that are fully
cycle extendable is given in terms of strongly induced subgraphs with given
attachment sets. Moreover, it is shown that all locally connected graphs with
minimum clustering coefficient 1/2 and maximum degree at most 6 are weakly
pancyclic, thereby proving Ryjacek's conjecture for this class of locally
connected graphs.
