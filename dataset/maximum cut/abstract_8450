Measurements of single crystalline MgB2 with torque magnetometry in fields up
to 90 kOe reveal a sharp peak in the irreversible torque at about 0.85 Hc2. In
the region between peak onset and maximum, pronounced history effects occur.
Angle and temperature dependence of the characteristic peak fields track those
of Hc2. The features observed suggest that the peak marks a disorder-induced
phase transition of vortex matter between a quasi-ordered Bragg glass and a
highly-disordered glass.
