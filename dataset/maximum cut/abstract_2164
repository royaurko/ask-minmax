The measured ratios $R(x,A_1/A_2)$ for $J/\Psi$, $\Psi'$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$
production on two different targets $A_1, A_2$ as a function of the fractional
momentum $x$ of the final state are well fit with a very simple functional form
having three adjustable parameters. An empirical relation is found between the
three parameters of the fit. The deduced $J/\Psi$ absorption cross sections
$\sigma_{abs}$ cluster around two values of which only $\sigma_{abs} = 5.8 \pm
0.2$ mb seems acceptable.
