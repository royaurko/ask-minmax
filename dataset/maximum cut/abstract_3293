We examine and compare several different classes of "balanced" block codes
over q-ary alphabets, namely symbol-balanced (SB) codes, charge-balanced (CB)
codes, and polarity-balanced (PB) codes. Known results on the maximum size and
asymptotic minimal redundancy of SB and CB codes are reviewed. We then
determine the maximum size and asymptotic minimal redundancy of PB codes and of
codes which are both CB and PB. We also propose efficient Knuth-like encoders
and decoders for all these types of balanced codes.
