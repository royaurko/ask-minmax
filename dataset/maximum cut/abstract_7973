Given a finite, connected graph $G$, the lamplighter chain on $G$ is the lazy
random walk $X^\diamond$ on the associated lamplighter graph
$G^\diamond={\mathbf Z}_2 \wr G$. The mixing time of the lamplighter chain on
the torus ${\mathbf Z}_n^d$ is known to have a cutoff at a time asymptotic to
the cover time of ${\mathbf Z}_n^d$ if $d=2$, and to half the cover time if $d
\ge 3$. We show that the mixing time of the lamplighter chain on
$G_n(a)={\mathbf Z}_n^2 \times {\mathbf Z}_{a \log n}$ has a cutoff at
$\psi(a)$ times the cover time of $G_n(a)$ as $n \to \infty$, where $\psi$ is
an explicit weakly decreasing map from $(0,\infty)$ onto $[1/2,1)$. In
particular, as $a > 0$ varies, the threshold continuously interpolates between
the known thresholds for ${\mathbf Z}_n^2$ and ${\mathbf Z}_n^3$. Perhaps
surprisingly, we find a phase transition (non-smoothness of $\psi$) at the
point $a_*=\pi r_3 (1+\sqrt{2})$, where high dimensional behavior
($\psi(a)=1/2$ for all $a \ge a_*$) commences. Here $r_3$ is the effective
resistance from $0$ to $\infty$ in ${\mathbf Z}^3$.
