We calculate the entropy of a scalar field in a rotating black hole in 2 + 1
dimension. In the Hartle-Hawking state the entropy is proportional to the
horizon area, but diverges linearly in $\sqrt{h}$, where $h$ is the radial
cut-off. In WKB approximation the superradiant modes do not contribute to the
entropy.
