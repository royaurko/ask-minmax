A triple of positive integers (d,h,m) is admissible if for any m given masses
in R^d there exist h hyperplanes that cut each of these masses into 2^h equal
pieces. We present an elementary reduction which combined with results by Ramos
(1996) yields all the admissible triples that were known up to now (with one
exception) as well as new ones.
