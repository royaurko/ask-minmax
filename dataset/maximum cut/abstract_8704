The Levy stability analysis is carried out for e+e- collisions at Z^0 mass
using Monte Carlo method. The Levy index \mu is found to be \mu=1.701 +- 0.043.
The self-similar generalized dimensions D(q) and multi-fractal spectrum
f(\alpha) are presented. The Renyi dimension D(q) decreases with increasing q.
The self-similar multi-fractal spectrum is a convex curve with a maximum at q =
0, \alpha = 1.169 +- 0.011. The right-side part of the spectrum, corresponding
to negative values of q is obtained through analytical continuation.
