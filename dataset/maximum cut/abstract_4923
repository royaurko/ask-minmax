We analyse subleading electroweak effects in the top anti-top resonance
production region in e+ e- collisions which arise due to the decay of the top
and anti-top quarks into the W+ W- b bbar final state. These are NLO
corrections adopting the non-relativistic power counting v ~ alpha_s ~
sqrt(alpha_EW). In contrast to the QCD corrections which have been calculated
(almost) up to NNNLO, the parametrically larger NLO electroweak contributions
have not been completely known so far, but are mandatory for the required
accuracy at a future linear collider. The missing parts of these NLO
contributions arise from matching coefficients of non-resonant production-decay
operators in unstable-particle effective theory which correspond to off-shell
top production and decay and other non-resonant irreducible background
processes to t tbar production. We consider the total cross section of the e+
e- -> W+ W- b bbar process and additionally implement cuts on the invariant
masses of the W+ b and W- bbar pairs.
