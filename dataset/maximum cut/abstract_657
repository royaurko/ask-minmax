We study gluon scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory at strong
coupling via the AdS/CFT correspondence. We solve numerically the discretized
Euler-Lagrange equations on the square worldsheet for the minimal surface with
light-like boundaries in AdS spacetime. We evaluate the area of the surface for
the 4, 6 and 8-point amplitudes using worldsheet and radial cut-off
regularizations. Their infrared singularities in the cut-off regularization are
found to agree with the analytical results near the cusp less than 5% at
520x520 lattice points.
