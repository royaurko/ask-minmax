A radion in a scenario with a warped extra dimension can be lighter than the
Higgs boson, even if the Kaluza-Klein excitation modes of the graviton turn out
to be in the multi-TeV region. The discovery of such a light radion would be
gateway to new physics. We show how the two-photon mode of decay can enable us
to probe a radion in the mass range 60 - 110 GeV. We take into account the
diphoton background, including fragmentation effects, and include cuts designed
to suppress the background to the maximum possible extent. Our conclusion is
that, with an integrated luminosity of 3000 $\rm fb^{-1}$ or less, the next run
of the Large Hadron Collider should be able to detect a radion in this mass
range, with a significance of 5 standard deviations or more.
