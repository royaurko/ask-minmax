In this paper we study the holographic dark energy in the formalism of
modified $f(R,T)$ gravity within the framework of a homogeneous and isotropic
flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe. We show that the Hubble horizon as an
IR cut-off in this modified theory is suitable to explain the recent
accelerated expansion of the Universe. We also discuss the statefinder
parameters and obtain the fixed point value of statefinder pair $\{r, s\}=\{1,
0\}$ as in the case of $\Lambda$CDM model under suitable constraints. As we
know that the phase transition is an integral part of the cosmic history, but
we do not get phase transition as the deceleration parameter comes out to be a
constant in this case. Therefore, we extend our analysis to viscous holographic
dark energy with same IR cut-off which gives the recent phase transition of the
Universe. In this case, we find that the value of statefinder pair matches with
$\Lambda$CDM model and shows the kinessence like behavior for the suitable
value of parameters.
