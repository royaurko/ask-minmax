We present a purely probabilistic proof of propagation of molecular chaos for
$N$-particle systems in dimension $3$ with interaction forces scaling like
$1/\vert q\vert^{\lambda}$ with $\lambda<2$ and cut-off at $q = N^{-1/3}$. The
proof yields a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between exact
microscopic and approximate mean-field dynamics. This can be used to show
propagation of molecular chaos, i.e. weak convergence of the marginals to the
corresponding products of solutions of the respective mean-field equation
without cut-off in a quantitative way. Our results thus lead to a derivation of
the Vlasov equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term
arbitrarily close to the physically relevant Coulomb- and gravitational forces.
