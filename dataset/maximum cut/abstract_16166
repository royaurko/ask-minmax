The high mass X-ray binary (HMXB) V0332+53 became active at the end of 2004
and the outburst was observed at hard X-rays by RXTE and INTEGRAL. Based on
these hard X-ray observations, the orbital parameters are measured through
fitting the Doppler-shifted spin periods. The derived orbital period and
eccentricity are consistent with those of Stella et al. (1985) obtained from
EXOSAT observations, whereas the projected semimajor axis and the periastron
longitude are found to have changed from 48$\pm$4 to 86$^{+6}_{-10}$ lt-s and
from 313$^{\circ}$$\pm$10 to 283$^{\circ}$$\pm$14, respectively. This would
indicate an angular speed of $\geq$ 1.5$^{\circ}$$\pm$0.8 yr$^{-1}$ for
rotation of the orbit over the past 21 years. The periastron passage time of
MJD 53367$\pm$1 is just around the time when the intensity reached maximum and
an orbital period earlier is the time when the outburst started. This
correlation resembles the behavior of a Type I outburst. During outburst the
source spun up with a rate of 8.01$^{+1.00}_{-1.14}$$\times10^{-6}$ s
day$^{-1}$. The evolution of pulse profile is highly intensity dependent. The
separation of double pulses remained almost constant ($\sim$ 0.47) when the
source was bright, and dropped to 0.37 within $\leq$ 3 days as the source
became weaker. The pulse evolution of V0332+53 may correlate to the change in
dominance of the emission between fan-beam and pencil-beam mechanisms.
