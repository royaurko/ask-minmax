We report on the study of the mass-radius (M-R) relation and the radial
oscillations of proto strange stars. For the quark matter we have employed the
well known density dependent quark mass model and its very recent modification,
the temperature and density dependent quark mass model. We find that the
maximum mass the star can support increases significantly with the temperature
of the star in this model which implies that transition to a black hole at the
early stage of formation of the star is inhibited. As for the neutrinos, we
find, contrary to the expectation that the M-R and oscillation frequencies are
almost independent of the neutrino chemical potentials.
