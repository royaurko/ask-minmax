We studied the application of statistical reconstruction algorithms, namely
maximum likelihood and least squares methods, to the problem of event
reconstruction in a dual phase liquid xenon detector. An iterative method was
developed for in-situ reconstruction of the PMT light response functions from
calibration data taken with an uncollimated gamma-ray source. Using the
techniques described, the performance of the ZEPLIN-III dark matter detector
was studied for 122 keV gamma-rays. For the inner part of the detector (R<100
mm), spatial resolutions of 13 mm and 1.6 mm FWHM were measured in the
horizontal plane for primary and secondary scintillation, respectively. An
energy resolution of 8.1% FWHM was achieved at that energy. The possibility of
using this technique for improving performance and reducing cost of
scintillation cameras for medical applications is currently under study.
