This paper summarizes the design of a programmable processor with transport
triggered architecture (TTA) for decoding LDPC and turbo codes. The processor
architecture is designed in such a manner that it can be programmed for LDPC or
turbo decoding for the purpose of internetworking and roaming between different
networks. The standard trellis based maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm is
used for turbo decoding. Unlike most other implementations, a supercode based
sum-product algorithm is used for the check node message computation for LDPC
decoding. This approach ensures the highest hardware utilization of the
processor architecture for the two different algorithms. Up to our knowledge,
this is the first attempt to design a TTA processor for the LDPC decoder. The
processor is programmed with a high level language to meet the time-to-market
requirement. The optimization techniques and the usage of the function units
for both algorithms are explained in detail. The processor achieves 22.64 Mbps
throughput for turbo decoding with a single iteration and 10.12 Mbps throughput
for LDPC decoding with five iterations for a clock frequency of 200 MHz.
