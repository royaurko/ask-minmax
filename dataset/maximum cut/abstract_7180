We give a short proof of an inequality, conjectured by Tsfasman and proved by
Serre, for the maximum number of points on hypersurfaces over finite fields.
Further, we consider a conjectural extension, due to Tsfasman and Boguslavsky,
of this inequality to an explicit formula for the maximum number of common
solutions of a system of linearly independent multivariate homogeneous
polynomials of the same degree with coefficients in a finite field. This
conjecture is shown to be false, in general, but is also shown to hold in the
affirmative in a special case. Applications to generalized Hamming weights of
projective Reed-Muller codes are outlined and a comparison with an older
conjecture of Lachaud and a recent result of Couvreur is given.
