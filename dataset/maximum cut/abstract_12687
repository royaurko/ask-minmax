As an attempt to understand the homochirality of organic molecules in life, a
chemical reaction model is proposed where the production of chiral monomers
from achiral substrate is catalyzed by the polymers of the same enatiomeric
type. This system has to be open because in a closed system the enhanced
production of chiral monomers by enzymes is compensated by the associated
enhancement in back reaction, and the chiral symmetry is conserved. Open flow
without cross inhibition is shown to lead to the chirality selection in a
general model. In polymerization, the influx of substrate from the ambience and
the efflux of chiral products for purposes other than the catalyst production
make the system necessarily open. The chiral symmetry is found to be broken if
the influx of substrate lies within a finite interval. As the efficiency of the
enzyme increases, the maximum value of the enantiomeric excess approaches unity
so that the chirality selection becomes complete.
