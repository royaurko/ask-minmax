We investigate nuclear matter equations of state in neutron star with kaon
condensation. It is generally known that the existence of kaons in neutron star
makes the equation of state soft so that the maximum mass of neutron star is
not likely to be greater than 2.0 $M_{\odot}$, the maximum mass constrained by
current observations. With existing Skyrme force model parameters, we calculate
nuclear equations of state and check the possibility of kaon condensation in
the core of neutron stars. The results show that even with the kaon
condensation, the nuclear equation of state satisfies both the maximum mass and
the allowed ranges of mass and radius.
