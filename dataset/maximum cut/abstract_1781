We determine the minimum sum--connectivity index of bicyclic graphs with $n$
vertices and matching number $m$, where $2\le m\le \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$,
the minimum and the second minimum, as well as the maximum and the second
maximum sum--connectivity indices of bicyclic graphs with $n\ge 5$ vertices.
The extremal graphs are characterized.
