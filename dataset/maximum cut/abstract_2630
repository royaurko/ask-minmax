Magnetic field enhancement has been studied in the past through replica and
cavity cutting. Considerable progress of niobium cavity manufacturing and
processing has been made since then. Wide variety of single cell cavities has
been analyzed through replica technique. Their RF performances were compared in
corresponding to geometric RF surface quality. It is concluded that the surface
roughness affects cavity performance mostly in secondary role. The other
factors must have played primary role in cavity performance limitations.
