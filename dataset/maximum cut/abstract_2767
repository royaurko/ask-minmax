We study partial orders on the information sets of polar codes designed for
binary discrete memoryless channels. We show that the basic polarization
transformations defined by Ar{\i}kan preserve `symmetric convex/concave
orders'. While for symmetric channels this ordering turns out to be equivalent
to the stochastic degradation ordering already known to order the information
sets of polar codes, we show that a strictly weaker partial order is obtained
when at least one of the channels is asymmetric. We also discuss two tools
which can be useful for verifying `symmetric convex/concave ordering': a
criterion known as the cut criterion and channel symmetrization.
