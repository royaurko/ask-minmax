The wiretap channel models secure communication of two users in the presence
of a non-legitimate eavesdropper who must be kept ignorant of transmitted
messages. The performance of such a system is usually characterized by its
secrecy capacity determining the maximum transmission rate of secure
communication. In this paper, the issue of whether the secrecy capacity is a
continuous function of the system parameters or not is examined. In particular,
this is done for channel uncertainty modeled via compound channels and
arbitrarily varying channels, in which the legitimate users know only that the
true channel realization is from a pre-specified uncertainty set. In the former
model, this realization remains constant for the whole duration of
transmission, while in the latter the realization varies from channel use to
channel use in an unknown and arbitrary manner. These models not only capture
the case of channel uncertainty, but are also suitable to model scenarios in
which a malicious adversary influences or jams the legitimate transmission. The
secrecy capacity of the compound wiretap channel is shown to be robust in the
sense that it is a continuous function of the uncertainty set. Thus, small
variations in the uncertainty set lead to small variations in secrecy capacity.
On the other hand, the deterministic secrecy capacity of the arbitrarily
varying wiretap channel is shown to be discontinuous in the uncertainty set
meaning that small variations can lead to dramatic losses in capacity.
