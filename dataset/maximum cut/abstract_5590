The term knowledge management (KM) first came to prominence in the late
1990s. Although initially dismissed as a fad, KM continues to be featured in
articles concerning business productivity and innovation. And yet, clear-cut
examples that demonstrate the success of KM are few and far between. A brief
examination of the history of KM explores the reasons for this and looks at
some of the assumptions about what KM can achieve. A subsequent analysis of the
experiences of Infosys with KM shows that for KM to be successful,
organizational leaders need to engage in a continuous process of modification
and maintenance. Although KM initiatives can be made to yield worthwhile
returns over an extended period, there are often substantial ongoing costs
associated with them.
