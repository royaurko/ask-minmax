For models which exhibit a continuous phase transition in the thermodynamic
limit a numerical study of small systems reveals a non-monotonic behaviour of
the microcanonical specific heat as a function of the system size. This is in
contrast to a treatment in the canonical ensemble where the maximum of the
specific heat increases monotonically with the size of the system. A
phenomenological theory is developed which permits to describe this peculiar
behaviour of the microcanonical specific heat and allows in principle the
determination of microcanonical critical exponents.
