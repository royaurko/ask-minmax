Absorption of a photon by an electron moving parallel to a rough surface is
studied.In the weak scattering regime we have evaluated the absorption
probability of absorption of a single photon. It is shown the absorption
probability with diffusional contribution becomes large by a lin/l factor
compared to the analogous result with the single scattering contribution. The
maximum of probability takes place for the infrared wavelengths and strongly
depends on the particle energy. We also discuss the case of two-dimensional
periodical surface profile and indicate optimal conditions for maximal
absorption probability. The results can be used in electron energy gain
spectroscopy and in laser-driven acceleration.
