Recently attention has been drawn to practical problems with the use of
unbounded Pareto distributions, for instance when there are natural upper
bounds that truncate the probability tail. Aban, Meerschaert and Panorska
(2006) derived the maximum likelihood estimator for the Pareto tail index of a
truncated Pareto distribution with a right truncation point $T$. The Hill
(1975) estimator is then obtained by letting $T \to \infty$. The problem of
extreme value estimation under right truncation was also introduced in Nuyts
(2010) who proposed a similar estimator for the tail index and considered
trimming of the number of extreme order statistics. Given that in practice one
does not always know whether the distribution is truncated or not, we discuss
estimators for the Pareto index and extreme quantiles both under truncated and
non-truncated Pareto-type distributions. We also propose a truncated Pareto
QQ-plot in order to help deciding between a truncated and a non-truncated case.
In this way we extend the classical extreme value methodology adding the
truncated Pareto-type model with truncation point $T \to \infty$ as the sample
size $n \to \infty$. Finally we present some practical examples, asymptotics
and simulation results.
