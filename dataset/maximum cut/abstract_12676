We present strategies based upon extremization principles, in the case of the
axisymmetric equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We study the equilibrium
shape by using a minimum energy principle under the constraints of the MHD
axisymmetric equations. We also propose a numerical algorithm based on a
maximum energy dissipation principle to compute in a consistent way the
equilibrium states. Then, we develop the statistical mechanics of such flows
and recover the same equilibrium states giving a justification of the minimum
energy principle. We find that fluctuations obey a Gaussian shape and we make
the link between the conservation of the Casimirs on the coarse-grained scale
and the process of energy dissipation.
