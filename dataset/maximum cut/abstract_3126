The macro-to-micro transition in a heterogeneous material is envisaged as the
selection of a probability distribution by the Principle of Maximum Entropy
(MAXENT). The material is made of constituents, e.g. given crystal
orientations. Each constituent is itself made of a large number of elementary
constituents. The relevant probability is the volume fraction of the elementary
constituents that belong to a given constituent and undergo a given stimulus.
Assuming only obvious constraints in MAXENT means describing a maximally
disordered material. This is proved to have the same average stimulus in each
constituent. By adding a constraint in MAXENT, a new model, potentially
interesting e.g. for texture prediction, is obtained.
