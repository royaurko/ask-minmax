We have started a search for High Redshift Radio Galaxies (HZRGs) in an area
covering 7 sr by selecting a sample of Ultra Steep Spectrum (USS) sources with
a low flux density cut-off S(1400 MHz) > 10 mJy and a steep spectral index
cut-off of alpha < -1.3 (S ~ nu**alpha) from the WENSS, NVSS and TEXAS surveys.
Our first results for 27 sources show that we are almost twice as effective in
finding HZRGs than than surveys of relatively bright radio sources with a
spectral index cut-off of alpha < -1.0. The redshift distribution is consistent
with an extension of the z - alpha relation to alpha < -1.3, but a large
fraction of our sample (40%) consists of objects which are too faint to observe
with 3-4m class telescopes. Our search is aimed at increasing the number of
very high redshift radio galaxies for further detailed studies of the formation
and evolution of massive galaxies and their environment.
