We report on the first detection of ionospheric disturbances caused by short
repeated gamma-ray bursts from the magnetar SGR J1550-5418. Very low frequency
(VLF) radio wave data obtained in South America clearly show sudden amplitude
and phase changes at the corresponding times of eight SGR bursts. Maximum
amplitude and phase changes of the VLF signals appear to be correlated with the
gamma-ray fluence. On the other hand, VLF recovery timescales do not show any
significant correlation with the fluence, possibly suggesting that the bursts'
spectra are not similar to each other. In summary, the Earth's ionosphere can
be used as a very large gamma-ray detector and the VLF observations provide us
with a new method to monitor high energy astrophysical phenomena without
interruption such as Earth Occultation.
