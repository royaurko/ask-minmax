We explore the relevance of color superconductivity inside a possible quark
matter core for the bulk properties of neutron stars. For the quark phase we
use an Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type model, extended to include diquark
condensates. For the hadronic phase, a microscopic many-body model is adopted,
with and without strangeness content. In our calculations, a sharp boundary is
assumed between the hadronic and the quark phases. For NJL model parameters
fitted to vacuum properties we find that no star with a pure quark core does
exist. Nevertheless the presence of color superconducting phases can lower the
neutron star maximum mass substantially. In some cases, the transition to quark
matter occurs only if color superconductivity is present. Once the quark phase
is introduced, the value of the maximum mass stays in any case below the value
of two solar masses.
