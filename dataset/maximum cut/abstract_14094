In this paper, we consider the transmission of confidential messages over
slow fading wireless channels in the presence of an eavesdropper. We propose a
transmission scheme that employs a single reconfigurable antenna at each of the
legitimate partners, whereas the eavesdropper uses a single conventional
antenna. A reconfigurable antenna can switch its propagation characteristics
over time and thus it perceives different fading channels. It is shown that
without channel side information (CSI) at the legitimate partners, the main
channel can be transformed into an ergodic regime offering a \textit{secrecy
capacity} gain for strict outage constraints. If the legitimate partners have
partial or full channel side information (CSI), a sort of selection diversity
can be applied boosting the maximum secret communication rate. In this case,
fading acts as a friend not a foe.
