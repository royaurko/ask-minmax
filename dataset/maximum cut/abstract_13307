CaFe2As2 single crystals under uniaxial pressure applied along the c axis
exhibit the coexistence of several structural phases at low temperatures. We
show that the room-temperature tetragonal phase is stabilized at low
temperatures for pressures above 0.06 GPa, and its weight fraction attains a
maximum in the region where superconductivity is observed under applied
uniaxial pressure. Simultaneous resistivity measurements strongly suggest that
this phase is responsible for the superconductivity in CaFe2As2 found below 10
K in samples subjected to nonhydrostatic pressure conditions.
