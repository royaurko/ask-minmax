We examine the motion of a charged particle in the vicinity of a weakly
magnetized naked singularity. The escape velocity and energy of the particle
moving around the naked singularity after being kicked by another particle or
photon are investigated. Also at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)
escape velocity and energy are examined. Effective potential and angular
momentum of the particle are also discussed. We discuss the center of mass
energy after collision between two particles having same mass and opposite
charges moving along the same circular orbit in the opposite direction. It is
investigated that under what conditions maximum energy can be produced as a
result of collision.
