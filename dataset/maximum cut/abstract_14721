We have presented the observations of O {\small VI} absorption at 1032 \AA\
towards 22 sightlines in 10 superbubbles (SBs) of the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) using the data obtained from the {\em Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic
Explorer (FUSE)}. The estimated abundance of O {\small VI} in the SBs varies
from a minimum of (1.09 $\pm$0.22)$\times10^{14}$ atoms/cm$^{2}$ in SB N206 to
a maximum of (3.71$\pm$0.23)$\times10^{14}$ atoms/cm$^{2}$ in SB N70. We find
about a 46% excess in the abundance of O {\small VI} in the SBs compared to the
non-SB lines of sight. Even inside a SB, O {\small VI} column density (N(O
{\small VI})) varies by about a factor of 2 to 2.5. These data are useful in
understanding the nature of the hot gas in SBs.
