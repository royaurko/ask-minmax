Two approximations are frequently used in statistical physics: the first one,
which we shall name the mean values approximation, is generally (and
improperly) named as "maximum term approximation". The second is the "Stirling
approximation". In this paper we demonstrate that the error introduced by the
first approximation is exactly compensated by the second approximation in the
calculation of mean values of multinomial distributions.
