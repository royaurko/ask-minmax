Using one-step solid state reaction method, we have successfully synthesized
the superconductor SrFe1-xRuxAs. X-ray diffraction indicates that the material
has formed the ThCr2Si2-type structure with a space group I4/mmm. The
systematic evolution of the lattice constants demonstrates that the Fe ions are
successfully replaced by the Ru. By increasing the doping content of Ru, the
spin-density-wave (SDW) transition in the parent compound is suppressed and
superconductivity emerges. The maximum superconducting transition temperature
is found at 13.5 K with the doping level of x = 0.7. The temperature dependence
of DC magnetization confirms superconducting transitions at around 12 K. Our
results indicate that similar to non-isoelectronic substitution, isoelectronic
substitution contributes to changes in both the carrier concentration and
internal pressure, and superconductivity could be induced by isoelectronic
substitution.
