Using Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD), we study heavy quark mass dependence of
S-wave and P-wave bottomonium correlators for 0.42Tc <= T <= 2.09Tc and study
spectral functions of S-wave bottomonium states moving in a thermal bath at
these temperatures using Maximum Entropy Method with NRQCD kernel. For the
studied momentum range, the energy of moving states shows quadratic
momentum-dependence and the width of moving states does not show significant
changes as the momentum of bottomonium is increased. Also, we find that in
correlator ratios, the temperature effect is larger than the effect caused by
20% change in the bottom quark mass.
