A main difficulty in the quantization of the gravitational field is the lack
of experiments that discriminate among the theories proposed to quantize
gravity. Recently we showed that the Standard Model(SM) itself contains tiny
Lorentz invariance violation(LIV) terms coming from QG. All terms depend on one
arbitrary parameter $\alpha$ that set the scale of QG effects. In this talk we
review the LIV for mesons nucleons and leptons and apply it to study several
effects, including the GZK anomaly.
