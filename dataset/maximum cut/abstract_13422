in data warehouse is a compulsion and become the most important for information
delivery, without multidimensional datawarehouse is incomplete.
Multidimensional give ability to analyze business measurement in many different
ways. Multidimensional is also synonymous with online analytical processing
(OLAP). By using some concepts in datawarehouse like slice-dice,drill down and
roll up will increase the ability of multidimensional datawarehouse. The
research question and the discussing for this paper are how much deepest the
multidimensional ability from each fact table in datawarehouse. By using the
statistic combination formula we try to explore the combination that can be
yielded from each dimension in hypercubes, the entire of dimensi combination,
minimum combination and maximum combination.
