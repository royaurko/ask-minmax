Helical structures are common in extragalactic jets. They are usually
attributed in the literature to periodical phenomena in the source (e.g.,
precession). In this work, we use VLBI data of the radio-jet in the quasar S5
0836+710 and hypothesize that the ridge-line of helical jets like this
corresponds to a pressure maximum in the jet and assume that the helically
twisted pressure maximum is the result of a helical wave pattern. For our
study, we use observations of the jet in S5 0836+710 at different frequencies
and epochs. The results show that the structures observed are physical and not
generated artificially by the observing arrays. Our hypothesis that the
observed intensity ridge-line can correspond to a helically twisted pressure
maximum is confirmed by our observational tests. This interpretation allows us
to explain jet misalignment between parsec and kiloparsec scales when the
viewing angle is small, and also brings us to the conclusion that
high-frequency observations may show only a small region of the jet flow
concentrated around the maximum pressure ridge-line observed at low
frequencies. Our work provides a potential explanation for the apparent
transversal superluminal speeds observed in several extragalactic jets by means
of transversal shift of an apparent core position with time.
