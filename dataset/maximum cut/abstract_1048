We study lattice QCD with two flavors of dynamical domain wall quarks. With
renormalization group motivated actions, we find chiral symmetry can be
preserved to a high degree at lattice cut off of a^{-1} \sim 2 GeV even for
fifth dimension size as small as L_s = 12. In addition two new steps are
introduced to improve the performance of the hybrid Monte Carlo simulation.
