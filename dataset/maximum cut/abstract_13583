We study the screening length of a heavy quark-antiquark pair in strongly
coupled gauge theory plasmas flowing at velocity v following a proposal by Liu,
Rajagopal, and Wiedemann. We analyze the screening length as the direction of
the plasma winds vary. To leading order in v, this angle-dependence can be
studied analytically for many theories by extending our previous formalism. We
show that the screening length is locally a minimum (maximum) when the pair is
perpendicular (parallel) to the plasma winds, which has been observed for the
N=4 plasma. Also, we compare AdS/CFT results with weak coupling ones, and we
discuss the subleading dependence on v for the Dp-brane.
