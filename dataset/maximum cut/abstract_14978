We implement momentum strategies using reward-risk measures as ranking
criteria based on classical tempered stable distribution. Performances and risk
characteristics for the alternative portfolios are obtained in various asset
classes and markets. The reward-risk momentum strategies with lower volatility
levels outperform the traditional momentum strategy regardless of asset class
and market. Additionally, the alternative portfolios are not only less riskier
in risk measures such as VaR, CVaR and maximum drawdown but also characterized
by thinner downside tails. Similar patterns in performance and risk profile are
also found at the level of each ranking basket in the reward-risk portfolios.
Higher factor-neutral returns achieved by the reward-risk momentum strategies
are statistically significant and large portions of the performances are not
explained by the Carhart four-factor model.
