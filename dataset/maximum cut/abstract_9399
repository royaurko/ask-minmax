The dining cryptographers protocol implements a multiple access channel in
which senders and recipients are anonymous. A problem is that a malicious
participant can disrupt communication by deliberately creating collisions. We
propose a computationally secure dining cryptographers protocol with collision
resolution that achieves a maximum stable throughput of 0.924 messages per
round and which allows to easily detect disruptors.
