We study the growth of matter perturbations beyond the linear level in
cosmologies in which the dark energy has a variable equation of state. The
non-linear corrections result in shifts in the positions of the maximum, minima
and nodes of the spectrum within the range of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations.
These can be used in order to distinguish theories with different late-time
variability of the equation of state.
