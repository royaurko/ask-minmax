The IceCube neutrino spectrum shows a flux which falls of as $E^{-2}$ for sub
PeV energies but there are no neutrino events observed above 2 PeV. In
particular the Glashow resonance expected at 6.3 PeV is not seen. We examine a
Planck scale Lorentz violation as a mechanism for explaining the cutoff of
observed neutrino energies around a few PeV. By choosing the one free parameter
the cut-off in neutrino energy can be chosen to be between 2 and 6.3 PeV. We
assume that neutrinos have a dispersion relation $E^2=p^2 -
(\xi_3/M_{Pl})~p^3$, and find that even when neutrinos are subluminal the pion
decay is suppressed at neutrino energies of order of few PeV. We find that the
muon decay being a two-neutrino process is enhanced. The $K^-\rightarrow \pi^0
e^- \bar \nu_e$ is also suppressed with a cut-off neutrino energy of same order
of magnitude. If no Glashow resonance events are seen in the future then the
Lorentz violation can be a viable explanation for the IceCube observations at
PeV energies.
