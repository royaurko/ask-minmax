The Blazhko effect in CX Lyr has been reported for the first time by Le
Borgne et al. (2007). The contributors have pointed out that the Blazhko period was
not evaluated accurately due to dataset scarcity. The possible period values
announced were 128 or 227 days. A newly conducted four-month observing campaign
in 2008 (fifty-nine observation nights) has provided fourteen times of maximum.
From a period analysis of measured times of maximum, a Blazhko period of 62 +/-
2 days can be suggested. However, the present dataset is still not densely
sampled enough to exclude that the measured period is still a modulation of the
real Blazhko period. Indeed the shape of the (O-C) curve does not repeat itself
exactly during the campaign duration.
