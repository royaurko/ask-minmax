High resolution MERLIN observations of a newly-discovered four-image
gravitational lens system, B0128+437, are presented. The system was found after
a careful re-analysis of the entire CLASS dataset. The MERLIN observations
resolve four components in a characteristic quadruple-image configuration; the
maximum image separation is 542 mas and the total flux density is 48 mJy at 5
GHz. A best-fit lens model with a singular isothermal ellipsoid results in
large errors in the image positions. A significantly improved fit is obtained
after the addition of a shear component, suggesting that the lensing system is
more complex and may consist of multiple deflectors. The integrated radio
spectrum of the background source indicates that it is a GigaHertz-Peaked
Spectrum (GPS) source. It may therefore be possible to resolve structure within
the radio images with deep VLBI observations and thus better constrain the
lensing mass distribution.
