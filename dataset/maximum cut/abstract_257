Three widely used scenaria for defining cuts on transverse energies of jets
in ep collisions are discussed. All of them are shown to suffer from the same
sort of unphysical behaviour when the cut regions are subject to additional
constraints. This feature is inherent in the very way dijet cross sections are
defined and cannot be avoided. In particular, the symmetric cut scenario is
shown to be equally suitable for the comparison with NLO QCD calculations as
the asymmetric or sum-like ones.
