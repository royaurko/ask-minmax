We have derived an X-ray luminosity function using parallax-based distance
measurements of a set of 12 dwarf novae, consisting of Suzaku, XMM-Newton and
ASCA observations. The shape of the X-ray luminosity function obtained is the
most accurate to date, and the luminosities of our sample are concentrated
between ~10^{30}-10^{31} erg s^{-1}, lower than previous measurements of X-ray
luminosity functions of dwarf novae. Based on the integrated X-ray luminosity
function, the sample becomes more incomplete below ~3 x 10^{30} erg s^{-1} than
it is above this luminosity limit, and the sample is dominated by X-ray bright
dwarf novae. The total integrated luminosity within a radius of 200 pc is 1.48
x 10^{32} erg s^{-1} over the luminosity range of 1 x 10^{28} erg s^{-1} and
the maximum luminosity of the sample (1.50 x 10^{32} erg s^{-1}). The total
absolute lower limit for the normalised luminosity per solar mass is 1.81 x
10^{26} erg s^{-1} M^{-1}_{solar} which accounts for ~16 per cent of the total
X-ray emissivity of CVs as estimated by Sazonov et al. (2006).
