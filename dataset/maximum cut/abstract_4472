We reexamine the oscillator construction of the D25-brane solution and the
tachyon fluctuation mode of vacuum string field theory given previously. Both
the classical solution and the tachyon mode are found to violate
infinitesimally their determining equations in the level cut-off
regularization. We study the effects of these violations on physical quantities
such as the tachyon mass and the ratio of the energy density of the solution
relative to the D25-brane tension. We discuss a possible way to resolve the
problem of reproducing the expected value of one for the ratio.
