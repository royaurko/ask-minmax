We establish necessary conditions for the appearance of both apparent
horizons and singularities in the initial data of spherically symmetric general
relativity when spacetime is foliated extrinsically. When the dominant energy
condition is satisfied these conditions assume a particularly simple form. Let
$\rho_{Max}$ be the maximum value of the energy density and $\ell$ the radial
measure of its support. If $\rho_{Max}\ell^2$ is bounded from above by some
numerical constant, the initial data cannot possess an apparent horizon. This
constant does not depend sensitively on the gauge. An analogous inequality is
obtained for singularities with some larger constant. The derivation exploits
Poincar\'e type inequalities to bound integrals over certain spatial scalars. A
novel approach to the construction of analogous necessary conditions for
general initial data is suggested.
