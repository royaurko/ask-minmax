An efficient algorithm for computing lower bounds on the global linear
complexity of nonlinearly filtered PN-sequences is presented. The technique
here developed is based exclusively on the realization of bit wise logic
operations, which makes it appropriate for both software simulation and
hardware implementation. The present algorithm can be applied to any arbitrary
nonlinear function with a unique term of maximum order. Thus, the extent of its
application for different types of filter generators is quite broad.
Furthermore, emphasis is on the large lower bounds obtained that confirm the
exponential growth of the global linear complexity for the class of nonlinearly
filtered sequences.
