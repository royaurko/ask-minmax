We introduce a notion of position-space cuts of eikonal diagrams, the set of
diagrams appearing in the perturbative expansion of the correlator of a set of
straight semi-infinite Wilson lines. The cuts are applied directly to the
position-space representation of any such diagram and compute its imaginary
part to the leading order in the dimensional regulator. Our cutting
prescription thus defines a position-space analog of the standard
momentum-space Cutkosky rules. Unlike momentum-space cuts which put internal
lines on shell, position-space cuts constrain a number of the gauge bosons
exchanged between the energetic partons to be lightlike, leading to a vanishing
and a non-vanishing imaginary part for space- and timelike kinematics,
respectively.
