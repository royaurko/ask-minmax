We present deep, high velocity resolution (~1.6 km/s) Giant Meterwave Radio
Telescope HI 21cm synthesis images for the faint (M_B ~ -12.1) dwarf irregular
galaxy GR8. We find that the velocity field of the galaxy shows a clear
systematic large scale pattern, with a maximum amplitude ~10 km/s. Neither pure
rotation, nor pure radial motion alone can fit the observed velocity field;
however a combination of radial and circular motions can provide a reasonable
fit. The most natural interpretation is that the neutral ISM, in addition to
rotating about the center, is also expanding outwards, as a result of energy
input from the ongoing star formation in the galaxy. Support for this
interpretation comes from the fact that the pressure in the HII regions in the
galaxy is known to be substantially (~55 times) more than the average pressure
in the gas disk. It is, however, also possible that the velocity field is the
result of the gas swirling inwards, in which case GR8 could be in the process
of formation via the merger of subgalactic clumps.
