One of the most exciting prospects for the LISA gravitational wave
observatory is the detection of gravitational radiation from the inspiral of a
compact object into a supermassive black hole. The large inspiral parameter
space and low amplitude of the signal makes detection of these sources
computationally challenging. We outline here a first cut data analysis scheme
that assumes realistic computational resources. In the context of this scheme,
we estimate the signal-to-noise ratio that a source requires to pass our
thresholds and be detected. Combining this with an estimate of the population
of sources in the Universe, we estimate the number of inspiral events that LISA
could detect. The preliminary results are very encouraging -- with the baseline
design, LISA can see inspirals out to a redshift z=1 and should detect over a
thousand events during the mission lifetime.
