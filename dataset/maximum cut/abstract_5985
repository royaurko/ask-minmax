We introduce a generalized Maximum Abelian Gauge (MAG). We work with this new
gauge on 12^4 lattices for beta=5.7,5.8 and 16^4 lattices for beta=5.9,6.0. We
also introduce a form of abelian projection related to the generalized MAG. We
measure U(1)xU(1) wilson loops and single color magnetic current densities.
