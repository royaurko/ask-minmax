This paper is concerned with the estimation of the period of an unknown
periodic function in Gaussian white noise. A class of estimators of the period
is constructed by means of a penalized maximum likelihood method. A
second-order asymptotic expansion of the risk of these estimators is obtained.
Moreover, the minimax problem for the second-order term is studied and an
estimator of the preceding class is shown to be second order efficient.
