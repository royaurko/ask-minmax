It is argued that the title of this paper represents a misconception.
Contrary to widespread beliefs it is electromagnetic field modes that are
``systems'' and can be entangled, not photons. The amount of entanglement in a
given state is shown to depend on redefinitions of the modes; we calculate the
minimum and maximum over all such redefinitions for several examples.
