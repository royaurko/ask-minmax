In this paper, we analyze the performance of space-time block codes which
enable symbolwise maximum likelihood decoding. We derive an upper bound of
maximum mutual information (MMI) on space-time block codes that enable
symbolwise maximum likelihood decoding for a frequency non-selective
quasi-static fading channel. MMI is an upper bound on how much one can send
information with vanishing error probability by using the target code.
