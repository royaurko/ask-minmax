We demonstrate that thermoelectric currents in superconducting bilayers with
a spin-active interface are controlled by the two competing processes. On one
hand, spin-sensitive quasiparticle scattering at such interface generates
electron-hole imbalance and yields orders-of-magnitude enhancement of the
thermoelectric effect in the system. On the other hand, this electron-hole
imbalance gets suppressed in the superconductor bulk due to electron scattering
on non-magnetic impurities. As a result, large thermoelectric currents can only
flow in the vicinity of the spin-active interface and decay away from this
interface at a distance exceeding the electron elastic mean free path $\ell$.
The magnitude of the thermoelectric effect reaches its maximum provided $\ell$
becomes of order of the total bilayer thickness.
