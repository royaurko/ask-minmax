We consider the discrete three dimensional scan statistics. Viewed as the
maximum of an 1-dependent stationary r.v.'s sequence, we provide approximations
and error bounds for the probability distribution of the three dimensional scan
statistics. Importance sampling algorithm is used to obtains sharp bounds for
the simulation error. Simulation results and comparisons with other
approximations are presented for the binomial and Poisson models.
