We develop a multi-level restricted Gaussian maximum likelihood method for
estimating the covariance function parameters and computing the best unbiased
predictor. Our approach produces a new set of multi-level contrasts where the
deterministic parameters of the model are filtered out thus enabling the
estimation of the covariance parameters to be decoupled from the deterministic
component. Moreover, the multi-level covariance matrix of the contrasts
exhibits fast decay that is dependent on the smoothness of the covariance
function. Due to the fast decay of the multi-level covariance matrix
coefficients only a small set is computed with a level dependent criterion. We
demonstrate our approach on problems of up to 512,000 observations with a
Matern covariance function.
