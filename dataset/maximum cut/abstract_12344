We present the result of a calculation of the next-to-leading correction to
the Higgs propagator in the 1/N expansion, where the Higgs sector is treated as
an O(N) symmetric sigma-model. The results are compared with two-loop
perturbation theory. The existing discrepancy between the lowest order of the
1/N expansion and perturbation theory is dramatically reduced by including the
NLO in 1/N. We find a maximum effective Higgs mass of 930-980 GeV. We give an
approximate relation between Higgs width and mass, which can be used for
phenomenological purposes.
