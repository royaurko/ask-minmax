The two-orbital superconducting state is modeled by on-site intra-orbital
negative-U Hubbard correlations together with inter-orbital pair-transfer
interactions. The critical temperature is mainly governed by intra-orbital
attractive interactions and it can pass through an additional maximum as a
function of band filling. For the certain number of electrons the clear
interband proximity effect is observable in the superconducting state of the
band with a smaller gap. The influence of band fillings and orbital site
energies on the temperature dependencies of two-component superconductivity
coherence lengths and magnetic field penetration depth is analyzed. The
presence of proximity effect is probably reflected in the relative temperature
behaviour of characteristic lengths.
