This paper presents a novel method to recognize stem - calyx of an apple
using shape descriptors. The main drawback of existing apple grading techniques
is that stem - calyx part of an apple is treated as defects, this leads to poor
grading of apples. In order to overcome this drawback, we proposed an approach
to recognize stem-calyx and differentiated from true defects based on shape
features. Our method comprises of steps such as segmentation of apple using
grow-cut method, candidate objects such as stem-calyx and small defects are
detected using multi-threshold segmentation. The shape features are extracted
from detected objects using Multifractal, Fourier and Radon descriptor and
finally stem-calyx regions are recognized and differentiated from true defects
using SVM classifier. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using experiments
conducted on apple image dataset and results exhibit considerable improvement
in recognition of stem-calyx region compared to other techniques.
