The infrared properties of lattice Landau gauge QCD of SU(3) are studied by
measuring gluon propagator, ghost propagator, QCD running coupling and
Kugo-Ojima parameter of $\beta=6.0, 16^4,24^4,32^4$ and $\beta=6.4, 32^4, 48^4,
56^4$ lattices. By the larger lattice measurements, we observe that the
runnning coupling measured by the product of the gluon dressing function and
the ghost dressing function squared rescaled to the perturbative QCD results
near the highest lattice momentum has the maximum of about 2.2 at around
$q=0.5$ GeV/c, and behaves either approaching constant or even decreasing as
$q$ approaches zero. The magnitude of the Kugo-Ojima parameter is getting
larger but staying around -0.83 in contrast to the expected value -1 in the
continuum theory. We observe, however, there is an exceptional sample which has
larger magnitude of the Kugo-Ojima parameter and stronger infrared singularity
of the ghost propagator. The reflection positivity of the 1-d Fourier transform
of the gluon propagator of the exceptional sample is manifestly violated.
  Gribov noise problem was studied by performing the fundamental modular gauge
(FMG) fixing with use of the parallel tempering method of $\beta=2.2, 16^4$
SU(2) configurations. Findings are that the gluon propagator almost does not
suffer noises, but the Kugo-Ojima parameter and the ghost propagator in the FMG
becomes $\sim 5$% less in the infrared region than those suffering noises. It
is expected that these qualitative aspects seen in SU(2) will reflect in the
infrared properties of SU(3) QCD as well.
