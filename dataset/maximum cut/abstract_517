A dijoin in a digraph is a set of edges meeting every directed cut. D. R.
Woodall conjectured in 1976 that if G is a digraph, and every directed cut of G
has at least k edges, then there are k pairwise disjoint dijoins. This remains
open, but a capacitated version is known to be false. In particular, A.
Schrijver gave a digraph G and a subset S of its edge-set, such that every
directed cut contains at least two edges in S, and yet there do not exist two
disjoint dijoins included in S. In Schrijver's example, G is planar, and the
subdigraph formed by the edges in S consists of three disjoint paths.
  We conjecture that when k = 2, the disconnectedness of S is crucial: more
precisely, that if G is a digraph, and S is a subset of the edges of G that
forms a connected subdigraph (as an undirected graph), and every directed cut
of G contains at least two edges in S, then we can partition S into two
dijoins.
  We prove this in two special cases: when G is planar, and when the subdigraph
formed by the edges in S is a subdivision of a caterpillar.
