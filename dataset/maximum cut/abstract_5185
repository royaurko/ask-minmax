Several contributors have noted that in a non-regulated environment the
development of public transport service is self-adjusting: Faced with a
decreasing demand, operators will tend to reduce service to cut costs,
resulting in a decrease in the level-of-service, which then triggers a further
drop in demand. The opposite may also occur: high demand will induce the
operator to increase supply, e.g. through an increase in frequency, which
results in a higher level-of-service and a subsequent increase in passenger
numbers, triggering another round of service improvements. This paper adds to
the literature by presenting an analytic model for analyzing these phenomena of
vicious or virtuous cycles. The model formalizes passengers decisions to use a
public transport service depending on waiting time and employs field data
regarding passengers variation in willingness-to-wait for a public transport
service. The paper investigates the dynamics of the line service and shows how
the emergence of a vicious or virtuous cycle depends on total number of
potential passengers and share of captive riders. It ends with a discussion of
the implications of the findings for the planning of public transport services.
