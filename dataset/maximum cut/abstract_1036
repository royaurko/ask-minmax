The use of deductive techniques, such as theorem provers, has several
advantages in safety verification of hybrid sys- tems; however,
state-of-the-art theorem provers require ex- tensive manual intervention.
Furthermore, there is often a gap between the type of assistance that a theorem
prover requires to make progress on a proof task and the assis- tance that a
system designer is able to provide. This paper presents an extension to
KeYmaera, a deductive verification tool for differential dynamic logic; the new
technique allows local reasoning using system designer intuition about per-
formance within particular modes as part of a proof task. Our approach allows
the theorem prover to leverage for- ward invariants, discovered using numerical
techniques, as part of a proof of safety. We introduce a new inference rule
into the proof calculus of KeYmaera, the forward invariant cut rule, and we
present a methodology to discover useful forward invariants, which are then
used with the new cut rule to complete verification tasks. We demonstrate how
our new approach can be used to complete verification tasks that lie out of the
reach of existing deductive approaches us- ing several examples, including one
involving an automotive powertrain control system.
