A basic concept in chain-particle cluster-motion, from frozen glassy state to
melt state, is the 2D soft nano-scale mosaic structure formed by 8 orders of 2D
interface excitation (IE) loop-flows, from small to large in inverse cascade
and re-arrangement structure in cascade along local one direction. IE has
additional repulsive energy and extra vacancy volume. IE results from that the
instantaneous synchronal polarized electron charge coupling pair is able to
parallel transport on the interface between two neighboring chain-particles
with antiparallel delocalization. This structure accords with de Gennes' mosaic
structure picture, from which we can directly deduce glass transition
temperature, melt temperature, free volume fraction, critical entangled chain
length, and activation energy to break solid lattice. This is also the
in-herency maximum order-potential structure in random systems.
