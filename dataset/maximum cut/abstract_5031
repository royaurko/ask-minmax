This report describes the recent efforts to compute analytic formulae for the
Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO) QCD corrections to Higgs plus two jet production at
hadron colliders. In these calculations the Higgs boson couples to gluons via a
top-quark loop which is integrated out to form an effective vertex. The
amplitudes are further simplified by splitting the real Higgs scalar into the
sum of two complex scalars phi and phi^dagger. Four-dimensional unitarity is
used to construct the cut-containing pieces of the amplitude, while a variety
of bootstrap and Feynman diagram techniques are used to construct the rational
pieces. The results described here are valid in the limit of a large top quark
mass and when the transverse momenta of the jets are less than mt.
