The field of ultra-high energy cosmic rays made a lot of progresses last
years with large area experiments such as the Pierre Auger Observatory, HiRes
and the Telescope Array. A suppression of the cosmic ray flux at energies above
$5.5x10^{19}$ eV is observed at a very high level of significance but the
origin of this cut-off is not established: it can be due to the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin suppression but it can also reflect the upper limit of
particle acceleration in astrophysical objects. The key characteristics to be
measured on cosmic rays is their composition. Upper limits are set above
$10^{18}$ eV on primary photons and neutrinos and primary cosmic rays are
expected to be hadrons. Identifying the precise composition (light or heavy
nuclei) will permit to solve the puzzle. It has been proven that the radio
signal emitted by the extensive air showers initiated by ultra-high energy
cosmic rays reflects their longitudinal profile and can help in constraining
the primary particle. We review in this paper the emission mechanisms as a
function of the frequency of the electric field.
