We consider pair production and decay of fundamental unstable particles in
the framework of a modified perturbation theory (MPT), which treats resonant
contributions of unstable particles in the sense of distributions. The
cross-section of the process is calculated within the NNLO of the MPT in a
model that admits exact solution. Universal massless-particles contributions
are taken into consideration. The calculations are carried out by means of
FORTRAN code with double precision, which ensures per mille accuracy of
computations. A comparison of the outcomes with the exact solution reveals an
excellent convergence of the MPT series at the energies close to and above the
maximum of the cross-section. Near the maximum of the cross-section the
discrepancy of the NNLO approximation makes up a few per mille.
