We discuss the origin of galactic angular momentum, and the statistics of the
present day spin distribution. It is expected that the galaxy spin axes are
correlated with the intermediate principal axis of the gravitational shear
tensor. This allows one to reconstruct the shear field and thereby the full
gravitational potential from the observed galaxy spin fields. We use the
direction of the angular momentum vector without any information of its
magnitude, which requires a measurement of the position angle and inclination
on the sky of each disk galaxy. We present the maximum likelihood shear
inversion procedure, which involves a constrained linear minimization. The
theory is tested against numerical simulations. We find the correlation
strength of nonlinear structures with the initial shear field, and show that
accurate large scale density reconstructions are possible at the expected noise
level.
