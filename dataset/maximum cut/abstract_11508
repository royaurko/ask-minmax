In this paper, I revisit the constraints obtained by several contributors
(Reichart et al. 1999; Eke et al. 1998; Henry 2000) on the estimated values of
Omega_m, n and sigma_8 in the light of recent theoretical developments: 1) new
theoretical mass functions (Sheth & Tormen 1999, Sheth, Mo & Tormen 1999, Del
Popolo 2002b); 2) a more accurate mass-temperature relation, also determined
for arbitrary Omega_m and Omega_{\Lambda} (Voit 2000, Pierpaoli et al. 2001,
Del Popolo 2002a). Firstly, using the quoted improvements, I re-derive an
expression for the X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF), similarly to Reichart et
al. (1999), and then I get some constraints to \Omega_m and n, by using the
ROSAT BCS and EMSS samples and maximum-likelihood analysis. Then I re-derive
the X-ray Temperature Function (XTF), similarly to Henry (2000) and Eke et al.
(1999), re-obtaining the constraints on Omega_m, n, sigma_8. Both in the case
of the XLF and XTF, the changes in the mass function and M-T relation produces
an increase in Omega_m of \simeq 20% and similar results in sigma_8 and n.
