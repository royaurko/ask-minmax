We present the measurement of the the flux and angular distribution of
atmospheric muon neutrinos using the MACRO detector. Three different event
topologies are detected in two different energy ranges. High energy neutrinos
(E~80 GeV) via the identification of upward throughgoing muons. Lower energy
neutrinos (E~ 4 GeV) via the upgoing stopping and partially contained downgoing
muons (ID+UGS), or via the partially contained upgoing muons (IU). The measured
flux is reduced with respect to the predictions. For the high energy sample,
globally the flux reduction is $0.74\pm 0.054_{stat+sys} \pm 0.12_{th}$ and
varies with the zenith angle. The ratio of measured to expected events is
almost constant with the zenith angle for the low energy events, and is $0.57
\pm 0.08_{stat+sys} \pm 0.14_{theor}$ for the IU sample, and $0.71 \pm
0.09_{stat+sys} \pm 0.17_{theor}$ for the (ID+UGS). All the data sets are
consistent within a scenario of neutrino oscillations, with maximum mixing and
$\Delta m^2 \sim 10^{-3}\div 10^{-2} eV^2$.
