In this paper, we explicitly construct a large class of symmetric Boolean
functions on $2k$ variables with algebraic immunity not less than $d$, where
integer $k$ is given arbitrarily and $d$ is a given suffix of $k$ in binary
representation. If let $d = k$, our constructed functions achieve the maximum
algebraic immunity. Remarkably, $2^{\lfloor \log_2{k} \rfloor + 2}$ symmetric
Boolean functions on $2k$ variables with maximum algebraic immunity are
constructed, which is much more than the previous constructions. Based on our
construction, a lower bound of symmetric Boolean functions with algebraic
immunity not less than $d$ is derived, which is $2^{\lfloor \log_2{d} \rfloor +
2(k-d+1)}$. As far as we know, this is the first lower bound of this kind.
