We introduce a Bayesian approach to predictive density calibration and
combination that accounts for parameter uncertainty and model set
incompleteness through the use of random calibration functionals and random
combination weights. Building on the work of Ranjan, R. and Gneiting, T. (2010)
and Gneiting, T. and Ranjan, R. (2013), we use infinite beta mixtures for the
calibration. The proposed Bayesian nonparametric approach takes advantage of
the flexibility of Dirichlet process mixtures to achieve any continuous
deformation of linearly combined predictive distributions. The inference
procedure is based on Gibbs sampling and allows accounting for uncertainty in
the number of mixture components, mixture weights, and calibration parameters.
The weak posterior consistency of the Bayesian nonparametric calibration is
provided under suitable conditions for unknown true density. We study the
methodology in simulation examples with fat tails and multimodal densities and
apply it to density forecasts of daily S&P returns and daily maximum wind speed
at the Frankfurt airport.
