We describe a detector for measuring the time of flight of forward protons at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) up to and beyond the full instantaneous design
luminosity of 1034 cm-2 s-1. Our design is based on deep diffused, high gain
avalanche photodiodes (APDs) which give a signal of ~6000 e when traversed by 7
Teravolt protons. We observe pulse risetimes of 650 psec and a pulse width of 5
nsec and calculate a time resolution of ~10 psec and a maximum count rate of
>100 Mhz.
