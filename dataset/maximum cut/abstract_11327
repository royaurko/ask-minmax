We have obtained time-series spectra for the pulsating hot subdwarf (sdB)
PG1605+072. Previous time-series photometry of this star has shown maximum
amplitude variations of about 0.1 mag and at least 50 periods. The pulsator has
the largest amplitude and longest periods of all the pulsating sdBs (or EC14026
stars) discovered so far, and appears to be unusual in its class. Preliminary
results of a search for velocity variations are presented here. With these
variations, along with equivalent width measurements, oscillation mode
identification should be possible.
