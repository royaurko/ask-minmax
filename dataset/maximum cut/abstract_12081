We trace with unprecedented numerical accuracy the phase diagram of the
Gaussian-core model, a classical system of point particles interacting via a
Gaussian-shaped, purely repulsive potential. This model, which provides a
reliable qualitative description of the thermal behavior of interpenetrable
globular polymers, is known to exhibit a polymorphic FCC-BCC transition at low
densities and reentrant melting at high densities. Extensive Monte Carlo
simulations, carried out in conjunction with accurate calculations of the solid
free energies, lead to a thermodynamic scenario that is partially modified with
respect to previous knowledge. In particular, we find that: i) the
fluid-BCC-FCC triple-point temperature is about one third of the maximum
freezing temperature; ii) upon isothermal compression, the model exhibits a
fluid-BCC-FCC-BCC-fluid sequence of phases in a narrow range of temperatures
just above the triple point. We discuss these results in relation to the
behavior of star-polymer solutions and of other softly repulsive systems.
