Using appropriate notation systems for proofs, cut-reduction can often be
rendered feasible on these notations, and explicit bounds can be given.
Developing a suitable notation system for Bounded Arithmetic, and applying
these bounds, all the known results on definable functions of certain such
theories can be reobtained in a uniform way.
