The electron spin relaxation process in n-type GaAs crystals driven by a
fluctuating electric field is investigated. Two different sources of
fluctuations are considered: (i) a symmetric dichotomous noise and (ii) a
Gaussian correlated noise. Monte Carlo numerical simulations show, in both
cases, an enhancement of the spin relaxation time by increasing the amplitude
of the external noise. Moreover, we find that the electron spin lifetime versus
the noise correlation time: (i) increases up to a plateau in the case of
dichotomous random fluctuations, and (ii) shows a nonmonotonic behaviour with a
maximum in the case of bulks subjected to a Gaussian correlated noise.
