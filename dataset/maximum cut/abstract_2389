Electromagnetic wavelets are constructed using scalar wavelets as
superpotentials, together with an appropriate polarization. It is shown that
oblate spheroidal antennas, which are ideal for their production and reception,
can be made by deforming and merging two branch cuts. This determines a unique
field on the interior of the spheroid which gives the boundary conditions for
the surface charge-current density necessary to radiate the wavelets. These
sources are computed, including the impulse response of the antenna.
