Within the BCS theory of superconductivity we calculate the superconducting
gap at zero temperature for metallic hydrogen-graphene system in order to
estimate the superconducting critical temperature of quasi two dimensional
highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. The obtained results are given as a
function of the hydrogen-induced density of carriers $n$ and their effective
mass $m^\star$. The obtained gap shows a Maxwell-like distribution with a
maximum of $\sim 60 $K at $n \sim 3 \times 10^{14} $cm$^{-2}$ and $m^\star/m =
1$. The theoretical results are discussed taking into account recent
experimental evidence for granular superconductivity in graphite.
