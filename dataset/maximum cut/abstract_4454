We study the derivative expansion for the effective action in the framework
of the Exact Renormalization Group for a single component scalar theory. By
truncating the expansion to the first two terms, the potential $U_k$ and the
kinetic coefficient $Z_k$, our analysis suggests that a set of coupled
differential equations for these two functions can be established under certain
smoothness conditions for the background field and that sharp and smooth
cut-off give the same result. In addition we find that, differently from the
case of the potential, a further expansion is needed to obtain the differential
equation for $Z_k$, according to the relative weight between the kinetic and
the potential terms. As a result, two different approximations to the $Z_k$
equation are obtained. Finally a numerical analysis of the coupled equations
for $U_k$ and $Z_k$ is performed at the non-gaussian fixed point in $D<4$
dimensions to determine the anomalous dimension of the field.
