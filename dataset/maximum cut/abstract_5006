The $\tau$ polarization can be easily measured at LHC in the 1-prong hadronic
$\tau$ decay channel by measuring what fraction of the $\tau$-jet momentum is
carried by the charged track. A simple cut requiring this fraction to be >0.8
retains most of the polarization of $\tau=$+1 $\tau$-jet signal while
suppressing the polarization of $\tau=$-1 $\tau$-jet background and practically
eliminating the fake $\tau$ background. This can be utilized to extract the
charged Higgs signal. It can be also utilized to extract the SUSY signal in the
stau NLSP region, and in particular the stau co-annihilaton region.
