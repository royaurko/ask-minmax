Although it has been believed that the models with generalised Chaplygin gas
do not contain singularities, in a previous work we have studied how a big
freeze could take place in some kinds of phantom generalised Chaplygin gas. In
the present work, we study some types of generalised Chaplygin gas in order to
show how different sorts of singularities could appears in such models, in the
future or in the past. We point out that: (i) singularities may not be
originated from the phantom nature of the fluid, and (ii) if initially the
tension of the brane in a brane-world Chaplygin model is large enough then an
infrared cut off appears in the past.
