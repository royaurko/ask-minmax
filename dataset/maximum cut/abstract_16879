We report on the analysis of ~22,000 M dwarfs using a statistical parallax
method. This technique employs a maximum-likelihood formulation to
simultaneously solve for the absolute magnitude, velocity ellipsoid parameters
and reflex solar motion of a homogeneous stellar sample, and has previously
been applied to Galactic RR Lyrae and Cepheid populations and to the
Palomar/Michigan State University (PMSU) survey of nearby low-mass stars. We
analyze subsamples of the most recent spectroscopic catalog of M dwarfs in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to determine absolute magnitudes and kinematic
properties as a function of spectral type, color, chromospheric activity and
metallicity. We find new, independent spectral type-absolute magnitude
relations, and color-absolute magnitude relations in the SDSS filters, and
compare to those found from other methods. Active stars have brighter absolute
magnitudes and lower metallicity stars have fainter absolute magnitudes for
stars of type M0-M4. Our kinematic analysis confirms previous results for the
solar motion and velocity dispersions, with more distant stars possessing
larger peculiar motions, and chromospherically active (younger) stars having
smaller velocity dispersions than their inactive counterparts. We find some
evidence for systematic differences in the mean U and W velocities of samples
subdivided by color.
