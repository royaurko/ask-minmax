We study the geometric effects of our galaxy's peculiar motion on the
circles-in-the-sky. We show that the shape of these circles-in-the-sky remains
circular, as detected by a local observer with arbitrary peculiar velocity.
Explicit expressions for the radius and center position of such an observed
circle-in-the-sky, as well as for the angular displacement of points on the
circle, are derived. In general, a circle is detected as a circle of different
radius, displaced relative to its original position, and centered at a point
which does not correspond to its detected center in the comoving frame.
Further, there is an angular displacement of points on the circles. These
effects all arise from aberration of cosmic microwave background radiation,
exhausting the purely geometric effects due to the peculiar motion of our
galaxy, and are independent of both the large scale curvature of space and the
expansion of the universe, since aberration is a purely local phenomenon. For a
Lorentz-boosted observer with the speed of our entire galaxy, the maximum
(detectable) changes in the angular radius of a circle, its maximum center
displacement, as well as the maximum angular distortion are shown all to be of
order $\beta=(v/c)$ radians. In particular, two back-to-back matching circles
in a finite universe will have an upper bound of $2|\beta|$ in the variation of
either their radii, the angular position of their centers, or the angular
distribution of points.
