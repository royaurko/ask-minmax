The tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of a hexagonal array of dipolar coupled
anisotropic magnetic nanoparticles is studied using a resistor network model
and a realistic micromagnetic configuration obtained by Monte Carlo
simulations. Analysis of the field-dependent TMR and the corresponding
magnetization curve shows that dipolar interactions suppress the maximum TMR
effect, increase or decrease the field-sensitivity depending on the direction
of applied field and introduce strong dependence of the TMR on the direction of
the applied magnetic field. For off-plane magnetic fields, maximum values in
the TMR signal are associated with the critical field for irreversible rotation
of the magnetization. This behavior is more pronounced in strongly interacting
systems (magnetically soft), while for weakly interacting systems (magnetically
hard) the maximum of TMR (Hmax) occurs below the coercive field (Hc), in
contrast to the situation for non-interacting nanoparticles or in-plane fields
(Hmax=Hc). The relation of our simulations to recent TMR measurements in
self-assembled Co nanoparticle arrays is discussed.
