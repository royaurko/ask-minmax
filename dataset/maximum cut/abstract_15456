Populations of mammalian progenitor cells commonly exhibit considerable
cell-cell variability. However, the functional role of this diversity is
unclear. Here, we analyze the dynamics of the stem cell surface marker Sca1 in
mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells using a simple stochastic model and
propose that multipotency is an example of maximum entropy statistical
inference: in the absence of defined instructions, individual cells remain
maximally non-committal with respect to their molecular identity, thereby
generating a maximally diverse population that is able to respond optimally to
a wide range of unforeseen future environmental changes. These results indicate
that cell-cell variability is central to collective decision-making by
mammalian progenitor cells and suggest that regulation of cellular dynamics is
exerted at the population, rather than individual cell, level.
