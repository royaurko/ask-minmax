We develop a series of molecular dynamics computer simulations of liquid
water, performed with a polarizable potential model, to calculate the spinodal
line and the curve of maximum density inside the metastable supercooled region.
After analysing the structural properties,the liquid spinodal line is followed
down to T=210 K. A monotonic decrease is found in the explored region. The
curve of maximum density bends on approaching the spinodal line. These results,
in agreement with similar studies on non polarizable models of water, are
consistent with the existence of a second critical point for water.
