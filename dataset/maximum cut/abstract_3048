We apply the Principle of Maximum Entropy to the study of a general class of
deterministic fractal sets. The scaling laws peculiar to these objects are
accounted for by means of a constraint concerning the average content of
information in those patterns. This constraint allows for a new statistical
characterization of fractal objects and fractal dimension.
