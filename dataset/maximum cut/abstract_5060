We have used Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the magnetic properties
of asymmetric dots as a function of their geometry. The asymmetry of round dots
is produced by cutting off a fraction of the dot and is characterized by an
asymmetry parameter $\alpha$. This shape asymmetry has interesting effects on
the coercivity ($H_{c}$), remanence ($M_{r}$), and barrier for vortex and C-
state formation. The dependences of $H_{c}$ and $M_{r}$ are non monotonic as a
function of $\alpha$ with a well defined minima in these parameters. The vortex
enters the most asymmetric part and exits through the symmetric portion of the
dot. With increasing $\alpha $ the vortex formation starts with a C-state which
persists for longer fields and the barrier for vortex exit diminishes with
increasing asymmetry, thus providing control over the magnetic chirality. This
implies interesting, naively-unexpected, magnetic behavior as a function of
geometry and magnetic field.
