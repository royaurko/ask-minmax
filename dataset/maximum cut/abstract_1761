A semigroup (dynamical system) generated by $C^{1+\alpha}$-contracting
mappings is considered. We call a such semigroup regular if the maximum $K$ of
the conformal dilatations of generators, the maximum $l$ of the norms of the
derivatives of generators and the smoothness $\alpha$ of the generators
satisfy a compatibility condition $K< 1/l^{\alpha}$. We prove the {\em
geometric distortion lemma} for a regular semigroup generated by
$C^{1+\alpha}$-contracting mappings.
