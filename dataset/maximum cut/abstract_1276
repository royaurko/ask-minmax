We calculate the $pp\rightarrow t\bar t\gamma+X\rightarrow W\gamma + X$ cross
section at SSC energies. Approximately 40\% of the total cross section
originates from photon bremsstrahlung off the final state jet in $t\bar tj$
production. Without cuts restricting the hadronic activity, the $t\bar t\gamma$
rate is a factor 10 (2) larger than the tree level $W\gamma$ cross section for
a top quark mass of 110~GeV (200~GeV). Imposing a jet veto cut, the $t\bar
t\gamma$ rate can be suppressed to a level well below the $W\gamma+0$~jet
signal cross section.
