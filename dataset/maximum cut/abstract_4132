Motivated by recent results on non-vanishing spatial curvature \cite{curve}
we employ the holographic model of dark energy to investigate the validity of
first and second laws of thermodynamics in non-flat (closed) universe enclosed
by apparent horizon $R_A$ and the event horizon measured from the sphere of
horizon named $L$. We show that for the apparent horizon the first law is
roughly respected for different epochs while the second laws of thermodynamics
is respected while for $L$ as the system's IR cut-off first law is broken down
and second law is respected for special range of deceleration parameter. It is
also shown that at late-time universe $L$ is equal to $R_A$ and the
thermodynamic laws are hold, when the universe has non-vanishing curvature.
Defining the fluid temperature to be proportional to horizon temperature the
range for coefficient of proportionality is obtained provided that the
generalized second law of thermodynamics is hold.
