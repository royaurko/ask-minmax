We present results of an exclusive measurement of the first excited state of
the Sigma hyperon, Sigma(1385)^+, produced in p+p -> Sigma^+ + K^+ + n at 3.5
GeV beam energy. The extracted data allow to study in detail the invariant mass
distribution of the Sigma(1385)^+. The mass distribution is well described by a
relativistic Breit-Wigner function with a maximum at m_0 = 1383.2 +- 0.9
MeV/c^2 and a width of 40.2 +- 2.1 MeV/c^2. The exclusive production
cross-section comes out to be 22.27 +- 0.89 +- 1.56 +3.07 -2.10 mu b. Angular
distributions of the Sigma(1385)^+ in different reference frames are found to
be compatible with the hypothesis that 33 % of Sigma(1385)^+ result from the
decay of an intermediate Delta^{++} resonance.
