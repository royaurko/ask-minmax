According to Dijkgraaf and Vafa the effective glueball superpotential of the
N=1 supersymmetric QCD coupled with an adjoint chiral multiplet is given by the
planar amplitude in the 1/N expansion of a matrix model. It was shown that,
when the N=1 supersymmetric QCD is coupled with fundamental chiral multiplets
as well, the effective glueball superpotential is modified by the disc
amplitude of the generalized matrix model. The diagramatic computation of this
disc amplitude is fairly involved for the multi-cut solution. Instead we
compute it with recourse to the complex analysis of the hyperelliptic curve.
The result is given in series of the gluino condensation S_i. The explicit
computation for the generic multi-cut solution is done up to order S^3. It is
systematic so that it can be extended to higher orders.
