Bosonic technicolor models accommodate fermion masses via a Higgs doublet
that acquires a vacuum expectation value when technifermions condense. We point
out that these models are severely constrained by vacuum stability if the Higgs
boson mass is near 125 GeV, the value suggested by LHC data. The Higgs quartic
coupling in bosonic technicolor is typically smaller at the weak scale than in
the Standard Model, while the top quark Yukawa coupling is larger. We find that
the running quartic coupling remains positive below a reasonably defined cut
off only in a narrow region of the model's parameter space. This region is only
slightly enlarged if one allows a metastable vacuum with a lifetime longer than
the age of the universe.
