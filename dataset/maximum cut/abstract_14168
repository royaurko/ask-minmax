Based on a pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram model of the Earth, Jones
& Lineweaver (2010) described uninhabited terrestrial liquid water. Our model
represents the atmosphere, surface, oceans and interior of the Earth - allowing
the range of P-T conditions in terrestrial environments to be compared to the
phase regime of liquid water. Here we present an overview and additional
results from the Earth model on the location of the deepest liquid water on
Earth and the maximum possible extent of the terrestrial biosphere. The
intersection of liquid water and terrestrial phase space indicates that the
deepest liquid water environments in the lithosphere occur at a depth of ~ 75
km. 3.5 % of the volume of the Earth is above 75 km depth. Considering the 3.5
% of the volume of the Earth where liquid water exists, ~ 12% of this volume is
inhabited by life while the remaining ~ 88% is uninhabited. This is distinct
from the fraction of the volume of liquid water occupied by life. We find that
at least 1% of the volume of liquid water on Earth is uninhabited. Better
geothermal gradients in the Earth's crust and mantle will improve the precision
and accuracy of these preliminary results.
