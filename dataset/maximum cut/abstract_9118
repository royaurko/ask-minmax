The expression of survival factors for radiation damaged cells is empirical
and based on probabilistic assumptions. We obtain it either from the maximum
entropy principle for the classical Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy and/or from the
Tsallis entropy. Empiric models are found to be particular cases of the
obtained expression. The survival factor exhibits a phase transition behaviour.
This formulation supports different tissues grouped as universality classes.
