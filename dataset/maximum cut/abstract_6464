Algebraic statistics is a recently evolving field, where one would treat
statistical models as algebraic objects and thereby use tools from
computational commutative algebra and algebraic geometry in the analysis and
computation of statistical models. In this approach, calculation of parameters
of statistical models amounts to solving set of polynomial equations in several
variables, for which one can use celebrated Grobner bases theory. Owing to the
important role of information theory in statistics, this paper as a first step,
explores the possibility of describing maximum and minimum entropy (ME) models
in the framework of algebraic statistics. We show that ME-models are toric
models (a class of algebraic statistical models) when the constraint functions
(that provide the information about the underlying random variable) are integer
valued functions, and the set of statistical models that results from
ME-methods are indeed an affine variety.
