The $\beta$ function for a scalar field theory describes the dependence of
the coupling constant on the renormalization mass scale. This dependence is
affected by the choice of regularization scheme. I explicitly relate the
$\beta$-functions of momentum cut-off regularization and dimensional
regularization on scalar field theories by a gauge transformation using the
Hopf algebras of the Feynman diagrams of the theories.
