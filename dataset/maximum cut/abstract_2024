In connection with recent publications we discuss spectral sum rules for the
Tomonaga-Luttinger model without using the explicit result for the one-electron
Green's function. They are usefull in the interpretation of recent high
resolution photoemission spectra of quasi-one-dimensional conductors. It is
shown that the limit of infinite frequency and band cut\-off do not commute.
Our result for arbitrary shape of the interaction potential generalizes an
earlier discussion by Suzumura. A general analytical expression for the
spectral function for wave vectors far from the Fermi wave vector $k_{F}$ is
presented. Numerical spectra are shown to illustrate the sum rules.
