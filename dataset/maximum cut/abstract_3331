We investigate a cognitive radio scenario involving a single cognitive
transmitter equipped with $\mathcal{K}$ antennas sharing the spectrum with
$\mathcal{M}$ primary users (PUs) transmitting over orthogonal bands. Each
terminal has a queue to store its incoming traffic. We propose a novel protocol
where the cognitive user transmits its packet over a channel formed by the
aggregate of the inactive primary bands. We study the impact of the number of
PUs, sensing errors, and the number of antennas on the maximum secondary stable
throughput.
