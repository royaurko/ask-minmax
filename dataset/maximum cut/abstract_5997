Carleson's theorem on the pointwise convergence of Fourier series provides
bounds for a maximal operator, with the maximum taken over all choices of
linear functions of a phase argument. We extend this to all quadratic choices
of phase functions. Specifically, we show that the maximal operator below maps
$L^p$ into itself for $1<p<\infty$. $$ \sup_a \sup_b |\int
e^{i(ay^2+by)}f(x-y)dy/y| $$
