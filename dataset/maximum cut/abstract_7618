A new Nijmegen soft-core OBE potential model is presented for the low-energy
YN interactions. Besides the results for the fit to the scattering data, which
largely defines the model, we also present some applications to hypernuclear
systems using the G-matrix method. An important innovation with respect to the
original soft-core potential is the assignment of the cut-off masses for the
baryon-baryon-meson (BBM) vertices in accordance with broken SU(3)$_F$, which
serves to connect the NN and the YN channels. As a novel feature, we allow for
medium strong breaking of the coupling constants, using the $^3P_0$ model with
a Gell-Mann--Okubo hypercharge breaking for the BBM coupling. We present six
hyperon-nucleon potentials which describe the available YN cross section data
equally well, but which exhibit some differences on a more detailed level. The
differences are constructed such that the models encompass a range of
scattering lengths in the $\Sigma N$ and $\Lambda N$ channels. For the
scalar-meson mixing angle we obtained values $\theta_S=37$ to 40 degrees, which
points to almost ideal mixing angles for the scalar $q\bar{q}$ states. The
G-matrix results indicate that the remarkably different spin-spin terms of the
six potentials appear specifically in the energy spectra of $\Lambda$
hypernuclei.
