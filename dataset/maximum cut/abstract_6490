An analysis of local fluctuations, or spikes, is performed for charged
particles produced in central C-Cu collisions at 4.5 GeV/$c$/nucleon. The
distributions of spike-centers and the maximum density distributions are
investigated for different narrow pseudorapidity windows to search for
multiparticle dynamical correlations. Two peaks over statistical background are
observed in the spike-center distributions with the structure similar to that
expected from the coherent gluon radiation model and recently found in hadronic
interactions. The dynamical contribution to maximum density fluctuations are
obtained to be hidden by statistical correlations, though behavior of the
distributions shows qualitative agreement with that from the one-dimensional
intermittency model. The observed features of the two different approaches,
coherent vs. stochastic, to the formation of the local dynamical fluctuations
are discussed.
