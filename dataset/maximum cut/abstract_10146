The Pierre Auger Observatory's (PAO) shower profile measurements can be used
to constrain the chemical composition of the ultra-high energy cosmic ray
(UHECR) spectrum. In particular, the PAO's measurements of the average depth of
shower maximum and the fluctuations of the depth of shower maximum indicate
that the cosmic ray spectrum is dominated by a fairly narrow distribution (in
charge) of heavy or intermediate mass nuclei at the highest measured energies
(E > 10^{19} eV), and contains mostly lighter nuclei or protons at lower
energies (E ~ 10^{18} eV). In this article, we study the propagation of UHECR
nuclei with the goal of using these measurements, along with those of the shape
of the spectrum, to constrain the chemical composition of the particles
accelerated by the sources of the UHECRs. We find that with modest
intergalactic magnetic fields, 0.3 nG in strength with 1 Mpc coherent lengths,
good fits to the combined PAO data can be found for the case in which the
sources accelerate primarily intermediate mass nuclei (such as nitrogen or
silicon). Without intergalactic magnetic fields, we do not find any composition
scenarios that can accommodate the PAO data. For a spectrum dominated by heavy
or intermediate mass nuclei, the Galactic (and intergalactic) magnetic fields
are expected to erase any significant angular correlation between the sources
and arrival directions of UHECRs.
