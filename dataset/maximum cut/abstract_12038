We explore, in three spatial dimensions, the transition from the normal state
to the Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superfluid phases. We restrict ourselves
to the case of the 'planar' phase, where the order parameter depends only on a
single spatial coordinate. We first show that, in the case of the simple
Fulde-Ferrell phase, singularities occur at zero temperature in the free energy
which prevents, at low temperature, a reliable use of an expansion in powers of
the order parameter. We then introduce in the quasiclassical equations a
Fourier expansion for the order parameter and the Green's functions, and we
show that it converges quite rapidly to the exact solution. We finally
implement numerically this method and find results in excellent agreement with
the earlier work of Matsuo \emph{et al}. In particular when the temperature is
lowered from the tricritical point, the transition switches from first to
second order. In the case of the first order transition, the spatial dependence
of the order parameter at the transition is found to be always very nearly a
pure cosine, although the maximum of its modulus may be comparable to the one
of the uniform BCS phase.
