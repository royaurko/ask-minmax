The preparative method, characterization and magnetic susceptibility \chi
measurements versus temperature T of the heavy fermion transition metal oxide
LiV_{2}O_{4} are reported in detail. The intrinsic \chi(T) shows a nearly
T-independent behavior below ~ 30 K with a shallow broad maximum at about 16 K,
whereas Curie-Weiss-like behavior is observed above 50-100 K. Field-cooled and
zero-field-cooled magnetization M measurements in applied magnetic fields H =
10 to 100 G from 1.8 to 50 K showed no evidence for spin-glass ordering.
Crystalline electric field theory for an assumed cubic V point group symmetry
is found insufficient to describe the observed temperature variation of the
effective magnetic moment. The Kondo and Coqblin-Schrieffer models do not
describe the magnitude and T dependence of \chi with realistic parameters. In
the high T range, fits of \chi(T) by the predictions of high temperature series
expansion calculations provide estimates of the V-V antiferromagnetic exchange
coupling constant J/k_{B} ~ 20 K, g-factor g ~ 2 and the T-independent
susceptibility. Other possible models to describe the \chi(T) are discussed.
The paramagnetic impurities in the samples were characterized using isothermal
M(H) measurements with 0 < H <= 5.5 Tesla at 2 to 6 K. These impurities are
inferred to have spin S_{imp} ~ 3/2 to 4, g_{imp} ~ 2 and molar concentrations
of 0.01 to 0.8 %, depending on the sample.
