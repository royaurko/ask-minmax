We measure the displacement response of a frictional multicontact interface
between identical polymer glasses to a biased shear force oscillation. We
evidence the existence, for maximum forces close below the nominal static
threshold, of a jamming creep regime governed by an ageing-rejuvenation
competition acting within the micrometer-sized contacting asperities.
Quantitative analysis of the creep curves suggests that another such mechanism
might be at work within the nanometer-thick adhesive junctions.
