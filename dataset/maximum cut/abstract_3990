Muon rate variations during Forbush effects registered by means of muon
detectors DECOR, TEMP and URAGAN operated in the experimental complex NEVOD
(MEPhI, Moscow) have been studied, and comparative analysis with neutron
monitor data has been performed. The ratio of values of Forbush decreases in
muon and in neutron fluxes is about one third, and preliminary rigidity
dependence of Forbush decrease amplitude using muon data has been also obtained
(for 2.4 GV cut-off rigidity). The detection of muon flux in the hodoscopic
mode allows to study the dynamics of muon flux anisotropy related with magnetic
field perturbations. Results of analysis of data from the new unique muon
detector URAGAN indicate the change of muon flux asymmetry direction during the
Forbush decrease. This phenomenon is related with the motion of solar plasma
cloud and hodoscope acceptance cone relative to each other.
