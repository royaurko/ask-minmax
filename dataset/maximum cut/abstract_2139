We calculate the broadening of the transverse momentum distribution of a
quark propagating through nuclear matter. Colour screening plays a fundamental
role in that it cuts off quark-nucleon interactions with soft gluons. The mean
transverse momentum of the quark acquired along its trajectory, observed via
Drell-Yan pairs, is related to it the ratio of the total inelastic
meson-nucleon cross section it to the meson mean squared radius. Parameter-free
calculations agree with the data.
