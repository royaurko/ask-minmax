The MAJORANA Collaboration is constructing the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, an
ultra-low background, 40-kg modular HPGe detector array to search for
neutrinoless double beta decay in 76Ge. In view of the next generation of
tonne-scale Ge-based 0nbb-decay searches that will probe the neutrino mass
scale in the inverted-hierarchy region, a major goal of the MAJORANA
DEMONSTRATOR is to demonstrate a path forward to achieving a background rate at
or below 1 count/tonne/year in the 4 keV region of interest around the Q-value
at 2039 keV. The background rejection techniques to be applied to the data
include cuts based on data reduction, pulse shape analysis, event coincidences,
and time correlations. The Point Contact design of the DEMONSTRATOR 0s
germanium detectors allows for significant reduction of gamma background.
