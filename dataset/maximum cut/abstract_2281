The magnitude of the double-spin asymmetry A_{NN} in polarized proton elastic
scattering is estimated using results from an earlier determination of the
spin-flip coupling of the leading Regge poles (cf. T.L.Trueman, Proceedings of
the 16th International Spin Physics Symposium SPIN 2004, eds. F. Bradamante et
al, World Scientific, 2005.) The required Regge cuts are estimated using the
absorptive Regge model. This estimate is then used to determine the sensitivity
of experiments at RHIC to the presence of the Odderon.
