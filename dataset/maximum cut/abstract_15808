We derive octupole-level secular perturbation equations for hierarchical
triple systems, using classical Hamiltonian perturbation techniques. By
extending previous work done to leading (quadrupole) order to octupole level
(i.e., including terms of order alpha^3, where alpha = a_1/a_2 < 1 is the ratio
of semimajor axes) we obtain expressions that are applicable to a much wider
range of parameters. For triple systems containing a close inner binary, we
also discuss the possible interaction between the classical Newtonian
perturbations and the general relativistic precession of the inner orbit. In
some cases we show that this interaction can lead to resonances and a
significant increase in the maximum amplitude of eccentricity perturbations. We
establish the validity of our analytic expressions by providing detailed
comparisons with the results of direct numerical integrations of the three-body
problem obtained for a large number of representative cases. We also discuss
applications of the theory in the context of several observed triple systems of
current interest, including the millisecond pulsar PSR B1620-26 in M4, the
giant planet in 16 Cygni, and the protostellar binary TMR-1. [short version]
