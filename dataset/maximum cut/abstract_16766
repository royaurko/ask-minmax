We examine the core of the X-ray bright galaxy cluster 2A 0335+096 using deep
Chandra X-ray imaging and spatially-resolved spectroscopy, and include new
radio observations. The set of around eight X-ray bright blobs in the core of
the cluster, appearing like eggs in a bird's nest, contains multiphase gas from
~0.5 to 2 keV. The morphology of the coolest X-ray emitting gas at 0.5 keV
temperature is similar to the Halpha emitting nebula known in this cluster,
which surrounds the central galaxy. XMM-Newton grating spectra confirm the
presence of material at these temperatures, showing excellent agreement with
Chandra emission measures. On scales of 80 to 250 kpc there is a low
temperature, high metallicity, swirl of intracluster medium as seen in other
clusters. In the core we find evidence for a further three X-ray cavities, in
addition to the two previously discovered. Enhancements in 1.5 GHz radio
emission are correlated with the X-ray cavities. The total 4PV enthalpy
associated with the cavities is around 5x10^59 erg. This energy would be enough
to heat the cooling region for ~5x10^7 yr. We find a maximum pressure
discontinuity of 26 per cent (2 sigma) across the surface brightness edge to
the south-west of the cluster core. This corresponds to an upper limit on the
Mach number of the cool core with respect to its surroundings of 0.55.
