Tunka-Rex, the Tunka radio extension, is an array of 20 antennas at the Tunka
experiment close to Lake Baikal in Siberia. It started operation on 08 October
2012. The antennas are connected directly to the data acquisition of the Tunka
main detector, a 1 square-km large array of 133 non-imaging photomultipliers
observing the Cherenkov light of air showers in dark and clear nights. This
allows to cross-calibrate the radio signal with the air-Cherenkov signal of the
same air showers - in particular with respect to the energy and the atmospheric
depth of the shower maximum, Xmax. Consequently, we can test whether in rural
regions with low radio background the practically achievable radio precision
comes close to the precision of the established fluorescence and air-Cherenkov
techniques. At a mid-term perspective, due to its higher duty-cycle, Tunka-Rex
can enhance the effective observing time of Tunka by an order of magnitude, at
least in the interesting energy range above 100 PeV. Moreover, Tunka-Rex is
very cost-effective, e.g., by using economic Short Aperiodic Loaded Loop
Antennas (SALLAs). Thus, the results of Tunka-Rex and the comparison to other
sophisticated radio arrays will provide crucial input for future large-scale
cosmic-ray observatories, for which measurement precision as well as costs per
area have to be optimized. In this paper we shortly describe the Tunka-Rex
setup and discuss the technical and scientific goals of Tunka-Rex.
