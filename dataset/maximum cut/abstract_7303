We have observed 60 edge-on galaxies in the NIR in order to study the stellar
distribution in galaxies with box/peanut-shaped bulges. The much smaller amount
of dust extinction at these wavelengths allows us to identify in almost all
target galaxies with box/peanut-shaped bulges an additional thin, central
component in cuts parallel to the major axis. This structure can be identified
with a bar. The length of this structure scaled by the length of the bulge
correlates with the morphologically classified shape of the bulge. This newly
established correlation is therefore mainly interpreted as the projection of
the bar at different aspect angles. Galaxies with peanut bulges have a bar seen
nearly edge-on and the ratio of bar length to thickness, 14 +/- 4, can be
directly measured for the first time. In addition, the correlation of the
boxiness of bulges with the bar strength indicates that the bar characteristic
could partly explain differences in the bulge shape. Furthermore, a new size
relation between the box/peanut structure and the central bulge is found. Our
observations are discussed in comparison to a N-body simulation for barred
galaxies (Pfenniger & Friedli 1991). We conclude that the inner region of
barred disk galaxies are build up by three distinct components: the spheroidal
bulge, a thin bar, and a b/p structure most likely representing the thick part
of the bar.
