We present results of a 0.1-100 keV BeppoSAX observation of the dipping LMXRB
EXO 0748-676 performed in 2000 November. During the observation the source
exhibited X-ray eclipses, type I X-ray bursts and dipping activity over a wide
range of orbital phases. The 0.1-100keV "dip-free"(ie. dipping and eclipsing
intervals excluded) spectrum is complex,especially at low-energies where a soft
excess is present. Two very different spectral models give satisfactory fits.
The first is the progressive covering model, consisting of separately absorbed
black body and cut-off power-law components.The second model is an absorbed
cut-off power-law together with a moderately ionized absorber with a sub-solar
abundance of Fe and a 2.13 keV absorption feature (tentatively identified with
Si xiii). This ionized absorber may be the same feature as seen by Chandra
during dips from EXO 0748-676.
