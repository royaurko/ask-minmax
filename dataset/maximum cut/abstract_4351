The feasibility of a measurement of the electric and magnetic nucleon form
factors at $B$-meson factories through the radiative return is studied. Angular
distributions allow a separation of the contributions from the two form
factors. The distributions are presented for the laboratory and the hadronic
rest frame, and the advantages of different coordinate systems are
investigated. It is demonstrated that $Q^2$ values up to 8 or even 9 GeV$^2$
are within reach. The Monte Carlo event generator PHOKHARA is extended to
nucleon final states, and results are presented which include Next-to-Leading
Order radiative corrections from initial-state radiation. The impact of angular
cuts on rates and distributions is investigated and the relative importance of
radiative corrections is analysed.
