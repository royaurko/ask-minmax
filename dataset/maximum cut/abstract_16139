I consider a stationary axisymmetric force-free degenerate magnetosphere of a
rotating Kerr black hole surrounded by a thin Keplerian infinitely-conducting
accretion disk. I focus on the closed-field geometry with a direct magnetic
coupling between the disk and the event horizon. I first present a simple
physical argument that shows how the black hole's rotation limits the radial
extent of the force-free link. I then confirm this result by solving
numerically the general-relativistic force-free Grad--Shafranov equation in the
magnetosphere, using the regularity condition at the inner light cylinder to
determine the poloidal current. I indeed find that force-free solutions exist
only when the magnetic link between the hole and the disk has a limited extent
on the disk surface. I chart out the maximum allowable size of this
magnetically-connected part of the disk as a function of the black hole spin. I
also compute the angular momentum and energy transfer between the hole and the
disk that takes place via the direct magnetic link. I find that both of these
quantities grow rapidly and that their deposition becomes highly concentrated
near the inner edge of the disk as the black hole spin is increased.
