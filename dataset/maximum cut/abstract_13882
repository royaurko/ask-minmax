We demonstrate assembly of solution processed semiconducting enriched (99%)
single walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWNT) in an array with varying linear density
via ac-dielectrophoresis and investigate detailed electronic transport
properties of the fabricated devices. We show that (i) the quality of the
alignment varies with frequency of the applied voltage and that (ii) by varying
the frequency and concentration of the solution, we can control the linear
density of the s-SWNTs in the array from 1/{\mu}m to 25 /{\mu}m. The maximum
linear density of 25 s-SWNT /\mum reported here is the highest for any aligned
semiconducting array. The DEP assembled s-SWNT devices provide opportunity to
investigate transport property of the arrays in the direct transport regime.
Room temperature electron transport measurements of the fabricated devices show
that with increasing nanotube density the device mobility increases while the
current on-off ratio decreases dramatically. For the dense array, the device
current density was 16 {\mu}A/{\mu}m, on-conductance was 390 {\mu}S, and sheet
resistance was 30 k{\Omega}/\square. These values are the best reported so far
for any semiconducting nanotube array.
