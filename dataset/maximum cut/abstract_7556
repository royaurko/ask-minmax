We calculate production cross sections of a forward quark-gluon pair and of
two gluons at mid-rapidity in Deep Inelastic Scattering and in high energy
proton-nucleus collisions. The calculation is performed in the framework of the
Color Glass Condensate formalism. We first calculate the cross sections in the
quasi-classical approximation, which includes multiple rescatterings in the
target. We then proceed to include the effects of non-linear small-x evolution
in the production cross sections. It is interesting to note that our result for
the two-gluon production cross section appears to be in direct violation of AGK
cutting rules, which is the first example of such violation in QCD. The
calculated quark-gluon and gluon-gluon production cross sections can be used to
construct theoretical predictions for two-particle azimuthal correlations at
RHIC and LHC (I^{p(d)A}) as well as for Deep Inelastic Scattering experiments
at HERA and eRHIC.
