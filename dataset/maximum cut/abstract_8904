A mathematical model of the interaction mechanism for the
intuitive-imaginative and heuristic-logical thinking responsible for the rift
in the intellectual activity into two cultures has been suggested. The said
model proceeds from the assumption that human thinking is based on the
principles of the many-channel quantum-mechanical logic of the "both ... and"
type surpassing the rigid confines of the "either ... or" type classical logic.
The aggregate product of the person equally endowed in the said two-cultural
space has been calculated. The interferential part of the latter achieves its
maximum at the extreme values of such parameters as the inter-state exchange
frequency and the difference of the states phases.
