Let $X$, $X_1$, $X_2$, $...$ be i.i.d. random variables, and let $S_n=X_1+...
+ X_n$ be the partial sums and $M_n=\max_{k\le n}|S_k|$ be the maximum partial
sums. We give the sufficient and necessary conditions for a kind of limit
theorems to hold on the convergence rate of the tail probabilities of both
$S_n$ and $M_n$. These results are related to the law of the iterated
logarithm. The results of Gut and Spataru (2000) are special cases of ours.
