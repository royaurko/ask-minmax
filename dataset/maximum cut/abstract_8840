The saturation of ion cyclotron Alfven turbulence excited by beam particles
is investigated using resonance broadening theory. The stochastic scattering
which decorrelates particles, includes both random acceleration by electric
fields and a turbulent magnetic mirroring effect. Turbulent mirroring is shown
to yield non-Gaussian corrections to the orbits even if the random electric and
magnetic fields are Gaussian. The predicted steady-state turbulence level
exhibits a peaked anglular distribution, with a maximum near Theta ~ 60
degrees.
