We study the spectrum and average mass composition of cosmic rays with
primary energies between 10^{17} eV and 10^{18} eV using a hybrid detector
consisting of the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) prototype and the MIA muon
array. Measurements have been made of the change in the depth of shower maximum
as a function of energy. A complete Monte Carlo simulation of the detector
response and comparisons with shower simulations leads to the conclusion that
the cosmic ray intensity is changing f rom a heavier to a lighter composition
in this energy range. The spectrum is consistent with earlier Fly's Eye
measurements and supports the previously found steepening near 4 \times 10^{17}
eV .
