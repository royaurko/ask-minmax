Using the hierarchical approximation, we discuss the cut-off dependence of
the renormalized quantities of a scalar field theory. The naturalness problem
and questions related to triviality bounds are briefly discussed. We discuss
unphysical features associated with the hierarchical approximation such as the
recently observed oscillatory corrections to the scaling laws. We mention a
two-parameter family of recursion formulas which allows one to continuously
extrapolate between Wilson's approximate recursion formula and the recursion
formula of Dyson's hierarchical model. The parameters are the dimension D and
2^zeta, the number of sites integrated in one RG transformation. We show
numerically that at fixed D, the critical exponent gamma depends continuously
on zeta. We suggest the requirement of zeta -independence as a guide for
constructing improved recursion formulas.
