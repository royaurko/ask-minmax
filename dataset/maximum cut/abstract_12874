In this paper, we propose a methodology for partitioning and mapping
computational intensive applications in reconfigurable hardware blocks of
different granularity. A generic hybrid reconfigurable architecture is
considered so as the methodology can be applicable to a large number of
heterogeneous reconfigurable platforms. The methodology mainly consists of two
stages, the analysis and the mapping of the application onto fine and
coarse-grain hardware resources. A prototype framework consisting of analysis,
partitioning and mapping tools has been also developed. For the coarse-grain
reconfigurable hardware, we use our previous-developed high-performance
coarse-grain data-path. In this work, the methodology is validated using two
real-world applications, an OFDM transmitter and a JPEG encoder. In the case of
the OFDM transmitter, a maximum clock cycles decrease of 82% relative to the
ones in an all fine-grain mapping solution is achieved. The corresponding
performance improvement for the JPEG is 43%.
