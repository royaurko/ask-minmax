The minimum value of the radius of strange star covered by the crust of
nuclear matter is determined. The results for the maximum possible thickness of
the crust (up to the neutron drip) as well as the possibility of thinner crust
postulated by some contributors are discussed. The minimum radius of the strange
star with maximal crust is 5.5 km. The useful scaling formulae with respect to
the main parameters describing strange matter and the density at the bottom of
the crust are presented.
