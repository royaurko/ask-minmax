We use the AdS/CFT prescription of Alday and Maldacena \cite{am} to analyze
gluon 6-point scattering amplitudes at strong coupling in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. By
cutting and gluing we obtain AdS 6-point amplitudes that contain extra boundary
conditions and come close to matching the field theory results. We interpret
them as parts of the field theory amplitudes, containing only certain diagrams.
We also analyze the collinear limits of 6- and 5-point amplitudes and discuss
the results.
