Block diagonalization (BD) based precoding techniques are well-known linear
transmit strategies for multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems. By employing BD-type
precoding algorithms at the transmit side, the MU-MIMO broadcast channel is
decomposed into multiple independent parallel single user MIMO (SU-MIMO)
channels and achieves the maximum diversity order at high data rates. The main
computational complexity of BD-type precoding algorithms comes from two
singular value decomposition (SVD) operations, which depend on the number of
users and the dimensions of each user's channel matrix. In this work,
low-complexity precoding algorithms are proposed to reduce the computational
complexity and improve the performance of BD-type precoding algorithms. We
devise a strategy based on a common channel inversion technique, QR
decompositions, and lattice reductions to decouple the MU-MIMO channel into
equivalent SU-MIMO channels. Analytical and simulation results show that the
proposed precoding algorithms can achieve a comparable sum-rate performance as
BD-type precoding algorithms, substantial bit error rate (BER) performance
gains, and a simplified receiver structure, while requiring a much lower
complexity.
