We study the effect of extragalactic point sources on satellite observations
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In order to separate the
contributions due to different foreground components, a maximum-entropy method
is applied to simulated observations by the Planck Surveyor satellite. In
addition to point sources, the simulations include emission from the CMB and
the kinetic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects from galaxy clusters,
as well as Galactic dust, free-free and synchrotron emission. We find that the
main input components are faithfully recovered and, in particular, that the
quality of the CMB reconstruction is only slightly reduced by the presence of
point sources. In addition, we find that it is possible to recover accurate
point source catalogues at each of the Planck Surveyor observing frequencies.
