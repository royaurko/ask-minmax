Grain alignment theory has reached the stage where quantitative predictions
of the degree of alignment and its variations with optical depth are possible.
With the goal of studying the effect of clumpiness on the sub-millimeter and
far infrared polarization we computed the polarization due to alignment via
radiative torques within clumpy models of cores and molecular clouds. Our
models were based upon a highly inhomogeneous simulation of compressible
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The P-I relations for our models reproduce
those seen in observations. We show that the degree of polarization observed is
extremely sensitive to the upper grain size cut-off, and is less sensitive to
changes in the radiative anisotropy. Furthermore, despite a variety of dust
temperatures along a single line of sight through our core and amongst dust
grains of different sizes, the assumption of isothermality amongst the aligned
grains does not introduce a significant error. Our calculations indicate that
sub-mm polarization vectors can be reasonably good tracers for the underlying
magnetic field structure, even for relatively dense clouds (A_V~10 to the cloud
center).
  The current predictive power of the grain alignment theory should motivate
future polarization observations using the next generation of multi-wavelength
sub-mm polarimeters such as those proposed for SOFIA.
