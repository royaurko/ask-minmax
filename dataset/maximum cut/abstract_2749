When a computer hard drive is confiscated in the conduct of a police
investigation the information contained is commonly encrypted at such a level
that brute force thechniques have to be used. This is too time consuming if the
hard drive is large, thus demanding methods to make a smart distinction between
likely encrypted and non-encrypted code in order to use the cracking resources
efficiently. The methods are stopping rules according to the cutting edge of
on-line change-point detection. The performance of the methods is evaluated in
terms of conditional expected delay and predictive value having calibrated the
methods so that they all have the same expected time till false alarm.
