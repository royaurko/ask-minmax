Little Higgs models with T parity contain an attractive dark matter
candidate, the heavy photon. We compute the cross section of the heavy photon
annihilation into Z-photon pairs, which turns out to be substantially higher
than the previously computed cross section for the two photon final state.
Unfortunately, even with this enhancement, the monochromatic photon flux from
galactic heavy photon annihilation is unlikely to be detectable by GLAST or the
currently operating atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes. We also compute the flux
of high-energy neutrinos from the annihilation of the heavy photons captured by
the Sun and the Earth. The maximum flux of upward-going muons due to such
neutrinos is about 1 yr^{-1}km^{-2}.
