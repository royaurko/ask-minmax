We review a recent work on masses of mesons and nucleons within a hard wall
model of holographic QCD in a unified approach. In order to treat meson and
nucleon properties on the same footing, we introduced the same infrared (IR)
cut for both sectors. In framework of present approach, the best fit to the
experimental data is achieved introducing the anomalous dimension for baryons.
