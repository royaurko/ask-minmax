We investigate whether the equilibrium time averaged state of a
self-organising system with many internal degrees of freedom, 2D- daisyworld,
can be described by optimising a single quantity. Unlike physical systems where
a principle of maximum energy production has been observed, Daisyworld follows
evolutionary dynamics rather than Hamiltonian dynamics. We find that this is
sufficient to invalidate the MEP principle, finding instead a different
principle, that the system self-organises to a state which maximises the amount
of life.
