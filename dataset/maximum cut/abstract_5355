Low-mass, high-Q, silicon nitride nanostrings are at the cutting edge of
nanomechanical devices for sensing applications. Here we show that the addition
of a chemically functionalizable gold overlayer does not adversely affect the Q
of the fundamental out-of-plane mode. Instead the device retains its mechanical
responsiveness while gaining sensitivity to molecular bonding. Furthermore,
differences in thermal expansion within the bilayer give rise to internal
stresses that can be electrically controlled. In particular, an alternating
current excites resonant motion of the nanostring. This AC thermoelastic
actuation is simple, robust, and provides an integrated approach to sensor
actuation.
