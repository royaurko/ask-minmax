This paper proposes a cooperation protocol between a secondary user (SU) and
a primary user (PU) which dedicates a free frequency subband for the SU if
cooperation results in energy saving. Time is slotted and users are equipped
with buffers. Under the proposed protocol, the PU releases portion of its
bandwidth for secondary transmission. Moreover, it assigns a portion of the
time slot duration for the SU to relay primary packets and achieve a higher
successful packet reception probability at the primary receiver. We assume that
the PU has three states: idle, forward, and retransmission states. At each of
these states, the SU accesses the channel with adaptive transmission
parameters. The PU cooperates with the SU if and only if the achievable average
number of transmitted primary packets per joule is higher than the number of
transmitted packets per joule when it operates alone. The numerical results
show the beneficial gains of the proposed cooperative cognitive protocol.
