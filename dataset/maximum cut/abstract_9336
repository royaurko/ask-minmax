We present tables for self-diffusion coefficients of the Lennard-Jones
liquids and gases for various model formulas in the modified free volume theory
of diffusion in the case of reduced temperatures $T^{\ast}=6.0$, 4.0, 1.3, 1.0,
0.8, 0.7 with reduced density ranging from $\rho^{\ast}=0.025$ to 1. Their
accuracies are compared with the molecular dynamic simulation results. In the
gas and liquid density regimes, the formula $D_{CERC}$ for the self-diffusion
coefficient is accurate within maximum 4% of the molecular dynamics simulation
values reported in the literature. It is the most reliable among the formulas
presented
