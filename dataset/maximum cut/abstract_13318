At the core of the Robertson-Seymour theory of graph minors lies a powerful
structure theorem which captures, for any fixed graph H, the common structural
features of all the graphs not containing H as a minor. Robertson and Seymour
prove several versions of this theorem, each stressing some particular aspects
needed at a corresponding stage of the proof of the main result of their
theory, the graph minor theorem.
  We prove a new version of this structure theorem: one that seeks to combine
maximum applicability with a minimum of technical ado, and which might serve as
a canonical version for future applications in the broader field of graph minor
theory. Our proof departs from a simpler version proved explicitly by Robertson
and Seymour. It then uses a combination of traditional methods and new
techniques to derive some of the more subtle features of other versions as well
as further useful properties, with substantially simplified proofs.
