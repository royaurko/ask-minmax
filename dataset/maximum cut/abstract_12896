Using dc excitation to spatially tilt Landau levels, we study resonant
acoustic phonon scattering in two-dimensional electron systems. We observe that
dc electric field strongly modifies phonon resonances, transforming resistance
maxima into minima and back into maxima. Further, phonon resonances are
enhanced dramatically in the non-linear dc response and can be detected even at
low temperatures. Most of our observations can be explained in terms of
dc-induced (de)tuning of the resonant acoustic phonon scattering and its
interplay with intra-Landau level impurity scattering. Finally, we observe a
dc-induced zero-differential resistance state and a resistance maximum which
occurs when the electron drift velocity approaches the speed of sound.
