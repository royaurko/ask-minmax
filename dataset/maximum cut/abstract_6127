We have experimentally implemented the distribution of photon pairs produced
by spontaneous parametric down conversion through telecom dense wavelength
division multiplexing filters. Using the measured counts and coincidences
between symmetric channels, we evaluate the maximum fringe visibility that can
be obtained with polarization entangled photons and compare different filter
technologies.
