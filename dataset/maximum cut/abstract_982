It is often claimed that there should be a 'GZK cut-off" in the flux of
extragalactic cosmic rays, arising from interactions between the cosmic rays
and the cosmic micro-wave background photons (e.g. 1 and 2). Some experiments
(3 and 4) show particles of even higher energy than this value and this has led
to claims for exotic processes (e.g. 5 and 6).
  We contend that such claims are unnecessary - there is no predicted cut-off,
rather a continuation of the injection spectrum at reduced intensity. We have
combined the world's data and shown that the prediction for a rather flat
injection spectrum (exponent: 1.9 - 2.2) in the case of universal particle
injection provides a reasonable fit to the data. Conventional forms for the
particle attenuation in the intergalactic medium (e.g. 7 and 8) have been
assumed. Either protons or iron nuclei (or a mixture) will suffice.
  Attention is drawn to another aspect, too, that of the losses on the
infra-red radiation which may be intense near to strong sources and for sources
in galaxy clusters. The attendant magnetic fields near the sources leads to
significantly long diffusion times through the strong infra-red fields. Two
'case histories' are considered.
