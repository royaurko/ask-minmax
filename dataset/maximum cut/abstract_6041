Recently, Roth and Skachek proposed two methods for constructing nearly
maximum-distance separable (MDS) expander codes. We show that through the
simple modification of using mixed-alphabet codes derived from MDS codes as
constituent codes in their code designs, one can obtain nearly MDS codes of
significantly smaller alphabet size, albeit at the expense of a (very slight)
reduction in code rate.
