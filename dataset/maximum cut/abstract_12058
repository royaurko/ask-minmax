Using Path Integral Monte Carlo and the Maximum Entropy method, we calculate
the dynamic structure factor of solid $^4$He in the bcc phase at a finite
temperature of T = 1.6 K and a molar volume of 21 cm$^3$. Both the
single-phonon contribution to the dynamic structure factor and the total
dynamic structure factor are evaluated. From the dynamic structure factor, we
obtain the phonon dispersion relations along the main crystalline directions,
[001], [011] and [111]. We calculate both the longitudinal and transverse
phonon branches. For the latter, no previous simulations exist. We discuss the
differences between dispersion relations resulting from the single-phonon part
vs. the total dynamic structure factor. In addition, we evaluate the formation
energy of a vacancy.
