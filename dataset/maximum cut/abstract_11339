We present a model for generation mechanisms of the optical pulsations
recently detected from the Geminga pulsar. We argue that this is just a
synchrotron radiation emitted along open magnetic field lines at altitudes of a
few light cylinder radii (which requires that Geminga is an almost aligned
rotator), where charged particles acquire non-zero pitch-angles as a result of
the cyclotron absorption of radio waves in the magnetized pair plasma. This
explains self-consistently both the lack of apparent radio emission, at least
at frequencies higher than about 100 MHz, and the optical pulsations from the
Geminga pulsar. From our model it follows that the synchrotron radiation is a
maximum in the infrared band, which suggests that Geminga should also be a
source of a pulsed infrared emission.
