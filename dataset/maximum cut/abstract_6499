In this paper we first emphasize the importance of the Pomeron (IP) for its
asymptotically saturation the unitarity condition alone. After proper modified
the field theory model for IP developed by Landshoff and Nochtmann, we argue
that the exchange of IP in high energy $h-h'$ scattering embodies the
hypothesis of the maximum non-perturbative strong interaction reaction (MNSIR)
in which a constituent quark converts into a current quark and emits a color
octet non-perturbative gluer. We think the IP is composed from the conjugated
pair of such gluer. In the circle of non-perturbative fundamental entities in
QCD, we argue that there should exist a new member -- the constituent gluon, it
should be emerged in high energy $h-h'$ strong-soft processes, and the
glueballs are produced via two constituent gluons fusion. Finally, we
conjecture there may be an averaged dual relation between the glueballs and the
Pomeron, but this correspondence may become as multi-to-one homologue.
