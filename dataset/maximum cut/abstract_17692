One-dimensional light harvesting structures illuminated by a conventional
lens are studied in this paper. Our theoretical study shows that high
transmission efficiencies are obtained when the structure is placed near the
focal plane of the lens. The considered structure is a finite slit-groove array
(SGA) with a given number of grooves that are symmetrically distributed with
respect to a central slit. The SGA is nano-patterned on an opaque metallic
film. It is found that a total transmittance of 80% is achieved even for a
single slit when (i) Fabry-Perot like modes are excited inside the slit and
(ii) the effective cross section of the aperture becomes of the order of the
full width at half maximum of the incident beam. A further enhancement of 8% is
produced by the groove array. The optimal geometry for the groove array
consists of a moderate number of grooves ($ \geq 4$) at either side of the
slit, separated by a distance of half the incident wavelength $\lambda$.
Grooves should be deeper (with depth $\geq \lambda/4$) than those typically
reported for plane wave illumination in order to increase their individual
scattering cross section.
