Two extremal classes of acyclic groups are discussed. For an arbitrary group
G, there is always a homomorphism from an acyclic group of cohomological
dimension 2 onto the maximum perfect subgroup of G, and there is always an
embedding of G in a binate (hence acyclic) group. In the other direction, there
are no nontrivial homomorphisms from binate groups to groups of finite
cohomological dimension. Binate groups are shown to be of significance in
relation to a number of important K-theoretic isomorphism conjectures.
