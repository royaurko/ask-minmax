We propose a betting strategy based on Bayesian logistic regression modeling
for the probability forecasting game in the framework of game-theoretic
probability by Shafer and Vovk (2001). We prove some results concerning the
strong law of large numbers in the probability forecasting game with side
information based on our strategy. We also apply our strategy for assessing the
quality of probability forecasting by the Japan Meteorological Agency. We find
that our strategy beats the agency by exploiting its tendency of avoiding
clear-cut forecasts.
