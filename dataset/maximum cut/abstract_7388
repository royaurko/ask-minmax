Hard X- and $\gamma$-ray spectra and light curves resulting from radioactive
decays are computed for aspherical (jet-like) and energetic supernova models
(representing a prototypical hypernova SN 1998bw), using a 3D energy- and
time-dependent Monte Carlo scheme. The emission is characterized by (1) early
emergence of high energy emission, (2) large line-to-continuum ratio, and (3)
large cut-off energy by photoelectric absorptions in hard X-ray energies. These
three properties are not sensitively dependent on the observer's direction. On
the other hand, fluxes and line profiles depend sensitively on the observer's
direction, showing larger luminosity and larger degree of blueshift for an
observer closer to the polar ($z$) direction. Strategies to derive the degree
of asphericity and the observer's direction from (future) observations are
suggested on the basis of these features, and an estimate on detectability of
the high energy emission by the {\it INTEGRAL} and future observatories is
presented. Also presented is examination on applicability of a gray effective
$\gamma$-ray opacity for computing the energy deposition rate in the aspherical
SN ejecta. The 3D detailed computations show that the effective $\gamma$-ray
opacity $\kappa_{\gamma} \sim 0.025 - 0.027$ cm$^{2}$ g$^{-1}$ reproduces the
detailed energy-dependent transport for both spherical and aspherical
(jet-like) geometry.
