We study the structure of renormalons in the Heavy Quark Effective Theory, by
expanding the heavy quark propagator in powers of $1/m_Q$. We demonstrate
that the way in which renormalons appear depends on the regularisation scheme
used to define the effective theory. In order to investigate the relation
between ultraviolet renormalons and power divergences of matrix elements of
higher-dimensional operators in the heavy quark expansion, we perform
calculations in dimensional regularisation and in three different cut-off
regularisation schemes. In the case of the kinetic energy operator, we find
that the leading ultraviolet renormalon which corresponds to a quadratic
divergence, is absent in all but one (the lattice) regularisation scheme. The
nature of this ``invisible renormalon'' remains unclear.
