We present the first inelastic neutron scattering study of the short
wavelength dynamics in a phospholipid bilayer. We show that inelastic neutron
scattering using a triple-axis spectrometer at the high flux reactor of the ILL
yields the necessary resolution and signal to determine the dynamics of model
membranes. The results can quantitatively be compared to recent Molecular
Dynamics simulations. Reflectivity, in-plane correlations and the corresponding
dynamics can be measured simultaneously to gain a maximum amount of
information. With this method, dispersion relations can be measured with a high
energy resolution. Structure and dynamics in phospholipid bilayers, and the
relation between them, can be studied on a molecular length scale.
