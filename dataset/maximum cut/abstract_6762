Link adaptation is a crucial part of many modern communications systems,
allowing the system to adapt the transmission and reception strategies to
changes in channel conditions. One of the fundamental components of the link
adaptation mechanism is signal to noise ratio (SNR) estimation, measuring the
instantaneous (mostly post processing) SNR at the receiver. That is, the SNR at
the decoder input, which is an important metric for the prediction of decoder
performance. In linearly decoded MIMO, which is the common MIMO decoding
strategy, the post processing SNR is well defined. However, this is not the
case in optimal maximum likelihood (ML) decoding applied to spatial
multiplexing (SM). This gap is interesting since ML decoded SM is gaining ever
growing interest in recent research and practice due to the rapid increase in
computation power, and available near optimal low complexity schemes. In this
paper we close the gap and provide SNR estimation schemes for ML decoded SM,
which are based on various approximations of the "per stream" error
probability. The proposed methods are applicable for both horizonal and
vertical decoding. Moreover, we propose a very low complexity implementation
for the SNR estimation mechanism employing the ML decoder itself with
negligible overhead.
