We present high spectral resolution ($R\approx108,000$) Stokes $V$
polarimetry of the Classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) GQ Lup and TW Hya obtained
with the polarimetric upgrade to the HARPS spectrometer on the ESO 3.6 m
telescope. We present data on both photospheric lines and emission lines,
concentrating our discussion on the polarization properties of the \ion{He}{1}
emission lines at 5876 \AA\ and 6678 \AA. The \ion{He}{1} lines in these CTTSs
contain both narrow emission cores, believed to come from near the accretion
shock region on these stars, and broad emission components which may come from
either a wind or the large scale magnetospheric accretion flow. We detect
strong polarization in the narrow component of the two \ion{He}{1} emission
lines in both stars. We observe a maximum implied field strength of $6.05 \pm
0.24$ kG in the 5876 \AA\ line of GQ Lup, making it the star with the highest
field strength measured in this line for a CTTS. We find field strengths in the
two \ion{He}{1} lines that are consistent with each other, in contrast to what
has been reported in the literature on at least one star. We do not detect any
polarization in the broad component of the \ion{He}{1} lines on these stars,
strengthening the conclusion that they form over a substantially different
volume relative the formation region of the narrow component of the \ion{He}{1}
lines.
