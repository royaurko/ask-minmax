We report on the electronic properties of superlattices composed of three
different antiferromagnetic insulators, NdMnO3/SrMnO3/LaMnO3 grown on SrTiO3
substrates. Photoemission spectra obtained by tuning the x-ray energy at the Mn
2p -> 3d edge show a Fermi cut-off, indicating metallic behavior mainly
originating from Mn e_g electrons. Furthermore, the density of states near the
Fermi energy and the magnetization obey a similar temperature dependence,
suggesting a correlation between the spin and charge degrees of freedom at the
interfaces of these oxides.
