We compute the next-to-maximally-helicity-violating one-loop n-gluon
amplitudes in N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory. These amplitudes contain three
negative-helicity gluons and an arbitrary number of positive-helicity gluons,
and constitute the first infinite series of amplitudes beyond the simplest,
MHV, amplitudes. We assemble ingredients from the N=4 NMHV tree super-amplitude
into previously unwritten double cuts and use the spinor integration technique
to calculate all bubble coefficients. We also derive the missing box
coefficients from quadruple cuts. Together with the known formula for
three-mass triangles, this completes the set of NMHV one-loop master integral
coefficients in N=1 SYM. To facilitate further use of our results, we provide
their Mathematica implementation.
