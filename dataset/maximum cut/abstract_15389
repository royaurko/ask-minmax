The GN model of non-linear fiber propagation has been shown to overestimate
the variance of non-linearity due to the signal Gaussianity approximation,
leading to maximum reach predictions for typical optical systems which may be
pessimistic by about 5% to 15%, depending on fiber type and system set-up.
Various models have been proposed which improve over the GN model accuracy. One
of them is the EGN model, which completely removes the Gaussianity
approximation from all non-linear interference (NLI) components. The EGN model
is, however, substantially more complex than the GN model. Recently, we
proposed a simple closed-form formula which permits to approximate the EGN
model, starting from the GN. It was however limited to all-identical,
equispaced channels, and did not correct single-channel NLI (also called SCI).
In this follow-up contribution, we propose an improved version which both
allows to address non-identical channels and corrects the SCI contribution as
well. Extensive simulative testing shows the new formula to be asymptotically
very accurate, for sufficiently large number of spans. This is a preliminary
document which will be followed by a journal submission.
