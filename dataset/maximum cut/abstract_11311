We report on a measurement of the angular spectrum of the anisotropy of the
microwave sky at 30 and 40 GHz between l=50 and l=200 over approximately 600
sq. deg. The data support a rise in the angular spectrum to a maximum with
$\delta T_l \approx 85 \mu$K at l=200. We also give a 2-sigma upper limit of
$\delta T_l < 122 \mu$K at l=432 at 144 GHz. These results come from the first
campaign of the Mobile Anisotropy Telescope (MAT) on Cerro Toco, Chile. To
assist in assessing the site, we present plots of the fluctuations in
atmospheric emission at 30 and 144 GHz.
