This paper provides orbital parameters for 38 barium stars and 10 extrinsic S
stars derived from a decade-long CORAVEL monitoring. Lower bounds on the
orbital period (generally exceeding 10 y) have been obtained for 10 more
systems. Mira S, SC and (Tc-poor) C stars have also been monitored and show
intrinsic radial-velocity variations due to atmospheric phenomena. Tentative
orbital solutions are proposed for 3 stars (S UMa, X Cnc, BD-08:1900) where the
velocity and photometric periods are different. Three stars (RZ Peg, SS Vir and
R CMi) exhibit radial-velocity variations synchronous with the light
variations. Pseudo-orbital solutions have been derived for those stars. In the
case of RZ Peg, a line-doubling phenomenon is observed near maximum light, and
probably reflects the shock wave propagating through the photosphere.
