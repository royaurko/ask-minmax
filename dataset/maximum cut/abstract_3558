We present a rapid method for the exact calculation of the cumulative
distribution function of the maximum of multinomially distributed random
variables. The method runs in time $O(mn)$, where $m$ is the desired maximum
and $n$ is the number of variables. We apply the method to the analysis of two
situations where an apparent clustering of cases of a disease in some locality
has raised the possibility that the disease might be communicable, and this
possibility has been discussed in the recent literature. We conclude that one
of these clusters may be explained on purely random grounds, whereas the other
may not.
