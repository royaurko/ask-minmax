We continue to develop the tensor-algebra approach to knot polynomials with
the goal to present the story in elementary and comprehensible form. The
previously reviewed description of Khovanov cohomologies for the gauge group of
rank N-1=1 was based on the cut-and-join calculus of the planar cycles, which
are involved rather artificially. We substitute them by alternative and natural
set of cycles, not obligatory planar. Then the whole construction is
straightforwardly lifted from SL(2) to SL(N) and reproduces Khovanov-Rozansky
(KR) polynomials, simultaneously for all values of N. No matrix factorization
and related tedious calculations are needed in such approach, which can
therefore become not only conceptually, but also practically useful.
