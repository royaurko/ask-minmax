We describe the application of a novel approach for the reduction of
scattering amplitudes, based on multivariate polynomial division, which we have
recently presented. This technique yields the complete integrand decomposition
for arbitrary amplitudes, regardless of the number of loops. It allows for the
determination of the residue at any multiparticle cut, whose knowledge is a
mandatory prerequisite for applying the integrand-reduction procedure. By using
the division modulo Groebner basis, we can derive a simple integrand recurrence
relation that generates the multiparticle pole decomposition for integrands of
arbitrary multiloop amplitudes. We apply the new reduction algorithm to the
two-loop planar and nonplanar diagrams contributing to the five-point
scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills and N=8 supergravity in four
dimensions, whose numerator functions contain up to rank-two terms in the
integration momenta. We determine all polynomial residues parametrizing the
cuts of the corresponding topologies and subtopologies. We obtain the integral
basis for the decomposition of each diagram from the polynomial form of the
residues. Our approach is well suited for a seminumerical implementation, and
its general mathematical properties provide an effective algorithm for the
generalization of the integrand-reduction method to all orders in perturbation
theory.
