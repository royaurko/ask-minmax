Relaxation of a non-equilibrium state in a disordered metal with a
spin-dependent electron energy distribution is considered. The collision
integral due to the electron-electron interaction is computed within the
approximation of a two-quasiparticle scattering. We show that the spin-flip
scattering processes with a small energy transfer may lead to the divergence of
the collision integral for a quasi one-dimensional wire. This divergence is
present only for a spin-dependent electron energy distribution which
corresponds to the total electron spin magnetization M=0 and only for non-zero
interaction in the triplet channel. In this case a non-perturbative treatment
of the electron-electron interaction is needed to provide an effective infrared
cut-off.
