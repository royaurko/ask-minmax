The electronic structures, lattice dynamics, and magnetic properties of
crystal {\beta}-FeSe under hydrostatic pressure have been studied by using the
first-principles electronic structure calculations with van der Waals (vdW)
corrections. With applied pressures, the energy bands around the Fermi energy
level consisting mainly of Fe-3d orbitals show obvious energy shifts and
occupation variations, and meanwhile the frequencies of all optical phonon
modes increase. Among these phonon modes, the A1g mode, which relates to the Se
height from the Fe-Fe plane, shows a clear frequency jump in the range between
5 and 6 GPa. This is also the pressure range within which the highest
superconducting transition temperature Tc of FeSe is reached in experiments. In
comparison with the other phonon modes, the zero-point vibration of the A1g
mode induces the strongest fluctuation of local magnetic moment on Fe under a
pressure from 0 to 9 GPa, and the induced fluctuation reaches the maximum
around 5 GPa. These results suggest that the effect of phonon via spin-phonon
coupling need to be considered when exploring the superconducting mechanism in
iron-based superconductors.
