We present the results of the fourth Optical/IR Interferometry Imaging Beauty
Contest. The contest consists of blind imaging of test data sets derived from
model sources and distributed in the OI-FITS format. The test data consists of
spectral data sets on an object "observed" in the infrared with spectral
resolution. There were 4 different algorithms competing this time: BSMEM the
Bispectrum Maximum Entropy Method by Young, Baron & Buscher; RPR the Recursive
Phase Reconstruction by Rengaswamy; SQUEEZE a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
algorithm by Baron, Monnier & Kloppenborg; and, WISARD the Weak-phase
Interferometric Sample Alternating Reconstruction Device by Vannier & Mugnier.
The contest model image, the data delivered to the contestants and the rules
are described as well as the results of the image reconstruction obtained by
each method. These results are discussed as well as the strengths and
limitations of each algorithm.
