We discuss the cutting rules in the real time approach to finite temperature
field theory and show the existence of cancellations among classes of cut
graphs which allows a physical interpretation of the imaginary part of the
relevant amplitude in terms of underlying microscopic processes. Furthermore,
with these cancellations, any calculation of the imaginary part of an amplitude
becomes much easier and completely parallel to the zero temperature case.
