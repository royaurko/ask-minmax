Supermassive black holes containing ~0.5% of the stellar mass of their host
galaxies appear to be ubiquitous components of galactic nuclei. The
gravitational force from these central singularities can influence the motion
of stars far outside the nucleus in non-axisymmetric, i.e. barred or triaxial,
galaxies. Here, recent work concerning the influence of nuclear black holes on
the large-scale structure of their host galaxies is reviewed. A number of
studies point to a critical ratio of black hole mass to bulge mass, Mh/Mg, at
which the black hole induces a transition to axisymmetry in the shape of the
surrounding bulge or bar. This critical ratio is close to the maximum value of
Mh/Mg observed in real galaxies, suggesting that black hole masses may be
limited by a feedback mechanism that cuts off the supply of fuel to the nucleus
once the central object grows sufficiently large.
