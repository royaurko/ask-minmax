This paper continues our earlier investigations into the inversion of random
functions in a general (abstract) setting. In Section 2 we investigate a
concept of invertibility and the invertibility of the composition of random
functions. In Section 3 we resolve some questions concerning the number of
samples required to ensure the accuracy of parametric maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE). A direct application to phylogeny reconstruction is given.
