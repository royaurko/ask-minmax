The recent results from photometric study of the new FUor star found in the
field of NGC 7000/IC 5070 are presented in the paper. The outburst of V2493 Cyg
in the summer of 2010 generated considerable interest among the astronomical
community. V2493 Cyg is the first FUor object, whose outburst was observed from
its very beginning in all spectral ranges. After reaching the firs maximum in
September/October 2010, the brightness of V2493 Cyg declined slowly, having
weakened by 1.45 mag. (V) by the spring/early summer of 2011. Since the autumn
of 2011, another light increase occurred and the star became brighter by 1.8
mag. (V) until April 2013. The recent photometric data show that the star keeps
its maximum brightness during the period April - August 2013 and the recorded
amplitude of the outburst reaches Delta V=5.1 mag. Consequently, the outburst
of V2493 Cyg lasts for more than three years. We expect that the interest in
this object will increase in the coming years and the results will help to
explore the nature of young stars.
