We present an approximate calculation for the distribution of the maximum of
a smooth stationary temporal signal X(t). As an application, we compute the
persistence exponent associated to the probability that the process remains
below a non-zero level M. When X(t) is a Gaussian process, our results are
expressed explicitly in terms of the two-time correlation function,
f(t)=<X(0)X(t)>.
