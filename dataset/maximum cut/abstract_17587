Bacterial spores in a metabolically dormant state can survive long periods
without nutrients under extreme environmental conditions. The molecular basis
of spore dormancy is not well understood, but the distribution and physical
state of water within the spore is thought to play an important role. Two
scenarios have been proposed for the spore's core region, containing the DNA
and most enzymes. In the gel scenario, the core is a structured macromolecular
framework permeated by mobile water. In the glass scenario, the entire core,
including the water, is an amorphous solid and the quenched molecular diffusion
accounts for the spore's dormancy and thermal stability. Here, we use $^2$H
magnetic relaxation dispersion to selectively monitor water mobility in the
core of Bacillus subtilis spores in the presence and absence of core Mn$^{2+}$
ions. We also report and analyze the solid-state $^2$H NMR spectrum from these
spores. Our NMR data clearly support the gel scenario with highly mobile core
water (~ 25 ps average rotational correlation time). Furthermore, we find that
the large depot of manganese in the core is nearly anhydrous, with merely 1.7 %
on average of the maximum sixfold water coordination.
