Understanding the maximal enhancement of solar absorption in semiconductor
materials by light trapping promises the development of affordable solar cells.
However, the conventional Lambertian limit is only valid for idealized material
systems with weak absorption, and cannot hold for the typical semiconductor
materials used in solar cells due to the substantial absorption of these
materials. Herein we theoretically demonstrate the maximal solar absorption
enhancement for semiconductor materials and elucidate the general design
principle for light trapping structures to approach the theoretical maximum. By
following the principles, we design a practical light trapping structure that
can enable an ultrathin layer of semiconductor materials,for instance, 10 nm
thick a-Si, absorb > 90% sunlight above the bandgap. The design has active
materials with one order of magnitude less volume than any of the existing
solar light trapping designs in literature. This work points towards the
development of ultimate solar light trapping techniques.
