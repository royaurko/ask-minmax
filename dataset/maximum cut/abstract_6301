Bar strengths are compared between active and non-active galaxies for a
sample of 43 barred galaxies. The relative bar torques are determined using a
new technique (Buta and Block 2001), where maximum tangential forces are
calculated in the bar region, normalized to the axisymmetric radial force
field. We use JHK images of the 2 Micron All Sky Survey. We show a first clear
empirical indication that the ellipticies of bars are correlated with the
non-axisymmetric forces in the bar regions. We found that nuclear activity
appears preferentially in those early type galaxies in which the maximum bar
torques are weak and appear at quite large distances from the galactic center.
Most suprisingly the galaxies with the strongest bars are non-active. Our
results imply that the bulges may be important for the onset of nuclear
activity, but that the correlation between the nuclear activity and the early
type galaxies is not straightforward.
