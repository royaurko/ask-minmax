We study various aspects of extracting spectral information from time
correlation functions of lattice QCD by means of Bayesian inference with an
entropic prior, the maximum entropy method (MEM). Correlator functions of a
heavy-light meson-meson system serve as a repository for lattice data with
diverse statistical quality. Attention is given to spectral mass density
functions, inferred from the data, and their dependence on the parameters of
the MEM. We propose to employ simulated annealing, or cooling, to solve the
Bayesian inference problem, and discuss practical issues of the approach.
