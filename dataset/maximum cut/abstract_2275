We analyze the phenomenological consequences of a Lorentz violating
energy-momentum dispersion relation in order to give a simple explanation for
the baryon asymmetry in the Universe. By assuming very few hypotheses, we
propose a straightforward mechanism for generating the observed
matter-antimatter asymmetry which entails a Lorentz-breakdown energy scale of
the order of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cut-off.
