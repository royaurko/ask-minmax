In the first part of this paper, we extend the d-dimensional unitarity cut
method of hep-ph/0609191 to cases with massive propagators. We present formulas
for integral reduction with which one can obtain coefficients of all pentagon,
box, triangle and massive bubble integrals. In the second part of this paper,
we present a detailed study of the phase space integration for unitarity cuts.
We carry out spinor integration in generality and give algebraic expressions
for coefficients, intended for automated evaluation.
