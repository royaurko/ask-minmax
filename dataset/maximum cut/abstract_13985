We have studied experimentally and numerically temperature profiles and the
formation of hot spots in intrinsic Josephson junction stacks in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8
(BSCCO). The superconducting stacks are biased in a state where all junctions
are resistive. The formation of hot spots in this system is shown to arise
mainly from the strongly negative temperature coefficient of the c-axis
resistivity of BSCCO at low temperatures. This leads to situations where the
maximum temperature in the hot spot can be below or above the superconducting
transition temperature Tc. The numerical simulations are in good agreement with
the experimental observations.
