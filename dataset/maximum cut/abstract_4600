Production of resonances is considered in the framework of the
single-freeze-out model of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The
formalism involves the virial expansion, where the probability to form a
resonance in a two-body channel is proportional to the derivative of the
phase-shift with respect to the invariant mass. The thermal model incorporates
longitudinal and transverse flow, as well as kinematic cuts of the STAR
experiment at RHIC. We find that the shape of the pi+ pi- spectral line
qualitatively reproduces the preliminary experimental data when the position of
the rho peak is lowered. This confirms the need to include the medium effects
in the description of the RHIC data. We also analyze the transverse-momentum
spectra of rho, K*(892), and f_0(980), and find that the slopes agree with the
observed values. Predictions are made for eta, eta', omega, phi, Lambda(1520),
and Sigma(1385).
