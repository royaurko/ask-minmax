We present an upper limit on the 3--20 keV X-ray flux from the black hole -
microlens OGLE-1999-BUL-32, based on RXTE/PCA scans over the Galactic Center
region in 1999-2000. It is shown that the X-ray luminosity of the black hole
did not exceed L(3-20 keV)<3e33(d/1kpc)^2 ergs/s (where d is the distance to
the black hole). Near the maximum of the background star amplification by the
microlens (July 6, 1999), the upper limit on the X-ray flux corresponds to an
X-ray luminosity L(3-20 keV)<7e33(d/1kpc)^2 ergs/s.
