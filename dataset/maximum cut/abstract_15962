The Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) is a multipurpose instrument
which has been delivered by the Instrument Development Laboratory of Lick
Observatory for use at the Cassegrain focus of the Keck II telescope. ESI saw
first light on August 29, 1999. ESI is a multi-mode instrument that enables the
observer to seamlessly switch between three modes during an observation. The
three modes of ESI are: An R=13,000-echellette mode; Low-dispersion prismatic
mode; Direct imaging mode. ESI contains a unique flexure compensation system
which reduces the small instrument flexure to negligible proportions.
Long-exposure images on the sky show FWHM spot diameters of 34 microns (0.34")
averaged over the entire field of view. These are the best non-AO images taken
in the visible at Keck Observatory to date. Maximum efficiencies are measured
to be 28% for the echellette mode and greater than 41% for low-dispersion
prismatic mode including atmospheric, telescope and detector losses. In this
paper we describe the instrument and its development. We also discuss the
performance-testing and some observational results.
