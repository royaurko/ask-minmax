Dihadron fragmentation functions and their evolution are studied in the
process of $e^+e^-$ annihilation. Under the collinear factorization
approximation and facilitated by the cut-vertex technique, the two hadron
inclusive cross section at leading order (LO) is shown to factorize into a
short distance parton cross section and a long distance dihadron fragmentation
function. We provide the definition of such a dihadron fragmentation function
in terms of parton matrix elements and derive its DGLAP evolution equation at
leading log. The evolution equation for the non-singlet quark fragmentation
function is solved numerically with a simple ansatz for the initial condition
and results are presented for cases of physical interest.
