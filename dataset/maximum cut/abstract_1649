This paper compares the Maximum-likelihood method and Bayesian method for
finite element model updating. The Maximum-likelihood method was implemented
using genetic algorithm while the Bayesian method was implemented using the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo. These methods were tested on a simple beam and an
unsymmetrical H-shaped structure. The results show that the Bayesian method
gave updated finite element models that predicted more accurate modal
properties than the updated finite element models obtained through the use of
the Maximum-likelihood method. Furthermore, both these methods were found to
require the same levels of computational loads.
