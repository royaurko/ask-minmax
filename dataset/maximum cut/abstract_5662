We apply the generalized Veneziano model ($B_5$ model) in the double-Regge
exchange limit to the $\gamma p \to K^+ K^- p$ reaction. Four different cases
defined by the possible combinations of the signature factors of leading Regge
exchanges (($K^*,a_2/f_2$), ($K^*,\rho/\omega$), ($K_2^*,a_2/f_2$), and
($K_2^*,\rho/\omega$)) have been simulated through the Monte Carlo method.
Suitable event candidates for the double-Regge exchange high-energy limit were
selected employing \textit{Van Hove} plots as a better alternative to
kinematical cuts in the $K^+ K^- p$ Dalitz plot. In this way we predict and
analyze the double-Regge contribution to the $K^+ K^- p$ Dalitz plot, which
constitutes one of the major backgrounds in the search for strangeonia, hybrids
and exotics using $\gamma p\rightarrow K^+K^-p$ reaction. We expect that data
currently under analysis, and that to come in the future, will allow
verification of the double-Regge behavior and a better assessment of this
component of the amplitude.
