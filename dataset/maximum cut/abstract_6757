Let $\G(v,e)$ be the set of all simple graphs with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges
and let $P_2(G)=\sum d_i^2$ denote the sum of the squares of the degrees, $d_1,
>..., d_v$, of the vertices of $G$.
  It is known that the maximum value of $P_2(G)$ for $G \in \G(v,e)$ occurs at
one or both of two special graphs in $\G(v,e)$--the \qs graph or the \qc graph.
For each pair $(v,e)$, we determine which of these two graphs has the larger
value of $P_2(G)$. We also determine all pairs $(v,e)$ for which the values of
$P_2(G)$ are the same for the \qs and the \qc graph. In addition to the \qs and
\qc graphs, we find all other graphs in $\G(v,e)$ for which the maximum value
of $P_2(G)$ is attained. Density questions posed by previous contributors are
examined.
