The partition function of nonequilibrium distribution which we recently
obtained [arXiv:0802.0259] in the framework of the maximum isotropization model
(MIM) is exploited to extract physical information from experimental data on
the proton rapidity and transverse mass distributions. We propose to partition
all interacting nucleons into ensembles in accordance with the number of
collisions. We analyze experimental rapidity distribution and get the number of
particles in every collision ensemble. We argue that even a large number of
effective nucleon collisions cannot lead to thermalization of nucleon system;
the thermal source which describes the proton distribution in central rapidity
region arises as a result of fast thermalization of the parton degrees of
freedom. The obtained number of nucleons which corresponds to the thermal
contribution is treated as a ``nucleon power'' of the created quark-gluon
plasma in a particular experiment.
