In this work, we report optical and photovoltaic properties of ZnO based
solid polymeric photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell. In this device construction,
film of ZnO nanoparticle (NP) has been sandwiched between ITO and LiClO4-PEO
solid electrolyte. ZnO NP has been used as photo-anode and the electrolyte
LiClO4 has been dissolved in a solid solution polyethylene oxide that makes the
device lightweight and portable. The charge transfer is performed by Li+ and
ClO4- ions which serve the purpose of a redox couple in a conventional dye
sensitize solar cell (DSSC). Short Circuit Current (JSC) shows maximum when the
ZnO/ITO interface has been illuminated by a UV light (350 +/- 15 nm) passing
through the transparent ITO glass substrate. JSC and Open Circuit Voltage (VOC)
of the best performing device are found to be 7 microA/cm2 and 0.24 V
respectively under white light of intensity 15 mW/cm2.
