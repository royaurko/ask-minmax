Here we analyze solar activity by focusing on time variations of the number
of sunspot groups (SGs) as a function of their modified Zurich class. We
analyzed data for solar cycles 2023 by using Rome (cycles 2021) and Learmonth
Solar Observatory (cycles 2223) SG numbers. All SGs recorded during these time
intervals were separated into two groups. The first group includes small SGs
(A, B, C, H, and J classes by Zurich classification) and the second group
consists of large SGs (D, E, F, and G classes). We then calculated small and
large SG numbers from their daily mean numbers as observed on the solar disk
during a given month. We report that the time variations of small and large SG
numbers are asymmetric except for the solar cycle 22. In general large SG
numbers appear to reach their maximum in the middle of the solar cycle (phase
0.450.5), while the international sunspot numbers and the small SG numbers
generally peak much earlier (solar cycle phase 0.290.35). Moreover, the 10.7 cm
solar radio flux, the facular area, and the maximum CME speed show better
agreement with the large SG numbers than they do with the small SG numbers. Our
results suggest that the large SG numbers are more likely to shed light on
solar activity and its geophysical implications. Our findings may also
influence our understanding of long term variations of the total solar
irradiance, which is thought to be an important factor in the Sun - Earth
climate relationship.
