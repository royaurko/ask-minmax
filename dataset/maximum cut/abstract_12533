In this paper, the global qualitative analysis of planar quadratic dynamical
systems is established and a new geometric approach to solving Hilbert's
Sixteenth Problem in this special case of polynomial systems is suggested.
Using geometric properties of four field rotation parameters of a new canonical
system which is constructed in this paper, we present a proof of our earlier
conjecture that the maximum number of limit cycles in a quadratic system is
equal to four and the only possible their distribution is (3:1). Besides,
applying the Wintner-Perko termination principle for multiple limit cycles to
our canonical system, we prove in a different way that a quadratic system has
at most three limit cycles around a singular point (focus) and give another
proof of the same conjecture.
