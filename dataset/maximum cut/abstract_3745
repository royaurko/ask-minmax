Photoelectron interferograms, manifested in photoelectron angular
distributions (PADs), are a high-information, coherent observable. In order to
obtain the maximum information from angle-resolved photoionization experiments
it is desirable to record the full, 3D, photoelectron momentum distribution.
Here we apply tomographic reconstruction techniques to obtain such 3D
distributions from multiphoton ionization of potassium atoms, and fully analyse
the energy and angular content of the 3D data. The PADs obtained as a function
of energy indicate good agreement with previous 2D data and detailed analysis
[Hockett et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 223001 (2014)] over the main spectral
features, but also indicate unexpected symmetry-breaking in certain regions of
momentum space, thus revealing additional continuum interferences which cannot
otherwise be observed. These observations reflect the presence of additional
ionization pathways and, most generally, illustrate the power of maximum
information measurements of this coherent observable.
