After the justification of the maximum entropy approach for equilibrium
thermodynamic system, and of a maximum path entropy algorithm for
nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems by virtue of the principle of virtual
work, we present in this paper another application of the principle to
thermodynamic systems out of equilibrium. Unlike the justification of maximum
path entropy for the motion trajectories during a period of time, this work is
on the maximum of the entropy defined as a measure of the momentary dynamical
uncertainty as a function of the probability distribution over the microstates
of the system at any given moment.
