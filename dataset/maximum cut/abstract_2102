We present preliminary results of the STAR experiment at RHIC on exotic
particle searches in minimum bias Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200
GeV. We observe a narrow peak at 1734 $\pm$ 0.5 $\pm$ 5 MeV in the $\Lambda
K^0_s$ invariant mass with width consistent with the experimental resolution of
about 6 MeV within the errors. The statistical significance can be quantified
between 3 and 6 $\sigma$ depending on cuts and methods. If this peak
corresponds to a real particle state it would be a candidate for the $N^0$ or
the $\Xi^0$ I=1/2 pentaquark states.
