Non-split almost complex supermanifolds and non-split Riemannian
supermanifolds are studied. The first obstacle for a splitting is parametrized
by group orbits on an infinite dimensional vector space. Further it is shown
that non-split structures appear in the first case as deformations of a split
reduction and in the second case as the deformation of an underlying metric. In
contrast to non-split deformations of complex supermanifolds, these
deformations can be restricted by cut-off functions to local deformations. A
class of examples of nowhere split structures constructed from almost complex
manifolds of dimension 6 and higher, is provided for both cases.
