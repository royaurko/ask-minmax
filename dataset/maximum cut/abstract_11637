We investigate the effect of exotic matter in particular, hyperon matter on
neutron star properties such as equation of state (EoS), mass-radius
relationship and bulk viscosity. Here we construct equations of state within
the framework of a relativistic field theoretical model. As hyperons are
produced abundantly in dense matter, hyperon-hyperon interaction becomes
important and is included in this model. Hyperon-hyperon interaction gives rise
to a softer EoS which results in a smaller maximum mass neutron star compared
with the case without the interaction. Next we compute the coefficient of bulk
viscosity and the corresponding damping time scale due to the non-leptonic weak
process including $\Lambda$ hyperons. Further, we investigate the role of the
bulk viscosity on gravitational radiation driven r-mode instability in a
neutron star of given mass and temperature and find that the instability is
effectively suppressed.
