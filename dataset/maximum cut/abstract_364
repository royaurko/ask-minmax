Gravitational scattering in the ADD-model is considered at both sub- and
transplanckian energies using a common formalism. By keeping a physical cut-off
in the KK tower associated with virtual KK exchange, such as the cut-off
implied from a finite brane width, troublesome divergences are removed from the
calculations in both energy ranges. The scattering behavior depends on three
different energy scales: the fundamental Planck mass, the collision energy and
the inverse brane width. The result for energies low compared to the effective
cut-off (inverse brane width) is a contact-like interaction. At high energies
the gravitational scattering associated with the extra dimensional version of
Newton's law is recovered.
