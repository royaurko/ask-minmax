We investigate localization of entanglement of multimode Gaussian states into
a pair of modes by local Gaussian measurements on the remaining modes and
classical communication. We find that for pure states and for mixed symmetric
states maximum entanglement between two modes can be localized by local
homodyne detections, i.e. projections onto infinitely squeezed states. We also
show that non-Gaussian measurements allow to localize more entanglement than
Gaussian ones.
