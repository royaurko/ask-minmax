The cut number of a manifold M, c(M), is the largest number of disjoint
two-sided hypersurfaces in M which do not separate M. Equivalently, it is the
largest rank of a free group being an epimorphic image of pi_1(M). We
investigate the relations between the cut number and the first Betti number,
b_1(M), of 3-manifolds M. We prove that the cut number of a ``generic''
3-manifold is at most 2. This is a rather unexpected result since it is very
hard to construct specific examples of 3-manifolds with with large b_1(M) and
small c(M). On the other hand, we prove that for any complex semisimple Lie
algebra g there exists a 3-manifold M with b_1(M)=dim g and c(M)<=rank g. Such
manifolds can be explicitly constructed.
