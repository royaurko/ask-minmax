ZFITTER is a Fortran package for the description of fermion-pair production
in e+e- annihilation. We report on results of a rederivation of the complete
set of analytical O(alpha) formulae for the treatment of photonic corrections
to the total cross-section and the integrated forward-backward asymmetry with
combined cuts on acollinearity angle, acceptance angle, and minimal energy of
the fermions. Numerically, the following changes result in ZFITTER v. 6.11
compared to ZFITTER v. 5.20/21: (i) at the Z resonance -- numerical changes are
negligible; (ii) at LEP 1 energies off-resonance -- corrections amount to at
most few per mil; (iii) at LEP 2 energies -- corrections amount to one per cent
or less. Thus, the predictions for LEP/SLC data remain unchanged within the
actual errors.
