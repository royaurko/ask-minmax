We characterize cutting arcs on fiber surfaces that produce new fiber
surfaces, and the changes in monodromy resulting from such cuts. As a
corollary, we characterize band surgeries between fibered links and introduce
an operation called Generalized Hopf banding. We further characterize
generalized crossing changes between fibered links, and the resulting changes
in monodromy.
