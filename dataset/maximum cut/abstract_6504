We compute and analyze the Flavor-Changing Neutral Current (FCNC)
interactions of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model Higgs bosons (h = h0, H0,
A0) with heavy quarks (top and bottom), focusing on the strongly-interacting
sector. We correlate the Higgs bosons production cross-section at the LHC with
the FCNC decay branching ratios and find the maximum allowed values of the
production rates, sigma(pp -> h -> qq') = sigma(pp -> h) x B(h -> qq') (qq'= tc
or bs) after taking into account limits from low energy data on flavor-changing
interactions. We single out the top channel, with a maximum production rate of
sigma^max(pp -> h -> tc) =~ 10^-3 - 10^-2 pb, as the most promising FCNC
channel to be detected at the LHC.
