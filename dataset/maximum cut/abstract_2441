We study the quantization of a linear scalar field, whose symmetries are
described by the kappa-Poincare' Hopf-algebra, via deformed Fock space
construction. The one-particle sector of the theory exhibits a natural
(planckian) cut-off for the field modes. At the multi-particle level the
non-trivial co-algebra structure of kappa-Poincare' leads to a deformed
bosonization in the construction of Fock space states. These physical states
carry energy-momentum charges which are divergenceless and obey a deformed
dispersion relation.
