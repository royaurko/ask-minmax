We calculate the response of a line emitted from a relativistic accretion
disk to a continuum variation of the central illuminating source. This model
might be relevant to the very broad and sometimes redshifted emission lines
which have been observed at optical and X-ray energies in Active Galactic
Nuclei and X-ray binaries. We consider separately the cases of a point-like and
of an extended central source. Based on the first three moments of the line
energy distribution (i.e. the line intensity, centroid energy and width) and
the two-dimensional transfer function, we identify a number of characteristic
features, which can help assessing the presence of a relativistic accretion
disk and estimating its parameters. In particular, by combining an absolute
time measurement of the maximum of line response function with a relative
measurement in units of light crossing time the mass of the central object can
be derived.
