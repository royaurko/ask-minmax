We present the design of a compact and highly sensitive electric field sensor
based on a bowtie antenna-coupled slot photonic crystal waveguide (PCW). An
electro-optic (EO) polymer with a large EO coefficient, r33=100pm/V, is used to
refill the PCW slot and air holes. Bowtie-shaped electrodes are used as both
poling electrodes and as receiving antenna. The slow-light effect in the PCW is
used to increase the effective in-device r33>1000pm/V. The slot PCW is designed
for low-dispersion slow light propagation, maximum poling efficiency as well as
optical mode confinement inside the EO polymer. The antenna is designed for
operation at 10GHz.
