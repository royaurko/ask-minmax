We present simulations of a cosmic shear survey and show how the survey
geometry influences the accuracy of determination of cosmological parameters.
We numerically calculate the full covariance matrices Cov of two-point
statistics of cosmic shear, based on the expressions derived in the first paper
of this series. The individual terms are compared for two survey geometries
with large and small cosmic variance. We use analyses based on maximum
likelihood of Cov and the Fisher information matrix in order to derive expected
constraints on cosmological parameters. As an illustrative example, we simulate
various survey geometries consisting of 300 individual fields of 13'x13' size,
placed (semi-)randomly into patches which are assumed to be widely separated on
the sky and therefore uncorrelated. Using the aperture mass statistics, the
optimum survey consists of 10 patches with 30 images in each patch. If
\Omega_m, \sigma_8 and \Gamma are supposed to be extracted from the data, the
minimum variance bounds on these three parameters are 0.17, 0.25 and 0.04
respectively. These variances raise slightly when the initial power spectrum
index n_s is also to be determined from the data. The cosmological constant is
only poorly constrained.
