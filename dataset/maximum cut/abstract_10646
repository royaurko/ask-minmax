Mkr 841 is a bright Seyfert 1 galaxy known to harbor a strong soft excess and
a variable K$\alpha$ iron line. It has been observed during 3 different periods
by XMM for a total cumulated exposure time of $\sim$108 ks. We present in this
paper a broad band spectral analysis of the complete EPIC-pn data sets. We were
able to test two different models for the soft excess, a relativistically
blurred photoionized reflection (\r model) and a relativistically smeared
ionized absorption (\a model). The continuum is modeled by a simple cut-off
power law and we also add a neutral reflection. These observations reveal the
extreme and puzzling spectral and temporal behaviors of the soft excess and
iron line. The 0.5-3 keV soft X-ray flux decreases by a factor 3 between 2001
and 2005 and the line shape appears to be a mixture of broad and narrow
components. We succeed in describing this complex broad-band 0.5-10 keV
spectral variability using either \r or \a to fit the soft excess. Both models
give statistically equivalent results even including simultaneous BeppoSAX data
up to 200 keV. Both models are consistent with the presence of remote
reflection characterized by a constant narrow component in the data. However
they differ in the presence of a broad line component present in \r but not
needed in \a. This study also reveals the sporadic presence of relativistically
redshifted narrow iron lines.
