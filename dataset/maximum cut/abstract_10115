The Cambrian explosion is a grand challenge to science today and involves
multidisciplinary study. This event is generally believed as a result of
genetic innovations, environmental factors and ecological interactions, even
though there are many conflicts on nature and timing of metazoan origins. The
crux of the matter is that an entire roadmap of the evolution is missing to
discern the biological complexity transition and to evaluate the critical role
of the Cambrian explosion in the overall evolutionary context. Here we
calculate the time of the Cambrian explosion by an innovative and accurate
"C-value clock"; our result (560 million years ago) quite fits the fossil
records. We clarify that the intrinsic reason of genome evolution determined
the Cambrian explosion. A general formula for evaluating genome size of
different species has been found, by which major questions of the C-value
enigma can be solved and the genome size evolution can be illustrated. The
Cambrian explosion is essentially a major transition of biological complexity,
which corresponds to a turning point in genome size evolution. The observed
maximum prokaryotic complexity is just a relic of the Cambrian explosion and it
is supervised by the maximum information storage capability in the observed
universe. Our results open a new prospect of studying metazoan origins and
molecular evolution.
