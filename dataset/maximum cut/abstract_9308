We describe here various detectors designs: GEM type, MICROMEGAStype,
PPACtype as well as cascaded detectors made of a resistive mesh manufactured
from a resistive Kapton foil, (20 microns thick, resistivity a few MOhm per
square) by a laser drilling technique. As in any other micropattern detectors
the maximum achievable gas gain of these detectors is restricted by the Raether
limit, however, the resistive mesh makes them and the front end electronics
fully spark protected. This approach could be an alternative or complimentary
to the ongoing efforts in developing MICROMEGAS and GEMs with resistive anode
readout plates and can be especially beneficial in the case of micropattern
detectors combined with a micropixel-type integrated front end electronics
