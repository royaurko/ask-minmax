We discuss a programming language for real-time audio signal processing that
is embedded in the functional language Haskell and uses the Low-Level Virtual
Machine as back-end. With that framework we can code with the comfort and type
safety of Haskell while achieving maximum efficiency of fast inner loops and
full vectorisation. This way Haskell becomes a valuable alternative to special
purpose signal processing languages.
