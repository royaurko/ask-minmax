Absolute proper motions, their corresponding errors and membership
probabilities of 501 stars in the intermediate-age open cluster NGC2548 region
are determined from MAMA measurements of 10 photographic plates. The plates
have the maximum epoch difference of 82 years and they were taken with the
double astrograph at Zo-Se station of Shanghai Observatory, which has an
aperture of 40 cm and a plate scale of 30"/mm. The average proper motion
precision is 1.18 mas/yr. These proper motions are used to determine the
membership probabilities of stars in the region. The number of stars with
membership probabilities higher than 0.7 is 165.
