In 1946 Erd\H os asked for the maximum number of unit distances, $u(n)$,
among $n$ points in the plane. He showed that $u(n)> n^{1+c/\log\log n}$ and
conjectured that this was the true magnitude. The best known upper bound is
$u(n)<cn^{4/3}$, due to Spencer, Szemer\'edi and Trotter. We show that the
upper bound $n^{1+6/\sqrt{\log n}}$ holds if we only consider unit distances
with rational angle, by which we mean that the line through the pair of points
makes a rational angle in degrees with the x-axis. Using an algebraic theorem
of Mann we get a uniform bound on the number of paths between two fixed
vertices in the unit distance graph, giving a contradiction if there are too
many unit distances with rational angle. This bound holds if we consider
rational distances instead of unit distances as long as there are no three
points on a line. A superlinear lower bound is given, due to Erd\H os and
Purdy. If we have at most $n^{\alpha}$ points on a line then we get the bound
$O(n^{1+\alpha})$ or $n^{1+\alpha+6/\sqrt{\log n}}$ for the number of rational
distances with rational angle depending on whether $\alpha\ge 1/2$ or $\alpha <
1/2$ respectively.
