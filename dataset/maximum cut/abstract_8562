Here the contributors provide a generalized Chudley-Elliott expression for
activated atom surface diffusion which takes into account the coupling between
both low-frequency vibrational motion (namely, the frustrated translational
modes) and diffusion. This expression is derived within the Gaussian
approximation framework for the intermediate scattering function at low
coverage. Moreover, inelastic contributions (arising from creation and
annihilation processes) to the full width at half maximum of the quasi-elastic
peak are also obtained.
