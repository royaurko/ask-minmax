Unique affine extensions $H^{\aff}_2$, $H^{\aff}_3$ and $H^{\aff}_4$ are
determined for the noncrystallographic Coxeter groups $H_2$, $H_3$ and $H_4$.
They are used for the construction of new mathematical models for quasicrystal
fragments with 10-fold symmetry. The case of $H^{\aff}_2$ corresponding to
planar point sets is discussed in detail. In contrast to the cut-and-project
scheme we obtain by construction finite point sets, which grow with a model
specific growth parameter.
