We present a maximum-likelihood analysis for estimating the angular
distribution of power in an anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave
background using ground-based laser interferometers. The standard isotropic and
gravitational-wave radiometer searches (optimal for point sources) are
recovered as special limiting cases. The angular distribution can be decomposed
with respect to any set of basis functions on the sky, and the single-baseline,
cross-correlation analysis is easily extended to a network of three or more
detectors-that is, to multiple baselines. A spherical harmonic decomposition,
which provides maximum-likelihood estimates of the multipole moments of the
gravitational-wave sky, is described in detail. We also discuss: (i) the
covariance matrix of the estimators and its relationship to the detector
response of a network of interferometers, (ii) a singular-value decomposition
method for regularizing the deconvolution of the detector response from the
measured sky map, (iii) the expected increase in sensitivity obtained by
including multiple baselines, and (iv) the numerical results of this method
when applied to simulated data consisting of both point-like and di#use
sources. Comparisions between this general method and the standard isotropic
and radiometer searches are given throughout, to make contact with the existing
literature on stochastic background searches.
