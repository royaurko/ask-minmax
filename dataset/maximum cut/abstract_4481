We discuss the existence of glueball states for N=1 SYM within the
Maldacena-Nunez model. We find that for this model the existence of an area law
in the Wilson loop operator does not imply the existence of a discrete glueball
spectrum. We suggest that implementing the model with an upper hard cut-off can
amend the lack of spectrum. As a result the model can be only interpreted in
the infra-red region. A direct comparison with the lattice data allows us to
fix the scale up to where the model is sensible to describe low-energy
observables. Nevertheless, taking for granted the lattice results, the
resulting spectrum does not follow the general trends found in other
supergravity backgrounds. We further discuss the decoupling of the non-singlet
Kaluza-Klein states by analysing the associated supergravity equation of
motion. The inclusion of non-commutative effects is also analysed and we find
that leads to an enhancement on the value of the masses.
