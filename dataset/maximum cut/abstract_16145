We describe and analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of
transient emission near 4680 {\AA} in Eta Car, reported earlier by Steiner &
Damineli (2004). If, as seems probable, this is He II $\lambda$4687, then it is
a unique clue to Eta Car's 5.5-year cycle. According to our analysis, several
aspects of this feature support a mass-ejection model of the observed
spectroscopic events, and not an eclipse model. The He II emission appeared in
early 2003, grew to a brief maximum during the 2003.5 spectroscopic event, and
then abruptly disappeared. It did not appear in any other HST spectra before or
after the event. The peak brightness was larger than previously reported, and
is difficult to explain even if one allows for an uncertainty factor of order
3. The stellar wind must provide a temporary larger-than-normal energy supply,
and we describe a special form of radiative amplification that may also be
needed. These characteristics are consistent with a class of mass-ejection or
wind-disturbance scenarios, which have implications for the physical structure
and stability of Eta Car.
