The paper contains the results of the polarization measurements of twilight
sky background during the wintertime including the epoch of Quadrantids
activity in January 2008 and 2009 in Crimea (Ukraine). Analysis of the twilight
sky polarization behavior had shown the barely detectable depolarization effect
at the scattering altitudes above 90 km right after the Quadrantids maximum.
This effect can be related with the meteoric dust in the upper atmosphere of
the Earth.
