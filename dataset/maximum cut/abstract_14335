Photonic crystal is a dielectric material which has a refractive index or
permittivity which vary periodically, thus preventing the propagation of light
with specific frequency and direction. The frequency range is called a photonic
bandgap (PBG). If the structure of photonic crystals is modified by taking one
line of rod in a photonic crystal is obtained a waveguide. Giving structures
with symmetrical defects around the waveguide channel with the parameters given
occurs coupling between the waveguide and cavity. Coupling indicates transfer
part or all of the EM field depends on the frequency of EM field in the
photonic crystal. Green tensor method can be used to calculate the total
electric field in a 2D photonic crystal. With the aid of MATLAB programs can be
shown to the powerful visualization calculation of the total electrical field
in 2D photonic crystals. Based on analysis of the literature and the bandgap
graphic and the field energy in the defects show that effective frequency which
produces maximum energy when coupling occur was in the mid-bandgap frequency
interval.
