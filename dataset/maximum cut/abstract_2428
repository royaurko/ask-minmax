The application of the copper bromide (CuBr) laser as an attractive tool in
the micro-machining of different materials has been demonstrated. High-quality
drilling by trepanning and precision cutting was established on several
materials with a negligible heat-affected zone (HAZ). That good performance was
a result of the combination of high power visible radiation, short pulses, and
close to the diffraction-limited laser beam quality with high-speed galvo
scanner beam steering.
