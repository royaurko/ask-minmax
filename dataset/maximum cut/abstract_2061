Using the spectral approach, we analyze the effective properties of a
composite which deviates slightly from periodicity. We find that, when the
inclusions are randomly displaced from their equilibrium positions, the sharp
resonances seen in the periodic case are broadened, and an additional branch
cut appears. We use these results to analyze the effective dielectric constant
of a colloidal crystal.
