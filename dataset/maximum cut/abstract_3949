Three transits of the planet orbiting the solar type star HD209458 were
observed in the far UV at the wavelength of the HI Ly-alpha line. The planet
size at this wavelength is equal to 4.3 R_Jup, i.e. larger than the planet
Roche radius (3.6 R_Jup). Absorbing hydrogen atoms were found to be blueshifted
by up to -130 km/s, exceeding the planet escape velocity. This implies that
hydrogen atoms are escaping this ``hot Jupiter'' planet. An escape flux of >~
10^10g/s is needed to explain the observations. Taking into account the tidal
forces and the temperature rise expected in the upper atmosphere, theoretical
evaluations are in good agreement with the observed rate. Lifetime of planets
closer to their star could be shorter than stellar lifetimes suggesting that
this evaporating phenomenon may explain the lack of planets with very short
orbital distance.
  This evaporating planet could be represented by the Egyptian God ``Osiris''
cut into pieces and having lost one of them. This would give us a much easier
way to name that planet and replace the unpleasant ``HD209458b'' name used so
far.
