We consider the thermodynamics of minimally coupled massive scalar field in
3+1 dimensional constant curvature black hole background. The brick wall model
of 't Hooft is used. When Schwarzschild like coordinates are used it is found
that two radial brick wall cut-off parameters are required to regularize the
solution. Free energy of the scalar field is obtained through counting of
states using the WKB approximation. It is found that the free energy and the
entropy are divergent in both the cut-off parameters.
