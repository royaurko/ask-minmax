We demonstrate that the (s-wave) geometric spectrum of the Efimov energy
levels in the unitary limit is generated by the radial motion of a primitive
periodic orbit (and its harmonics) of the corresponding classical system. The
action of the primitive orbit depends logarithmically on the energy. It is
shown to be consistent with an inverse-squared radial potential with a lower
cut-off radius. The lowest-order WKB quantization, including the Langer
correction, is shown to reproduce the geometric scaling of the energy spectrum.
The (WKB) mean-squared radii of the Efimov states scale geometrically like the
inverse of their energies. The WKB wavefunctions, regularized near the
classical turning point by Langer's generalized connection formula, are
practically indistinguishable from the exact wave functions even for the lowest
($n=0$) state, apart from a tiny shift of its zeros that remains constant for
large $n$.
