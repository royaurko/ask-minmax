We bound the number of fixed points of an automorphism of a real curve in
terms of the genus and the number of connected components of the real part of
the curve. Using this bound, we derive some consequences concerning the maximum
order of an automorphism and the maximum order of an abelian group of
automorphisms of a real curve. We also bound the full group of automorphisms of
a real hyperelliptic curve.
