Motivated by the possibility of formulating a strings/black hole
correspondence in AdS space, we extract the Hagedorn behavior of thermal AdS_3
bosonic string from 1-loop partition function of SL(2,R) WZW model. We find
that the Hagedorn temperature is monotonically increasing as the AdS radius
shrinks, reaches a maximum of order of string scale set by the unitarity bound
of the CFT for internal space. The resulting density of states near the
Hagedorn temperature resembles the form as for strings in flat space and is
dominated by the space-like long string configurations. We then argue a
conjectured strings/black hole correspondence in AdS space by applying the
Hagedorn thermodynamics. We find the size of the corresponding black hole is a
function of the AdS radius. For large AdS radius a black hole far bigger than
the string scale will form. On the contrary, when the AdS and string scales are
comparable a string size black hole will form. We also examine strings on BTZ
background obtained through SL(2,Z) transformation. We find a tachyonic
divergence for a BTZ black hole of string scale size.
