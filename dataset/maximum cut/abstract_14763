The strain effects on the spin-orbit induced splitting of the valence band
maximum and conduction band minimum in monolayer MoS2 and the gap in graphene
are calculated using first-principles calculations. The dependence of these
splittings on the various symmetry types of strain is described by means of an
effective Hamiltonian based on the method of invariants and the parameters in
the model are extracted by fitting to the theory. These splittings are related
to acoustic phonon deformation potentials, or electron-phonon coupling matrix
elements which enter the spin-dependent scattering theory of conduction in
these materials.
