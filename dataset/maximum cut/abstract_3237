Statistical properties of a local fluctuational fluxes measured at the plasma
edge are investigated in the work. It's shown that the amplitudes increments of
the local fluctuational fluxes decrease by power law. For approximation of
experimental PDFs the fractional stable distributions are used. The new
algorithm of statistical estimation of the FSD parameters based on maximum
likelihood method is described. By using of the algorithm the parameters of FSD
are estimated by using experimental samples. It is shown good agreement between
experimental and theoretical distributions. On the basis of this results the
conclusion is made about applicability of the CTRW model for description of a
processes underlying of the plasma turbulence.
