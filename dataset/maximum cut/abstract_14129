The hybrid eclipse of November 3rd, 2013 was observed as partial with a
magnitude equal to 0.126 from Badajoz (38^\circ 53' N, 6^\circ 58' W). The
evolution of the Total Ozone Column (TOC) values during 4 hours was monitored
using a Solar Light Microtops-II manual sun-photometer. Before the eclipse, TOC
remained invariable ~280 Dobson Units (DU) for one hour and a half. Once the
eclipse was started, a clear decrease in TOC occurred. After the eclipse
maximum (with TOC = 273 DU), a rapid TOC recovery was observed. When the
eclipse was over, TOC came back to values ~280 DU.
