The model of Dvali, Gabadadze, and Porrati (DGP) gives a simple geometrical
setup in which gravity becomes 5-dimensional at distances larger than a length
scale \lambda_{DGP}. We show that this theory has strong interactions at a
length scale \lambda_3 ~ (\lambda_{DGP}^2 / M_P)^{1/3}. If \lambda_{DGP} is of
order the Hubble length, then the theory loses predictivity at distances
shorter than \lambda_3 ~ 1000 km. The strong interaction can be viewed as
arising from a longitudinal `eaten Goldstone' mode that gets a small kinetic
term only from mixing with transverse graviton polarizations, analogous to the
case of massive gravity. We also present a negative-energy classical solution,
which can be avoided by cutting off the theory at the same scale scale
\lambda_3. Finally, we examine the dynamics of the longitudinal Goldstone mode
when the background geometry is curved.
