Carbon-dioxide (CO2) is the main contributor to anthropogenic global warming,
and the timing of its peak concentration in the atmosphere is likely to govern
the timing of maximum radiative forcing. While dynamics of atmospheric CO2 is
governed by multiple time-constants, we idealize this by a single time-constant
to consider some of the factors describing the time-delay between peaks in CO2
emissions and concentrations. This time-delay can be understood as the time
required to bring CO2 emissions down from its peak to a small value, and is
governed by the rate of decarbonizaton of economic activity. This
decarbonization rate affects how rapidly emissions decline after having
achieved their peak, and a rapid decline in emissions is essential for limiting
peak radiative forcing. Long-term mitigation goals for CO2 should therefore
consider not only the timing of peak emissions, but also the rate of
decarbonization. We discuss implications for mitigation of the fact that the
emissions peak corresponds to small but nonzero emissions. One consequence is
that the timing of peak CO2 is not influenced by its atmospheric lifetime,
despite its long lifetime being the origin of the delay in the concentration
peak.
