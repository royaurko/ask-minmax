Despite the shallow convective envelopes of delta Scuti pulsators, solar-like
oscillations are theoretically predicted to be excited in those stars as well.
To search for such stochastic oscillations we organised a spectroscopic
multi-site campaign for the bright, metal-rich delta Sct star rho Puppis. We
obtained a total of 2763 high-resolution spectra using four telescopes. We
discuss the reduction and analysis with the iodine cell technique, developed
for searching for low-amplitude radial velocity variations, in the presence of
high-amplitude variability. Furthermore, we have determined the angular
diameter of rho Puppis to be 1.68 \pm 0.03 mas, translating into a radius of
3.52 \pm 0.07Rsun. Using this value, the frequency of maximum power of possible
solar-like oscillations, is expected at ~43 \pm 2 c/d (498 \pm 23 muHz). The
dominant delta Scuti-type pulsation mode of rho Puppis is known to be the
radial fundamental mode which allows us to determine the mean density of the
star, and therefore an expected large frequency separation of 2.73 c/d (31.6
muHz). We conclude that 1) the radial velocity amplitudes of the delta Scuti
pulsations are different for different spectral lines; 2) we can exclude
solar-like oscillations to be present in rho Puppis with an amplitude per
radial mode larger than 0.5 m/s.
