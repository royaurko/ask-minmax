The renormalised form factors for pseudoscalar meson-baryon coupling are
computed in chiral colour dielectric model. This has been done by rearranging
the Lippmann-Schwinger series for the meson baryon scattering matrix so that it
can be expressed as a baryon pole term with renormalized form factors and
baryon masses and the rest of the terms which arise from the crossed diagrams.
Thus we are able to obtain an integral equation for the renormalized
meson-baryon form factors in terms of the bare form factors as well as an
expression for the meson self energy. This integral equation is solved and
renormalized meson baryon form factors and renormalized baryon masses are
computed. The parameters of the model are adjusted to obtain a best fit to the
physical baryon masses. The calculations show that the renormalized form
factors are energy-dependent and differ from the bare form factors primarily at
momentum transfers smaller than 1 GeV. At nucleon mass, the change in the form
factors is about 10% at zero momentum transfer. The computed form factors are
soft with the equivalent monopole cut-off mass of about 500 MeV. The
renormalized coupling constants are obtained by comparing the chiral colour
dielectric model interaction Hamiltonian with the standard form of
meson-nucleon interaction Hamiltonian. The ratio of $\Delta N\pi$ and $NN\pi$
coupling constants is found to be about 2.15. This value is very close to the
experimental value.
