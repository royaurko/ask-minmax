The Stringy Uncertainty relations, and corrections thereof, were explicitly
derived recently from the New Relativity Principle that treats all dimensions
and signatures on the same footing and which is based on the postulate that the
Planck scale is the minimal length in Nature in the same vein that the speed of
light was taken as the maximum velocity in Einstein's theory of Special
Relativity. A simple numerical argument is presented which suggests that
Quantum Spacetime may very well be $infinite$ dimensional. A discussion of the
repercusions of this new paradigm in Physics is given. A truly remarkably
simple and plausible solution of the cosmological constant problem results from
the New Relativity Principle : The cosmological constant is $not$ constant, in
the same vein that Energy in Einstein's Special Relativity is observer
dependent. Finally, following El Naschie, we argue why the observed D=4 world
might just be an $average$ dimension over the infinite possible values of the
Quantum Spacetime and why the compactification mechanisms from higher to four
dimensions in String theory may not be actually the right way to look at the
world at Planck scales.
