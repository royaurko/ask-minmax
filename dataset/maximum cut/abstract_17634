This paper presents and analyzes a novel concatenated coding scheme for
enabling error resilience in two distributed storage settings: one being
storage using existing regenerating codes and the second being storage using
locally repairable codes. The concatenated coding scheme brings together a
maximum rank distance (MRD) code as an outer code and either a globally
regenerating or a locally repairable code as an inner code. Also, error
resilience for combination of locally repairable codes with regenerating codes
is considered. This concatenated coding system is designed to handle two
different types of adversarial errors: the first type includes an adversary
that can replace the content of an affected node only once; while the second
type studies an adversary that is capable of polluting data an unbounded number
of times. The paper establishes an upper bound on the resilience capacity for a
locally repairable code and proves that this concatenated coding coding scheme
attains the upper bound on resilience capacity for the first type of adversary.
Further, the paper presents mechanisms that combine the presented concatenated
coding scheme with subspace signatures to achieve error resilience for the
second type of errors.
