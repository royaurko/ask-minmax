Motivated by work in graph theory, we define the fixing number for a matroid.
We give upper and lower bounds for fixing numbers for a general matroid in
terms of the size and maximum orbit size (under the action of the matroid
automorphism group). We prove the fixing numbers for the cycle matroid and
bicircular matroid associated with 3-connected graphs are identical. Many of
these results have interpretations through permutation groups, and we make this
connection explicit.
