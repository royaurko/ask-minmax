We present a self-consistent interpretation of the of very-high-energy
neutrino signal from the direction of the inner Galaxy, which is a part of the
astronomical neutrino signal reported by IceCube. We demonstrate that an
estimate of the neutrino flux in the E>100 TeV energy range lies at the
high-energy power-law extrapolation of the spectrum of diffuse gamma-ray
emission from the Galactic Ridge, as observed by Fermi telescope. This suggests
that IceCube neutrino and Fermi/LAT gamma-ray fluxes are both produced in
interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium in the Norma arm
and/or in the Galactic Bar. Cosmic rays responsible for the gamma-ray and
neutrino flux are characterised by hard spectrum with the slope harder than
-2.4 and cut-off energy higher than 10 PeV.
