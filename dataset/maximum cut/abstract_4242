The production of top quark pairs in association with a hard gluon in
$e^+e^-$ collisions at the NLC provides an opportunity to probe for anomalous
$t\bar tg$ couplings, \eg, the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic moments of the
top. We demonstrate that an examination of the energy spectrum of the
additional gluon jet can yield strong constraints on the size of these two
anomalous couplings. The results are shown to be quite sensitive to the cut on
the minimum gluon jet energy needed to remove events where the final state
$b$-quark radiates strongly. The possibility of using additional observables to
improve the sensitivity to anomalous couplings is briefly discussed. [To appear
