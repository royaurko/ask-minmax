The inaccessibility of a point p in a bounded domain D \subset R^n is the
minimum of the lengths of segments through p with boundary at \bd D. The points
of maximum inaccessibility I_D are those where the inaccessibility achieves its
maximum. We prove that for strictly convex domains, I_D is either a point or a
segment, and that for a planar polygon I_D is in general a point. We study the
case of a triangle, showing that this point is not any of the classical notable
points.
