We have used polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction to determine the
spatial distribution of the magnetization density induced by a magnetic field
of 9 T in the tetragonal phase of K0.8Fe1.6Se2. The maximum entropy
reconstruction shows clearly that most of the magnetization is confined to the
region around the iron atoms whereas there is no significant magnetization
associated with either Se or K atoms. The distribution of magnetization around
the Fe atom is slightly nonspherical with a shape which is extended along the
[0 0 1] direction in the projection. Multipolar refinement results show that
the electrons which give rise to the paramagnetic susceptibility are confined
to the Fe atoms and their distribution suggests that they occupy 3d t2g-type
orbitals with around 66% in those of xz/yz symmetry. Detail modeling of the
magnetic form factor indicates the presence of an orbital moment to the total
paramagnetic moment of Fe2+
