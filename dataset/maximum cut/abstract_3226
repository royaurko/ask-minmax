We present a detailed analysis of the upper critical field for CeCoIn5 under
high pressure. We show that, consistently with other measurements, this system
shows a decoupling between maximum of the superconducting transition
temperature Tc and maximum pairing strength. This puts forward CeCoIn5 as an
important paradigm for this class of unconventional, strongly correlated
superconductors.
