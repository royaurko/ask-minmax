A novel picture of the quasiparticle (QP) gap in prototype semiconductors Si
and Ge emerges from an analysis based on all-electron, self-consistent, GW
calculations. The deep-core electrons are shown to play a key role via the
exchange diagram --if this effect is neglected, Si becomes a semimetal.
Contrary to current lore, the Ge 3d semicore states (e.g., their polarization)
have no impact on the GW gap. Self-consistency improves the calculated gaps --a
first clear-cut success story for the Baym-Kadanoff method in the study of
real-materials spectroscopy; it also has a significant impact on the QP
lifetimes. Our results embody a new paradigm for ab initio QP theory.
