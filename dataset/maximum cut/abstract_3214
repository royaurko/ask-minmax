We report on the experimental realization of two different Bell inequality
tests based on six-qubit linear-type and Y-shape graph states. For each of
these states, the Bell inequalities tested are optimal in the sense that they
provide the maximum violation among all Bell inequalities with stabilizing
observables and possess the maximum resistance to noise.
