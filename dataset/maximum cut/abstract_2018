A method of accelerated computation of broadband far off boresight patterns
of telescope beams is extended and applied to the 100 GHz channels of Planck
HFI (HFI 100). Far off boresight angle power patterns are computed with both
GRASP PTD and NUIM PO software, considering cuts with an angular size of 10
degrees. The former reveal secondary oscillations of radial power distribution
as compared with the latter. The difference for power patterns of a/b
polarisation channels is also investigated.
