We report the first measurements of linear and nonlinear magneto-optical
polarization rotation on an intercombination transition of Ba vapor (lambda=
791.1nm). We observe a maximum polarization rotation angle in Faraday
configuration of 15mrad, accompanied by suppression of absorption. A
theoretical treatment of the nonlinear Faraday effect in the limit of a strong
interacting light field is developed.
