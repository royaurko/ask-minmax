Flux-pinning-induced stress and strain distributions in a thin disk
superconductor in a perpendicular magnetic field is analyzed. We calculate the
body forces, solve the magneto-elastic problem and derive formulas for all
stress and strain components, including the magnetostriction $\Delta R/R$. The
flux and current density profiles in the disk are assumed to follow the Bean
model. During a cycle of the applied field the maximum tensile stress is found
to occur approximately midway between the maximum field and the remanent state.
An effective relationship between this overall maximum stress and the peak
field is found.
