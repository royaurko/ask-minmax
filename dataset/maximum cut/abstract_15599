An Ulrich sheaf on an n-dimensional projective variety X, embedded in a
projective space, is a normalized ACM sheaf which has the maximum possible
number of global sections. Using a construction based on the representation
theory of Roby-Clifford algebras, we prove that every normal ACM variety admits
a reflexive sheaf whose restriction to a general 1-dimensional linear section
is Ulrich; we call such sheaves delta-Ulrich. In the case n=2, where
delta-Ulrich sheaves satisfy the property that their direct image under a
general finite linear projection is a semistable instanton bundle, we show that
some high Veronese embedding of X admits a delta-Ulrich sheaf with a global
section.
