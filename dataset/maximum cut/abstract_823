The partition function of BFSS matrix model is studied for two different
classical backgrounds upto 1-loop level. One of the backgrounds correspond to a
membrane wrapped around a compact direction and another to a localized cluster
of $D0$-branes. It is shown there exist phase transitions between these two
configurations - but only in presence of an IR cut-off. The low temperature
phase corresponds to a string (wrapped membrane) phase and so we call this the
Hagedorn phase transition. While the presence of an IR cut-off seemingly is
only required for perturbative analysis to be valid, the physical necessity of
such a cut-off can be seen in the dual supergravity side. It has been argued
from entropy considerations that a finite size horizon must develop even in an
extremal configuration of D0-branes, from higher derivative $O(g_s)$
corrections to supergravity. It can then be shown that the Hagedorn like
transition exists in supergravity also. Interestingly the perturbative analysis
also shows a second phase transition back to a string phase. This is also
reminiscent of the Gregory-Laflamme instability.
