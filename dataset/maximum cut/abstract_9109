Microbond tests composed of single fibre and matrix droplet are often used to
determine the properties of fibre reinforced composites. Interfacial shear
strength is quantified by the maximum pull-out force assuming a uniform stress
distribution along the fibre. Here, nonlinear finite element analyses are
performed to investigate the validity of this assumption.
