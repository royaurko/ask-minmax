We report results of a systematic study of one-dimensional four-wave moving
solitons in a recently proposed model of the Bragg cross-grating in planar
optical waveguides with the Kerr nonlinearity; the same model applies to a
fiber Bragg grating (BG) carrying two polarizations of light. We concentrate on
the case when the system's spectrum contains no true bandgap, but only
semi-gaps (which are gaps only with respect to one branch of the dispersion
relation), that nevertheless support soliton families. Solely zero-velocity
solitons were previously studied in this system, while current experiments
cannot generate solitons with the velocity smaller than half the maximum group
velocity. We find the semi-gaps for the moving solitons in an analytical form,
and demonstrated that they are completely filled with (numerically found)
solitons. Stability of the moving solitons is identified in direct simulations.
The stability region strongly depends on the frustration parameter, which
controls the difference of the present system from the usual model for the
single BG. A completely new situation is possible, when the velocity interval
for stable solitons is limited not only from above, but also from below.
Collisions between stable solitons may be both elastic and strongly inelastic.
Close to their instability border, the solitons collide elastically only if
their velocities c1 and c2 are small; however, collisions between more robust
solitons are elastic in a strip around c1=-c2.
