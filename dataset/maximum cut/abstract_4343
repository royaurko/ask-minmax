We study the mass of the ground state of Qqq system using differents
regularization schemes of the relativistic integral equation obtnaide with a
flavor independente contact interaction in a QCD-inspired model. We calculated
the masses of the spin 1/2 low-lying states of the $\Lambda^0$, $\Lambda^{+}_c$
and $\Lambda_{b}^{0}$ for differentes values of the regularization cut-off
parameter with a fixed nucleon mass.
  Our results are remarkable agreement with the experimental data.
