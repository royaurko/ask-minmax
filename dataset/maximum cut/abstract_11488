Optical spectroscopic observations of GX 339-4 were carried out between 1998
May (X-ray high state) and 1999 May (X-ray low state) over 7 epochs. The
equivalent width of Halpha increased during the high state then decreased
during the low state. The equivalent width of HeII 4686 decreased over both
states. The full-width half-maximum of Halpha, Hbeta, HeII 4686 and the Bowen
Blend increased from 1998 to 1999 indicating that the emission line regions
moved closer to the compact object. Hbeta shows a redshifted absorption feature
at 4880 angstroms at all epochs. This line remains unidentified. Analysis of
individual spectra from 1998 May 28-31 show modulation of the radial
velocities, equivalent width and V/R ratios of Halpha on the 14.86 hour orbital
period. The equivalent width of HeII 4686 also varies on the orbital period.
This is the first time since the study of Calanan et al. (1992) that
spectroscopic data has confirmed the orbital period. The semi-amplitude of the
Halpha radial velocities is K_1 = 14 km/s. Hence the mass function = 2 x
10^(-4) Msun.
