Magneto-optical imaging and Hall-probe array magnetometry are used to measure
the field of first flux entry, H_p, into the same Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8+delta
single crystal cut to different crystal thickness-to-width ratios (d/w), and
for two angles alpha between the edges and the principal in-plane crystalline
(a,b) axes. At all temperatures, the variation with aspect ratio of H_p is
qualitatively well described by calculations for the so-called geometric
barrier [E.H. Brandt, Phys. Rev. B 60, 11939 (1999)]. However, the magnitude of
H_p is strongly enhanced due to the square shape of the crystal. In the
intermediate temperature regime (T < ~ 50 K) in which the Bean-Livingston
barrier limits vortex entry, there is some evidence for a tiny
crystal-orientation dependent enhancement when the sample edges are at an angle
of 45 deg; with respect to the crystalline axes, rather than parallel to them.
