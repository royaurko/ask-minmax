In this paper we study the distribution of the level at time $\theta$ of
Markovian fluid queues and Markovian continuous time random walks, the maximum
(and minimum) level over $[0,\theta]$, and their joint distributions. We
approximate $\theta$ by a random variable $T$ with Erlang distribution and we
use an alternative way, with respect to the usual Laplace transform approach,
to compute the distributions. We present probabilistic interpretation of the
equations and provide a numerical illustration.
