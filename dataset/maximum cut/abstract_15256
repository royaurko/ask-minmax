In the analysis of non-monotone missing at random (MAR) data using inverse
probability weighting, a straightforward approach towards modeling the
missingness mechanism based on simple polytomous logistic regression often
imposes more restrictive conditions than what MAR entails. We propose a class
of models for the non-monotone missingness mechanism that spans and
accommodates the entire MAR model, and the estimation procedure can be easily
implemented within this class using existing software. Where unconstrained
maximum likelihood does not converge, we propose a Bayesian estimation of the
missing data process which is guaranteed to yield inferences within the model.
We illustrate the new methodology in an application evaluating the association
between maternal HIV infection and adverse birth outcomes in Botswana.
