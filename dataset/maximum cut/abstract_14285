In this paper, we explore the nature of three-dimensional Bose gases at large
positive scattering lengths via resummation of dominating processes involving a
minimum number of virtual atoms. We focus on the energetics of the nearly
fermionized Bose gases beyond the usual dilute limit. We also find that an
onset instability sets in at a critical scattering length, beyond which the
near-resonance Bose gases become strongly coupled to molecules and lose the
metastability. Near the point of instability, the chemical potential reaches a
maximum, and the effect of the three-body forces can be estimated to be around
a few percent.
