We calculate the decay rate of a Yukawa fermion in a thermal bath using
finite temperature cutting rules and effective Green's functions according to
the hard thermal loop resummation technique. We apply this result to the decay
of a heavy Majorana neutrino in leptogenesis. Compared to the usual approach
where thermal masses are inserted into the kinematics of final states, we find
that deviations arise through two different leptonic dispersion relations. The
decay rate differs from the usual approach by more than one order of magnitude
in the temperature range which is interesting for the weak washout regime. We
discuss how to arrive at consistent finite temperature treatments of
leptogenesis.
