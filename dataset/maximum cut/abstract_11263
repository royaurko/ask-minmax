We present an optical imaging study of 20 southern-sky nova remnants which
has resulted in the discovery of four previously unknown nova shells -- V842
Cen, RR Cha, DY Pup and HS Pup. The study has also revealed previously
unobserved features in three other known shells -- those of BT Mon, CP Pup and
RR Pic. The images of BT Mon, V842 Cen, RR Cha, DY Pup and HS Pup have been
processed using several deconvolution algorithms (Richardson-Lucy, maximum
entropy and clean) in addition to straightforward point-source subtraction in
an attempt to resolve the shells from the central stars. The use of four
different methods enables us to make a qualitative judgement of the results.
Notably, the shell of RR Pic displays tails extending outwards from clumps in
the main ejecta similar to those previously detected in DQ Her.
