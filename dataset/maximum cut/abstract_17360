The $\beta$-model of random graphs is an exponential family model with the
degree sequence as a sufficient statistic. We characterize conditions that lead
to a quadratic time algorithm to check for the existence of MLE of the
$\beta$-model, and show that the MLE never exists for the degree partition
$\beta$ model. Motivated by privacy problems with network data, we then present
a differentially private estimator of the parameters of $\beta$-model. We show
that the estimator is asymptotically consistent and normally distributed - it
achieves the same rate of convergence as the non private estimator. Our
techniques involve releasing the degree sequence using Laplace mechanism and
constructing a maximum likelihood estimate of the degree sequence, which is
equivalent to projecting the noisy degree sequence on the set of all graphical
degree sequences. We present an efficient algorithm for the projection which
also outputs a synthetic graph. Our techniques can be used to release degree
distributions and degree partitions accurately and privately, and to estimate
noisy degrees arising from contexts other than privacy. We evaluate the
proposed estimator on real graphs and compare it with a current algorithm for
releasing degree distributions and find that it does significantly better.
