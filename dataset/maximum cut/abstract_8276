We are contructing an interferometric telescope, the Very Small Array, to
study the cosmic microwave background on angular scales 0.2--4.5 degrees. The
physical layout and electronic design of the telescope are optimised to give
maximum protection from systematic effects, while still providing sufficient
sensitivity to make high signal-to-noise images. A prototype single baseline is
currently being tested, with scientific results expected during 2000.
