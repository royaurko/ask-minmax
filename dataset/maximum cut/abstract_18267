We present VLBA observations of water maser emission associated with the
star-forming region IRAS 21391+5802, which is embedded in a bright rimmed
cometary globule in IC1396. The angular resolution of the maps is about 0.8
mas, corresponding to a spatial resolution of about 0.6 AU, at an estimated
distance of 750 pc. Proper motions are derived for 10 maser features identified
consistently over three epochs, which were separated by intervals of about one
month. The masers appear in four groups, which are aligned linearly on the sky,
roughly along a northeast-southwest direction, with a total separation of about
520 AU (about 0.7 arcseconds). The 3-D velocities of the masers have a maximum
value of about 42 km/s (about 9 AU/yr). The average error on the derived proper
motions is about 4 km/s. The overall pattern of proper motions is indicative of
a bipolar outflow. Proper motions of the masers in a central cluster, with a
projected extent of about 20 AU, show systematic deviations from a radial
outflow. However, we find no evidence of Keplerian rotation, as has been
claimed elsewhere. A nearly circular loop of masers lies near the middle of the
cluster. The radius of this loop is 1 AU and the line-of-sight velocities of
the masers in the loop are within 2 km/s of the systemic velocity of the
region. These masers presumably exist at the radial distance where significant
dust condensation occurs in the outflow emanating from the star.
