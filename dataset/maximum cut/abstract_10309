Now that theta13 is known to be large, a medium baseline reactor experiment
can observe the fine structure of the electron antineutrino survival
probability curve, approximately periodic oscillations in L/E with wavelength
4pi/Delta M^2_31. The periodicity with respect to L/E is broken by 2-3
oscillations which, in the case of the normal (inverted) hierarchy, shift the
first 16 oscillations nearly 1% higher (lower) and move the next 16 lower
(higher). The energy of each peak determines a particular combination of the
mass differences, for example cos^2(theta12)Delta M^2_31 + sin^2(theta12)Delta
M^2_32 for nearly all peaks visible at baselines under 40 km. Comparing these
combinations with each other or with NOvA results one can in principle
determine the mass hierarchy. Alternately, as the Fourier transforms of the 1-3
and 2-3 oscillation probabilities are out of phase by the 1-2 oscillation
probability, near the maximum of the 1-2 oscillation the complex phase of the
total survival probability can be used to determine the hierarchy. Two
interference effects make this task difficult. First, kilometer distances
between the reactors reduce the amplitudes of peaks below about 4 MeV. Second,
even reactors 100 or more kilometers away significantly obscure the 1-2
oscillation maximum, which also complicates a measurement of the solar mixing
angle with a single detector.
