We calculate the mean power spectrum of galaxies using published power
spectra of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The mean power spectrum has a
relatively sharp maximum on scale 120 Mpc (for Hubble constant h=1), followed
by an almost exact power-law spectrum of index n = -1.9 toward smaller scales.
The power spectrum found from APM 2-D galaxy distribution and from LCRS and
IRAS 1.2 Jy surveys is flatter around the maximum. Power spectra of galaxies
and matter are similar in shape, we find the bias parameter of galaxies
relative to matter 1.3 + - 0.1. We compare the empirical power spectrum of
matter with analytical power spectra and show that the primordial power
spectrum has a break in amplitude and a spike.
