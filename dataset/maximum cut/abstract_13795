We analyze the asymptotic performance of nonbinary spatially-coupled
low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes built on the general linear group,
when the transmission takes place over the binary erasure channel. We propose
an efficient method to derive an upper bound to the maximum a posteriori
probability (MAP) threshold for nonbinary LDPC codes, and observe that the MAP
performance of regular LDPC codes improves with the alphabet size. We then
consider nonbinary SC-LDPC codes. We show that the same threshold saturation
effect experienced by binary SC-LDPC codes occurs for the nonbinary codes,
hence we conjecture that the BP threshold for large termination length
approaches the MAP threshold of the underlying regular ensemble.
