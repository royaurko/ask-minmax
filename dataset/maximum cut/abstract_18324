We present measurements of parameters of the 3-dimensional power spectrum of
galaxy clustering from 222 square degrees of early imaging data in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. The projected galaxy distribution on the sky is expanded
over a set of Karhunen-Loeve eigenfunctions, which optimize the signal-to-noise
ratio in our analysis. A maximum likelihood analysis is used to estimate
parameters that set the shape and amplitude of the 3-dimensional power
spectrum. Our best estimates are Gamma=0.188 +/- 0.04 and sigma_8L = 0.915 +/-
0.06 (statistical errors only), for a flat Universe with a cosmological
constant. We demonstrate that our measurements contain signal from scales at or
beyond the peak of the 3D power spectrum. We discuss how the results scale with
systematic uncertainties, like the radial selection function. We find that the
central values satisfy the analytically estimated scaling relation. We have
also explored the effects of evolutionary corrections, various truncations of
the KL basis, seeing, sample size and limiting magnitude. We find that the
impact of most of these uncertainties stay within the 2-sigma uncertainties of
our fiducial result.
