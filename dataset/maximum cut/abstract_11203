We present a study of the kinetic energy dissipation in interstellar cloud
collisions. The main aim is to understand the dependence of the elasticity
(defined as the ratio of the final to the initial kinetic energy of the clouds)
on the velocity and mass ratio of the colliding clouds, magnetic field
strength, and gas metallicity for head-on collisions. The problem has been
studied both analytically and via numerical simulations. We have derived handy
analytical relationships that well approximate the analogous numerical results.
The main findings of this work are: (i) the kinetic energy dissipation in cloud
collisions is minimum (i.e. the collision elasticity is maximum) for a cloud
relative velocity $v_r \simeq 30 km s^{-1}$; (ii) the above minimum value is
proportional $Z L_c^2$, where $Z$ is the metallicity and $L_c$ is the cloud
size: the larger is $Z L_c^2$ the more dissipative (i.e. inelastic) the
collision will be; (iii) in general, we find that the energy dissipation
decreases when the magnetic field strength, and mass ratio of the clouds are
increased and the metallicity is decreased, respectively. We briefly discuss
the relevance of this study to the global structure of the interstellar medium
and to galaxy formation and evolution.
