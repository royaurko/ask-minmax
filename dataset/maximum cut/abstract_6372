We introduce a concept for random tilings which, comprising the conventional
one, is also applicable to tiling ensembles without height representation. In
particular, we focus on the random tiling entropy as a function of the tile
densities. In this context, and under rather mild assumptions, we prove a
generalization of the first random tiling hypothesis which connects the maximum
of the entropy with the symmetry of the ensemble. Explicit examples are
obtained through the re-interpretation of several exactly solvable models. This
also leads to a counterexample to the analogue of the second random tiling
hypothesis about the form of the entropy function near its maximum.
