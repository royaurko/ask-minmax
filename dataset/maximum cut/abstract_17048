While silicon has dominated solid-state electronics for more than four
decades, a variety of new materials have been introduced into photonics to
expand the accessible wavelength range and to improve the performance of
photonic devices. For example, gallium-nitride based materials enable the light
emission at blue and ultraviolet wavelengths, and high index contrast
silicon-on-insulator facilitates the realization of ultra dense and CMOS
compatible photonic devices. Here, we report the first deployment of graphene,
a two-dimensional carbon material, as the photo-detection element in a 10
Gbits/s optical data link. In this interdigitated metal-graphene-metal
photodetector, an asymmetric metallization scheme is adopted to break the
mirror symmetry of the built-in electric-field profile in conventional graphene
field-effect-transistor channels, allowing for efficient photo-detection within
the entire area of light illumination. A maximum external photo-responsivity of
6.1 mA/W is achieved at 1.55 {\mu}m wavelength, a very impressive value given
that the material is below one nanometer in thickness. Moreover, owing to the
unique band structure and exceptional electronic properties of graphene, high
speed photodetectors with an ultra-wide operational wavelength range at least
from 300 nm to 6 {\mu}m can be realized using this fascinating material.
