We search for misclassified type 1 AGNs among type 2 AGNs identified with
emission line flux ratios, and investigate the properties of the sample. Using
4\,113 local type 2 AGNs at $0.02<z<0.05$ selected from Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Data Release 7, we detected a broad component of the \Ha\ line with a
Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM) ranging from 1\,700 to 19\,090 \kms\ for 142
objects, based on the spectral decomposition and visual inspection. The
fraction of the misclassified type 1 AGNs among type 2 AGN sample is
$\sim$3.5%, implying that a large number of missing type 1 AGN population may
exist. The misclassified type 1 AGNs have relatively low luminosity with a mean
broad \Ha\ luminosity, log L$_{H\alpha} = 40.50\pm0.35$ \ergs, while black hole
mass of the sample is comparable to that of the local black hole population,
with a mean black hole mass, log M$_{\rm BH} = 6.94\pm0.51$ M$_{\odot}$. The
mean Eddington ratio of the sample is log L$_{\rm bol}$/L$_{\rm Edd}$ =
$-2.00\pm0.40$, indicating that black hole activity is relatively weak, hence,
AGN continuum is too weak to change the host galaxy color. We find that the
\OIII\ lines show significant velocity offsets, presumably due to outflows in
the narrow-line region, while the velocity offset of the narrow component of
the \Ha\ line is not prominent, consistent with the ionized gas kinematics of
general type 1 AGN population.
