We describe modifications to the joint stepwise maximum likelihood method of
Cole (2011) in order to simultaneously fit the GAMA-II galaxy luminosity
function (LF), corrected for radial density variations, and its evolution with
redshift. The whole sample is reasonably well-fit with luminosity (Qe) and
density (Pe) evolution parameters Qe, Pe = 1.0, 1.0 but with significant
degeneracies characterized by Qe = 1.4 - 0.4Pe. Blue galaxies exhibit larger
luminosity density evolution than red galaxies, as expected. We present the
evolution-corrected r-band LF for the whole sample and for blue and red
sub-samples, using both Petrosian and Sersic magnitudes. Petrosian magnitudes
miss a substantial fraction of the flux of de Vaucouleurs profile galaxies: the
Sersic LF is substantially higher than the Petrosian LF at the bright end.
