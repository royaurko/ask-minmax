We experimentally study the ghost critical field (GCF), a magnetic field
scale for the suppression of superconducting fluctuations, using Hall effect
and magnetoresistance measurements on a disordered superconducting thin film
near its transition temperature $T_c$. We observe an increase in the Hall
effect with a maximum in field that tracks the upper critical field below
$T_c$, vanishes near $T_c$, and returns to higher fields above $T_c$. Such a
maximum has been observed in studies of the Nernst effect and identified as the
GCF. Magnetoresistance measurements near $T_c$ indicate quenching of
superconducting fluctuations, agree with established theoretical descriptions,
and allow us to extract the GCF and other parameters. Above $T_c$ the Hall peak
field is quantitatively distinct from the GCF, and we contrast this finding
with ongoing studies of the Nernst effect and superconducting fluctuations in
unconventional and thin-film superconductors.
