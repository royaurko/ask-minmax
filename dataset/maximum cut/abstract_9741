In this paper, we will analyse the consequences of deforming the canonical
commutation relations consistent with the existence of a minimum length and a
maximum momentum. We first generalize the deformation of first quantized
canonical commutation relation to second quantized canonical commutation
relation. Thus, we arrive at a modified version of second quantization. A
modified Wheeler-DeWitt equation will be constructed by using this deformed
second quantized canonical commutation relation. Finally, we demonstrate that
in this modified theory the big bang singularity gets naturally avoided.
