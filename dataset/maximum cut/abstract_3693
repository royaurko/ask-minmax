We consider a static self-gravitating system consisting of perfect fluid with
isometries of an $(n-2)$-dimensional maximally symmetric space in Lovelock
gravity theory. A straightforward analysis of the time-time component of the
equations of motion suggests a generalized mass function.
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff like equation is obtained by using this mass
function and gravitational equations. We investigate the maximum entropy
principle in Lovelock gravity, and find that this Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
equation can also be deduced from the so called "maximum entropy principle"
which is originally customized for Einstein gravity theory. This investigation
manifests a deep connection between gravity and thermodynamics in this
generalized gravity theory.
