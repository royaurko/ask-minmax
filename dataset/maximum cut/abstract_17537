In our previous treatment of neutron stars, we have developed the model
fulfilling global and not local charge neutrality. In order to implement such a
model, we have shown the essential role by the Thomas-Fermi equations, duly
generalized to the case of electromagnetic field equations in a general
relativistic framework, forming a coupled system of equations that we have
denominated Einstein-Maxwell-Thomas-Fermi (EMTF) equations. From the
microphysical point of view, the weak interactions are accounted for by
requesting the \beta\ stability of the system, and the strong interactions by
using the \sigma-\omega-\rho\ nuclear model, where \sigma, \omega\ and \rho\
are the mediator massive vector mesons. Here we examine the equilibrium
configurations of slowly rotating neutron stars by using the Hartle formalism
in the case of the EMTF equations indicated above. We integrate these equations
of equilibrium for different central densities and circular angular velocities
and compute the mass, polar and equatorial radii, angular momentum,
eccentricity, moment of inertia, as well as quadrupole moment of the
configurations. Both the Keplerian mass-shedding limit and the axisymmetric
secular instability are used to construct the new mass-radius relation. We
compute the maximum and minimum masses and rotation frequencies of neutron
stars. We compare and contrast all the results for the global and local charge
neutrality cases.
