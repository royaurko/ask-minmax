We present a Raman spectroscopic investigation of the Herbertsmithite
ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2, the first realization of a Heisenberg s=1/2 antiferromagnet on a
perfect kagome lattice. The magnetic excitation spectrum of this compound is
dominated by two components, a high temperature quasi elastic signal and a low
temperature, broad maximum. The latter has a linear low energy slope and
extends to high energy. We have investigated the temperature dependence and
symmetry properties of both signals. Our data agree with previous calculations
and point to a spin liquid ground state.
