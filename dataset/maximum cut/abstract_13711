The Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagava-Sakata (PMNS) modified electroweak Lagrangian
yields, within the perturbative kinematical procedure in the massive neutrino
Fock space, in addition to the Lorentz invariant standard model (SM) neutrino
and antineutrino cross-sections, also the "infinitesimal" neutrino and
antineutrino cross-sections some of which are either conserving or violating
the Lorentz symmetry as well as also either conserving or violating the flavor
symmetry. Some of these infinitesimal differential cross-sections can be
extended into the space oscillation region beyond the collision point. The
extension goes along the baseline defined by the flavor neutrino or
antineutrino scattering angle. Each of these oscillation differential
cross-sections, being sinusoidal, change sign along the baseline; some start
positive and some negative at the collision point. For each of them one seeks
the baseline distance to the first differential cross-section maximum.
