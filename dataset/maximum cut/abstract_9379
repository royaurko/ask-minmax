We determine the statistics of work in isothermal volume changes of a
classical ideal gas consisting of a single particle. Combining our results with
the findings of Lua and Grosberg [J. Chem. Phys. B 109, 6805 (2005)] on
adiabatic expansions and compressions we then analyze the joint probability
distribution of heat and work for a microscopic, non-equilibrium Carnot cycle
and determine its efficiency at maximum power.
