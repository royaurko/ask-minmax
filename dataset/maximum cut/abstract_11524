We report on Galactic Center L'-band observations made during NAOS/CONICA
Science Verification. Colors of the inner 2" stars reveal an infrared excess of
S2, the closest star to the black hole, that could sign the first thermal
infrared detection of Sgr A*. A multi-wavelength maximum likelihood analysis
has allowed us to eliminate all but two of the candidates for gravitational
lensing proposed by Alexander (2001). Our observations of the thin and
intersecting structures of the Northern Arm could trace several shocks heating
the neighbooring dust rather than a stream of matter in orbit around the
central mass as previously thought.
