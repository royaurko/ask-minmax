Using the Sakai-Sugimoto model we study the effect of an external magnetic
field on the dynamics of fundamental flavours in both the confined and
deconfined phases of a large N_c gauge theory. We find that an external
magnetic field promotes chiral symmetry breaking, consistent with the "magnetic
catalysis" observed in the field theory literature, and seen in other studies
using holographic duals. The external field increases the separation between
the deconfinement temperature and the chiral symmetry restoring temperature. In
the deconfined phase we investigate the temperature-magnetic field phase
diagram and observe, for example, there exists a maximum critical temperature
(at which symmetry is restored) for very large magnetic field. We find that
this and certain other phenomena persist for the Sakai-Sugimoto type models
with probe branes of diverse dimensions. We comment briefly on the dynamics in
the presence of an external electric field.
