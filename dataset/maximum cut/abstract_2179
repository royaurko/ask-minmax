The cross section for inclusive prompt photon production with polarized
hadron beams is calculated at order $\alpha\alpha_s^2$ using the phase space
slicing or analytic/Monte Carlo method. Isolation cuts are placed on the photon
and the results are compared to a previous fully analytic calculation.
Numerical results for the isolated cross section are presented for for
$\vec{p}\vec{p}\rightarrow \gamma+X$ at RHIC center-of-mass energies with
plausible isolation parameters using the most modern polarized parton densities
evolved in next-to-leading order QCD. The perturbative stability of the
asymmetries and scale dependence of the results are briefly discussed.
