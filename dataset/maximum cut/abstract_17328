We present the results of our studies of the aperiodic optical flux
variability for SS Cyg, an accreting binary systemwith a white dwarf. The main
set of observational data presented here was obtained with the ANDOR/iXon
DU-888 photometer mounted on the RTT-150 telescope, which allowed a record(for
CCD photometers) time resolution up to 8 ms to be achieved. The power spectra
of the source's flux variability have revealed that the aperiodic variability
contains information about the inner boundary of the optically thick flow in
the binary system. We show that the inner boundary of the optically thick
accretion disk comes close to the white dwarf surface at the maximum of the
source's bolometric light curve, i.e., at the peak of the instantaneous
accretion rate onto the white dwarf, while the optically thick accretion disk
is truncated at distances 8.5e9 cm ~10 R_{WD} in the low state. We suggest that
the location of the inner boundary of the accretion disk in the binary can be
traced by studying the parameters of the power spectra for accreting white
dwarfs. In particular, this allows the mass of the accreting object to be
estimated.
