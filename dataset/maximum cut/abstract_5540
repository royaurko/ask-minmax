The study of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies reveals a nearly constant
cored density distribution of Cold Dark Matter. N-body simulations however lead
to a cuspy distribution on the galactic scale, with a central peak. A
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of light particles naturally solves this problem
by predicting a repulsive force, obstructing the formation of the peak. After
succinctly presenting the BEC model, we test it against rotation curve data for
a set of 3 High Surface Brightness (HSB), 3 Low Surface Brightness (LSB) and 3
dwarf galaxies. The BEC model gives a similar fit to the Navarro-Frenk-White
(NFW) dark matter model for all HSB and LSB galaxies in the sample. For dark
matter dominated dwarf galaxies the addition of the BEC component improved more
upon the purely baryonic fit than the NFW component. Thus despite the sharp
cut-off of the halo density, the BEC dark matter candidate is consistent with
the rotation curve data of all types of galaxies.
