Using Brownian Dynamics computer simulations we show that the relaxation of a
supercooled Brownian system is qualitatively the same as that of a Newtonian
system. In particular, near the so-called mode-coupling transition temperature,
dynamic properties of the Brownian system exhibit the same deviations from
power-law behavior as those of the Newtonian one. Thus, similar dynamical
events cut off the idealized mode-coupling transition in Brownian and Newtonian
systems. We discuss implications of this finding for extended mode-coupling
theory. In addition, we point out and discuss the difference between our
findings and experimental results, and present an alternative interpretation of
some of our simulation data.
