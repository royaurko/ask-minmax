In this paper we prove that bounded Hua-harmonic functions on tube domains
that satisfy some boundary regularity condition are necessarily pluriharmonic.
In doing so, we show that a similar theorem is true on one-dimensional
extensions of the Heisenberg group or equivalently on the Siegel upper
half-plane.
