Through a straightforward Bayesian approach we show that under some general
conditions a maximum running time, namely the number of discrete steps
performed by a computer program during its execution, can be defined such that
the probability that such a program will halt after that time is smaller than
any arbitrary fixed value. Consistency with known results and consequences are
also discussed.
