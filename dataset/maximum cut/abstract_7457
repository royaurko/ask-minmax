Low AC loss high transport current HTS cables (>1 kA) are required for
application in transformers, generators and are considered for future
generations of fusion reactors coils. 2G coated conductors are suitable
candidates for high field application at quite high operation temperatures of
50-77 K, which is crucial precondition for economical cooling costs. As a
feasibility study we present the first ROEBEL bar cable of approx. 35 cm length
made from industrial DyBCO coated conductor (THEVA GmbH, Germany). Meander
shaped ROEBEL strands of 4 mm width with a twist pitch of 180 mm were cut from
10 mm wide CC tapes using a specially designed tool. The strands carried in
average 157 Amps/cm-width DC and were assembled to a subcable with 5 strands
and a final cable with 16 strands. The 5 strand cable was tested and carried a
transport current of > 300 Amps DC at 77 K, equivalent to the sum of the
individual strand transport critical currents. The 16 strand cable carried 500
A limited through heating effects and non sufficient stabilisation and current
sharing. A pulse current load indicated a current carrying potential of > 1 kA
for the 16 strand cable.
