We geometrically engineer N=2 theories perturbed by a superpotential by
adding 3-form flux with support at infinity to local Calabi-Yau geometries in
type IIB. This allows us to apply the formalism of Ooguri, Ookouchi, and Park
[arXiv:0704.3613] to demonstrate that, by tuning the flux at infinity, we can
stabilize the dynamical complex structure moduli in a metastable,
supersymmetry-breaking configuration. Moreover, we argue that this setup can
arise naturally as a limit of a larger Calabi-Yau which separates into two
weakly interacting regions; the flux in one region leaks into the other, where
it appears to be supported at infinity and induces the desired superpotential.
In our endeavor to confirm this picture in cases with many 3-cycles, we also
compute the CIV-DV prepotential for arbitrary number of cuts up to fifth order
in the glueball fields.
