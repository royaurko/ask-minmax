In this report a potential problem in the data analysis of the OPERA
experiment is discussed: the main issue is that the quantity \partial t used in
the maximum likelihood procedure is not a "true" parameter of the
parent-distribution (called PDF in the paper) but a shhift in the x-axis (time
scale). This means that the quantity \partial t has to be considered only as a
systematic effect these error is not simply deducible from a gaussian
distribution as stated.
