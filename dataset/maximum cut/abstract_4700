The radiative corrections of the strong and electroweak interactions are
calculated at next-to-leading order for Higgs-boson production in the
weak-boson-fusion channel at hadron colliders. Specifically, the calculation
includes all weak-boson fusion and quark--antiquark annihilation diagrams to
Higgs-boson production in association with two hard jets, including all
corresponding interferences. The results on the QCD corrections confirm that
previously made approximations of neglecting s-channel diagrams and
interferences are well suited for predictions of Higgs production with
dedicated vector-boson fusion cuts at the LHC. The electroweak corrections,
which also include real corrections from incoming photons and leading
heavy-Higgs-boson effects at two-loop order, are of the same size as the QCD
corrections, viz. typically at the level of 5-10% for a Higgs-boson mass up to
\sim 700 GeV. In general, both types of corrections do not simply rescale
differential distributions, but induce distortions at the level of 10%. The
discussed corrections have been implemented in a flexible Monte Carlo event
generator.
