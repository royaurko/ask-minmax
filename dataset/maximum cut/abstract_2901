We discuss the renormalizability of the massless Thirring model in terms of
the causal fermion Green functions and correlation functions of left-right
fermion densities. We obtain the most general expressions for the causal
two-point Green function and correlation function of left-right fermion
densities with dynamical dimensions of fermion fields, parameterised by two
parameters. The region of variation of these parameters is constrained by the
positive definiteness of the norms of the wave functions of the states related
to components of the fermion vector current. We show that the dynamical
dimensions of fermion fields calculated for causal Green functions and
correlation functions of left-right fermion densities can be made equal. This
implies the renormalizability of the massless Thirring model in the sense that
the ultra-violet cut-off dependence, appearing in the causal fermion Green
functions and correlation functions of left-right fermion densities, can be
removed by renormalization of the wave function of the massless Thirring
fermion fields only.
