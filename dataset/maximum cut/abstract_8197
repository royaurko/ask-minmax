We present early phase observations in optical and near-infrared wavelengths
for the extremely luminous Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2009dc. The decline rate
of the light curve is $\Delta m_{15}(B)=0.65\pm 0.03$, which is one of the
slowest among SNe Ia. The peak $V$-band absolute magnitude is $M_{V}=-19.90\pm
0.15$ mag even if the host extinction is $A_{V}=0$ mag. It reaches
$M_{V}=-20.19\pm 0.19$ mag for the host extinction of $A_{V}=0.29$ mag as
inferred from the observed Na {\sc i} D line absorption in the host. Our
$JHK_{s}$-band photometry shows that the SN is one of the most luminous SNe Ia
also in near-infrared wavelengths. These results indicate that SN 2009dc
belongs to the most luminous class of SNe Ia, like SN 2003fg and SN 2006gz. We
estimate the ejected $^{56}$Ni mass of $1.2\pm 0.3$ $\Msun$ for no host
extinction case (or 1.6$\pm$ 0.4 M$_{\odot}$ for the host extinction of
$A_{V}=0.29$ mag). The C {\sc ii} $\lambda$6580 absorption line keeps visible
until a week after maximum, which diminished in SN 2006gz before its maximum
brightness. The line velocity of Si {\sc ii} $\lambda$6355 is about 8000 km
s$^{-1}$ around the maximum, being considerably slower than that of SN 2006gz,
while comparable to that of SN 2003fg. The velocity of the C {\sc ii} line is
almost comparable to that of the Si {\sc ii}. The presence of the carbon line
suggests that thick unburned C+O layers remain after the explosion. SN 2009dc
is a plausible candidate of the super-Chandrasekhar mass SNe Ia.
