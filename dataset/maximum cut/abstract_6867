We give a surgery formula for the asymptotic behavior of the sequence given
by the logarithm of the higher dimensional Reidemeister torsion. Applying the
resulting formula to Seifert fibered spaces, we show that the growth of the
sequences has the same order as the indices and we give the explicit values for
the limits of the leading coefficients. There are finitely many possibilities
as the limits of the leading coefficients for a Seifert fibered space. We also
show that the maximum is given by the product of (-log 2) and the Euler
characteristic of the base orbifold for a Seifert fibered space. These limits
of the leading coefficients give a locally constant function on a character
variety. This function takes the maximum only on the top-dimensional components
of the SU(2)-character varieties for Seifert fibered homology spheres.
