In this talk estimates are presented of the odderon contributions to the
exclusive J/psi and Upsilon production cross-sections at the Tevatron and the
Large Hadron Collider. The obtained cross-sections are compared to
cross-sections of the dominant background subprocesses mediated by the photon
exchange. Possible experimental cuts are proposed that reduce the photon
background.
