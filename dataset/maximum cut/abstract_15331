We undertake an investigation of particle acceleration in the context of
non-linear electrodynamics. We deduce the maximum energy that an electron can
gain in a non-linear density wave in a magnetised plasma, and we show that an
electron can `surf' a sufficiently intense Born-Infeld electromagnetic plane
wave and be strongly accelerated by the wave. The first result is valid for a
large class of physically reasonable modifications of the linear Maxwell
equations, whilst the second result exploits the special mathematical structure
of Born-Infeld theory.
