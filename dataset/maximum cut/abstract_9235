A linear-programming decoder for \emph{nonbinary} expander codes is
presented. It is shown that the proposed decoder has the maximum-likelihood
certificate properties. It is also shown that this decoder corrects any pattern
of errors of a relative weight up to approximately 1/4 \delta_A \delta_B (where
\delta_A and \delta_B are the relative minimum distances of the constituent
codes).
