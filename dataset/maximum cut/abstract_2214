Benefiting from the high statistics from $e^+e^-$ experiments at the $Z^0$
resonance, it is possible to impose strong two-jet cuts on the data without
losing the statistical significance. In these events perturbative activity is
suppressed and hadronization effects can be more prominent. I give two examples
of observables that can be important tools for a more detailed study of the
hadronization mechanism.
