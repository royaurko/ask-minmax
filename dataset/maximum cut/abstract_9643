This paper deals with spectrum sensing for cognitive radio scenarios where
the decision fusion center (DFC) exploits array processing. More specifically,
we explore the impact of user cooperation and orthogonal transmissions among
secondary users (SUs) on the reporting channel. To this aim four protocols are
considered: (i) non-orthogonal and non-cooperative; (ii) orthogonal and
non-cooperative; (iii) non-orthogonal and cooperative; (iv) orthogonal and
cooperative. The DFC employs maximum ratio combining (MRC) rule and performance
are evaluated in terms of complementary receiver operating characteristic
(CROC). Analytical results, coupled with Monte Carlo simulations, are
presented.
