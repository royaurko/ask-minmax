In this paper, we perform a careful numerical study of nearly singular
solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations with smooth initial data. We
consider the interaction of two perturbed antiparallel vortex tubes which was
previously investigated by Kerr in \cite{Kerr93,Kerr05}. In our numerical
study, we use both the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule and
the pseudo-spectral method with a high order Fourier smoothing. Moreover, we
perform a careful resolution study with grid points as large as
$1536\times1024\times 3072$ to demonstrate the convergence of both numerical
methods. Our computational results show that the maximum vorticity does not
grow faster than doubly exponential in time while the velocity field remains
bounded up to T=19, beyond the singularity time $T=18.7$ reported by Kerr in
\cite{Kerr93,Kerr05}. The local geometric regularity of vortex lines near the
region of maximum vorticity seems to play an important role in depleting the
nonlinear vortex stretching dynamically.
