We generalize the definition of localization length to disordered systems
driven by a time-periodic potential using a Floquet-Green function formalism.
We study its dependence on the amplitude and frequency of the driving field in
a one-dimensional tight-binding model with different amounts of disorder in the
lattice. As compared to the autonomous system, the localization length for the
driven system can increase or decrease depending on the frequency of the
driving. We investigate the dependence of the localization length with the
particle's energy and prove that it is always periodic. Its maximum is not
necessarily at the band center as in the non-driven case. We study the
adiabatic limit by introducing a phenomenological inelastic scattering rate
which limits the delocalizing effect of low-frequency fields.
