Robot reliability has become an increasingly important issue in the last few
years due to increased application of robots in many industries (like
automobile industry) under hazardous and unstructured environment. As the
component failure behavior is dependent on configuration and environment, the
available information about the constituent component of robots is most of the
time imprecise, incomplete, vague and conflicting and so it is very difficult
to analyze their behavior and to predict their failure pattern. The reliability
analysis of any system provides an understanding about the likelihood of
failures occurring in the system/component and the increased insight about its
inherent weakness. The objective of this paper is to quantify the uncertainties
that makes the decision more realistic, generic and extendable to application
domain. In this paper various reliability parameters (such as mean time between
failures, expected number of failures, reliability, availability etc.) are
computed using Fuzzy Lambda-Tau methodology. Triangular fuzzy numbers are used
to represent failure rates and repair times as they allow expert opinion,
linguistic variables, operating conditions, uncertainty and imprecision in
reliability information, to be incorporated into system model. Petri Nets are
used because unlike the fault tree methodology, the use of Petri Nets allows
efficient simultaneous generation of minimal cut and path sets.
