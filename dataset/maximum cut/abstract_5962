By using the maximum entropy principle with Tsallis entropy we obtain a
fragment size distribution function which undergoes a transition to scaling.
This distribution function reduces to those obtained by other contributors using
Shannon entropy. The treatment is easily generalisable to any process of
fractioning with suitable constraints.
