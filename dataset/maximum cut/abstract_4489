Recently Hertog, Horowitz, and Maeda (HHM) (hep-th/0310054) have proposed
that cosmic censorship can be violated in the AdS/CFT context. They argue that
for certain initial data there is insufficient energy available to make a black
hole whose horizon is big enough to cloak the singularity that forms. We have
investigated this proposal in the models HHM discuss and have thus far been
unable to find initial data that provably satisfy this criterion, despite our
development of an improved lower bound on the size of the singular region. This
is consistent with recent numerical results (hep-th/0402109). For certain
initial data, the energies of our configurations are not far above the lower
bound on the requisite black hole mass, and so it is possible that in the exact
time development naked singularities do form. We go on to argue that the finite
radius cut-off AdS_5 situation discussed by HHM displays instabilities when the
full 10D theory is considered. We propose an AdS_3 example that may well be
free of this instability.
