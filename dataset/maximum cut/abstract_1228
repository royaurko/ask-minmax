The stellar disk in a spiral galaxy is believed to be truncated physically
because the disk surface brightness is observed to fall faster than that for an
exponential in the outer, faint regions. We review the literature associated
with this phenomenon and find that a number of recent observations contradict
the truncation picture. Hence we question the very existence of a physical
outer cut-off in stellar disks. We show, in this paper, that the observed drop
in the surface brightness profiles in fact corresponds to a negligible decrease
in intensity, and that this minor change at the faint end appears to be
exaggerated on a log-normal plot. Since minor deviations from a perfect
exponential are common throughout the disk, we suggest that such a deviation at
the faint end could easily give rise to the observed sharp drop.
