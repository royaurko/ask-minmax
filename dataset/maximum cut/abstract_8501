We performed ac-susceptibility measurements to explore the vortex dynamics
and the flux pinning properties of superconducting Pb films with an array of
micro-holes (antidots) and non-fully perforated holes (blind holes). A lower
ac-shielding together with a smaller extension of the linear regime for the
lattice of blind holes indicates that these centers provide a weaker pinning
potential than antidots. Moreover, we found that the maximum number of flux
quanta trapped by a pinning site, i.e. the saturation number ns, is lower for
the blind hole array.
