In this paper, new techniques are presented to either simplify or improve
most existing upper bounds on the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding performance
of the binary linear codes over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.
Firstly, the recently proposed union bound using truncated weight spectrums by
Ma {\em et al} is re-derived in a detailed way based on Gallager's first
bounding technique (GFBT), where the "good region" is specified by a
sub-optimal list decoding algorithm. The error probability caused by the bad
region can be upper-bounded by the tail-probability of a binomial distribution,
while the error probability caused by the good region can be upper-bounded by
most existing techniques. Secondly, we propose two techniques to tighten the
union bound on the error probability caused by the good region. The first
technique is based on pair-wise error probabilities, which can be further
tightened by employing the independence between the error events and certain
components of the received random vectors. The second technique is based on
triplet-wise error probabilities, which can be upper-bounded by proving that
any three bipolar vectors form a non-obtuse triangle. The proposed bounds
improve the conventional union bounds but have a similar complexity since they
involve only the $Q$-function. The proposed bounds can also be adapted to
bit-error probabilities.
