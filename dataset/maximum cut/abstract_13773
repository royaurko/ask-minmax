We describe how the couplings in an asynchronous kinetic Ising model can be
inferred. We consider two cases, one in which we know both the spin history and
the update times and one in which we only know the spin history. For the first
case, we show that one can average over all possible choices of update times to
obtain a learning rule that depends only on spin correlations and can also be
derived from the equations of motion for the correlations. For the second case,
the same rule can be derived within a further decoupling approximation. We
study all methods numerically for fully asymmetric Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
models, varying the data length, system size, temperature, and external field.
Good convergence is observed in accordance with the theoretical expectations.
