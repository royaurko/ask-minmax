It is shown that the maximum stable output of a CPP-GMR sensor is increased
significantly by using a synthetic ferrimagnet free layer, provided the
electron current flows from free layer to reference layer. This free layer
allows a larger magnetoresistance ratio for a given free layer magnetic moment,
and in addition results in a greater than three-fold increase in the critical
current above which spin-torque instability of the free layer occurs. In read
heads with net free layer moments equivalent to only 4.5nm of Ni80Fe20, this
effect is shown to result in sustainable sense current densities above 2e8
A/cm2.
