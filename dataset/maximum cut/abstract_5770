This paper will discuss a new method of signal read-out from photon detectors
in ultra-large, underground liquid argon time projection chambers. In this
design, the signal from the light collection system is coupled via capacitive
plates to the TPC wire-planes. This signal is then read out using the same
cabling and electronics as the charge information. This greatly benefits light
collection: it eliminates the need for an independent readout, substantially
reducing cost; It reduces the number of cables in the vapor region of the TPC
that can produce impurities; And it cuts down on the number of feed-throughs in
the cryostat wall that can cause heat-leaks and potential points of failure. We
present experimental results that demonstrate the sensitivity of a LArTPC wire
plane to photon detector signals. We also simulate the effect of a 1 $\mu$s
shaping time and a 2 MHz sampling rate on these signals in the presence of
noise, and find that a single photoelectron timing resolution of $\sim$30 ns
can be achieved.
