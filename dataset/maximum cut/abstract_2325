Calibration technology provides us with a fast and elegant way to find the
supergravity solutions for BPS wrapped M-branes. Its true potential had however
remained untapped due to the absence of a classification of calibrations in
spacetimes with non-trivial flux. The applications of this method were thus
limited in practise to M-branes wrapping Kahler calibrated cycles. In this
paper, we catagorize a type of generalised calibrations which exist in
supergravity backgrounds and contain Kahler calibrations as a sub-class. This
broadens the arena of brane configurations whose supergravity solutions are
accessible through the calibration 'short-cut' method.
