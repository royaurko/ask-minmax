The use of Type Ia supernovae as distance indicators relies on the
determination of their brightness. This is not constant, but it can be
calibrated using an observed relation between the brightness and the properties
of the optical light curve (decline rate, width, shape), which indicates that
brighter SNe have broader, slower light curves. However, the physical basis for
this relation is not yet fully understood. Among possible causes are different
masses of the progenitor white dwarfs or different opacities in
Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. We parametrise the Chandrasekhar-mass models
presented by Iwamoto et al (1999), which synthesize different amounts of Ni,
and compute bolometric light curves and spectra at various epochs. Since
opacity in SNe Ia is due mostly to spectral lines, it should depend on the mass
of Fe-peak elements synthesized in the explosion, and on the temperature in the
ejecta. Bolometric light curves computed using these prescriptions for the
optical opacity reproduce the relation between brightness and decline rate.
Furthermore, when spectra are calculated, the change in colour between maximum
and two weeks later allows the observed relation between M_B(Max) and
Dm_{15}(B) to be reproduced quite nicely. Spectra computed at various epochs
compare well with corresponding spectra of spectroscopically normal SNeIa
selected to cover a similar range of Dm_{15}(B) values.
