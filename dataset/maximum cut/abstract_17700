We study the role of finite-size effects at the hadron-quark phase transition
in a new hybrid equation of state constructed from an ab-initio
Br\"uckner-Hartree-Fock equation of state with the realistic Bonn-B potential
for the hadronic phase and a covariant non-local Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model for
the quark phase. We construct static hybrid star sequences and find that our
model can support stable hybrid stars with an onset of quark matter below $2
M_\odot$ and a maximum mass above $2.17 M_\odot$ in agreement with recent
observations. If the finite-size effects are taken into account the core is
composed of pure quark matter. Provided that the quark vector channel
interaction is small, and the finite size effects are taken into account, quark
matter appears at densities 2-3 times the nuclear saturation density. In that
case the proton fraction in the hadronic phase remains below the value required
by the onset of the direct URCA process, so that the early onset of quark
matter shall affect on the rapid cooling of the star.
