The pt-differential inclusive production cross sections of the prompt charmed
mesons D0, D+, and D*+ in the rapidity range |y|<0.5 were measured in
proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV at the LHC using the ALICE
detector. Reconstructing the decays D0->K-pi+, D+->K-pi+pi+, D*+->D0pi+, and
their charge conjugates, about 8,400 D0, 2,900 D+, and 2,600 D*+ mesons with
1<pt<24 GeV/c were counted, after selection cuts, in a data sample of 3.14x10^8
events collected with a minimum-bias trigger (integrated luminosity L_int =
5/nb). The results are described within uncertainties by predictions based on
perturbative QCD.
