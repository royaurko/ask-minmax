We revisit the exclusive signature $e^\pm (\mu^\pm) + b\bar b$ in the
associated production of the intermediate mass Higgs boson with a $W$ boson. We
show that it is feasible to use this signature to identify the Higgs boson in
the lower intermediate mass region ($90$ to $130$ GeV) at the LHC with
reasonable acceptance cuts by assuming effective bottom-jet identification. We
further demonstrate that the background can be reduced with judicious cuts down
to the level of the signal.
