We present preliminary data and modeling of the late time light curve of the
Type Ia supernova SN 2000cx. Optical and near-infrared data obtained with the
VLT at 360 to 480 days past maximum light show the increasing importance of the
near-infrared regime. Detailed multi-band modeling based on W7 also show this
effect. Conclusions on positron escape in this phase may therefore require more
detailed observations and modeling than hitherto appreciated.
