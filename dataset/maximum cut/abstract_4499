We study the real time correlators of scalar glueball operators for
Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature in flat space. The analytic structure
of the frequency space propagator in perturbative field theory is seen to be
qualitatively different to the strong coupling results that may be obtained
from perturbations about AdS black hole spacetimes: we find branch cuts rather
than poles. This difference appears to persist away from the strict zero and
infinite coupling limits, possibly suggesting a phase transition in large N
thermal N = 4 SYM theory as a function of the 't Hooft coupling.
