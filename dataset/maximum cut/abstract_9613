In their paper \cite{DokosDwyer:Permutat12}, Dokos et al. conjecture that the
major index statistic is equidistributed among 1423-avoiding, 2413-avoiding,
and 2314-avoiding permutations. In this paper we confirm this conjecture by
constructing two major index preserving bijections, $\Theta:S_n(1423)\to
S_n(2413)$ and $\Omega:S_n(2314)\to S_n(2413)$. In fact, we show that $\Theta$
(respectively, $\Omega$) preserves numerous other statistics including the
descent set, right-to-left maximum (respectively, left-to-right minimum), and a
new statistic we call top-steps (respectively, bottom-steps).
