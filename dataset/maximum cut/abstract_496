We study initial cuts of models of weak two-sorted Bounded Arithmetics with
respect to the strength of their theories and show that these theories are
stronger than the original one. More explicitly we will see that
polylogarithmic cuts of models of $\mathbf{V}^0$ are models of $\mathbf{VNC}^1$
by formalizing a proof of Nepomnjascij's Theorem in such cuts. This is a
strengthening of a result by Paris and Wilkie. We can then exploit our result
in Proof Complexity to observe that Frege proof systems can be sub
exponentially simulated by bounded depth Frege proof systems. This result has
recently been obtained by Filmus, Pitassi and Santhanam in a direct proof. As
an interesting observation we also obtain an average case separation of
Resolution from AC0-Frege by applying a recent result with Tzameret.
