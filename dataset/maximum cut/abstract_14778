We study the existence and stability of solitons in the quadratic nonlinear
media with spatially localized ${\cal PT}$-symmetric modulation of the linear
refractive index. Families of stable one and two hump solitons are found. The
properties of nonlinear modes bifurcating from a linear limit of small
fundamental harmonic field are investigated. It is shown that the fundamental
branch, bifurcating from the linear mode of the fundamental harmonic is limited
in power. The power maximum decreases with the strength of the imaginary part
of the refractive index. The modes bifurcating from the linear mode of the
second harmonic can exist even above ${\cal PT}$ symmetry breaking threshold.
We found that the fundamental branch bifurcating from the linear limit can
undergo a secondary bifurcation colliding with a branch of two-hump soliton
solutions. The stability intervals for different values of the propagation
constant and gain/loss gradient are obtained. The examples of dynamics and
excitations of solitons obtained by numerical simulations are also given.
