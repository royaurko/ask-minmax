In this work we develop on the recently suggested concept of superstatistics
[C. Beck and E.G.D. Cohen, Physica A {\bf 322}, 267 (2003)], face the problem
of devising a viable way for estimating the correct statistics for a system in
absence of sufficient knowledge of its microscopical dynamics, and suggest to
solve it through the Maximum Entropy Principle. As an example, we deduce the
Probability Distribution Function for velocity fluctuations in turbulent
fluids, which is slightly different from the form suggested in [C. Beck, Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 87}, 180601 (2001)].
