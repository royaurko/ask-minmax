Current experimental constraints on a large parameter space in supersymmetric
models rely on the large missing energy signature. This is usually provided by
the lightest neutralino which stability is ensured by the R-parity. However, if
the R-parity is violated, the lightest neutralino decays into the standard
model particles and the missing energy cut is not efficient anymore. In
particular, the UDD type R-parity violation induces the neutralino decay to
three quarks which potentially leads to the most difficult signal to be
searched at hadron colliders. In this paper, we study the constraints on the
R-parity violating supersymmetric model using a same-sign dilepton and a
multijet signatures. We show that the gluino and squarks lighter than a TeV are
already excluded in constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model with
R-parity violation if their masses are approximately equal. We also analyze
constraints in a simplified model with R-parity violation. We compare how
R-parity violation changes some of the observables typically used to
distinguish a supersymmetric signal from standard model backgrounds.
