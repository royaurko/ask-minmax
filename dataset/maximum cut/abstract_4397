We point out that the dispersion relation for the left hand cut integral
presented in one of our previous paper (Nucl. Phys. {\bf A}733(2004)235) is
actually free of subtraction constant, even for unequal mass elastic
scatterings. A new fit to the LASS data~\cite{Aston} is performed and firm
evidence for the existence of $\kappa$ pole is found. The correct use of
analyticity also put strong constraints on threshold parameters -- which are
found to be in good agreement with those obtained from chiral theories. We also
determined the pole parameters of $K_0^*(1430)$ on the second sheet, and
reconfirm the existence of $K_0^*(1950)$ on the third sheet. We stress that the
LASS data do not require them to have the twin pole structure of a typical
Breit--Wigner resonance.
