(Abridged) This thesis presents work towards the design of a new array of
Image Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) to detect multi-TeV gamma-ray
sources. The array consists of 5 telescopes in a square layout with one central
telescope, known as the Pevatron eXplorer or PeX. PeX is a PeV (10^{15} eV)
cosmic ray explorer that aims to study and discover gamma-ray sources in the 1
to 500 TeV range. The initial PeX design has been influenced by the HEGRA
CT-System and H.E.S.S. configurations. One important feature of multi-TeV air
showers is their ability to trigger telescopes at large core distance (>400m).
PeX will utilise large core distance events to improve the performance and
illustrate the viability of a sparse array for multi-TeV gamma-ray astronomy.
  One important aspect of the thesis (Chapter 6) was the investigation of a new
time-based image cleaning method. The arrival time between photons in two
adjacent pixels in the camera is used to apply an extra cut which helps
mitigate night sky background. To illustrate the robustness of the time
cleaning cut, various level of night sky background have been considered. These
levels include: off-Galactic plane, on-Galactic plane and towards the Galactic
centre. The most important result is that PeX performance with a time cleaning
cut improves results when a high level of night sky background is present. For
a Galactic centre level of night sky background there is a factor of 1.5
improvement in angular resolution, effective area and quality factor when a
time cleaning cut is applied compared to using no time cleaning cut.
