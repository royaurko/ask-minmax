We consider in more detail the covariant counterterm proposed by Mann and
Marolf in asymptotically flat spacetimes. With an eye to specific practical
computations using this counterterm, we present explicit expressions in general
$d$ dimensions that can be used in the so-called `cylindrical cut-off' to
compute the action and the associated conserved quantities for an
asymptotically flat spacetime. As applications, we show how to compute the
action and the conserved quantities for the NUT-charged spacetime and for the
Kerr black hole in four dimensions.
