In this paper we give a bijective proof for a relation between uni- bi- and
tricellular maps of certain topological genus. While this relation can formally
be obtained using Matrix-theory as a result of the Schwinger-Dyson equation, we
here present a bijection for the corresponding coefficient equation. Our
construction is facilitated by repeated application of a certain cutting, the
contraction of edges, incident to two vertices and the deletion of certain
edges.
