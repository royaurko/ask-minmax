We have shown that if one relaxes the constraint that the quarks in a heavy
quarkonium are at rest and on-shell, new contributions to the discontinuity of
the production amplitude appear. These can be seen as a s-cut in the amplitude
and are on the same footage as the classical cut of the Colour-Singlet Model
(CSM), where the heavy quarks forming the quarkonium are put on-shell by
hypothesis. We treat this cut in a gauge-invariant manner by introducing
necessary new 4-point vertices, suggestive of the colour-octet mechanism. We
have further shown that this cut contributes at least as much as the LO CSM at
large P_T. However, the 4-point vertices cannot be totally constrained and an
ambiguity remains to what concerns their actual contribution. Theoretical
insights from meson photoproduction are discussed in that context.
