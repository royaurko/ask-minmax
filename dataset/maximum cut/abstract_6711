The viability of a possible cosmological scenario is investigated. The
theoretical framework is the constrained next-to-minimal supersymmetric
standard model (cNMSSM), with a gravitino playing the role of the lightest
supersymmetric particle (LSP) and a neutralino acting as the next-to-lightest
supersymmetric particle (NLSP). All the necessary constraints from colliders
and cosmology have been taken into account. For gravitino we have considered
the two usual production mechanisms, namely out-of equillibrium decay from the
NLSP, and scattering processes from the thermal bath. The maximum allowed
reheating temperature after inflation, as well as the maximum allowed gravitino
mass are determined.
