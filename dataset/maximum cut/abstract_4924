The L-user additive white Gaussian noise multi-way relay channel is
considered, where multiple users exchange information through a single relay at
a common rate. Existing coding strategies, i.e., complete-decode-forward and
compress-forward are shown to be bounded away from the cut-set upper bound at
high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). It is known that the gap between the
compress-forward rate and the capacity upper bound is a constant at high SNR,
and that between the complete-decode-forward rate and the upper bound increases
with SNR at high SNR. In this paper, a functional-decode-forward coding
strategy is proposed. It is shown that for L >= 3, complete-decode-forward
achieves the capacity when SNR <= 0 dB, and functional-decode-forward achieves
the capacity when SNR >= 0 dB. For L=$, functional-decode-forward achieves the
capacity asymptotically as SNR increases.
