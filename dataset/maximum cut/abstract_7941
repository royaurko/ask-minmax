Since November 2004, the Burst Alert Telescope on board Swift is producing a
monitoring of the entire sky in the 15-150 keV band, recording the timing and
spectral behavior of the detected sources. Here we study the properties of the
HMXB 4U 1036-56 using both the BAT survey data and those from a Swift-XRT
observation. A folding analysis performed on the BAT light curve of the first
100 months of survey unveils a periodic modulation with a period of 61.0 days,
tied to the presence in the BAT light curve of several intensity enhancements
lasting ~1/4 of P_0. We explain this modulation as the orbital period of the
binary system. The position of 4U 1036-56 on the Corbet diagram, the derived
semi-major orbit axis (~ 180 R_sun), and the bulk of the source emission
observed in a limited portion of the orbit are consistent with a Be companion
star. The broad band 0.2-150 keV spectrum is well modeled with a flat absorbed
power law with a cut-off at ~16 keV. Finally, we explore the possible
association of 4U 1036-56 with the gamma-ray source AGL J1037-5808, finding
that the BAT light curve does not show any correlation with the gamma-ray
outburst observed in November 2012.
