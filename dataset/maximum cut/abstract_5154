Motivated by ongoing experimental analyses, we report on the calculation of
next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the production of top anti-top pairs
in association with two hard b-jets at the Fermilab TeVatron. Besides the total
cross section and its scale dependence, a few differential distributions
applicable for Higgs boson searches at the TeVaron are given. The QCD
corrections with respect to leading order are negative and small. For our main
setup they amount to 2%, and remain reasonably stable against changes of cuts.
This proves that an integrated next-to-leading order K-factor does not
necessarily need to be applied in the background estimation for the top
anti-top H -> top anti-top bottom anti-bottom signal process. The distributions
show similarly small corrections. The shape of kinematic distributions is
distorted at most by about 20% in some corners of the phase space. Even though
it is not the main purpose of this paper, we also evaluated the
forward-backward asymmetry of the top quark at next-to-leading order.
