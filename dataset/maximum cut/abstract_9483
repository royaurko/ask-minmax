We found that oscillations of LOS velocity in H-alpha are different for
various parts of faculae regions. Power spectra show that the contribution of
low-frequency modes (1.2 - 2 mHz) increase at the network boundaries. Three and
five- minute periods dominate inside cells. The spectra of photosphere and
chromosphere LOS velocity oscillations differ for most faculae. On the other
hand, we detected several cases where propagating oscillations in faculae were
manifest with a five-minute period. Their initiation point on spatial-temporal
diagrams coincided with the local maximum of the longitudinal magnetic field.
