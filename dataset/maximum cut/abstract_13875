We calculate the evolution of the prompt intrinsic Poynting power generated
by merging black holes. Orbiting black holes induce rotation of the space-time.
In a presence of magnetic field supported by an accretion disk outside of the
orbit, this results in a generation of an electromagnetic outflow via the
Blandford-Znajek-type process with luminosity $L_{EM} \sim G^3 M^3 B^2/(c^5
R_{orb}) $ and reaching a fairly low maximum values of $L_{EM} =
10^{37}-10^{39} m_6 $ erg s$^{-1}$ ($m_6$ is the masses of black holes in
millions of Solar mass) at the time of the merger.
  Dissipation of the wind power may produce two types of observed signatures: a
highly variable collimated emission coming from the internal dissipation within
the jets and a broad-band near-isotropic emission generated at the termination
shocks.
