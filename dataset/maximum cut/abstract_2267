The possibility to observe the medium-modified fragmentation of hard b-quarks
tagged by a leading muon in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is analyzed.
We have found that reasonable statistics, ~20000 events per 1 month of LHC run
with lead beams, can be expected for the realistic geometrical acceptance and
kinematic cuts. The numerical estimates on the effect of the medium-induced
softening b-jet fragmentation function are given.
