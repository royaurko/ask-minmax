We present the first edition of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar
Catalog. The catalog consists of the 3814 objects (3000 discovered by the SDSS)
in the initial SDSS public data release that have at least one emission line
with a full width at half maximum larger than 1000 km/s, luminosities brighter
than M_i^* = -23, and highly reliable redshifts. The area covered by the
catalog is 494 square degrees; the majority of the objects were found in SDSS
commissioning data using a multicolor selection technique. The quasar redshifts
range from 0.15 to 5.03. For each object the catalog presents positions
accurate to better than 0.2" rms per coordinate, five band (ugriz) CCD-based
photometry with typical accuracy of 0.05 mag, radio and X-ray emission
properties, and information on the morphology and selection method. Calibrated
spectra of all objects in the catalog, covering the wavelength region 3800 to
9200 Angstroms at a spectral resolution of 1800-2100, are also available. Since
the quasars were selected during the commissioning period, a time when the
quasar selection algorithm was undergoing frequent revisions, the sample is not
homogeneous and is not intended for statistical analysis.
