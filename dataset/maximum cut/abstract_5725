$\gamma$-ray spectra of pulsars have been mostly studied in a
phenomenological way, by fitting them to a cut-off power-law function. Here, we
analyze a model where pulsed emission comes from synchro-curvature processes in
a gap. We calculate the variation of kinetic energy of magnetospheric particles
along the gap and the associated radiated spectra, considering an effective
particle distribution. We fit the phase-averaged and phase-resolved Fermi-LAT
spectra of the three brightest gamma-ray pulsars: Geminga, Crab, and Vela, and
constrain the three free parameters we leave free in the model. Our best-fit
models well reproduce the observed data, apart from residuals above a few GeV
in some cases, range for which the inverse Compton scattering likely becomes
the dominant mechanism. In any case, the flat slope at low-energy (< GeV) seen
by Fermi-LAT both in the phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra of most
pulsars, including the ones we studied, requires that most of the detected
radiation below ~ GeV is produced during the beginning of the particle
trajectories, when radiation mostly come from the loss of perpendicular
momentum.
