We present broadband X-ray spectral study of two ultraluminous X-ray sources
(ULXs), M81 X-6 and Holmberg IX X-1 based on Suzaku & XMM-Newton observations.
We perform joint broadband spectral analysis of the brightest sources in the
field, i.e. the two ULXs and the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in M81, and
demonstrate that the X-ray spectra of the ULXs cut off at energies more than
about 3keV with negligible contribution at high energies in the Suzaku HXD/PIN
band. The 90% upper limit on the 10-30keV band luminosity of an underlying
broadband power-law component is 3.5e38 ergs/s for M81 X-6 and 1.2e39ergs/s for
Holmberg IX X-1. These limits are more than an order of magnitude lower than
the bolometric (0.1-30 keV) luminosity of 6.8e39ergs/s for M81 X-6 and 1.9e40
ergs/s for Holmberg IX X-1. Our results confirm earlier indications of spectral
cut-offs inferred from the XMM-Newton observations of bright ULXs and show that
there isn't an additional high energy power-law component contributing
significantly to the X-ray emission. The spectral form of the two ULXs are very
different from those of Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) or AGNs. This
implies that the ULXs are neither simply scaled-up versions of stellar mass
BHBs or scaled-down versions of AGNs.
