We present a conjecture for the $n$-gluon one-loop amplitudes with maximal
helicity violation. The conjecture emerges from the powerful requirement that
the amplitudes have the correct behavior in the collinear limits of external
momenta. One implication is that the corresponding amplitudes where three or
more gluon legs are replaced by photons vanish for $n>4$.
