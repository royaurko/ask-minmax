Let $\mathbf{W}$ be a correlated complex non-central Wishart matrix defined
through $\mathbf{W}=\mathbf{X}^H\mathbf{X}$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is $n\times m
\, (n\geq m)$ complex Gaussian with non-zero mean $\boldsymbol{\Upsilon}$ and
non-trivial covariance $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$. We derive exact expressions for
the cumulative distribution functions (c.d.f.s) of the extreme eigenvalues
(i.e., maximum and minimum) of $\mathbf{W}$ for some particular cases. These
results are quite simple, involving rapidly converging infinite series, and
apply for the practically important case where $\boldsymbol{\Upsilon}$ has rank
one. We also derive analogous results for a certain class of gamma-Wishart
random matrices, for which $\boldsymbol{\Upsilon}^H\boldsymbol{\Upsilon}$
follows a matrix-variate gamma distribution. The eigenvalue distributions in
this paper have various applications to wireless communication systems, and
arise in other fields such as econometrics, statistical physics, and
multivariate statistics.
