Vector boson fusion (VBF) processes offer a promising avenue to study the
non-colored sectors of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model at the
LHC. A feasibility study for searching for the chargino/neutralino system in
the $R-$parity conserving Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is presented.
The high $E_T$ forward jets in opposite hemispheres are utilized to trigger VBF
events, so that the production of the lightest chargino and the second lightest
neutralino can be probed without a bias by experimental triggers. Kinematic
requirements are developed to search for signals of these supersymmetric states
above Standard Model backgrounds in both $\tau$ and light lepton ($e$ and
$\mu$) final states at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV.
