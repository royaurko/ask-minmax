We present formulas for the coefficients of 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-point master
integrals for one-loop massive amplitudes. The coefficients are derived from
unitarity cuts in D dimensions. The input parameters can be read off from any
unitarity-cut integrand, as assembled from tree-level expressions, after simple
algebraic manipulations. The formulas presented here are suitable for
analytical as well as numerical evaluation. Their validity is confirmed in two
known cases of helicity amplitudes contributing to gg -> gg and gg -> gH, where
the masses of the Higgs and the fermion circulating in the loop are kept as
free parameters.
