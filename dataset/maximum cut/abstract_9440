A theory for direct quantitative analysis of an antigen is proposed. It is
based on a potential homogenous immunoreaction system. It establishes an
equation to describe the concentration change of the antigen and antibody
complex. A maximum point is found in the concentration profile of the complex
which can be used to calculate the concentration of the antigen. An
experimental scheme was designed for a commercial time-resolved
fluoroimmunoassay kit for HBsAg, which is based heterogeneous immunoreaction.
The results showed that the theory is practically applicable.
