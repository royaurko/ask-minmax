The minimum rate of entropy production (MREP) and the least dissipation
energy (LDE) principles are re-examined concerning continuous systems in
stationary nonequilibrium states. By means of simple considerations on
coefficients of phenomenological laws and by taking into account balance
equations, an Onsager-like potential density for the stationary state is
obtained. In the case of a single state variable it is found that the potential
density describes a saddle-shaped surface around the stationary point in the
domain of the force (state variable) and the flux. The saddle point may be
considered a maximum along a LDE path (fixed force) and a minimum along a MREP
path (fixed phenomenological coefficient). The latter allow for the
Glansdorff-Prigogine local potential.
