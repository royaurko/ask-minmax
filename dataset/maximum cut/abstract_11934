Molecular dynamics simulations on a three dimensional defective Lennard-Jones
solid containing a void are performed in order to investigate detailed
properties of hot spot generation. In addition to the temperature, I monitor
the number of energetically colliding particles per unit volume which
characterizes the intensity of shock-enhanced chemistry. The quantity is found
to saturate for nanoscale voids and to be maximized after voids have completely
collapsed. It makes an apparent comparison to the temperature which requires
much larger void for the enhancement and becomes maximum during the early stage
of the collapse. It is also found that the average velocity and the temperature
of ejected molecules inside a cubic void are enhanced during the collapse
because of the focusing of momentum and energy towards the center line of a
void.
