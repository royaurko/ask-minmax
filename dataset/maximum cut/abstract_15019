The detection of strong thermochemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of an
extrasolar planet is thought to be a potential biosignature. In this article we
present a new kind of false positive that can mimic a disequilibrium or any
other biosignature that involves two chemical species. We consider a scenario
where the exoplanet hosts a moon that has its own atmosphere and neither of the
atmospheres is in chemical disequilibrium. Our results show that the integrated
spectrum of the planet and the moon closely resembles that of a single object
in strong chemical disequilibrium. We derive a firm limit on the maximum
spectral resolution that can be obtained for both directly-imaged and
transiting planets. The spectral resolution of even idealized space-based
spectrographs that might be achievable in the next several decades is in
general insufficient to break the degeneracy. Both chemical species can only be
definitively confirmed in the same object if absorption features of both
chemicals can be unambiguously identified and their combined depth exceeds
100%.
