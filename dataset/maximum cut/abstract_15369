The source-subtracted, 1.1 and 1.6 {\mu}m NICMOS images used in earlier
analyses of the near-infrared Hubble Ultra Deep Field contained residual flux
in extended wings of identified sources that contributed an unknown amount to
fluctuation power. When compared to the original results, a reanalysis after
subtracting this residual flux shows that mean-square and rms fluctuations
decrease a maximum of 52 and 31 per cent at 1.6 {\mu}m and 50 and 30 per cent
at 1.1 {\mu}m. However, total mean-square fluctuations above 0.5 arcsec only
decrease 6.5 and 1.4 per cent at 1.6 and 1.1 {\mu}m, respectively. These
changes would not affect any published conclusions based on the prior analyses.
These results exclude previous suggestions that extended wings of detected
galaxies may be a major contributor to the source-subtracted near-infrared
background and confirm that most fluctuation power in these images must be
explained by other means.
