We perform a detailed analysis of the latest HARPS and Keck radial velocity
data for the planet-hosting red dwarf GJ581, which attracted a lot of attention
in recent time. We show that these data contain important correlated noise
component ("red noise") with the correlation timescale of the order of 10 days.
This red noise imposes a lot of misleading effects while we work in the
traditional white-noise model. To eliminate these misleading effects, we
propose a maximum-likelihood algorithm equipped by an extended model of the
noise structure. We treat the red noise as a Gaussian random process with
exponentially decaying correlation function.
  Using this method we prove that: (i) planets b and c do exist in this system,
since they can be independently detected in the HARPS and Keck data, and
regardless of the assumed noise models; (ii) planet e can also be confirmed
independently by the both datasets, although to reveal it in the Keck data it
is mandatory to take the red noise into account; (iii) the recently announced
putative planets f and g are likely just illusions of the red noise; (iv) the
reality of the planet candidate GJ581 d is questionable, because it cannot be
detected from the Keck data, and its statistical significance in the HARPS data
(as well as in the combined dataset) drops to a marginal level of $\sim
2\sigma$, when the red noise is taken into account.
  Therefore, the current data for GJ581 really support existence of no more
than four (or maybe even only three) orbiting exoplanets. The planet candidate
GJ581 d requests serious observational verification.
