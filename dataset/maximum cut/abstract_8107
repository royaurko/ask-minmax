We present the target selection process for the Multi-object APO Radial
Velocity Exoplanets Large-area Survey (MARVELS), which is part of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) III. MARVELS is a medium-resolution ($R \sim 11000$)
multi-fiber spectrograph capable of obtaining radial velocities for 60 objects
at a time in order to find brown dwarfs and giant planets. The survey was
configured to target dwarf stars with effective temperatures approximately
between $4500$ and $6250 \, \mbox{K}$. For the first 2 years MARVELS relied on
low-resolution spectroscopic pre-observations to estimate the effective
temperature and $\log(g)$ for candidate stars and then selected suitable dwarf
stars from this pool. Ultimately, the pre-observation spectra proved
ineffective at filtering out giant stars; many giants were incorrectly
classified as dwarfs, resulting in a giant contamination rate of $\sim$30\% for
the first phase of the MARVELS survey. Thereafter, the survey instead applied a
reduced proper motion cut to eliminate giants and used the Infrared Flux Method
to estimate effective temperatures, using only extant photometric and
proper-motion catalog information. The target selection method introduced here
may be useful for other surveys that need to rely on extant catalog data for
selection of specific stellar populations.
