The characteristic function of the folded normal distribution and its moment
function are derived. The entropy of the folded normal distribution and the
Kullback--Leibler from the normal and half normal distributions are
approximated using Taylor series. The accuracy of the results are also assessed
using different criteria. The maximum likelihood estimates and confidence
intervals for the parameters are obtained using the asymptotic theory and
bootstrap method. The coverage of the confidence intervals is also examined.
