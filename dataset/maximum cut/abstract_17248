Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in TbCo2-xFex has been studied by dc
magnetization measurements.On substituting Fe in TbCo2, not only the magnetic
transition temperature is tuned to room temperature, but also the operating
temperature range for MCE is increased from 50 K for TbCo2 to 95 K for
TbCo1.9Fe0.1. The maximum magnetic entropy change (-{\Delta}SM) for
TbCo1.9Fe0.1 is found to be 3.7 J kg-1 K-1 for a 5 T field change, making it a
promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration near room temperature. The
temperature dependent neutron diffraction study shows a structural phase
transition (from cubic to rhombohedral phase with lowering of temperature)
which is associated with the magnetic phase transition and these transitions
broaden on Fe substitution. To investigate the nature of the paramagnetic to
ferrimagnetic phase transition, we performed a critical exponent study. From
the derived values of critical exponents, we conclude that TbCo2 belongs to the
3D Heisenberg class with short-range interaction, while on Fe substitution it
tends towards mean-field with long-range interaction. The derived values of
critical exponents represent the phenomenological universal curve for the field
dependence of {\Delta}SM, indicating that TbCo2 and TbCo1.9Fe0.1 belong to two
different universality classes.
