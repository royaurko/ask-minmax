In this work, we consider the problem of coding for the half-duplex
non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward (NAF) cooperative channel where the
transmitter to relay and the inter-relay links are highly reliable. We derive
bounds on the diversity order of the NAF protocol that are achieved by a
distributed space-time bit-interleaved coded modulation (D-ST-BICM) scheme
under iterative APP detection and decoding. These bounds lead to the design of
space-time precoders that ensure maximum diversity order and high coding gains.
The word error rate performance of D-ST-BICM are also compared to outage
probability limits.
