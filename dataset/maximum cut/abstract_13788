This paper extends the scenario of the Four Color Theorem in the following
way. Let H(d,k) be the set of all k-uniform hypergraphs that can be (linearly)
embedded into R^d. We investigate lower and upper bounds on the maximum (weak
and strong) chromatic number of hypergraphs in H(d,k). For example, we can
prove that for d>2 there are hypergraphs in H(2d-3,d) on n vertices whose weak
chromatic number is Omega(log n/log log n), whereas the weak chromatic number
for n-vertex hypergraphs in H(d,d) is bounded by O(n^((d-2)/(d-1))) for d>2.
