We review the recently developed bootstrap method for the computation of
high-multiplicity QCD amplitudes at one loop. We illustrate the general
algorithm step by step with a six-point example. The method combines
(generalized) unitarity with on-shell recursion relations to determine the not
cut-constructible, rational terms of these amplitudes. Our bootstrap approach
works for arbitrary configurations of gluon helicities and arbitrary numbers of
external legs.
