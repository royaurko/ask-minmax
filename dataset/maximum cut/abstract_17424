The International AXion Observatory (IAXO) will incorporate a new generation
detector for axions, a hypothetical particle, which was postulated to solve one
of the puzzles arising in the standard model of particle physics, namely the
strong CP problem. The new IAXO experiment is aiming at achieving a sensitivity
to the coupling between axions and photons of one order of magnitude beyond the
limits of the current state-of-the-art detector, represented by the CERN Axion
Solar Telescope (CAST). The IAXO detector relies on a high-magnetic field
distributed over a very large volume to convert solar axions into x-ray
photons. Utilizing the designs of the ATLAS barrel and end-cap toroids, a large
superconducting toroidal magnet is currently being designed at CERN to provide
the required magnetic field. The new toroid will be built up from eight, one
meter wide and 20 m long, racetrack coils. The toroid is sized about 4 m in
diameter and 22 m in length. It is designed to realize a peak magnetic field of
5.4 T with a stored energy of 500 MJ. The magnetic field optimization process
to arrive at maximum detector yield is described. In addition, force and stress
calculations are performed to select materials and determine their structure
and sizing. Conductor dimensionality, quench protection and the cryogenic
design are dealt with as well.
