Some distributions of the mu- in the top quark pair production reaction pp ->
b u anti-d anti-b mu- anti-nu_mu at the LHC are calculated to leading order in
the presence of the anomalous Wtb coupling with operators of dimension up to
five. The distributions in the transverse momentum, rapidity and cosine of the
mu- angle with respect to the beam in the laboratory frame and with respect to
the reversed momentum of the b-quark in the rest frame of W-boson are changed
rather moderately by the anomalous Wtb coupling. The distributions computed
with the full set of leading order Feynman diagrams practically do not differ
from those computed with the t anti-t production diagrams, with typical
acceptance cuts. This demonstrates very little effect of the off resonance
background contributions.
