Interference Alignment (IA) is a transmission scheme which achieves 1/2
Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) per transmit-antenna per user. The constraints imposed
on the scheme are based on the linear receiver since conventional IA assumes
Gaussian signaling. However, when the transmitters employ Finite Alphabet (FA)
signaling, neither the conventional IA precoders nor the linear receiver are
optimal structures. Therefore, a novel Fractional Interference Alignment (FIA)
scheme is introduced when FA signals are used, where the alignment constraints
are now based on the non-linear, minimum distance (MD) detector. Since DoF is
defined only as signal-to-noise ratio tends to infinity, we introduce a new
metric called SpAC (number of Symbols transmitted-per-transmit
Antenna-per-Channel use) for analyzing the FIA scheme. The maximum SpAC is one,
and the FIA achieves any value of SpAC in the range [0,1]. The key motivation
for this work is that numerical simulations with FA signals and MD detector for
fixed SpAC (=1/2, as in IA) over a set of optimization problems, like
minimizing bit error rate or maximizing the mutual information, achieves a
significantly better error rate performance when compared to the existing
algorithms that minimize mean square error or maximize signal-to-interference
plus noise ratio.
