Electronic band structure calculations using the augmented spherical wave
method have been performed for CuCrO2. For this antiferromagnetic (T_N = 24 K)
semiconductor crystallizing in the delafossite structure, it is found that the
valence band maximum is mainly due to the t_2g orbitals of Cr^3+ and that spin
polarization is predicted with 3 mu_B per Cr^3+. The structural
characterizations of CuCr1-xMgxO2 reveal a very limited range of Mg^2+
substitution for Cr^3+ in this series. As soon as x = 0.02, a maximum of 1% Cr
ions substituted by Mg site is measured in the sample. This result is also
consistent with the detection of Mg spinel impurities from X-ray diffraction
for x = 0.01. This explains the saturation of the Mg^2+ effect upon the
electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power observed for x > 0.01. Such a
very weak solubility limit could also be responsible for the discrepancies
found in the literature. Furthermore, the measurements made under magnetic
field (magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient)
support that the Cr^4+ "holes", created by the Mg^2+ substitution, in the
matrix of high spin Cr^3+ (S = 3/2) are responsible for the transport
properties of these compounds.
