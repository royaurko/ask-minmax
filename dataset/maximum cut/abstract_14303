The current analysis of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa(CKM) quark mixing
matrix uses the standard parametrisation by 3 mixing angles and the
CP-violating KM phase. However it would be more convenient to express these
mixing angle parameters in terms of the known CKM matrix elements like
$V_{ud}$, $ V_{us}$, $ V_{ub}$, $V_{cb}$ and the CP-violating phase $\delta$.
The other CKM matrix elements are then expressed in terms of these known matrix
elements instead of the standard mixing angles. In this paper, using $V_{ud}$,
$ V_{us}$, $ V_{ub}$ and $V_{cb}$ from the current global fit, we show that the
measured values for $|V_{td}/V_{ts}|$ and $\sin\beta$ imply $\gamma=(68\pm
3)^{\circ}$ at which $\sin\beta$ and $\sin\alpha$ are near its maximum,
consistent with the global fit.
