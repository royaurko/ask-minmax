We show that every orthogonal polyhedron homeomorphic to a sphere can be
unfolded without overlap while using only polynomially many (orthogonal) cuts.
By contrast, the best previous such result used exponentially many cuts. More
precisely, given an orthogonal polyhedron with n vertices, the algorithm cuts
the polyhedron only where it is met by the grid of coordinate planes passing
through the vertices, together with Theta(n^2) additional coordinate planes
between every two such grid planes.
