We present axisymmetric maximum disk mass models for a sample of 74 spiral
galaxies taken from the southern sky Fabry-Perot Tully-Fisher survey (Schommer
et al. 1993). The sample contains galaxies spanning a large range of
morphologies and having rotation widths from 180 km/sec to 680 km/secs. For
each galaxy we have an I-band image and a 2-d H_alpha velocity field. The
distribution of mass is modeled as a sum of disk and bulge components with
distinct, constant mass-to-light ratios. No dark matter halo is included in the
fits. The models reproduce the overall structure of the rotation curves in the
majority of galaxies, providing good fits to galaxies which exhibit pronounced
structural differences in their surface brightness profiles. 75% of galaxies
for which the rotation curve is measured to R_23.5 or beyond are well fit by a
mass-traces-light model for the entire region within R_23.5. The models for
about 20% of the galaxies do not fit well; the failure of most of these models
is traced directly to non-axisymmetric structures, primarily bars but also
strong spiral arms. The median I-band M/L of the disk plus bulge is 2.4+/-0.9
h_75 in solar units, consistent with normal stellar populations. These results
require either that the mass of dark matter within the optical disk of spiral
galaxies is small, or that its distribution is very precisely coupled to the
distribution of luminous matter.
