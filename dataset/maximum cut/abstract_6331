The longitudinal profile of extensive air showers is sensitive to the energy
and type/mass of the primary particle. One of its characteristics, the
atmospheric depth of shower maximum, is often used to reconstruct the elemental
composition of primary cosmic rays. In this article, the impact of the
atmospheric density profile on the reconstruction of the depth of maximum, as
observed in fluorescence light measurements, is investigated. We consider in
detail the atmospheric density profile and its time variations at the site of
the southern Pierre Auger Observatory, using data that were obtained from
meteorological radio soundings. Similar atmospheric effects are expected to be
found also at other sites.
