A Henkin-style proof of completeness of first-order classical logic is given
with respect to a very small set (notably missing cut rule) of Genzten
deduction rules for intuitionistic sequents. Insisting on sparing on derivation
rules, satisfiability theorem is seen to need weaker assumptions than
completeness theorem, the missing request being exactly the rule ~ p --> p,
which gives a hint of intuitionism's motivations from a classical point of
view. A bare treatment of standard, basic first-order syntax somehow more
algebraic-flavoured than usual is also given.
