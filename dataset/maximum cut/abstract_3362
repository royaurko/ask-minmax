A strong edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is an assignment of colors to edges
such that every color class induces a matching. We here focus on bipartite
graphs whose one part is of maximum degree at most $3$ and the other part is of
maximum degree $\Delta$. For every such graph, we prove that a strong
$4\Delta$-edge-coloring can always be obtained. Together with a result of
Steger and Yu, this result confirms a conjecture of Faudree, Gy\'arf\'as,
Schelp and Tuza for this class of graphs.
