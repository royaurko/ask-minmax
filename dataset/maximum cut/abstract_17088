Parabolic solar dish concentrator with sphere receiver is less studied. We
present an analytic function to calculate the intercept factor of the system
with real sun bright distribution and Gaussian distribution, the results
indicate that the intercept factor is related to the rim angle of reflector and
the ratio of open angle of receiver at the top of reflector to optical error
when the optical error is larger than or equal to 5 mrad, but is related to the
rim angle, open angle and optical error in less than 5 mrad optical error.
Furthermore we propose a quick process to optimize the system to provide the
maximum solar energy to net heat efficiency for different optical error under
typical condition. The results indicate that the parabolic solar dish
concentrator with sphere receiver has rather high solar energy to net heat
efficiency which is 20% more than solar trough and tower system including
higher cosine factor and lower heat loss of the receiver.
