The longitudinal transport problem (the current is applied parallel to some
bias magnetic field) in type-II superconductors is analyzed theoretically.
Based on analytical results for simplified configurations, and relying on
numerical studies for general scenarios, it is shown that a remarkable
inversion of the current flow in a surface layer may be predicted under a wide
set of experimental conditions. Strongly inhomogeneous current density
profiles, characterized by enhanced transport toward the center and reduced, or
even negative, values at the periphery of the conductor, are expected when the
physical mechanisms of flux depinning and consumption (via line cutting) are
recalled. A number of striking collateral effects, such as local and global
paramagnetic behavior, are predicted. Our geometrical description of the
macroscopic material laws allows a pictorial interpretation of the physical
phenomena underlying the transport backflow.
