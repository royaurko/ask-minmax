Effects of the growth velocity on the crystal growth behavior of
Bi_2Sr_2Ca_1Cu_2O_x (Bi-2212) have been studied by floating zone technique. The
results show that a necessary condition for obtaining large single crystals
along the c-axis is that the solid-liquid interface of a growing rod maintains
a stable planar growth front. The planar liquid-solid growth interface tends to
break down into a cellular interface, while the growth velocity is higher than
0.25 mm/h. Single crystals of up to 50x7.2x7 mm3 along the a-, b- and caxes
have been cut in a 7.2 mm diameter rod with optimum growth conditions. Tconset
is 91 K measured by magnetic properties measurement system (MPMS) for as-grown
crystals. Optical polarization microscope and neutron diffraction show that the
quality of the single crystals is good.
