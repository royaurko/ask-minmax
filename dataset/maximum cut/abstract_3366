We present an algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the
correlation parameters of elliptical copulas. Previously existing methods for
this task were either fast but only approximate or exact but very
time-consuming, especially for high-dimensional problems. Our proposal combines
the advantages of both, since it obtains the exact estimates and its
performance makes it suitable for most practical applications. The algorithm is
given with explicit expressions for the Gaussian and Student's t copulas.
