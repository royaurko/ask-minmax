Photon correlations are investigated for a single laser-excited ion trapped
in front of a mirror. Varying the relative distance between the ion and the
mirror, photon correlation statistics can be tuned smoothly from an
antibunching minimum to a bunching-like maximum. Our analysis concerns the
non-Markovian regime of the ion-mirror interaction and reveals the field
establishment in a half-cavity interferometer.
