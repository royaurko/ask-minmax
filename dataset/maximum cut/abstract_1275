We have used ISAJET 7.0/ISASUSY 1.0 to evaluate the rates and study
distributions for trilepton events from the leptonic decays of charginos and
neutralinos produced at the Fermilab Tevatron via the reaction, $p\bar
p\rightarrow \tilde{W_1} \tilde{Z_2}$ + X for cuts inspired by the CDF and D0
experiments. We find that about 60\% of these events do not contain any jets,
and so should be easily identifiable over Standard Model backgrounds from
$t\bar{t}$ and WZ production, provided that the decay
$\tilde{Z_2}\rightarrow\tilde{Z_1}Z$ is kinematically inaccessible.
  We further show that, with suitable cuts, these backgrounds can be reduced to
less than 1-2 $fb$ even if $n_{jet} = 1$, effectively increasing the SUSY
sample by 50\%. We confirm that the signal is only rate-limited, and that the
Fermilab Tevatron after an accumulation of 100 $pb^{-1}$ of integrated
luminosity will be able to explore parameters well beyond the range of LEP and,
if sleptons are substantially lighter than squarks, close to the reach of LEP
200.
