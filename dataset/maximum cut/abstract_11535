The time dependence of the dark energy density can be an important clue to
the nature of dark energy in the universe. We show that future supernova data
from dedicated telescopes (such as SNAP), when combined with data of nearby
supernovae, can be used to determine how the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$
depends on redshift, if $\rho_X(z)$ is not too close to a constant. For
quantitative comparison, we have done an extensive study of a number of dark
energy models. Based on these models we have simulated data sets in order to
show that we can indeed reconstruct the correct sign of the time dependence of
the dark energy density, outside of a degeneracy region centered on $1+w_0 =
-w_1 z_{max}/3$ (where $z_{max}$ is the maximum redshift of the survey, e.g.,
$z_{max}=1.7$ for SNAP). We emphasize that, given the same data, one can obtain
much more information about the dark energy density directly (and its time
dependence) than about its equation of state.
