We report an algorithm for the partition of a line segment according to a
given ratio $\nu$. At each step the length distribution among sets of the
partition follows a binomial distribution. We call $k$-set to the set of
elements with the same length at the step $n$. The total number of elements is
$2^n$ and the number of elements in a same $k$-set is $C_n^k$. In the limit of
an infinite partion this object become a multifractal where each $k$-set
originate a fractal. We find the fractal spectrum $D_k$ and calculate where is
its maximum. Finally we find the values of $D_k$ for the limits $k/n \to 0$ and
