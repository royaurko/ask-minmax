Volleyball has become a competitive sport with high physical and technical
performance. Matches results are based on the players and teams'skills as
technical and tactical strategies to succeed in a championship. At this point,
some studies are carried out on the performance analysis of different match
elements, contributing to the development of this sport. In this paper, we
proposed a new approach to analyze volleyball data. The study is based on the
compositional data methodology modeling in regression model. The parameters are
obtained through the maximum likelihood. We performed a simulation study to
evaluate the estimation procedure in compositional regression model and we
illustrated the proposed methodology considering real data set of volleyball.
