The method developed by Stock and Stock (1999) to derive absolute magnitudes
and intrinsic colors is applied to simulated low-resolution spectra. The
simulation is made by convolving real spectra with a Gaussian function,
$\sigma$ (the full width at half maximum) related to the final spectral
resolution. The accuracy with which the stellar parameters are determined
indicates that the method may be applied to typical objective-prism spectra. We
show that changes in the spectral resolution do not significantly affect the
stellar parameters obtained with this method for early-type stars, whereas for
later-type stars an improved approach is necessary.
