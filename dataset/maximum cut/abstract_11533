We present the results of detailed analysis of X-ray data in 3-20 keV range
from a ~70 day outburst of the neutron star transient Aquila X-1 during
September-November 2000. Optical monitoring with the YALO 1m telescope was used
to trigger X-ray observations with Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) in order
to follow the outburst from a very early stage. In this paper we discuss the
correlated evolution in time of features in the spectral and temporal domains,
for the entire outburst. The state transition from low/hard state to high/soft
state during the rise of the outburst occurs at higher luminosity than the
transition back to low/hard state during the decay, as has also been observed
in other outbursts. Fourier power spectra at low frequencies show a broken
power law continuum during the rising phase, with the break frequency
increasing with time. During the decline from maximum the source evolves to a
position in the hardness-intensity plane as well as in the color-color diagram
which is similar to, but distinct from, the canonical high/soft state. High
frequency quasi-periodic oscillations from 636-870 Hz were seen only during
this transitional state.
