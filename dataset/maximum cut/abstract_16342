First, second and third nearest neighbor mixing potentials for FePt alloys,
were calculated from first principles using a Connolly-Williams approach. Using
the mixing potentials obtained in this manner, the dependency of equilibrium
L1_0 ordering on temperature was studied for bulk and for a spherical
nanoparticle with 3.5nm diameter at equiatomic composition by use of Monte
Carlo simulation and the analytical ring approximation. The calculated
order-disorder temperature for bulk (1495-1514 K) was in relatively good
agreement (4% error) with the experimental value (1572K). For nanoparticles of
finite size, the (long range) order parameter changed continuously from unity
to zero with increasing temperature. Rather than a discontinuity indicative of
a phase transition we obtained an inflection point in the order as a function
of temperature. This inflection point occurred at a temperature below the bulk
phase transition temperature and which decreased as the particle size
decreased. Our calculations predict that 3.5nm diameter particles in
configurational equilibrium at 600 C (a typical annealing temperature for
promoting L1_0 ordering) have an L1_0 order parameter of 0.83 (compared to a
maximum possible value equal to unity). According to our investigations, the
experimental absence of (relatively) high L1_0 order in 3.5nm diameter
nanoparticles annealed at 600 C or below is primarily a problem of kinetics
rather than equilibrium
