We present the photometric properties of 1279 blue variable stars within the
LMC. Photometry is derived from the MACHO database. The lightcurves of the
sample exhibit a variety of quasi-periodic and aperiodic outburst behavior. A
characteristic feature of the photometric variation is that the objects are
reddest when at maximum outburst. A subset of 102 objects were examined
spectroscopically. Within this subset, 91% exhibited Balmer emission in at
least one epoch, in some cases with spectacular spectral variability. The
variability observed in the sample is consistent with the establishment and
maintenance of the Be phenomenon.
