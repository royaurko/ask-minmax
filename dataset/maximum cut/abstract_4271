We use a non-perturbative approach which combines coupled channel
Lippmann-Schwinger equations with meson-meson potentials provided by the lowest
order chiral Lagrangian. By means of one parameter, a cut off in the momentum
of the loop integrals, which results of the order of 1 GeV, we obtain
singularities in the S-wave amplitudes corresponding to the sigma, f_0 and a_0
resonances. The \pi\pi --> \pi\pi, \pi\pi --> K bar(K) phase shifts and
inelasticities in the T=0 scalar channel are well reproduced as well as the
\pi^0 eta and K bar(K) mass distributions in the T=1 channel. Furthermore, the
total and partial strong decay widths of the f_0 and a_0 resonances are
properly reproduced.
