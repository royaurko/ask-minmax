We consider growth conditions for (frequently) Birkhoff-universal functions
of exponential type with respect to the different rays emanating from the
origin. For that purpose, we investigate their (conjugate) indicator diagram
or, equivalently, their indicator function. Some known results, where growth is
measured with respect to the maximum modulus, are extended.
