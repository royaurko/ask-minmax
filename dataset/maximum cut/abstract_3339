The $\alpha$-Brownian bridge, or scaled Brownian bridge, is a generalization
of the Brownian bridge with a scaling parameter that determines how strong the
force that pulls the process back to 0 is. The bias of the maximum likelihood
estimator of the parameter $\alpha$ is derived and a bias-correction that
improves the estimator substantially is proposed. The properties of the
bias-corrected estimator and four Bayesian estimators based on non-informative
priors are evaluated in a simulation study.
