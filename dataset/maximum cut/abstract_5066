The role played by counterexamples in standard system analysis is well known;
but less common is a notion of counterexample in probabilistic systems
refinement. In this paper we extend previous work using counterexamples to
inductive invariant properties of probabilistic systems, demonstrating how they
can be used to extend the technique of bounded model checking-style analysis
for the refinement of quantitative safety specifications in the probabilistic B
language. In particular, we show how the method can be adapted to cope with
refinements incorporating probabilistic loops. Finally, we demonstrate the
technique on pB models summarising a one-step refinement of a randomised
algorithm for finding the minimum cut of undirected graphs, and that for the
dependability analysis of a controller design.
