We present a new theoretical framework for Diffusion Limited Aggregation and
associated Dielectric Breakdown Models in two dimensions. Key steps are
understanding how these models interrelate when the ultra-violet cut-off
strategy is changed, the analogy with turbulence and the use of logarithmic
field variables. Within the simplest, Gaussian, truncation of mode-mode
coupling, all properties can be calculated. The agreement with prior knowledge
from simulations is encouraging, and a new superuniversality of the tip scaling
exponent is both predicted and confirmed.
