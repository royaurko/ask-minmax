In this paper we study the numerical passage from the spatially homogeneous
Boltzmann equation without cut-off to the Fokker-Planck-Landau equation in the
so-called grazing collision limit. To this aim we derive a Fourier spectral
method for the non cut-off Boltzmann equation in the spirit of L. Pareschi,
B.Perthame, TTSP 25, (1996) and L.Pareschi, G.Russo, SINUM 37, (2000). We show
that the kernel modes that define the spectral method have the correct grazing
collision limit providing a consistent spectral method for the limiting
Fokker-Planck-Landau equation. In particular, for small values of the
scattering angle, we derive an approximate formula for the kernel modes of the
non cut-off Boltzmann equation which, similarly to the Fokker-Planck-Landau
case, can be computed with a fast algorithm. The uniform spectral accuracy of
the method with respect to the grazing collision parameter is also proved.
