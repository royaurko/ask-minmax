The distribution of electrons and holes in the CuO$_2$ plane of the
high-temperature superconducting cuprates is determined with nuclear magnetic
resonance through the quadrupole splittings of $^{17}$O and $^{63}$Cu. Based on
new data for single crystals of electron-doped Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$(x=0,
0.05, 0.10, 0.15) as well as Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ (x=0, 0.13) the changes in
hole contents $n_d$ of Cu 3d$(x^2-y^2)$ and $n_p$ of O 2$p_\sigma$ orbitals are
determined and they account for the stoichiometrically doped charges, similar
to hole-doped \lsco. It emerges that while $n_d+2n_p=1$ in all parent materials
as expected, $n_d$ and $n_p$ vary substantially between different groups of
materials. Doping holes increases predominantly $n_p$, but also $n_d$. To the
contrary, doping electrons predominantly decreases $n_d$ and only slightly
$n_p$. However, $n_p$ for the electron doped systems is higher than that in
hole doped La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$CuO$_4$. Cuprates with the highest maximum
$T_{\rm c}$s appear to have a comparably low $n_d$ while, at the same time,
$n_p$ is very high. The rather high oxygen hole content of the Pr$_2$CuO$_4$
and Nd$_2$CuO$_4$ with the low $n_d$ seems to make them ideal candidates for
hole doping to obtain the highest $T_{\rm c}$.
