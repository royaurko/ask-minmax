We theoretically investigate second harmonic generation in extremely narrow,
sub-wavelength semiconductor and dielectric waveguides. We discuss a novel
guiding mechanism characterized by the inhibition of diffraction and the
suppression of cut-off limits in the context of a light trapping phenomenon
that sets in under conditions of general phase and group velocity mismatch
between the fundamental and the generated harmonic.
