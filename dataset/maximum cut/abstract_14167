We present a path-integral likelihood formalism that extends parameterized
likelihood analyses to include continuous functions. The method finds the
maximum likelihood point in function-space, and marginalizes over all possible
functions, under the assumption of a Gaussian-distributed function-space. We
apply our method to the problem of removing unknown systematic functions in two
topical problems for dark energy research : scale-dependent galaxy bias in
redshift surveys; and galaxy intrinsic alignments in cosmic shear surveys. We
find that scale-dependent galaxy bias will degrade information on cosmological
parameters unless the fractional variance in the bias function is known to 10%.
Measuring and removing intrinsic alignments from cosmic shear surveys with a
flat-prior can reduce the dark energy Figure-of-Merit by 20%, however provided
that the scale and redshift-dependence is known to better than 10% with a
Gaussian-prior, the dark energy Figure-of-Merit can be enhanced by a factor of
two with no extra assumptions.
