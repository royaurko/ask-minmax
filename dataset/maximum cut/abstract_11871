The spin-orbit scattering effect on critical current through
superconductor/ferromagnet (SF) bilayers separated by an insulator (SFIFS
tunnel junction) have been investigated for the case of absence of the
superconducting order parameter oscillations (thin F layers). The analysis is
based on a microscopic theory for proximity coupled SF bilayer for different
bilayer parameters (boundary transparency, proximity effect strength, relative
orientation and value of the F layers exchange field). We find that the
spin-orbit scattering considerably modifies dc Josephson current in SFIFS
tunnel junction. In contrast to a simple physical picture, the reduction of the
exchange field effects is nonlinear in character getting its maximum in the
field's region where the critical current enhancement or the transition to the
\pi-state take place. Hence, for understanding the various experimental results
on tunnel structures with thin F layers, the coupled effects of the exchange
interaction and spin-orbit scattering must be considered.
