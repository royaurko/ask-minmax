We describe the first results from a program of multi-wavelength monitoring
of symbiotic binary stars in outburst. The prototypical symbiotic star Z
Andromedae was observed extensively at radio, optical, far-UV, and X-ray
wavelengths during its current (ongoing) outburst. These observations provide
evidence for an initial obscuration or the source of ionizing radiation by an
optically thick shell of material, outflow with velocities of 100s of km/s,
plus collisional excitation and shock heating of the red-giant wind. In
addition, the optical light curve reveals variability on time scales as short
as days on both the rise to and decline from optical maximum.
