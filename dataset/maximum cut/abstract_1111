We prove the Bouchard-Mari\~no Conjecture for the framed one-legged
topological vertex by deriving the Eynard-Orantin type recursion relations from
the cut-and-join equation satisfied by the relevant triple Hodge integrals.
This establishes a version of local mirror symmetry for the local $C^3$
geometry with one $D$-brane.
