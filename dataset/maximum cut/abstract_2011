The starburst IMF is probably as much of theoretical interest and practical
relevance as it is a subject of observational controversy. In this conference
paper we review the most common methods (star counts, dynamical masses, and
line ratios) to derive or constrain the IMF, and discuss potential problems and
shortcomings that often lead to claims of anomalous IMF slopes and mass
cut-offs.
