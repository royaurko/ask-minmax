High-resolution Chandra observations of Tycho's SNR have revealed several
sets of quasi-steady, high-emissivity, nearly-parallel X-ray stripes in some
localized regions of the SNR. These stripes are most likely the result of
cosmic-ray (CR) generated magnetic turbulence at the SNR blast wave. However,
for the amazingly regular pattern of these stripes to appear requires the
simultaneous action of a number of shock-plasma phenomena and is not predicted
by most models of magnetic field amplification. A consistent explanation of
these stripes yields information on the complex nonlinear plasma processes
connecting efficient CR acceleration and magnetic field fluctuations in strong
collisionless shocks. The nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (NL-DSA) model
described here, which includes magnetic field amplification from a cosmic-ray
current driven instability, does predict stripes consistent with the
synchrotron emission observations of Tycho's SNR. We argue that the local
ambient mean magnetic field geometry determines the orientation of the stripes
and therefore it can be reconstructed with the high resolution X-ray imaging.
The estimated maximum energy of the CR protons responsible for the stripes is
$\sim 10^{15}$\,eV. Furthermore, the model predicts that a specific X-ray
polarization pattern, with a polarized fraction ~ 50%, accompanies the stripes,
which can be tested with future X-ray polarimeter missions.
