We model both the photo-stationary state and dynamics of an illuminated,
photo-sensitive, glassy liquid crystalline sheet. To illustrate the interplay
between local tilt $\theta$ of the sheet, effective incident intensity,
curvature and dynamics, we adopt the simplest variation of local incident light
intensity with angle, that is $\cos\theta$. The tilt in the stationary state
never overshoots the vertical, but maximum curvature could be seen in the
middle of the sheet for intense light. In dynamics, overshoot and
self-eclipsing arise, revealing how important moving fronts of light
penetration are. Eclipsing is qualitatively as in the experiments of Ikeda and
Yu (2003).
