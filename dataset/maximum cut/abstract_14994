The problem of approximating the PageRank score of a node with minimal
information about the rest of the graph has attracted considerable attention in
the last decade; but its central question, whether it is in general necessary
to explore a non-vanishing fraction of the graph, remained open until now (only
for specific graphs and/or nodes was a solution known). We present the first
algorithm that produces a $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation of the score of any
one node in any $n$-node graph with probability $(1-\epsilon)$ visiting at most
$O(n^\frac{2}{3}\sqrt[3]{\log(n)})=o(n)$ nodes. Our result is essentially tight
(we prove that visiting $\Omega(n^\frac{2}{3})$ nodes is in general necessary
to solve even an easier "ranking" version of the problem under any "natural"
graph exploration model, including all those in the literature) but it can be
further improved for some classes of graphs and/or nodes of practical interest
- e.g. to $O(n^\frac{1}{2} \gamma^\frac{1}{2})$ nodes in graphs with maximum
outdegree $\gamma$.
