In present study, we discuss results of applicability of discrete filters for
large eddy simulation (LES) method of forced compressible magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) turbulent flows with the scale-similarity model. Influences and effects
of discrete filter shapes on the scale-similarity model are examined in
physical space using a finite-difference numerical schemes. We restrict
ourselves to the Gaussian filter and the top-hat filter. Representations of
this subgrid-scale model which correspond to various 3- and 5-point
approximations of both Gaussian and top-hat filters for different values of
parameter $\epsilon$ (the ratio of the mesh size to the cut-off lengthscale of
the filter) are investigated. Discrete filters produce more discrepancies for
magnetic field. It is shown that the Gaussian filter is more sensitive to the
parameter $\epsilon$ than the top-hat filter in compressible forced MHD
turbulence. The 3-point filters at $\epsilon=2$ and $\epsilon=3$ give the least
accurate results and the 5-point Gaussian filter shows the best results at
$\epsilon=2$.
