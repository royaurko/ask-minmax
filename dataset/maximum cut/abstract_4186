We study the occurrence of final states with only an electron-positron pair
and missing transverse momentum as a signal of \susy\ in photon-photon
collisions. Suitable high energy photon beams may be provided at linear
colliders by back-scattering laser beams on electron beams. The final states
considered represent a typical signature for the production and decay of
selctron and chargino pairs within the \mssm. We show that, away from the
kinematical threshold, selctrons produce this signal far more abundantly than
charginos. The standard model background is dominated by W-pair production. We
propose a series of kinematical cuts which reduce this background to an
acceptable level. With a 1 TeV collider operated in the $\gamma\gamma$-mode, we
find that interesting and complementary tests of \susic\ models can be
performed for selctron masses up to 350 GeV.
