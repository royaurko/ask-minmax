HD 142527 is a pre-transition disk with strong evidence for on-going planet
formation. Recent observations show a disrupted disk with spiral arms, a
dust-depleted inner cavity and the possible presence of gas streams driving gas
from the outer disk towards the central star. We aim to derive the morphology
of the disk, as well as the distribution and properties of the dust at its
surface. We have obtained polarized differential images of HD 142527 at $H$ and
$Ks$ bands with NaCo at the VLT. Combining these images with classical
PSF-subtraction, we are able to derive the polarization degree of this disk. At
$H$ band the polarization degree of the disk varies between 10% and 25%. This
result cannot be reproduced by dust distributions containing highly porous
material. The polarization is better matched by distributions of compact
particles, with maximum sizes at least up to a few microns, in agreement with
previous observations. We also observe two regions of low emission (nulls) in
total and in polarized intensity. In particular, one of these nulls is at
roughly the same position as the maximum of the horse-shoe shape observed in
sub-millimeter continuum emission ALMA Band-7 (345 GHz) observations. We
discuss the possible link between both features.
