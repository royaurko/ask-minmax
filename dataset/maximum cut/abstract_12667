Numerical and analytical studies of decaying, two-dimensional (2D)
Navier-Stokes (NS) turbulence at high Reynolds numbers are reported. The effort
is to determine computable distinctions between two different formulations of
maximum entropy predictions for the decayed, late-time state. Both formulations
define an entropy through a somewhat ad hoc discretization of vorticity to the
"particles" of which statistical mechanical methods are employed to define an
entropy, before passing to a mean-field limit. In one case, the particles are
delta-function parallel "line" vortices ("points" in two dimensions), and in
the other, they are finite-area, mutually-exclusive convected "patches" of
vorticity which in the limit of zero area become "points." We use
time-dependent, spectral-method direct numerical simulation of the
Navier-Stokes equations to see if initial conditions which should relax to
different late-time states under the two formulations actually do so.
