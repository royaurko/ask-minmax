The amount and type of self-entanglement of DNA filaments is significantly
affected by spatial confinement, which is ubiquitous in biological systems.
Motivated by recent advancements in single DNA molecule experiments based on
nanofluidic devices, and by the introduction of algorithms capable of detecting
knots in open chains, we investigate numerically the entanglement of linear,
open DNA chains confined inside nano-slits. The results regard the abundance,
type and length of occurring knots and are compared with recent findings for
DNA inside nano-channels. In both cases, the width of the confining region, D,
spans the 30nm- 1\mu m range and the confined DNA chains are 1 to 4\mu m long.
It is found that the knotting probability is maximum for slit widths in the
70-100nm range. However, over the considered DNA contour lengths, the maximum
incidence of knots remains below 20%, while for channel confinement it tops
50%. Further differences of the entanglement are seen for the average contour
length of the knotted region which drops significantly below D ~100nm for
channel-confinement, while it stays approximately constant for slit-like
confinement. These properties ought to reverberate in different kinetic
properties of linear DNA depending on confinement and could be detectable
experimentally or exploitable in nano-technological applications.
