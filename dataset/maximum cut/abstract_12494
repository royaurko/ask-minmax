The geometric thickness of a graph G is the minimum integer k such that there
is a straight line drawing of G with its edge set partitioned into k plane
subgraphs. Eppstein [Separating thickness from geometric thickness. In: Towards
a Theory of Geometric Graphs, vol. 342 of Contemp. Math., AMS, 2004] asked
whether every graph of bounded maximum degree has bounded geometric thickness.
We answer this question in the negative, by proving that there exists
Delta-regular graphs with arbitrarily large geometric thickness. In particular,
for all Delta >= 9 and for all large n, there exists a Delta-regular graph with
geometric thickness at least c Delta^{1/2} n^{1/2 - 4/Delta - epsilon}.
Analogous results concerning graph drawings with few edge slopes are also
presented, thus solving open problems by Dujmovic' et al. [Really straight
graph drawings. In: Proc. 12th International Symp. on Graph Drawing (GD '04),
vol. 3383 of Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., Springer, 2004] and Ambrus et al.
[The slope parameter of graphs. Tech. Rep. MAT-2005-07, Department of
Mathematics, Technical University of Denmark, 2005].
