We use simulated maps of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy to
quantify the ability of different statistical tests to discriminate between
Gaussian and non-Gaussian models. Despite the central limit theorem on large
angular scales, both the genus and extrema correlation are able to discriminate
between Gaussian models and a semi-analytic texture model selected as a
physically motivated non-Gaussian model. When run on the COBE 4-year CMB maps,
both tests prefer the Gaussian model. Although the bispectrum has comparable
statistical power when computed on the full sky, once a Galactic cut is imposed
on the data the bispectrum loses the ability to discriminate between models.
Off-diagonal elements of the bispectrum are comparable to the diagonal elements
for the non-Gaussian texture model and must be included to obtain maximum
statistical power.
