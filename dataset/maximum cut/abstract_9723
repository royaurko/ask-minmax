An influence of a radio-frequency electric field on glioma - brain cancer
development is considered. A specific task emerging here is whether this new
medical technology is effective against invasive cells with a high motility,
when switching between migrating and proliferating phenotypes takes place. This
therapeutic effect is studied in the framework of a continuous time random
walk. It is shown that the migration proliferation dichotomy of cancer cells
leads to the weakening of the electric field treatment.
