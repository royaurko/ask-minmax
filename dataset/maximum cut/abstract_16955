We formulate three famous, descriptive essays of C.N. Parkinson on
bureaucratic inefficiency in a quantifiable and dynamical socio-physical
framework. In the first model we show how the use of recent opinion formation
models for small groups can be used to understand Parkinson's observation that
decision making bodies such as cabinets or boards become highly inefficient
once their size exceeds a critical 'Coefficient of Inefficiency', typically
around 20. A second observation of Parkinson - which is sometimes referred to
as Parkinson's Law - is that the growth of bureaucratic or administrative
bodies usually goes hand in hand with a drastic decrease of its overall
efficiency. In our second model we view a bureaucratic body as a system of a
flow of workers, which enter, become promoted to various internal levels within
the system over time, and leave the system after having served for a certain
time. Promotion usually is associated with an increase of subordinates. Within
the proposed model it becomes possible to work out the phase diagram under
which conditions bureaucratic growth can be confined. In our last model we
assign individual efficiency curves to workers throughout their life in
administration, and compute the optimum time to send them to old age pension,
in order to ensure a maximum of efficiency within the body - in Parkinson's
words we compute the 'Pension Point'.
