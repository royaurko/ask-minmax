We have developed a new numerical scheme to solve r-mode oscillations of {\it
rapidly rotating polytropic stars} in Newtonian gravity. In this scheme, Euler
perturbations of the density, three components of the velocity are treated as
four unknown quantities together with the oscillation frequency. For the basic
equations of oscillations, the compatibility equations are used instead of the
linearized equations of motion.
  By using this scheme, we have solved the classical r-mode oscillations of
rotational equilibrium sequences of polytropes with the polytropic indices $N =
0.5, 1.0$ and 1.5 for $m = 2, 3$ and 4 modes. Here $m$ is the rank of the
spherical harmonics $Y_l^m$. These results have been applied to investigate
evolution of uniformly rotating hot young neutron stars by considering the
effect of gravitational radiation and viscosity. We have found that the maximum
angular velocities of neutron stars are around 10-20% of the Keplerian angular
velocity irrespective of the softness of matter. This confirms the results
obtained from the analysis of r-modes with the slow rotation approximation
employed by many contributors.
