We present a comprehensive study of the emission spectra from accreting
sources. We use our new reflection code to compute the reflected spectra from
an accretion disk illuminated by X-rays. This set of models covers different
values of ionization parameter, solar iron abundance and photon index for the
illuminating spectrum. These models also include the most complete and recent
atomic data for the inner-shell of the iron and oxygen isonuclear sequences. We
concentrate our analysis to the 2-10 keV energy region, and in particular to
the iron K-shell emission lines. We show the dependency of the equivalent width
(EW) of the Fe K$\alpha$ with the ionization parameter. The maximum value of
the EW is $\sim 800$ eV for models with log $\xi\sim 1.5$, and decreases
monotonically as $\xi$ increases. For lower values of $\xi$ the Fe K$\alpha$ EW
decreases to a minimum near log $\xi\sim 0.8$. We produce simulated CCD
observations based on our reflection models. For low ionized, reflection
dominated cases, the 2-10 keV energy region shows a very broad, curving
continuum that cannot be represented by a simple power-law. We show that in
addition to the Fe K-shell emission, there are other prominent features such as
the Si and S L$\alpha$ lines, a blend of Ar {\sc viii-xi} lines, and the Ca
{\sc x} K$\alpha$ line. In some cases the S {\sc xv} blends with the He-like Si
RRC producing a broad feature that cannot be reproduced by a simple Gaussian
profile. This could be used as a signature of reflection.
