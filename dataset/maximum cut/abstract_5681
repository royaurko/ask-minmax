Nanoscale and power-efficient electro-optic (EO) modulators are essential
components for optical interconnects that are beginning to replace electrical
wiring for intra- and inter-chip communications. Silicon-based EO modulators
show sufficient figures of merits regarding device footprint, speed, power
consumption and modulation depth. However, the weak electro-optic effect of
silicon still sets a technical bottleneck for these devices, motivating the
development of modulators based on new materials. Graphene, a two-dimensional
carbon allotrope, has emerged as an alternative active material for
optoelectronic applications owing to its exceptional optical and electronic
properties. Here, we demonstrate a high-speed graphene electro-optic modulator
based on a graphene-boron nitride (BN) heterostructure integrated with a
silicon photonic crystal nanocavity. Strongly enhanced light-matter interaction
of graphene in a submicron cavity enables efficient electrical tuning of the
cavity reflection. We observe a modulation depth of 3.2 dB and a cut-off
frequency of 1.2 GHz.
