In lattice QCD computations a substantial amount of work is spent in solving
linear systems arising in Wilson's discretization of the Dirac equations. We
show first numerical results of the extension of the two-level DD-\alpha AMG
method to a true multilevel method based on our parallel MPI-C implementation.
Using additional levels pays off, allowing to cut down the core minutes spent
on one system solve by a factor of approximately 700 compared to standard
Krylov subspace methods and yielding another speed-up of a factor of 1.7 over
the two-level approach.
