We investigate early discovery signals for supersymmetry at the Large Hadron
Collider without using information about missing transverse energy. Instead we
use cuts on the number of jets and isolated leptons (electrons and/or muons).
We work with minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model, and focus
on phenomenological models that give a relic density of dark matter compatible
with the WMAP measurements. An important model property for early discovery is
the presence of light sleptons, and we find that for an integrated luminosity
of only 200--300 pb$^{-1}$ at a center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV models with
gluino masses up to $\sim 700$ GeV can be tested.
