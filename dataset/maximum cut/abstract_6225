We measured the electrical resistivity of a BiS2-based compound EuFBiS2 under
high pressure. Polycrystalline EuFBiS2 shows insulator-metal transition and
pressure-induced superconductivity above 0.7 GPa. The superconducting
transition temperature increases with increasing applied pressure and shows the
maximum value around 8.6 K at 1.8 GPa.
