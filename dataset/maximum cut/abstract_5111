The emission of projectile fragments alpha has been studied in ^{84}Kr
interactions with nuclei of the nuclear emulsion detector composition at
relativistic energy below 2 GeV per nucleon. The angular distribution of
projectile fragments alpha in terms of transverse momentum could not be
explained by a straight and clean-cut collision geometry hypothesis of
Participant - Spectator (PS) Model. Therefore, it is assumed that projectile
fragments alpha were produced from two separate sources that belong to the
projectile spectator region differing drastically in their temperatures. It has
been clearly observed that the emission of projectile fragments alpha are from
two different sources. The contribution of projectile fragments alpha from
contact layer or hot source is a few percent of the total emission of
projectile fragments alphas. Most of the projectile fragments alphas are
emitted from the cold source. It has been noticed that the temperature of hot
and cold regions are dependent on the projectile mass number.
