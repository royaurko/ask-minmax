We calculate the CP-violating effects in the top quark semi-leptonic three
body decays induced by the supersymmetric CP-odd phase of the top squark
trilinear soft breaking term $\arg(A_t)$. The light top squark mass is assumed
to be close to the top quark mass $m_{\tilde{t}}\sim m_t$. The CP-conserving
phase is provided by the $\chi^+$ and $\chi^0$ cut. We find that the partial
rate asymmetry is in the 0.1% level. In the most favorable parameter region the
decay rate asymmetr can reach up to 0.55%.
