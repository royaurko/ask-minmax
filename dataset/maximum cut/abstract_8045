We study the form factors of the Konishi operator, the prime example of
non-protected operators in N=4 SYM theory, via the on-shell unitarity methods.
Since the Konishi operator is not protected by supersymmetry, its form factors
share many features with those in QCD, such as the occurrence of rational terms
and of UV divergences that require renormalization. A subtle point is that this
operator depends on the spacetime dimension. This requires a modification when
calculating its form factors via unitarity methods. We derive a rigorous
prescription that implements this modification to all loop orders and obtain
the two-point form factor up to two-loop order and the three-point form factor
to one-loop order. From these form factors, we construct an IR-finite cross
section type quantity, namely the inclusive decay rate of the (off-shell)
Konishi operator to any final (on-shell) state. Via the optical theorem, it is
connected to the imaginary part of the two-point correlation function. We
extract the Konishi anomalous dimension up to two-loop order from it.
