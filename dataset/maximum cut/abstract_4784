Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is an organizing principle of
biological neural networks. While synchronous firing of neurons is considered
to be an important functional block in the brain, how STDP shapes neural
networks possibly toward synchrony is not entirely clear. We examine relations
between STDP and synchronous firing in spontaneously firing neural populations.
Using coupled heterogeneous phase oscillators placed on initial networks, we
show numerically that STDP prunes some synapses and promotes formation of a
feedforward network. Eventually a pacemaker, which is the neuron with the
fastest inherent frequency in our numerical simulations, emerges at the root of
the feedforward network. In each oscillatory cycle, a packet of neural activity
is propagated from the pacemaker to downstream neurons along layers of the
feedforward network. This event occurs above a clear-cut threshold value of the
initial synaptic weight. Below the threshold, neurons are self-organized into
separate clusters each of which is a feedforward network.
