Representing images and videos with Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)
matrices and considering the Riemannian geometry of the resulting space has
proven beneficial for many recognition tasks. Unfortunately, computation on the
Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices --especially of high-dimensional ones--
comes at a high cost that limits the applicability of existing techniques. In
this paper we introduce an approach that lets us handle high-dimensional SPD
matrices by constructing a lower-dimensional, more discriminative SPD manifold.
To this end, we model the mapping from the high-dimensional SPD manifold to the
low-dimensional one with an orthonormal projection. In particular, we search
for a projection that yields a low-dimensional manifold with maximum
discriminative power encoded via an affinity-weighted similarity measure based
on metrics on the manifold. Learning can then be expressed as an optimization
problem on a Grassmann manifold. Our evaluation on several classification tasks
shows that our approach leads to a significant accuracy gain over
state-of-the-art methods.
