The b - u skewed parton distributions (SPDs) are discussed. The SPDs allow an
unambigous superposition of overlap and resonsance contributions and their
zeroth order moments represent the B - pi transition form factors. The values
of the form factors at maximum recoil are found to be F+(0)=F0(0)=0.22 with an
error of 0.05 in agreement with measurements of the B - pi pi branching ratio.
The branching ratios for the semi-leptonic B - pi decays are evaluated too.
