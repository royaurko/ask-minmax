Inspired in the AdS/CFT correspondence one can look for dualities between
string theory and non conformal field theories. Exact dualities in the non
conformal case are intricate but approximations can be helpful in extracting
physical results. A phenomenological approach consists in introducing a scale
corresponding to the maximum value of the axial AdS coordinate. Here we show
that this approach can reproduce the scaling of high energy glueball scattering
amplitudes and also an approximation for the scalar glueball mass ratios.
