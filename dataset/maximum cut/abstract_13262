We introduce a new distributed algorithm for aligning graphs or finding
substructures within a given graph. It is based on the cavity method and is
used to study the maximum-clique and the graph-alignment problems in random
graphs. The algorithm allows to analyze large graphs and may find applications
in fields such as computational biology. As a proof of concept we use our
algorithm to align the similarity graphs of two interacting protein families
involved in bacterial signal transduction, and to predict actually interacting
protein partners between these families.
