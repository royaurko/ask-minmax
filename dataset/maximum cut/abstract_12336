We consider the production of tau pairs by electron-positron colliding beams
at the maximum cross section near the threshold. At this energy tau pairs are
produced mostly in the s-wave which implies that the spin of the tau pairs are
almost always pointing in the beam direction independent of the production
angle. When both electrons and positrons are longitudinally polarized in the
same direction, for example 90%, one can obtain tau pairs with 99% polarization
in the direction of the polarization vectors of the incident beams. Tests of CP
violation and study of the structure of weak interactions using such polarized
tau pairs are discussed.
