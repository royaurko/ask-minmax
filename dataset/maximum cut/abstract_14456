A "book with k pages" consists of a straight line (the "spine") and k
half-planes (the "pages"), such that the boundary of each page is the spine. If
a graph is drawn on a book with k pages in such a way that the vertices lie on
the spine, and each edge is contained in a page, the result is a k-page book
drawing (or simply a k-page drawing). The k-page crossing number nu_k(G) of a
graph G is the minimum number of crossings in a k-page drawing of G. In this
paper we investigate the k-page crossing numbers of complete graphs K_n. We use
semidefinite programming techniques to give improved lower bounds on nu_k(K_n)
for various values of k. We also use a maximum satisfiability reformulation to
calculate the exact value of nu_k(K_n) for several values of k and n. Finally,
we investigate the best construction known for drawing K_n in k pages,
calculate the resulting number of crossings, and discuss this upper bound in
the light of the new results reported in this paper.
