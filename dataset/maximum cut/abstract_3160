In this paper, using martingale techniques, we prove a generalization of
Doob's maximal identity in the setting of continuous nonnegative local
submartingales $(X_{t})$ of the form: $X_{t}=N_{t}+A_{t}$, where the measure
$(dA_{t})$ is carried by the set $\left\{t: X_{t}=0\right\}$. In particular, we
give a multiplicative decomposition for the Az\'ema supermartingale associated
with some last passage times related to such processes and we prove that these
non-stopping times contain very useful information. As a consequence, we obtain
the law of the maximum of a continuous nonnegative local martingale $(M_t)$
which satisfies $M_\infty=\psi(\sup_{t\geq0}M_t)$ for some measurable function
$\psi$ as well as the law of the last time this maximum is reached.
