We show that the maximum population imbalance ratio $P_\mathrm{CC}$ for a
two-component Fermi gas near the unitarity limit to condense does not increase
with the trap aspect ratio $\lambda$, by two methods of 1) solving the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations with coupling-constant renormalization, and 2)
studying the pairing susceptibility by the real-space self-consistent
$T$-matrix approximation. The deviation of the cloud shape from what is
expected from the trap shape increases but stays minor with increasing
$\lambda$ up to 50. This finding indicates that despite the apparent
discrepancy between the MIT and Rice experiments over the value of
$P_\mathrm{CC}$ and the validity of local density approximation, the
equilibrium state of the system for the aspect ratio in the Rice experiment
should be consistent with that of MIT.
