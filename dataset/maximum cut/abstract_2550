Game semantics provides an interactive point of view on proofs, which enables
one to describe precisely their dynamical behavior during cut elimination, by
considering formulas as games on which proofs induce strategies. We are
specifically interested here in relating two such semantics of linear logic, of
very different flavor, which both take in account concurrent features of the
proofs: asynchronous games and concurrent games. Interestingly, we show that
associating a concurrent strategy to an asynchronous strategy can be seen as a
semantical counterpart of the focusing property of linear logic.
