A structural condition is given for finite maximal antichains in the
homomorphism order of relational structures to have the splitting property. It
turns out that non-splitting antichains appear only at the bottom of the order.
Moreover, we examine looseness and finite antichain extension property for some
subclasses of the homomorphism poset. Finally, we take a look at cut-points in
this order.
