At impact of a liquid droplet on a smooth surface heated above the liquid's
boiling point, the droplet either immediately boils when it contacts the
surfaces (``contact boiling''), or without any surface contact forms a
Leidenfrost vapor layer towards the hot surface and bounces back (``gentle film
boiling''), or both forms the Leidenfrost layer and ejects tiny droplets upward
(``spraying film boiling''). We experimentally determine conditions under which
impact behaviors in each regime can be realized. We show that the dimensionless
maximum spreading $\gamma$ of impacting droplets on the heated surfaces in both
gentle and spraying film boiling regimes shows a universal scaling with the
Weber number $\We$ ($\gamma\sim\We^{2/5}$) -- regardless of surface temperature
and of liquid properties -- which is much steeper than for the impact on
non-heated (hydrophilic or hydrophobic) surfaces ($\gamma\sim\We^{1/4}$). We
also intereferometrically measure the vapor thickness under the droplet.
