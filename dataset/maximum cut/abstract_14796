This paper summarizes the status and the recent measurements from the Pierre
Auger Observatory. The energy spectrum is described and its features discussed.
We report searches for anisotropy of cosmic ray arrival directions on large
scales and through correlation with catalogues of celestial objects. We also
present the search for anisotropies in the data without the use of astronomical
catalogues. The first measurement of the proton-air cross section around
10^{18} eV is discussed. Finally, the mass composition is addressed with
measurements of the variation of the depth of shower maximum with energy and
with the muon density at ground.
