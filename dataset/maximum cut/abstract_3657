We present a method for the evaluation of the interaction potential of an
equilibrium classical system starting from the (partial) knowledge of its
structure factor. The procedure is divided into two phases both of which are
based on the maximum entropy principle of information theory. First we
determine the maximum entropy estimate of the radial distribution function
constrained by the information contained in the structure factor. Next we
invert the pair function and extract the interaction potential. The method is
tested on a Lennard-Jones fluid at high density and the reliability of its
results with respect to the missing information in the structure factor data
are discussed. Finally, it is applied to the experimental data of liquid sodium
at 100$^{\circ}$C.
