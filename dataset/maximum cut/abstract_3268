We measure the recoil velocity as a function of spin for equal-mass,
highly-spinning black-hole binaries, with spins in the orbital plane, equal in
magnitude and opposite in direction. We confirm that the leading-order effect
is linear in the spin and the cosine of angle between the spin direction and
the infall direction at merger. We find higher-order corrections that are
proportional to the odd powers in both the spin and cosine of this angle.
Taking these corrections into account, we predict that the maximum recoil will
be 3680+-130 km/s.
