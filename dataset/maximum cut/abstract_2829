In this paper, using Mazharimousavi and Halilsoy (MH) black hole (BH) with
scalar hair (reported in arXiv:1412.4002), we construct scalar MH thin-shell
wormhole (TSW) in $(2+1)$ dimensions by applying the cut and paste technique
invented by Visser. The surface stress, which is concentrated at the wormhole
throat, is determined by using the Darmois-Israel formalism. By imposing the
different models of equation of gas states, we study the stability analysis of
the MH TSW. Some properties and characteristics of the stability regions are
highlighted.
