We have measured the absorption of terahertz radiation in a BCS
superconductor over a broad range of frequencies from 200 GHz to 1.1 THz, using
a broadband antenna-lens system and a tantalum microwave resonator. From low
frequencies, the response of the resonator rises rapidly to a maximum at the
gap edge of the superconductor. From there on the response drops to half the
maximum response at twice the pair-breaking energy. At higher frequencies, the
response rises again due to trapping of pair-breaking phonons in the
superconductor. In practice this is the first measurement of the frequency
dependence of the quasiparticle creation efficiency due to pair-breaking in a
superconductor. The efficiency, calculated from the different non-equilibrium
quasiparticle distribution functions at each frequency, is in agreement with
the measurements.
