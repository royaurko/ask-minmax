We investigate high-field transport in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) on SiO2,
up to breakdown. The maximum current density is limited by self-heating, but
can reach >3 mA/um for GNRs ~15 nm wide. Comparison with larger, micron-sized
graphene devices reveals that narrow GNRs benefit from 3D heat spreading into
the SiO2, which enables their higher current density. GNRs also benefit from
lateral heat flow to the contacts in short devices (< ~0.3 um), which allows
extraction of a median GNR thermal conductivity (TC), ~80 W/m/K at 20 C across
our samples, dominated by phonons. The TC of GNRs is an order of magnitude
lower than that of micron-sized graphene on SiO2, suggesting strong roles of
edge and defect scattering, and the importance of thermal dissipation in small
GNR devices.
