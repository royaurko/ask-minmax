We demonstrate that measurements of atom-number fluctuations in a trapped
dipolar condensate can reveal the presence of the elusive roton excitation. The
key signature is a super-Poissonian peak in the fluctuations as the size of the
measurement cell is varied, with the maximum occurring when the size is
comparable to the roton wavelength. The magnitude of this roton feature is
enhanced with temperature. The variation in fluctuations across the condensate
demonstrates that the roton excitations are effectively confined to propagate
in the densest central region, realizing a density trapped roton gas. While our
main results are based on full numerical solutions of the meanfield equations,
we also develop and validate a simple local density theory. Finally, we
consider fluctuations measured within a washer-shaped cell which filters out
the contribution of modes with nonzero angular momentum and provides a signal
sensitive to individual roton modes.
