Direct evaluation of charged particle polarizabilities on the lattice is
quite difficult. However, a short cut for charged pion polarizability - the
Das, Mathur, Okubo Sum Rule - can readily be calculated using lattice
techniques. A phenomenological model has been developed to fit the time
behavior of the propagators in this expression. Numerical systematics are
discussed and some preliminary results are presented.
