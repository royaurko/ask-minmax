For molecules and materials responding to femtosecond-scale optical laser
pulses, we predict maximum relative excitation of a Raman-active vibrational
mode with period T when the pulse has an FWHM duration of 0.42 T. This result
follows from a general analytical model, and is precisely confirmed by detailed
density-functional-based dynamical simulations for C60 and a carbon nanotube,
which include anharmonicity, nonlinearity, no assumptions about the
polarizability tensor, and no averaging over rapid oscillations within the
pulse. The mode specificity is, of course, best at low temperature and for
pulses that are electronically off-resonance, and the energy deposited in any
mode is proportional to the fourth power of the electric field.
