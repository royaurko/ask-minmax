We have studied the angular dependence of the irreversible magnetization and
its time relaxation in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ single crystals with one or two
families of columnar defects inclined with respect to the c-axis. At high
magnetic fields, the magnetization shows the usual maximum centered at the mean
tracks' orientation and an associated minimum in the normalized relaxation
rate. In contrast, at low fields we observe an anomalous local minimum in the
magnetization and a maximum in the relaxation rate. We present a model to
explain this anomaly based on the slowing down of the creep processes arising
from the increase of the vortex-vortex interactions as the applied field is
tilted away from the mean tracks' direction.
