A novel 2-D method for computing the convex hull of a sufficiently dense set
of n integer points is introduced. The approach employs a ranking function that
avoids sorting the points directly thus reducing the overall time complexity.
The ranked points create a simple polygonal chain from which the Convex Hull
can be found using a suitable O(n) method. The result is achieved by placing a
bound on the density (or ratio) of points to m, where m is the maximum value of
the ranking function required to represent the set of points yielding an O(n+m)
method. A fast method is then developed based on the bit length, p, of the data
set which reduces this time further. The required conditions are easily
satisfied by image processing methods which determine the Hulls of polygonal
regions where the densities are in the range of 3%. Our experiments on a range
problem domains show that this is not atypical. Since the complexity of the
method is related to the bit size p for current machines (p=32, p=64) the
method is for all practical purposes O(n). A short proof is provided.
