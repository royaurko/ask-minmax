Low- and medium resolution spectra of the fast nova, Nova (V1494) Aql 1999
No.2 obtained approximately 6, 7, 19 and 28 days after the maximum brightness
are presented and discussed. The spectrum covering the whole optical range at
day 6 shows the principal plus diffuse-enhanced spectrum. The presence of
strong Fe II multiplets with P-Cyg profiles suggest that V1494 Aql belongs to
the ``Fe II'' class defined by Williams (1992). The medium-resolution profiles
(lambda/Delta lambda \approx 7000) of the Hgamma and Hdelta lines show
well-defined sharp absorption features with the same radial velocities, while
the Halpha split into two distinct emission peaks in the last two spectra
(Delta t=19 and 28 days). The observed behaviour suggests an expanding
equatorial ring with possible small-scale clumpiness in the nova shell.
  The visual lightcurve is used to deduce M_V by the maximum magnitude versus
rate of decline relationship. The resulting parameters are: t_2=6.6+/-0.5 days,
t_3=16+/-0.5 days, M_V=-8.8+/-0.2 mag. Adopting this value, a distance
d=3.6+/-0.3 kpc is determined.
