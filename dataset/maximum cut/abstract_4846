We present results for the lowest order cross sections, calculated with the
complete set of the standard model Feynman diagrams, of all possible detection
channels of the associated production of the top quark pair and the light Higgs
boson, which may be used for determination of the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling at
the future e+e- linear collider. We show that, for typical particle
identification cuts, the background contributions are large. In particular, the
QCD background contributions are much bigger than could be expected when taking
into account a possibly low virtuality of exchanged gluons. Moreover, we
include the initial state radiation effects and discuss the dependence of the
cross sections on the Higgs boson and top quark masses.
