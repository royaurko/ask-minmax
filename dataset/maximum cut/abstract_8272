A light pseudoscalar coupled to two photons would be copiously emitted by the
core of a supernova and part of this flux would be converted to gamma-rays by
the galactic magnetic field. Measurements on the SN1987A gamma-ray flux by the
Gamma-Ray Spectrometer on the Solar Maximum Mission satellite imply stringents
bounds on such process. The improved generation of satellite-borne detectors,
like EGRET or the projegeneration of satellite-borne detectors, like EGRET or
the project GLAST, could be able to detect a pseudoscalar-to-photon signal from
a nearby supernova.
