The maximum traffic arrival rate at the network for a given delay guarantee
(delay constrained throughput) has been well studied for wired channels.
However, few results are available for wireless channels, especially when
multiple antennas are employed at the transmitter and receiver. In this work,
we analyze the network delay constrained throughput of a multiple input
multiple output (MIMO) wireless channel with time-varying spatial correlation.
The MIMO channel is modeled via its virtual representation, where the
individual spatial paths between the antenna pairs are Gilbert-Elliot channels.
The whole system is then described by a K-State Markov chain, where K depends
upon the degree of freedom (DOF) of the channel. We prove that the DOF based
modeling is indeed accurate. Furthermore, we study the impact of the delay
requirements at the network layer, violation probability and the number of
antennas on the throughput under different fading speeds and signal strength.
