Motivated by studying asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood
estimator (MLE) in stochastic volatility (SV) models, in this paper we
investigate likelihood estimation in state space models. We first prove, under
some regularity conditions, there is a consistent sequence of roots of the
likelihood equation that is asymptotically normal with the inverse of the
Fisher information as its variance. With an extra assumption that the
likelihood equation has a unique root for each $n$, then there is a consistent
sequence of estimators of the unknown parameters. If, in addition, the supremum
of the log likelihood function is integrable, the MLE exists and is strongly
consistent. Edgeworth expansion of the approximate solution of likelihood
equation is also established. Several examples, including Markov switching
models, ARMA models, (G)ARCH models and stochastic volatility (SV) models, are
given for illustration.
