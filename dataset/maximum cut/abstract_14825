We perform time-dependent calculations of strong-field ionization of He by
elliptically polarized light in configuration of recent attoclock measurements
of Boge {\em et al} [PRL {\bf 111}, 103003 (2013)]. By solving a 3D
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, we obtain the angular offset $\theta_m$
of the maximum in the photoelectron momentum distribution in the polarization
plane relative to the position predicted by the strong field approximation.
This offset is used in attoclock measurements to extract the tunneling time.
Our calculations clearly support the set of experimental angular offset values
obtained with the use of non-adiabatic calibration of the {\em in situ} field
intensity, and disagree with an alternative set calibrated adiabatically. These
findings are in contrast with the conclusions of Boge {\em et al} who found a
qualitative agreement of their semiclassical calculations with the adiabatic
set of experimental data. This controversy may complicate interpretation of the
recent atto-clock measurements.
