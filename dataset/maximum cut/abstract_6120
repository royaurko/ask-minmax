We consider the thermodynamic geometry of an ideal non-Abelian gas. We show
that, for a certain value of the fractional parameter and at the relevant
maximum value of fugacity, the thermodynamic curvature has a singular point.
This indicates a condensation such as Bose-Einstein condensation for
non-Abelian statistics and we work out the phase transition temperature in
various dimensions.
