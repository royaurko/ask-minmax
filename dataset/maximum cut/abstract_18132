Motivated by applications in neuroanatomy, we propose a novel methodology for
estimating the heritability which corresponds to the proportion of phenotypic
variance which can be explained by genetic factors. Estimating this quantity
for neuroanatomical features is a fundamental challenge in psychiatric disease
research. Since the phenotypic variations may only be due to a small fraction
of the available genetic information, we propose an estimator of the
heritability that can be used in high dimensional sparse linear mixed models.
Our method consists of three steps. Firstly, a variable selection stage is
performed in order to recover the support of the genetic effects -- also called
causal variants -- that is to find the genetic effects which really explain the
phenotypic variations. Secondly, we propose a maximum likelihood strategy for
estimating the heritability which only takes into account the causal genetic
effects found in the first step. Thirdly, we compute the standard error and the
95% confidence interval associated to our heritability estimator thanks to a
nonparametric bootsrap approach. Our main contribution consists in providing an
estimation of the heritability with standard errors substantially smaller than
methods without variable selection. We illustrate the performance of our
methodology on synthetic and real neuroanatomic data coming from the Imagen
project. We also show that our approach has a very low computational burden and
is very efficient from a statistical point of view.
