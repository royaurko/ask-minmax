An Ising-type atom-atom interaction is obtained in a fiber-connected
three-atom system. The interaction is effective when $\Delta\approx \gamma
_{0}\gg g$. The preparations of remote two-atom and three-atom entanglement
governed by this interaction are discussed in specific parameters region. The
overall two-atom entanglement is very small because of the existence of the
third atom. However, the three-atom entanglement can reach a maximum very close
to 1.
