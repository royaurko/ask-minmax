We propose the use of a tunneling electromechanical transducer to dynamically
detect Casimir forces between two conducting surfaces. The maximum distance for
which Casimir forces should be detectable with our method is around $1 \mu$m,
while the lower limit is given by the ability to approach the surfaces. This
technique should permit to study gravitational forces on the same range of
distances, as well as the vacuum friction provided that very low dissipation
mechanical resonators are used.
