In this paper we formulate and solve a mean-field game described by a linear
stochastic dynamics and a quadratic or exponential-quadratic cost functional
for each generic player. The optimal strategies for the players are given
explicitly using a simple and direct method based on square completion and a
Girsanov-type change of measure. This approach does not use the well-known
solution methods such as the Stochastic Maximum Principle and the Dynamic
Programming Principle with Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equation and
Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation. In the risk-neutral linear-quadratic
mean-field game, we show that there is unique best response strategy to the
mean of the state and provide a simple sufficient condition of existence and
uniqueness of mean-field equilibrium. This approach gives a basic insight into
the solution by providing a simple explanation for the additional term in the
robust or risk-sensitive Riccati equation, compared to the risk-neutral Riccati
equation. Sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of mean-field
equilibria are obtained when the horizon length and risk-sensitivity index are
small enough. The method is then extended to the linear-quadratic robust
mean-field games under small disturbance, formulated as a minimax mean-field
game.
