We have studied how the lateral interaction affects the electric conductance,
the second-order current correlation (shot noise), and the third-order one
(skewness) of a pair of parallel Al atomic wires. The field operator of wave
function is introduced to calculate the current-current correlations. The
corresponding wave functions are self-consistently obtained by iteration
according to the Lippmann-Schwinger First-principles calculation. The results
show that when the distance between two wires is sufficiently small, the
bonding interaction near the Fermi level will induce a spatial delocalization
of electrons. This leads to an electric conduction value greater than the sum
of two uncorrelated atomic wire, and a side-band peak is generated around the
maximum conductance. This correlation can also be observed from the shot noise
and the skewness. In addition, we found that the three-order Fano factor is
negatively related to the conductance.
