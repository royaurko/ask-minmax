Photon-tagged correlations may be useful to determine how the dense partonic
medium produced in heavy-ion collisions affects the fragmentation of
high-energy quarks and gluons into a leading hadron. In these proceedings, I
discuss the kinematic requirements for the hadron and the prompt photon
transverse momentum cuts. A case study at LHC energy, tagging on p_T > 20 GeV
and p_T > 50 GeV photons, is then briefly examined.
