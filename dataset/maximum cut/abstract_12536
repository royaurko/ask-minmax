We deal with a planar random flight $\{(X(t),Y(t)),0<t\leq T\}$ observed at
$n+1$ equidistant times $t_i=i\Delta_n,i=0,1,...,n$. The aim of this paper is
to estimate the unknown value of the parameter $\lambda$, the underlying rate
of the Poisson process. The planar random flights are not markovian, then we
use an alternative argument to derive a pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator
$\hat{\lambda}$ of the parameter $\lambda$. We consider two different types of
asymptotic schemes and show the consistency, the asymptotic normality and
efficiency of the estimator proposed. A Monte Carlo analysis for small sample
size $n$ permits us to analyze the empirical performance of $\hat{\lambda}$.
  A different approach permits us to introduce an alternative estimator of
$\lambda$ which is consistent, asymptotically normal and asymptotically
efficient without the request of other assumptions.
