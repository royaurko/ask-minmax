The "golden region'' in the MSSM parameter space is the region where the
experimental constraints are satisfied and the amount of fine-tuning is
minimized. In this region, the stop trilinear soft term is large, leading to a
significant mass splitting between the two stop mass eigenstates. As a result,
the decay of the heavier stop into the lighter stop and a Z boson is
kinematically allowed throughout the golden region. We propose that the
experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can search for this decay
through an inclusive signature, Z+2jb+missing Et+X. We evaluate the Standard
Model backgrounds for this channel, and identify a set of cuts that would allow
detection of the supersymmetric contribution at the LHC for the MSSM parameters
typical of the golden region.
