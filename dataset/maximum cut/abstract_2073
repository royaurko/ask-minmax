The steady current induced by electromagnetic field in a 2D system with
asymmetric scatterers is studied. The scatterers are assumed to be oriented
cuts with one diffusive and another specular sides. Besides, the existence of
isotropic impurity scatterers is assumed. This simple model simulates the
lattice of half-disk which have been studied numerically recently. The model
allows the exact solution in the framework of the kinetic equation. The static
current response in the second order of electric field is obtained. The
photogalvanic tensor contains both responses to linear and circular
polarization of electromagnetic field. The model possesses non-analyticity with
regards to the rate of impurity scattering.
