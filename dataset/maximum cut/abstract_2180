Strategies are presented for discovering light, color-singlet technipions
(pi_T) produced in association with a vector boson through s-channel technirho
production, at the Tevatron and LHC. Signal and W+jets background were
simulated including detector effects. Tagging of b-quarks from the pi_T -> bb
decay is found to be important to reduce the W+jets background. Kinematic
properties of signal and background events are significantly different and
simple cuts can be used to further improve the signal to background ratio.
