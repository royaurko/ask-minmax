In this paper we revisit the classical results on the St. Petersburg sum. We
determine the limit distribution of the St. Petersburg sum conditioning on its
maximum, and we analyze how the limit depends on the value of the maximum. As
an application we obtain an infinite sum representation for the distribution
function of the possible semistable limits, and we provide exact asymptotics
for the ratio $P\{S_n > x \}/ P\{X_1 > x \}$, as $x \to \infty$. We show that
although the St. Petersburg distribution is only O-subexponential, the
subexponential property almost holds.
