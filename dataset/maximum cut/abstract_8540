We show that the newly discovered $^{52}$Cr Bose condensate in zero magnetic
field can be a spin nematic of the following kind: A "maximum" polar state, a
"co-linear" polar state, or a biaxial nematic ferromagnetic state. We also
present the phase diagram with a magnetic field in the interaction subspace
containing the Chromium condensate. It contains many uniaxial and biaxial spin
nematic phases, which often but not always break time reversal symmetry, and
can exist with or without spontaneous magnetization.
