We consider Higgs boson production through gluon--gluon fusion in hadron
collisions. We present a numerical program that computes the cross section up
to NNLO in QCD perturbation theory. The program includes the decay modes
H->gamma-gamma, H->WW->lnulnu, H->ZZ->4leptons, and allows the user to apply
arbitrary cuts on the momenta of the partons and of the photons or leptons that
are produced in the final state.
