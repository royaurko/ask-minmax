In this paper, the holographic dark energy model with new infrared cut-off
proposed by Granda and Oliveros has been investigated in spatially non flat
universe. The dependency of the evolution of equation of state, deceleration
parameter and cosmological evolution of Hubble parameter on the parameters of
new HDE model are calculated. Also, the statefinder parameters $r$ and $s$ in
this model are derived and the evolutionary trajectories in $s-r$ plane are
plotted. We show that the evolutionary trajectories are dependent on the model
parameters of new HDE model. Eventually, in the light of SNe+BAO+OHD+CMB
observational data, we plot the evolutionary trajectories in $s-r$ and $q-r$
planes for best fit values of the parameters of new HDE model.
