This paper deals with the geometry of the space (GIT quotient) M_8 of 8
points in P^1, and the Gale-quotient N'_8 of the GIT quotient of 8 points in
P^3. The space M_8 comes with a natural embedding in P^{13}, or more precisely,
the projectivization of the S_8-representation V_{4,4}. There is a single
S_8-skew cubic C in P^{13}. The fact that M_8 lies on the skew cubic C is a
consequence of Thomae's formula for hyperelliptic curves, but more is true: M_8
is the singular locus of C. These constructions yield the free resolution of
M_8, and are used in the determination of the "single" equation cutting out the
GIT quotient of n points in P^1 in general. The space N'_8 comes with a natural
embedding in P^{13}, or more precisely, PV_{2,2,2,2}. There is a single skew
quintic Q containing N'_8, and N'_8 is the singular locus of the skew quintic
Q. The skew cubic C and skew quintic Q are projectively dual. (In particular,
they are surprisingly singular, in the sense of having a dual of remarkably low
degree.) The divisor on the skew cubic blown down by the dual map is the secant
variety Sec(M_8), and the contraction Sec(M_8) - - > N'_8 factors through N_8
via the space of 8 points on a quadric surface. We conjecture that the divisor
on the skew quintic blown down by the dual map is the quadrisecant variety of
N'_8 (the closure of the union of quadrisecant *lines*), and that the quintic Q
is the trisecant variety. The resulting picture extends the classical duality
in the 6-point case between the Segre cubic threefold and the Igusa quartic
threefold. We note that there are a number of geometrically natural varieties
that are (related to) the singular loci of remarkably singular cubic
hypersurfaces. Some of the content of this paper appeared in arXiv/0809.1233.
