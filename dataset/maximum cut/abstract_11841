We report low energy electronic Raman scattering from Ni-substituted
YBa2Cu3O6.95 single crystals with Tc ranging from 92.5 K to 78 K. The fully
symmetrical A1g channel and the B1g channel which is sensitive to the dx2-y2
gap maximum have been explored. The energy of the B1g pair-breaking peak
remains constant under Ni doping while the energy of the A1g peak scales with
Tc (EA1g/Tc=5). Our data show that the A1g peak tracks the magnetic resonance
peak observed in inelastic neutron scattering yielding a key explanation to the
long-standing problem of the origin the A1g peak.
