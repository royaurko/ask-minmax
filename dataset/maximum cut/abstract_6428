We show for the system La1-xCexCoO3 (0.1 <= x <= 0.4) that it is possible to
synthesize electron-doped cobaltites by the growth of epitaxial thin films. For
La1-xCexCoO3, ferromagnetic order is observed within the entire doping range
(with the maximum of the Curie temperature, Tc, at x ca. 0.3), resulting in a
magnetic phase diagram similar to that of hole-doped lanthanum cobaltites. The
measured spin values strongly suggest an intermediate-spin state of the Co ions
which has been also found in the hole-doped system. In contrast to the
hole-doped material, however, where Tc is well above 200 K, we observe a strong
suppression of the maximum Tc to about 22 K. This is likely to be caused by a
considerable decrease of the Co3d - O2p hybridization. The observed intriguing
magnetic properties are in agreement with previously reported theoretical
results.
