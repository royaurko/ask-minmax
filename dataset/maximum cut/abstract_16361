A characteristic feature of the copper oxide high-temperature superconductors
is the dichotomy between the electronic excitations along the nodal (diagonal)
and antinodal (parallel to the Cu-O bonds) directions in momentum space,
generally assumed to be linked to the "d-wave" symmetry of the superconducting
state. Angle-resolved photoemission measurements in the superconducting state
have revealed a quasiparticle spectrum with a d-wave gap structure that
exhibits a maximum along the antinodal direction and vanishes along the nodal
direction. Subsequent measurements have shown that, at low doping levels, this
gap structure persists even in the high-temperature metallic state, although
the nodal points of the superconducting state spread out in finite "Fermi
arcs". This is the so-called pseudogap phase, and it has been assumed that it
is closely linked to the superconducting state, either by assigning it to
fluctuating superconductivity or by invoking orders which are natural
competitors of d-wave superconductors. Here we report experimental evidence
that a very similar pseudogap state with a nodal-antinodal dichotomous
character exists in a system that is markedly different from a superconductor:
the ferromagnetic metallic groundstate of the colossal magnetoresistive bilayer
manganite La1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7. Our findings therefore cast doubt on the assumption
that the pseudogap state in the copper oxides and the nodal-antinodal dichotomy
are hallmarks of the superconductivity state.
