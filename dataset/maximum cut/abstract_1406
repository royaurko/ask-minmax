We investigate color superconducting phase at high density in the extended
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model for the two flavor quarks. Because of the
non-renormalizability of the model, physical observables may depend on the
regularization procedure, that is why we apply two types of regularization, the
cut-off and the dimensional one to evaluate the phase structure, the equation
of state and the relationship between the mass and the radius of a dense star.
To obtain the phase structure we evaluate the minimum of the effective
potential at finite temperature and chemical potential. The stress tensor is
calculated to derive the equation of state. Solving the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we show the relationship between the mass
and the radius of a dense star. The dependence on the regularization is found
not to be small for these phenomena in the color superconducting phase.
