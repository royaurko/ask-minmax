Study of energetic cosmic explosions as a part of time domain astronomy is
one of the key areas that could be pursued with upcoming Giant segmented
optical-IR telescopes with a very large photon collecting area applying cutting
edge technology. Existing 8-10m class telescopes have been helpful to improve
our knowledge about Core-Collapse Supernovae, Gamma-ray Bursts and nature of
their progenitors and explosion mechanisms. However, many aspects about these
energetic cosmic explosions are still not well-understood and require much
bigger telescopes and back-end instruments with high precision to address the
evolution of massive stars and high-redshift Universe in more detail. In this
presentation, possible thrust research areas towards Core-Collapse Supernovae
and Gamma-ray Bursts with the Thirty Meter Telescope and back-end instruments
are presented.
