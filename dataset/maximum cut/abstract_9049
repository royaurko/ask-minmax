We consider the evolution of d-wave pairing, mediated by nearly critical spin
fluctuations, with the coupling strength. We show that the onset temperature
for pairing, T*, smoothly evolves between weak and strong coupling, passing
through a broad maximum at intermediate coupling. At strong coupling, T* is of
order the magnetic exchange energy J. We argue that for all couplings, pairing
is confined to the vicinity of the Fermi surface. We also find that thermal
spin fluctuations only modestly reduce T*, even at criticality, but they
substantially smooth the gap anisotropy. The latter evolves with coupling,
being the largest at weak coupling.
