Electronic structure calculations using the augmented spherical wave method
have been performed for CuRhO2. For this semiconductor crystallizing in the
delafossite structure, it is found that the valence band maximum is mainly due
to the 4d t2g orbitals of Rh^{3+}. The structural characterizations of
CuRh(1-x)MgxO2 show a broad range of Mg^{2+} substitution for Rh^{3+} in this
series, up to about 12%. Measurements of the resistivity and thermopower of the
doped systems show a Fermi liquid-like behavior for temperatures up to about
1000K, resulting in a large weakly temperature dependent power factor. The
thermopower is discussed both within the Boltzmann equation approach as based
on the electronic structure calculations and the temperature independent
correlation functions ratio approximation as based on the Kubo formalism.
