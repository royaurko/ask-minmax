We studied the magnetization losses of four different types of filamentary
YBCO coated conductors. A 10 mm wide YBCO coated conductor was subdivided into
20 filaments by laser cutting. The separation of coupling loss from the total
is possible because the energy loss per cycle in samples with electrically
insulated filaments has a very small frequency dependence. We measured the
frequency dependence of the total losses in the frequency range between 0.1 Hz
and 500 Hz. The coupling loss was obtained from the total by subtracting the
hysteresis loss. The latter was measured at low frequencies since only
hysteresis loss is non-negligible at frequencies below 1 Hz. The transverse
resistivity was determined from the coupling losses; it was assumed that the
sample length is equal to half of the twist pitch. The values of transverse
resistivity deduced from the loss data were compared with those obtained by the
four-point measurements with current flowing perpendicular to the filaments.
Preliminary results indicate that the current method of laser ablation creates
electrical contacts between the superconducting filaments and the substrate.
This was also confirmed by the Hall probe mapping of the magnetic field in the
vicinity of the tape. The measured transverse resistivity was close to the
resistivity of the substrate (Hastelloy).
