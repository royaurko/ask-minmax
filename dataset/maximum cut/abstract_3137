It is shown that the laws of thermodynamics are extremely robust under
generalizations of the form of entropy. Using the Bregman-type relative
entropy, the Clausius inequality is proved to be always valid. This implies
that thermodynamics is highly universal and does not rule out consistent
generalization of the maximum entropy method.
