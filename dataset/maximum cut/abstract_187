Gravity waves (GW) in the early universe generate B-type polarization in the
cosmic microwave background (CMB), which can be used as a direct way to measure
the energy scale of inflation. Gravitational lensing contaminates the GW signal
by converting the dominant E polarization into B polarization. By
reconstructing the lensing potential from CMB itself one can decontaminate the
B mode induced by lensing. We present results of numerical simulations of B
mode delensing using quadratic and iterative maximum-likelihood lensing
reconstruction methods as a function of detector noise and beam. In our
simulations we find the quadratic method can reduce the lensing B noise power
by up to a factor of 7, close to the no noise limit. In contrast, the iterative
method shows significant improvements even at the lowest noise levels we
tested. We demonstrate explicitly that with this method at least a factor of 40
noise power reduction in lensing induced B power is possible, suggesting that
T/S=10^-6 may be achievable in the absence of sky cuts, foregrounds, and
instrumental systematics. While we do not find any fundamental lower limit due
to lensing, we find that for high-sensitivity detectors residual lensing noise
dominates over the detector noise.
