We report an ultrafast and efficient way to create the maximum coherence
between the two lower states in a -like atomic systems, driven by two
nonlinearly chirped few-cycle pulses. The phenomenon of coherent population
trapping and electromagnetically induced population transfer are investigated
by solving the appropriate density matrix equations without invoking the
rotating wave approximation. The robustness of the scheme for maximum coherence
against the variation of the laser parameters are tested numerically. We also
demonstrate that the proposed scheme could be used to obtain complete
population transfer to an initially empty ground state.
