Balakrishnan and Mi [1] considered order preserving property of maximum
likelihood estimators. In this paper there are given conditions under which the
moment estimators have the property of preserving stochastic orders. There is
considered property of preserving for usual stochastic order as well as for
likelihood ratio order. Mainly, sufficient conditions are given for one
parameter family of distributions and also for exponential family, location
family and scale family.
