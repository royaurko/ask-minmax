In the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and the
R-parity breaking model (RBM), we investigate production processes of the
scalar top (stop) at HERA energies. These models are characterized by the
possible existence of the light stop whose mass is lighter than those of the
top quark and the other squarks. It is shown that in the MSSM the stop pair
production via boson-gluon fusion gives a sizeable cross section and the most
serious background $ep\rightarrow ec\bar{c}X$ could be suppressed by
appropriate kinematical cuts. We also show that in the RBM the stop is singly
produced in the neutral current processes and we have a clear signal as a sharp
peak in the Bjorken parameter $x$ distribution of the scattered electron.
