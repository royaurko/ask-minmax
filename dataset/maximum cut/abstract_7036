This paper shows that the Maddah-Ali--Tse (MAT) scheme which establishes the
symmetric capacity of two example broadcast channels with strictly causal state
information at the transmitter is a simple special case of the
Shayevitz--Wigger scheme for the broadcast channel with generalized feedback,
which involves block Markov coding, compression, superposition coding, Marton
coding, and coded time sharing. Focusing on the class of symmetric broadcast
channels with state, we derive an expression for the maximum achievable
symmetric rate using the Shayevitz--Wigger scheme. We show that the MAT results
can be recovered by evaluating this expression for the special case in which
superposition coding and Marton coding are not used. We then introduce a new
broadcast channel example that shares many features of the MAT examples. We
show that another special case of our maximum symmetric rate expression in
which superposition coding is also used attains a higher symmetric rate than
the MAT scheme. The symmetric capacity of this example is not known, however.
