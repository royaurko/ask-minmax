We study the limits on the mass of the lightest Higgs in supersymmetric
models extended with a gauge singlet when perturbative unification is required.
We find that when maximum intermediate matter is added, the different evolution
of the gauge couplings raises the mass bound from 135 GeV to 155 GeV. In these
models perturbative unification of the gauge couplings is achieved in a natural
way.
