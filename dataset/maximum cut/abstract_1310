We accomplish our efforts to obtain predictions for all four-fermion final
states of e+ e- annihilation and the corresponding bremsstrahlung reactions
which are possible in the framework of the Standard Model. For this purpose we
have developed a program EE4FGAMMA. Our predictions are valid for fermions of
arbitrary masses and we can obtain results for total cross sections without any
collinear cut. Keeping exact fermion masses is of course required for top quark
production. We give a detailed phenomenological analysis of fermion mass
effects and real photon radiation for all channels of four-fermion production
at LEP-II and next linear collider energies.
