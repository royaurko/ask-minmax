Right-handed neutrinos with large Majorana mass occur naturally in the
left-right symmetric model. We explore the prospect of such heavy Right-handed
Neutrino search Via $W_R$ decay in the Like Sign Dilepton channel at SSC/LHC.
The standard model background can be effectively eliminated by suitable lepton
$p_T$ and isolation cuts without affecting the signal cross section seriously.
In this way it seems possible to explore the bulk of the parameter space $0 <
M_{N_R} < M_{W_R}$, with $M_{W_R}$ going upto 3000 (2000) GeV at SSC (LHC)
energy.
