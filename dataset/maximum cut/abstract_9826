We discuss moderate resolution spectra, multicolor photometry, and light
curves of thirty-one of the most luminous stars and variables in the giant
spiral M101. The majority are intermediate A to F-type supergiants. We present
new photometry and light curves for three known "irregular blue variables" V2,
V4 and V9) and identify a new candidate. Their spectra and variability confirm
that they are LBV candidates and V9 may be in an LBV-like maximum light state
or eruption.
