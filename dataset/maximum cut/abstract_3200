The behaviour of large amplitude electrostatic waves in cold plasma is
investigated in the context of Born-Infeld electrodynamics. The equations of
motion for the plasma are established using an unconstrained action principle.
The maximum amplitude and frequency of a large amplitude electrostatic wave are
determined, and a lower bound on the wavelength is established. The maximum
electric field is found to be the same as that on a point electron at rest.
