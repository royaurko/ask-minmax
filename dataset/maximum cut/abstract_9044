The motion of an air-fluid interface through an irregularly coated capillary
is studied by analysing the Lucas-Washburn equation with a random capillary
force. The pinning probability goes from zero to a maximum value, as the
interface slows down. Under a critical velocity, the distribution of waiting
times $\tau$ displays a power-law tail $\sim \tau^{-2}$ which corresponds to a
strongly intermittent dynamics, also observed in experiments. We elaborate a
procedure to predict quantities of experimental interest, such as the average
interface trajectory and the distribution of pinning lengths.
