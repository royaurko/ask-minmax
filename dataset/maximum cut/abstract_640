The profiles of a spreading wetting film are computed taking into account
intermolecular forces and introducing a kinetic slip condition at a molecular
cut-off distance. This eliminates the stress singularity, so that both "true"
and "visible" contact angles are defined unequivocally. The "true" contact
angle at the cut-off distance depends on the slip length as well as on the edge
propagation speed, but not on gravity or asymptotic inclination angle. These
macroscopic factors influence, however, the "visible" contact angle observed in
the interval where the actual film profile departs from the intermediate
asymptotic curve.
