The effect of additional doping of charge impurities was investigated in a
ferromagnetic semiconductor Zn$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$Te. It was found that the doping
of iodine, which is expected to act as an n-type dopant in ZnTe, brought about
a drastic enhancement of the ferromagnetism in Zn$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$Te while the
grown films remained electrically insulating. In particular, at a fixed Cr
composition of x = 0.05, the ferromagnetic transition temperature Tc increased
up to 300K at maximum due to the iodine doping from Tc = 30K of the undoped
counterpart, while the ferromagnetism disappeared due to the doping of nitrogen
as a p-type dopant. The observed systematic correlation of ferromagnetism with
the doping of charge impurities of both p- and n-type, suggesting a key role of
the position of Fermi level within the impurity d-state, is discussed on the
basis of the double exchange interaction as a mechanism of ferromagnetism in
this material.
