A 3-simplex is a collection of four sets A_1,...,A_4 with empty intersection
such that any three of them have nonempty intersection. We show that the
maximum size of a set system on n elements without a 3-simplex is $2^{n-1} +
\binom{n-1}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1} + \binom{n-1}{2}$ for all $n \ge 1$, with
equality only achieved by the family of sets either containing a given element
or of size at most 2. This extends a result of Keevash and Mubayi, who showed
the conclusion for n sufficiently large.
