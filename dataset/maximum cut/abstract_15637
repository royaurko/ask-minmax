The Total Colouring Conjecture suggests that $\Delta+3$ colours ought to
suffice in order to provide a proper total colouring of every graph $G$ with
maximum degree $\Delta$. Thus far this has been confirmed up to an additive
constant factor, and the same holds even if one additionally requires every
pair of neighbours in $G$ to differ with respect to the sets of their incident
colours, so called pallets. Within this paper we conjecture that an upper bound
of the form $\Delta+const.$ still remains valid even after extending the
distinction requirement to pallets associated with vertices at distance at most
$r$, if only $G$ has minimum degree $\delta$ larger than a constant dependent
on $r$. We prove that such assumption on $\delta$ is then unavoidable and
exploit the probabilistic method in order to provide two supporting results for
the conjecture. Namely, we prove the upper bound $(1+o(1))\Delta$ for every
$r$, and show that the conjecture holds if $\delta\geq \varepsilon\Delta$ for
any fixed $\epsilon\in(0,1]$ and $r$, i.e., in particular for regular graphs.
