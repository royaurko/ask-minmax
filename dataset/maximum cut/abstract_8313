Two classes of gamma-ray bursts have been identified so far, characterized by
durations shorter and longer than approximately 2 seconds. In 1998 two
independent papers indicated the existence of the third class of the bursts
roughly duration between 2 and 10 seconds. In this paper, using the full BATSE
Catalog, the maximum likelihood estimation is presented, which gives a 0.5%
probability to having only two subclasses. The Monte-Carlo simulation confirms
this probability, too.
