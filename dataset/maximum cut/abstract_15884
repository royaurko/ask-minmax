In this paper we review the main and the most recent evidence for the
presence of a core radius in the distribution of the dark matter around spiral
galaxies. Their rotation curves, coadded according to the galaxy luminosity,
conform to an Universal profile which can be represented as the sum of an
exponential thin disk term plus a spherical halo term with a flat density core.
  From dwarfs to giants, these halos feature a constant density region of size
r_0 and core density rho_0 related by rho_0= 4.5 10^{-2} (r_0/kpc)^{-2/3}M_sol
pc^{-3}. At the highest masses rho_0 decreases exponentially, with r_0
revealing a lack of objects with disk masses > 10^{11}M_sol and central
densities > 1.5 10^{-2}(r_0/kpc)^{-3} M_sol pc^{-3}, which implies a maximum
mass of ~2 10^{12} M_sol for halos hosting spirals. The fine structure of dark
matter halos is obtained from the kinematics of a number of suitable
low-luminosity disk galaxies. The inferred halo circular velocity increases
linearly with radius out to the edge of the stellar disk, implying a constant
dark halo density over the entire disk region. The structural properties of
halos around normal spirals are similar to those around dwarf and low surface
brightness galaxies; nevertheless they provide far more substantial evidence of
the discrepancy between the mass distributions predicted in the Cold Dark
Matter scenario and those actually detected around galaxies.
