We have analyzed vibrations generated in an orthogonal cutting process. Using
a simple one degree of freedom model of the regenerative cutting we have
observed the complex behaviour of the system. In presence of a shaped cutting
surface, the nonlinear interaction between the tool and a worpiece leads to
chatter vibrations of periodic, quasi-periodic or chaotic type depending on
system parameters. To describe the profile of the surface machined by the first
pass we used a harmonic function. We analysed the impact phenomenon between the
tool and a workpiece after their contact loss.
