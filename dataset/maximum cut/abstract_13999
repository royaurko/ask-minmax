Thurstonian and Bradley-Terry models are the most commonly applied models in
the analysis of paired comparison data. Since their introduction, numerous
developments have been proposed in different areas. This paper provides an
updated overview of these extensions, including how to account for object- and
subject-specific covariates and how to deal with ordinal paired comparison
data. Special emphasis is given to models for dependent comparisons. Although
these models are more realistic, their use is complicated by numerical
difficulties. We therefore concentrate on implementation issues. In particular,
a pairwise likelihood approach is explored for models for dependent paired
comparison data, and a simulation study is carried out to compare the
performance of maximum pairwise likelihood with other limited information
estimation methods. The methodology is illustrated throughout using a real data
set about university paired comparisons performed by students.
