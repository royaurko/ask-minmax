The spectroscopic variability of Arcturus hints at cyclic activity cycle and
differential rotation. This could provide a test of current theoretical models
of solar and stellar dynamos. To examine the applicability of current models of
the flux transport dynamo to Arcturus, we compute a mean-field model for its
internal rotation, meridional flow, and convective heat transport in the
convective envelope. We then compare the conditions for dynamo action with
those on the Sun. We find solar-type surface rotation with about 1/10th of the
shear found on the solar surface. The rotation rate increases monotonically
with depth at all latitudes throughout the whole convection zone. In the lower
part of the convection zone the horizontal shear vanishes and there is a strong
radial gradient. The surface meridional flow has maximum speed of 110 m/s and
is directed towards the equator at high and towards the poles at low latitudes.
Turbulent magnetic diffusivity is of the order $10^{15}$--$10^{16} {\rm
cm^2/s}$. The conditions on Arcturus are not favorable for a
circulation-dominated dynamo.
