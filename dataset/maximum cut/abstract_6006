We give a necessary and sufficient condition on a sequence of functions on a
set $\Omega$ under which there is a measure on $\Omega$ which renders the given
sequence of functions a martingale. Further such a measure is unique if we
impose a natural maximum entropy condition on the conditional probabilities.
