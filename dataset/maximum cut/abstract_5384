The luminosity function of planetary nebulae populations in galaxies within
10-15 Mpc distance has a cut-off at bright magnitudes and a functional form
that is observed to be invariant in different galaxy morphological types. Thus
it is used as a secondary distance indicator in both early and late-type
galaxies. Recent deep surveys of planetary nebulae populations in brightest
cluster galaxies (BCGs) seem to indicate that their luminosity functions
deviate from those observed in the nearby galaxies. We discuss the evidence for
such deviations in Virgo, and indicate which physical mechanisms may alter the
evolution of a planetary nebula envelope and its central star in the halo of
BCGs. We then discuss preliminary results for distances for the Virgo, Hydra I
and Coma clusters based on the observed planetary nebulae luminosity functions.
