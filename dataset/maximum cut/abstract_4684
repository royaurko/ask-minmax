We consider the evolution of primordial black holes in a generalyzed
Jordan-Brans-Dicke cosmological model where both the Brans-Dicke scalar field
and its coupling to gravity are dynamical functions determined from the
evolution equations. The evaporation rate for the black holes changes compared
to that in standard cosmology. We show that accretion of radiation can proceed
effectively in the radiation dominated era. The black hole lifetime shortens
for low initial mass, but increases for high initial mass, and is thus
considerably modified compared to the case of standard cosmology. We derive a
cut-off value for the initial black hole mass, below which primordial black
holes evaporate out in the radiation dominated era, and above which they
survive beyond the present era.
