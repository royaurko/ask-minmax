A detailed investigation by one-step photoemission calculations of the
GaN(0001)-(1x1) surface in comparison with recent experiments is presented in
order to clarify its structural properties and electronic structure. The
discussion of normal and off-normal spectra reveals through the identified
surface states clear fingerprints for the applicability of a surface model
proposed by Smith et al. Especially the predicted metallic bonds are confirmed.
In the context of direct transitions the calculated spectra allow to determine
the valence band width and to argue in favor of one of two theoretical bulk
band structures. Furthermore a commonly used experimental method to fix the
valence band maximum is critically tested.
