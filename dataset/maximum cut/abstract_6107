We measure the statistical distribution of the local density of optical
states (LDOS) on disordered semi-continuous metal films. We show that LDOS
fluctuations exhibit a maximum in a regime where fractal clusters dominate the
film surface. These large fluctuations are a signature of surface-plasmon
localization on the nanometer scale.
