An iterative method is derived for image reconstruction. Among other
attributes, this method allows constraints unrelated to the radiation
measurements to be incorporated into the reconstructed image. A comparison is
made with the widely used Maximum-Likelihood Expectation-Maximization (MLEM)
algorithm.
