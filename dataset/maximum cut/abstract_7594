We report on our results of D3-brane probing a large class of generalised
type IIB supergravity solutions presented very recently in the literature. The
structure of the solutions is controlled by a single non-linear differential
equation. These solutions correspond to renormalisation group flows from pure
N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory to an N=2 gauge theory with a massive adjoint
scalar. The gauge group is SU(n) with n large. After presenting the general
result, we focus on one of the new solutions, solving for the specific
coordinates needed to display the explicit metric on the moduli space. We
obtain an appropriately holomorphic result for the coupling. We look for the
singular locus, and interestingly, the final result again manifests itself in
terms of a square root branch cut on the complex plane, as previously found for
a set of solutions for which the details are very different. This, together
with the existence of the single simple non-linear differential equation, is
further evidence in support of an earlier suggestion that there is a very
simple model --perhaps a matrix model with relation to the Calogero-Moser
integrable system-- underlying this gauge theory physics.
