A feasibility to use the hadronic decay mode of $Z$ for the model independant
measurement of the total cross section of Higgs-strahlung process
$(\sigma_{Zh})$ at a future $e^+e^-$ collider was studied. For the recoil mass
measurement from hadronic decay of $Z$, a simple cut based analysis was applied
on samples produced by the ILD full detector simulation at $\sqrt{s}=350$ GeV
and 500 GeV using the ILC beam parameters. At $350$ GeV, a bump in the recoil
mass distribution was reconstructed, and $\Delta\sigma_{Zh}/\sigma_{Zh}$ = 3.4%
was obtained assuming 165 fb$^{-1}$ data with $e^-(e^+)$ beam polarization of
-80%(+30%) and +80%(-30%), respectively. At $500$ GeV, clear Higgs boson peak
in the recoil mass distribution was not seen, however, from the excess of the
events, $\Delta\sigma_{Zh}/\sigma_{Zh}=3.9%$ was obtained assuming 500
fb$^{-1}$ data with $e^-(e^+)$ beam polarization of -80%(+30%).
