We study the spectrum of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) in energy range
$\sim$5-100 keV. Early in 2006 the INTEGRAL observatory performed a series of
four 30ksec observations with the Earth disk crossing the field of view of the
instruments. The modulation of the aperture flux due to occultation of
extragalactic objects by the Earth disk was used to obtain the spectrum of the
Cosmic X-ray Background(CXB). Various sources of contamination were evaluated,
including compact sources, Galactic Ridge emission, CXB reflection by the Earth
atmosphere, cosmic ray induced emission by the Earth atmosphere and the Earth
auroral emission. The spectrum of the cosmic X-ray background in the energy
band 5-100 keV is obtained. The shape of the spectrum is consistent with that
obtained previously by the HEAO-1 observatory, while the normalization is
$\sim$10% higher. This difference in normalization can (at least partly) be
traced to the different assumptions on the absolute flux from the Crab Nebulae.
  The increase relative to the earlier adopted value of the absolute flux of
the CXB near the energy of maximum luminosity (20-50 keV) has direct
implications for the energy release of supermassive black holes in the Universe
and their growth at the epoch of the CXB origin.
