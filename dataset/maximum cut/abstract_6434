The temperature dependence of the magnetic specific heat has been studied
experimentally and theoretically in the semimagnetic semiconductor
Pb_{1-x}Eu_{x}Te for x=0.027 and x=0.073, over the temperature range from 0.5 K
to 10 K, in magnetic fields up to 2 T. There was a maximum in the magnetic
specific heat between 1 and 3 K even in zero and low magnetic fields; this
maximum shifted toward higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field. The
experimental data have been analyzed in the framework of a model in which we
assume that the ground states of europium ions are split even without an
external magnetic field. We present arguments which support this assumption and
we show that it is possible to find a physical mechanism leading to the
splitting which can explain the experimental results.
