Our probabilistic analysis sheds light to the following questions: Why do
random polynomials seem to have few, and well separated real roots, on the
average? Why do exact algorithms for real root isolation may perform
comparatively well or even better than numerical ones? We exploit results by
Kac, and by Edelman and Kostlan in order to estimate the real root separation
of degree $d$ polynomials with i.i.d.\ coefficients that follow two zero-mean
normal distributions: for SO(2) polynomials, the $i$-th coefficient has
variance ${d \choose i}$, whereas for Weyl polynomials its variance is
${1/i!}$. By applying results from statistical physics, we obtain the expected
(bit) complexity of \func{sturm} solver, $\sOB(r d^2 \tau)$, where $r$ is the
number of real roots and $\tau$ the maximum coefficient bitsize. Our bounds are
two orders of magnitude tighter than the record worst case ones. We also derive
an output-sensitive bound in the worst case. The second part of the paper shows
that the expected number of real roots of a degree $d$ polynomial in the
Bernstein basis is $\sqrt{2d}\pm\OO(1)$, when the coefficients are i.i.d.\
variables with moderate standard deviation. Our paper concludes with
experimental results which corroborate our analysis.
