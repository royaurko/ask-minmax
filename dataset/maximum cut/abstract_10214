It is said that the finding of the maximum oscillation in neutrino
oscillation by Super-Kamiokande is one of the major achievements of the SK. In
present paper, we examine the assumption made by Super-Kamiokande Collaboration
that the direction of the incident neutrino is approximately the same as that
of the produced lepton, which is the cornerstone in their L/E analysis and we
find this approximation does not hold even approximately. In the Part 2 of the
subsequent paper, we apply the results from Figures 12, 13 and 14 to L/E
analysis and conclude that one cannot obtain the maximum oscillation in L/E
analysis which shows strongly the oscillation pattern from the neutrino
oscillation.
