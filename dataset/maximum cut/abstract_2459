We explore how the polarization of the tau leptons in the cascade decay
$\tilde{q}\to q\tilde\chi^0_2\to q\tau\tilde\tau\to q\tau\tau\tilde\chi^0_1$
can be exploited to study mixing properties of neutralinos and staus. We
present details of the analysis including experimental effects such as
transverse momentum cuts for the $\tau\to\pi\nu$ decay mode, and show that the
di-pion invariant mass distribution provides valuable information on their
properties.
