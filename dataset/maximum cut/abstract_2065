We present a method that allows for the discovery of communities within
graphs of arbitrary size in times that scale linearly with their size. This
method avoids edge cutting and is based on notions of voltage drops across
networks that are both intuitive and easy to solve regardless of the complexity
of the graph involved. We additionally show how this algorithm allows for the
swift discovery of the community surrounding a given node without having to
extract all the communities out of a graph.
