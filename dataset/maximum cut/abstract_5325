We investigate surface waves at the boundary between a semi-infinite layered
metal-dielectric nanostructure cut normally to the layers and a semi-infinite
dielectric. Spatial dispersion properties of such a nanostructure can be
dramatically affected by coupling of surface plasmons polaritons at different
metal-dielectric interfaces. As a consequence, the effective medium approach is
not applicable in general. It is demonstrated that Dyakonov-like surface waves
with hybrid polarization can propagate in an angular range substantially
enlarged compared to conventional birefringent materials. Our numerical
simulations for an Ag-GaAs stack in contact with glass show a low to moderate
influence of losses.
