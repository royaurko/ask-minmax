We study the nonlocal spin transport in a lateral spin valve with multiple
ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes. When two current-injecting and two spin
current-detecting electrodes are all ferromagnetic, the number of possible
nonlocal spin signal states is four at maximum. In reality, this number is
reduced, depending on the inter-probe distance and the relative magnitudes of
the spin resistances. Our theoretical results are in agreement with recent
experiments of spin injection into an Al island, a carbon nanotube, and
graphene.
