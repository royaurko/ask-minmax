We generalize the usual exponential Boltzmann factor to any reasonable and
potentially observable distribution function, $B(E)$. By defining generalized
logarithms $\Lambda$ as inverses of these distribution functions, we are led to
a generalization of the classical Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, $S_{BG}= -\int d
\epsilon \omega(\epsilon) B(\epsilon) \log B(\epsilon)$ to the expression
$S\equiv -\int d \epsilon \omega(\epsilon) \int_0^{B(\epsilon)} dx \Lambda
(x)$, which contains the classical entropy as a special case. We demonstrate
that this entropy has two important features: First, it describes the correct
thermodynamic relations of the system, and second, the observed distributions
are straight forward solutions to the Jaynes maximum entropy principle with the
ordinary (not escort!) constraints. Tsallis entropy is recovered as a further
special case.
