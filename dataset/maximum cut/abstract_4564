A new method for approximating Skyrme solutions is developed. It consists of
cutting sections out of the Skyrme crystal and smoothly interpolating between
the boundary and spatial infinity. Several field configurations are
constructed, and their energies calculated. The surface energy (per unit area)
of an infinite flat plane of the crystal is also calculated, and the result
used to derive a formula analogous to the semi-empirical mass formula of
nuclear physics. This formula can be used to give some idea of what the Skyrme
model predicts about volume and surface energies of the nucleus over a broad
range of baryon numbers.
