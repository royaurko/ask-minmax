We present $Z_3$ orbifold compactifications of $E_8\times E_8^\prime$
heterotic string with three Wilson lines, resulting to the maximum number of
SU(3) factors. Here, all the matter spectrums are in the SU(3) trits($\equiv $
three representations ${\bf 3,\bar 3,1}$) of the $SU(3)^8$ GUT. Using this
information, we show how three family supersymmetric standard models(SSM) can
be obtained. Also, the low lying interesting representations(fundamental and
adjoint) of $E_6$ and $E_8$ are given in terms of trits, establishing simple
criteria for treating these low lying representations of exceptional groups.
