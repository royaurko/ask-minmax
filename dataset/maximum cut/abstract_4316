We discuss forward-backward charge asymmetries for lepton pair production in
association with a large transverse momentum jet at hadron colliders. The
measurement of the lepton charge asymmetry relative to the jet direction
A_{FB}^j gives a new determination of the effective weak mixing angle
sin^2{\theta_{eff}^{lept}(M_Z^2)} with in principle a statistical precision
after cuts of \sim 10^{-3} (8 x 10^{-3}) at LHC (Tevatron), due to the large
cross section of the process with initial gluons. The identification of b jets
also allows for the measurement of the bottom quark Z asymmetry A_{FB}^b at
hadron colliders although with a lower precision than at LEP, the resulting
statistical precision for sin^2{\theta_{eff}^{lept}(M_Z^2)} being \sim 9 x
10^{-4} (2 x 10^{-2} at Tevatron).
