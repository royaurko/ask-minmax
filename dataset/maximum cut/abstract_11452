A scenario for a periodic filling and emptying of the accretion disc of the
microquasar GRS 1915+105 is proposed, by computing the mass transfer rate from
the evolving low mass red giant donor (Greiner at al. 2001) and comparing it
with the observed accretion rate onto the primary black hole. We propose a
duty-cycle with (5-10)(eta/0.1) per cent active ON-state where eta is the
efficiency of converting accretion into radiation. The duration of the
quiescent recurrent OFF-state is identified as the viscosity time scale at the
circularization radius and equals 370(alpha/0.001)^(-4/5) years, where alpha is
the viscosity parameter in the alpha-prescription of a classical disc. If the
viscosity at the outer edge of the disc is small and eta is close to the
maximum available potential energy (per rest mass energy) at the innermost
stable orbit, the present active phase may last another 10 - 20 years.
