A maximum stable set in a graph G is a stable set of maximum cardinality. S
is a local maximum stable set of G, if S is a maximum stable set of the
subgraph induced by its closed neighborhood.
  Nemhauser and Trotter Jr. proved in 1975 that any local maximum stable set is
a subset of a maximum stable set of G. In 2002 we showed that the family of all
local maximum stable sets of a forest forms a greedoid on its vertex set. The
cases where G is bipartite, triangle-free, well-covered, while the family of
all local maximum stable sets is a greedoid, were analyzed in 2004, 2007, and
2008, respectively.
  In this paper we demonstrate that if the family of all local maximum stable
sets of the graph satisfies the accessibility property, then it is an interval
greedoid. We also characterize those graphs whose families of local maximum
stable sets are either antimatroids or matroids.
