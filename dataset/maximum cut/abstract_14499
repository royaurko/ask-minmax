We propose theoretically a method for the control of the frequency of the
nonlinear optical response of a model nonlinear medium driven by an electric
field and suggest an experimental realization on the basis of isotropic LiF, or
NaCl crystals and pulsed Nd glass laser. The theoretical background of the
proposed optical control is the nonlinear resonance and the resonance
overlapping which is typical for nonlinear systems. It is shown that by a
proper choice of the parameters of the applied pulses a diffusive growth of the
oscillation amplitude can be achieved resulting in a controlled switching of
the system's frequency. The maximum frequency of the nonlinear response is
identified to be proportional to the intensity of the applied noise. An
experimental suggestion for particular materials is proposed.
