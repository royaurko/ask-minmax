We study the potential of LEP II to unravel the existence of invisibly
decaying Higgs bosons, predicted in a wide class of models. We perform a model
independent analysis, focusing our attention to the final state topologies
exhibiting $b \bar{b}$ or $\ell^+ \ell^-$ ($\ell=\mu$ or $e$) pairs and missing
energy. We carefully evaluate the signals and backgrounds, choosing appropriate
cuts to enhance the discovery limits. Our results demonstrate that LEP II is
capable of discovering such a Higgs boson for a wide range of masses and
couplings.
