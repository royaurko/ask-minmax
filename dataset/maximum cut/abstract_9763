Let (M,g) be asmooth, compact Riemannian manifold with smooth boundary, with
n= dim M= 2,3. We suppose the boundary of M to be a smooth submanifold of M
with dimension n-1. We consider a singularly perturbed nonlinear system, namely
Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Proca system, or Klein-Gordon-Maxwell system of
Scrhoedinger-Maxwell system on M. We prove that the number of low energy
solutions, when the perturbation parameter is small, depends on the topological
properties of the boundary of M, by means of the Lusternik Schnirelmann
category. Also, these solutions have a unique maximum point that lies on the
boundary.
