The dimension-four genuine anomalous quartic couplings are studied in
processes of six-fermion production via e+e- collisions. Complete tree-level
electroweak calculations are performed including initial-state-radiation and
beamstrahlung. The analysis of final-state distributions can be used to find
kinematical cuts to enhance the effects of anomalous couplings. For the
parameters of the custodial-symmetry-conserving anomalous couplings a
sensitivity in the range between 10^{-3} and 10^{-2} can be expected at 1 TeV.
