The empirical, possible small variation downward by about 10^-5, of the ratio
of the proton mass to the electron mass, over a characteristic time interval
estimated here to be about a billion years, is related to the decrease with
time of a small, effective vacuum expectation value for a Goldstone-like
pseudoscalar field which is present in the early universe, and is related to
the scalar inflaton field. The same vacuum expectation value controls the
magnitude of a very small, residual vacuum energy density today, which has also
slowly decreased. The present time variation is estimated to be near to a
definite limit, that is asymptotically approached as t->oo.
