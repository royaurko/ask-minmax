We consider a differential method of maximum entropy that is based on the
linearity of Fourier transform and involves reconstruction of images from the
differences of the visibility function. The efficiency of the method is
demonstrated with respect to the recovery of source images with bright
components against the background of a sufficiently weak extended base. The
simulation results are given along with the maps of an extragalactic radio
source 0059+581, which were obtained using the standard and differential
methods of maximum entropy for three observation dates and show that the
principle of differential mapping allows us to increase considerably the
dynamic interval of images.
