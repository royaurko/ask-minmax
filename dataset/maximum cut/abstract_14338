It is shown that thermally excited plasmon-polariton modes can strongly
mediate, enhance and \emph{tune} the near-field radiation transfer between two
closely separated graphene sheets. The dependence of near-field heat exchange
on doping and electron relaxation time is analyzed in the near infra-red within
the framework of fluctuational electrodynamics. The dominant contribution to
heat transfer can be controlled to arise from either interband or intraband
processes. We predict maximum transfer at low doping and for plasmons in two
graphene sheets in resonance, with orders-of-magnitude enhancement (e.g. $10^2$
to $10^3$ for separations between $0.1\mu m$ to $10nm$) over the
Stefan-Boltzmann law, known as the far field limit. Strong, tunable, near-field
transfer offers the promise of an externally controllable thermal switch as
well as a novel hybrid graphene-graphene thermoelectric/thermophotovoltaic
energy conversion platform.
