The present effort explores the influence of a longitudinal applied electric
field on the magnetocaloric properties of graphenes. The magnetic entropy
change $\Delta S(T,\Delta B,E)$ has two contributions: $S_{cos}(T,B,E)$ with an
oscillating character on $m$, inversely proportional to the magnetic field; and
$S_{per}(T,B,E)$ with a periodic character also on $m$. In comparison to the
case without electric field, the maximum value of the magnetic entropy change
either increases or decreases due to an applied electric field, depending on
the value of $m$; and, in addition, the temperature in which the maximum
entropy change occurs decreases due to the electric field.
