In this paper, we introduce the notion of a $(a,b)$-rectangle pattern on
permutations that not only generalizes the notion of successive elements
(bonds) in permutations, but is also related to mesh patterns introduced
recently by Br\"and\'en and Claesson. We call the $(k,k)$-rectangle pattern the
$k$-box pattern. To provide an enumeration result on the maximum number of
occurrences of the 1-box pattern, we establish an enumerative result on
pattern-avoiding signed permutations.
  Further, we extend the notion of $(k,\ell)$-rectangle patterns to words and
binary matrices, and provide distribution of $(1,\ell)$-rectangle patterns on
words; explicit formulas are given for up to 7 letter alphabets where $\ell \in
\{1,2\}$, while obtaining distributions for larger alphabets depends on
inverting a matrix we provide. We also provide similar results for the
distribution of bonds over words. As a corollary to our studies we confirm a
conjecture of Mathar on the number of "stable LEGO walls" of width 7 as well as
prove three conjectures due to Hardin and a conjecture due to Barker. We also
enumerate two sequences published by Hardin in the On-Line Encyclopedia of
Integer Sequences.
