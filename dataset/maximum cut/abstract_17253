We present results from the Radio Interferometric Planet (RIPL) search for
compan- ions to the nearby star GJ 896A. We present 11 observations over 4.9
years. Fitting astrometric parameters to the data reveals a residual with
peak-to-peak amplitude of ~ 3 mas in right ascension. This residual is well-fit
by an acceleration term of 0.458 \pm 0.032 mas/y^2. The parallax is fit to an
accuracy of 0.2 mas and the proper motion terms are fit to accuracies of 0.01
mas/y. After fitting astrometric and acceleration terms residuals are 0.26 mas
in each coordinate, demonstrating that stellar jitter does not limit the
ability to carry out radio astrometric planet detection and characterization.
The acceleration term originates in part from the companion GJ 896B but the
amplitude of the acceleration in declination is not accurately predicted by the
orbital model. The acceleration sets a mass upper limit of 0.15 MJ at a
semi-major axis of 2 AU for a planetary companion to GJ 896A. For semi-major
axes between 0.3 and 2 AU upper limits are determined by the maximum angular
separation; the upper limits scale from the minimum value in proportion to the
inverse of the radius. Upper limits at larger radii are set by the acceleration
and scale as the radius squared. An improved solution for the stellar binary
system could improve the exoplanet mass sensitivity by an order of magnitude.
