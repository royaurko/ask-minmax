We prove that if $G$ is a graph with an minimal edge cut $F$ of size three
and $G_1$, $G_2$ are the two (augmented) components of $G-F$, then the crossing
number of $G$ is equal to the sum of crossing numbers of $G_1$ and $G_2$.
Combining with known results, this implies that crossing number is additive
over edge-cuts of size $d$ for $d\in\{0, 1, 2, 3\}$, whereas there are
counterexamples for every $d\ge 4$. The techniques generalize to show that
minor crossing number is additive over edge cuts of arbitrary size, as well as
to provide bounds for crossing number additivity in arbitrary surfaces. We
point out several applications to exact crossing number computation and
crossing critical graphs, as well as provide a very general lower bound for the
minor crossing number of the Cartesian product of an arbitrary graph with a
tree.
