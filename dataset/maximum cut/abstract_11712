The half filled Hubbard model is studied in the pair approximation of the
Cluster Variation Method. The use of the $SO(4)$ symmetry of the model makes
possible to give a complete analytical characterization of the ground state, by
means of explicit expressions for the double occupancy and the nearest neighbor
correlation functions. The finite temperature analysis is reduced to the
numerical solution of only two coupled transcendental equations. The behavior
of local magnetic moment, specific heat and correlation functions is given for
some typical cases in one and two dimensions. We obtain good qualitative
agreement with exact and numerical results in one dimension. The results for
finite temperatures show a rapid evolution, with increasing temperature, from a
strongly antiferromagnetic behavior to a disordered one; in the high
temperature region a maximum (which has been related to a "gradual"
metal--insulator transition) is found in the specific heat for very large
values of the Coulomb repulsion.
