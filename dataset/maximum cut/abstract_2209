We present a new parton model approach for nuclear collisions at RHIC
energies (and beyond). It is a selfconsistent treatment, using the same
formalism for calculating cross sections like the total and the inelastic one
and, on the other hand, particle production. Actually, the latter one is based
on an expression for the total cross section, expanded in terms of cut Feynman
diagrams. Dominant diagrams are assumed to be composed of parton ladders
between any pair of nucleons, with ordered virtualities from both ends of the
ladder.
