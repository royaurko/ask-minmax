The Maximum Entropy Modeling Toolkit supports parameter estimation and
prediction for statistical language models in the maximum entropy framework.
The maximum entropy framework provides a constructive method for obtaining the
unique conditional distribution p*(y|x) that satisfies a set of linear
constraints and maximizes the conditional entropy H(p|f) with respect to the
empirical distribution f(x). The maximum entropy distribution p*(y|x) also has
a unique parametric representation in the class of exponential models, as
m(y|x) = r(y|x)/Z(x) where the numerator m(y|x) = prod_i alpha_i^g_i(x,y) is a
product of exponential weights, with alpha_i = exp(lambda_i), and the
denominator Z(x) = sum_y r(y|x) is required to satisfy the axioms of
probability.
  This manual explains how to build maximum entropy models for discrete domains
with the Maximum Entropy Modeling Toolkit (MEMT). First we summarize the steps
necessary to implement a language model using the toolkit. Next we discuss the
executables provided by the toolkit and explain the file formats required by
the toolkit. Finally, we review the maximum entropy framework and apply it to
the problem of statistical language modeling.
