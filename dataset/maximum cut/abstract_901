d'Alembert's principle describes the balance between two opposing forces.
Directly applied forces change a system with respect to a fixed frame of
reference. Inertial forces alter the frame of reference so that a system
appears to be unchanged. In addition, the forces of constraint limit the
possible changes that the system may follow. I show that the direct forces move
a system along a path that maximizes the gain in entropy. That maximum entropy
production principle can only be understood in the context of d'Alembert's
special separation between direct, inertial, and constraining forces. The
maximum entropy production principle unifies aspects of mechanics,
thermodynamics, natural selection, statistical inference, and probability
theory. Although maximum entropy production is a general principle, a purely
geometric interpretation provides a more fundamental and universal perspective
than does entropy. In particular, the conservation of total probability imposes
strong geometric symmetry and constraint on d'Alembert's separation of direct
and inertial forces. Maximum entropy production is a useful but sometimes
unnatural way of expressing those fundamental geometric principles. I also show
that maximum entropy production and maximum gain in Fisher information are
equivalent ways of describing the underlying geometric principles.
