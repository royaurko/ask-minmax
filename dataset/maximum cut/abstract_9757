We consider two transceivers, the first with perfect clock and the second
with imperfect clock. We investigate the joint estimation of the delay between
the transceivers and the offset and the drift of the imperfect clock. We
propose a protocol for the synchronization of the clocks. We derive some
empirical estimators for the delay, the offset and the drift, and compute the
Cramer-Rao lower bounds and the joint maximum likelihood estimator of the delay
and the drift. We study the impact of the protocol parameters and the
time-of-arrival estimation variance on the achieved performances. We validate
some theoretical results by simulation.
