We investigate the cosmological perturbation dynamics for a universe
consisting of pressureless baryonic matter and a viscous fluid, the latter
representing a unified model of the dark sector. In the homogeneous and
isotropic background the \textit{total} energy density of this mixture behaves
as a generalized Chaplygin gas. The perturbations of this energy density are
intrinsically non-adiabatic and source relative entropy perturbations. The
resulting baryonic matter power spectrum is shown to be compatible with the
2dFGRS and SDSS (DR7) data. A joint statistical analysis, using also
Hubble-function and supernovae Ia data, shows that, different from other
studies, there exists a maximum in the probability distribution for a negative
present value $q_0 \approx - 0.53$ of the deceleration parameter. Moreover,
while previous descriptions on the basis of generalized Chaplygin gas models
were incompatible with the matter power spectrum data since they required a
much too large amount of pressureless matter, the unified model presented here
favors a matter content that is of the order of the baryonic matter abundance
suggested by big-bang nucleosynthesis.
