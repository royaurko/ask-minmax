We evaluate the prospects for detecting a non-standard light Higgs boson with
a significant branching ratio to two photons, in Run II of the Fermilab
Tevatron. We derive the reach for several channels: $2\gamma$ inclusive,
$2\gamma+1$ jet and $2\gamma+2$ jets. We present the expected Run II limits on
the branching ratio of $h\to\gamma\gamma$ as a function of the Higgs mass, for
the case of ``bosonic'', as well as ``topcolor'' Higgs bosons.
