The recent observations of the massive pulsars PSR J1614-2230 and of PSR
J0348+0432 with about two solar masses implies strong constraints on the
properties of dense matter in the core of compact stars. Effective models of
QCD aiming to describe neutron star matter can thereby be considerably
constrained. In this context, a chiral quark-meson model based on a SU(3)
linear $\sigma$-model with a vacuum pressure and vector meson exchange is
discussed in this work. The impact of its various terms and parameters on the
equation of state and the maximum mass of compact stars are delineated to check
whether pure quark stars with two solar masses are feasible within this
approach. Large vector meson coupling constant and a small vacuum pressure
allow for maximum masses of two or more solar masses. However, pure quark stars
made of absolutely stable strange quark matter, so called strange stars, turn
out to be restricted to a quite small parameter range.
