We consider the two-nucleon system at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order
(N^3LO) in chiral effective field theory. The two-nucleon potential at N^3LO
consists of one-, two- and three-pion exchanges and a set of contact
interactions with zero, two and four derivatives. In addition, one has to take
into account various isospin-breaking and relativistic corrections. We employ
spectral function regularization for the multi-pion exchanges. Within this
framework, it is shown that the three-pion exchange contribution is negligibly
small. The low-energy constants (LECs) related to pion-nucleon vertices are
taken consistently from studies of pion-nucleon scattering in chiral
perturbation theory. The total of 26 four-nucleon LECs has been determined by a
combined fit to some np and pp phase shifts from the Nijmegen analysis together
with the nn scattering length. The description of nucleon-nucleon scattering
and the deuteron observables at N^3LO is improved compared to the one at NLO
and NNLO. The theoretical uncertainties in observables are estimated based on
the variation of the cut-offs in the spectral function representation of the
potential and in the regulator utilized in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation.
