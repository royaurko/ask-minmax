This paper shows how maximum possible configuration efficiency of an
indefinitely large software system is constrained by chosing a fixed upper
limit to the number of program units per subsystem. It is then shown how the
configuration efficiency of an indefinitely large software system depends on
the ratio of the total number of informaiton hiding violational software units
divided by the total number of program units.
