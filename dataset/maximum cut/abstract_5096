We present updated predictions on the inclusive total cross sections,
including the complete next-to-leading order QCD corrections, for the graviton
and photon associated production process in the large extra dimensions model at
the LHC with a center-of-mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV, using the parameters
according to the requirements of the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations. Moreover, we
also discuss in detail the dependence on the transverse momentum cut and
uncertainties due to the choices of scales and parton distribution functions.
