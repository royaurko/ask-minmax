We propose a simple model for superconductors endowed with two critical
temperatures, corresponding to two second-order phase transitions, in the
framework of the Ginzburg-Landau mean-field theory. For very large Cooper pair
self-interaction, in addition to the standard condensation occurring in the
Ginzburg-Landau theory, we find another phase transition at a lower temperature
with a maximum difference of 15% between the two critical temperatures.
