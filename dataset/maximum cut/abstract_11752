The c-axis Josephson plasmon in optimally doped single-layer and bi-layer
high Tc cuprates Tl2201 and Tl2212 have been investigated using infrared
spectroscopy. We observed the plasma frequencies for these two compounds at
27.8 and 25.6 cm-1 respectively, which we interpret as a Josephson resonance
across the TlO blocking layers. No maximum in the temperature dependence of the
c-axis conductivity was observed below Tc, indicating that even in the
superconducting state a coherent quasi-particle contribution to the c-axis
conductivity is absent or very weak, in contrast to the behaviour of the
ab-plane conductivity.
