This report presents the preliminary result for the prompt photon production
cross section in proton-proton collisions in the mid-rapidity region using the
PHENIX detector. The NLO pQCD calculation is in good agreement with the data.
The measurement was made with and without an isolation cut. The isolation cut
significantly improves the signal purity without reducing the signal yield.
This is an important step for the future spin asymmetry measurement.
