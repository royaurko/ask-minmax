We present the development and application of a generic analysis scheme for
the measurement of neutrino spectra with the IceCube detector. This scheme is
based on regularized unfolding, preceded by an event selection which uses a
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance algorithm to select the relevant variables
and a Random Forest for the classification of events. The analysis has been
developed using IceCube data from the 59-string configuration of the detector.
27,771 neutrino candidates were detected in 346 days of livetime. A rejection
of 99.9999% of the atmospheric muon background is achieved. The energy spectrum
of the atmospheric neutrino flux is obtained using the TRUEE unfolding program.
The unfolded spectrum of atmospheric muon neutrinos covers an energy range from
100 GeV to 1 PeV. Compared to the previous measurement using the detector in
the 40-string configuration, the analysis presented here, extends the upper end
of the atmospheric neutrino spectrum by more than a factor of two, reaching an
energy region that has not been previously accessed by spectral measurements.
