It is supposed that the exponential multiplier in the method of the
non-equilibrium statistical operator (Zubarev`s approach) can be considered as
a distribution density of the past lifetime of the system, and can be replaced
by an arbitrary distribution function. To specify this distribution the method
of maximum entropy principle as in [Sch\"onfeldt J-H, Jiminez N, Plastino A R,
Plastino A, Casas M 2007 \textit{Physica A} \textbf{374} 573] is used. The
obtained distribution is close to exponential one. Another approach to the
maximum entropy principle, as in [Van der Straeten E and Beck C 2008 Phys. Rev.
E \textbf{78} 051101], except exponential distributions yields power-like,
log-normal distributions, as well as distributions of other kind and
transitions between them.
