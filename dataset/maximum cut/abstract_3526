We study the synchronization of totalistic one dimensional cellular automata
(CA). The CA with a non zero synchronization threshold exhibit complex non
periodic space time patterns and conversely. This synchronization transition is
related to directed percolation.
  We study also the maximum Lyapunov exponent for CA, defined in analogy with
continuous dynamical systems as the exponential rate of expansion of the linear
map induced by the evolution rule of CA, constructed with the aid of the
Boolean derivatives. The synchronization threshold is strongly correlated to
the maximum Lyapunov exponent and we propose approximate relations between
these quantities. The value of this threshold can be used to parametrize the
space time complexity of CA.
