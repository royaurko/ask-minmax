We show that generalized Penrose tilings can be obtained by the projection of
a cut plane of a 5-dimensional lattice into two dimensions, while 3-d
quasiperiodic lattices with overlapping unit cells are its projections into 3d.
The frequencies of all possible vertex types in the generalized Penrose
tilings, and the frequencies of all possible types of overlapping 3-d unit
cells are also given here. The generalized Penrose tilings are found to be
nonconvertable to kite and dart patterns, nor can they be described by the
overlapping decagons of Gummelt.
