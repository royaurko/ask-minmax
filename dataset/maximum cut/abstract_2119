The surface tension at the deconfinement transition of SU(3) is determined
with a parametrized version of the fixed point action of a renormalization
group transformation on lattices with temporal extent $N_\tau=3$ and 4 and
spatial extent $N_\sigma/N_\tau=3$ and 4. A considerable cut-off dependence can
be seen in comparison with earlier determinations from tree level Symanzik and
tadpole improved actions.
