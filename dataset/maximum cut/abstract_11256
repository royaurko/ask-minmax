We present deep, pointed $^{12}$CO($J=2-1$) observations of three late-type
LSB galaxies. The beam-size was small enough that we could probe different
environments (\HI maximum, \HI mininum, star forming region) in these galaxies.
No CO was found at any of the positions observed. We argue that the implied
lack of molecular gas is real and not caused by conversion factor effects. The
virtual absence of a molecular phase may explain the very low star formation
rates in these galaxies.
