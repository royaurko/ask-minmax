We present a theoretical study of superconductivity of polarons in the
Hubbard-Holstein model. A residual kinematic interaction proportional to the
square of the polaron hopping energy between polarons and phonons provides a
pairing field for the polarons. We find that superconducting instability in the
d-wave channel is possible with small transition temperatures which is maximum
in the large to small polaron cross-over region. An s-wave instability is found
to be not possible when the effective on-site interaction between polarons is
repulsive.
