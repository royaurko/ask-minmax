We study the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of different traffic
models for kinesin which are relevant in biological and experimental contexts.
We find that motor-motor interactions play a fundamental role by enhancing the
thermodynamic efficiency at maximum power of the motors, as compared to the
non-interacting system, in a wide range of biologically compatible scenarios.
We furthermore consider the case where the motor-motor interaction directly
affects the internal chemical cycle and investigate the effect on the system
dynamics and thermodynamics.
