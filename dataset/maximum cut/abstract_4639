In Quantum Information Processing by NMR one of the major challenges is
relaxation or decoherence. Often it is found that the equilibrium mixed state
of a spin system is not suitable as an initial state for computation and a
definite initial state is required to be prepared prior to the computation. As
these preferred initial states are non-equilibrium states, they are not
stationary and are destroyed with time as the spin system relaxes toward its
equilibrium, introducing error in computation. Since it is not possible to cut
off the relaxation processes completely, attempts are going on to develop
alternate strategies like Quantum Error Correction Codes or Noiseless
Subsystems. Here we study the relaxation behavior of various Pseudo Pure States
and analyze the role of Cross terms between different relaxation processes,
known as Cross-correlation. It is found that while cross-correlations
accelerate the relaxation of certain pseudo pure states, they retard that of
others.
