Soft computing approaches are mainly designed to address the real world
ill-defined, imprecisely formulated problems, combining different kind of novel
models of computation, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms (GAs.
Handwritten digit recognition is a typical example of one such problem. In the
current work we have developed a two-pass approach where the first pass
classifier performs a coarse classification, based on some global features of
the input pattern by restricting the possibility of classification decisions
within a group of classes, smaller than the number of classes considered
initially. In the second pass, the group specific classifiers concentrate on
the features extracted from the selected local regions, and refine the earlier
decision by combining the local and the global features for selecting the true
class of the input pattern from the group of candidate classes selected in the
first pass. To optimize the selection of local regions a GA based approach has
been developed here. The maximum recognition performance on Bangla digit
samples as achieved on the test set, during the first pass of the two pass
approach is 93.35%. After combining the results of the two stage classifiers,
an overall success rate of 95.25% is achieved.
