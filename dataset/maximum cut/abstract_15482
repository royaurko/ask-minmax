We examine all possible statistical pictures of violent conflicts over common
era history with a focus on dealing with incompleteness and unreliability of
data. We apply methods from extreme value theory on log-transformed data to
remove compact support, then, owing to the boundedness of maximum casualties,
retransform the data and derive expected means. We find the estimated mean
likely to be at least three times larger than the sample mean, meaning severe
underestimation of the severity of conflicts from naive observation. We check
for robustness by sampling between high and low estimates and jackknifing the
data. We study inter-arrival times between tail events and find (first-order)
memorylessless of events. The statistical pictures obtained are at variance
with the claims about "long peace".
