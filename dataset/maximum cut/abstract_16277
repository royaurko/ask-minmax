We compare the HI column densities from Ly-alpha absorption to the metal
column densities from X-ray absorption in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows.
Eight bursts of seventeen entering the sample, have significant extragalactic
X-ray absorptions. Of these we find a range in metallicities from sub-solar to
a few hundred times the solar value. There is a complete lack of correlation
between the X-ray and optical column densities. This, and the large range and
extreme values of these 'metallicities', suggest that the column densities
derived by one or both methods are not a reliable indication of the true total
column densities towards GRBs. Ionisation of the GRB's gas cloud to large
distances along the line of sight seems the most likely cause. From the lower
limit on the total column density and the UV luminosity of the GRBs, we derive
a maximum distance to the majority of the gas surrounding GRBs of ~3 pc,
suggesting that the gas probed by optical afterglow spectra is not the cloud in
which the burst occurs. This is an encouraging result for the use of GRB
optical afterglows as probes of the interstellar medium (ISM) in their host
galaxies, as the ISM observed is less likely to be strongly affected by the GRB
or its progenitor.
