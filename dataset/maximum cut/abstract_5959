It is shown that Tsallis' generalized statistics provides a natural frame for
the statistical-thermodynamical description of anomalous diffusion. Within this
generalized theory, a maximum-entropy formalism makes it possible to derive a
mathematical formulation for the mechanisms that underly Levy-like
superdiffusion, and for solving the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation.
