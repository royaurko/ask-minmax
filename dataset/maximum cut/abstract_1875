Application of the information-theoretic Maximum Caliber principle to the
microtrajectories of a two-state system shows that the determination of key
dynamical quantities can be mapped onto the evaluation of properties of the 1-D
Ising model. The strategy described here is equivalent to an earlier Maximum
Caliber formulation of the two-state problem, but reveals a different way of
imposing the constraints which determine the probability distribution of
allowed microtrajectories. The theoretical calculations of second moments,
covariances, and correlation times that are obtained from Maximum Caliber agree
well with simulated data of a particle diffusing on a double Gaussian surface,
as well as with recent experiments on a particle trapped by a dual-well optical
trap. The formalism reveals a new relationship between the average occupancy of
the two states of the system, the average number of transitions between the two
states that the system undergoes, Markov transition probabilities, and the
discretization time step. In addition, Maxwell-like relations imply how
measurements on one potential landscape can be used to make predictions about
the dynamics on a different potential landscape, independent of further
experiment.
