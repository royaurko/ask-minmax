We present multi-wavelength analysis of an eruption event that occurred in
Active Region (AR) NOAA 11093 on 7 August 2010, using data obtained from SDO,
STEREO, RHESSI and GONG H$\alpha$ network telescope. From these observations,
we inferred that upward slow rising motion of an inverse S-shaped filament
lying along the polarity inversion line (PIL) resulted in a CME subsequent to a
two-ribbon flare. Interaction of overlying field line across the filament with
side lobe field lines, associated EUV brightening, and flux
emergence/cancellation around the filament were the observational signatures of
the processes leading to its destabilization and the onset of eruption.
Moreover, the rising motion profile of filament/flux rope corresponded well
with flare characteristics, viz., the reconnection rate and HXR emission
profiles. Flux rope accelerated to the maximum velocities as a CME at the peak
phase of the flare, followed by deceleration to an average velocity of 590
kms$^{-1}$. We suggest that the observed emergence/cancellation of magnetic
fluxes near the filament caused it to rise, resulting in the tethers to cut and
reconnection to take place beneath the filament; in agreement with the tether
cutting model. The corresponding increase/decrease in positive/negative
photospheric fluxes found in the post-peak phase of the eruption provides
unambiguous evidence of reconnection as a consequence of tether cutting.
