We investigate the jet propagation and breakout from the stellar progenitor
for gamma-ray burst (GRB) collapsars by performing two-dimensional relativistic
hydrodynamic simulations and analytical modeling. We find that the jet opening
angle is given by $\theta_j \sim 1/5 \Gamma_{0}$, and infer the initial Lorentz
factor of the jet at the central engine, $\Gamma_0$, is a few for existing
observations of $\theta_j$. The jet keeps the Lorentz factor low inside the
star by converging cylindrically via collimation shocks under the cocoon
pressure, and accelerates at jet breakout before the free expansion to a
hollow-cone structure. In this new picture the GRB duration is determined by
the sound crossing time of the cocoon, after which the opening angle widens,
reducing the apparent luminosity. Some bursts violating the maximum opening
angle $\theta_{j,\max}\sim 1/5 \sim 12^{\circ}$ imply the existence of a
baryon-rich sheath or a long-acting jet. We can explain the slopes in both
Amati and Yonetoku spectral relations using an off-centered photosphere model,
if we make only one assumption that the total jet luminosity is proportional to
the initial Lorentz factor of the jet. We also numerically calibrate the
pre-breakout model (Bromberg et al.) for later use.
