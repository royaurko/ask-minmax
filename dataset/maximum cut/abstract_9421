Conformal Ricci collineations of static spherically symmetric spacetimes are
studied. The general form of the vector fields generating conformal Ricci
collineations is found when the Ricci tensor is non-degenerate, in which case
the number of independent conformal Ricci collineations is \emph{fifteen}; the
maximum number for 4-dimensional manifolds. In the degenerate case it is found
that the static spherically symmetric spacetimes always have an infinite number
of conformal Ricci collineations. Some examples are provided which admit
non-trivial conformal Ricci collineations, and perfect fluid source of the
matter.
