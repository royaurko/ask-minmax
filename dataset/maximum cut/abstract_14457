Additional experimental evidence is presented in support of the recent
hypothesis that a possible solar influence could explain fluctuations observed
in the measured decay rates of some isotopes. These data were obtained during
routine weekly calibrations of an instrument used for radiological safety at
The Ohio State University Research Reactor using Cl-36. The detector system
used was based on a Geiger-Mueller gas detector, which is a robust detector
system with very low susceptibility to environmental changes. A clear annual
variation is evident in the data, with a maximum relative count rate observed
in January/February, and a minimum relative count rate observed in July/August,
for seven successive years from July 2005 to June 2011. This annual variation
is not likely to have arisen from changes in the detector surroundings, as we
show here.
