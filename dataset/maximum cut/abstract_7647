Data from the DRIFT-IIa directional dark matter experiment are presented,
collected during a near continuous 6 month running period. A detailed
calibration analysis comparing data from gamma-ray, x-ray and neutron sources
to a GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations reveals an efficiency for detection of
neutron induced recoils of 94+/-2(stat.)+/-5(sys.)%. Software-based cuts,
designed to remove non-nuclear recoil events, are shown to reject 60Co
gamma-rays with a rejection factor of better than 8x10-6 for all energies above
threshold. An unexpected event population has been discovered and is shown here
to be due to the alpha-decay of 222Rn daughter nuclei that have attached to the
central cathode. A limit on the flux of neutrons in the Boulby Underground
Laboratory is derived from analysis of unshielded and shielded data.
