By partially substituting the tri-valence element La with di-valence element
Sr in $LaOFeAs$, we introduced holes into the system. For the first time, we
successfully synthesized the hole doped new superconductors
$(La_{1-x}Sr_x)OFeAs$. The maximum superconducting transition temperature at
about 25 K was observed at a doping level of x = 0.13. It is evidenced by Hall
effect measurements that the conduction in this type of material is dominated
by hole-like charge carriers, rather than electron-like ones. Together with the
data of the electron doped system $La(O_{1-x}F_x)FeAs$, a generic phase diagram
is depicted and is revealed to be similar to that of the cuprate
superconductors.
