We presented CAIXA, a Catalogue of AGN in the XMM-Newton Archive, in Bianchi
et al. (2009). It consists of all the radio-quiet X-ray unobscured
(N$_\mathrm{H}<2\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) observed
by XMM-Newton in targeted observations, whose data are public as of March 2007.
With its 156 sources, this is the largest catalogue of high signal-to-noise
X-ray spectra of AGN. All the EPIC pn spectra of the sources in CAIXA were
extracted homogeneously and a baseline model was applied in order to derive
their basic X-ray properties. These data are complemented by multiwavelength
data found in the literature: Black Hole masses, Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM)
of Hbeta, radio and optical fluxes. A systematic search for correlations
between the X-ray spectral properties and the multiwavelength data was
performed for the sources in CAIXA. We discuss here some of the significant
(>99.9 % confidence level) correlations.
