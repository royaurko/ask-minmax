Quantum entanglement cannot be unlimitedly shared among arbitrary number of
qubits. Larger the number of entangled pairs in an N-qubit system, smaller the
degree of bi-partite entanglement is. We analyze a system of N qubits in which
an arbitrary pair of particles is entangled. We show that the maximum degree of
entanglement (measured in the concurrence) between any pair of qubits is 2/N.
This tight bound can be achieved when the qubits are prepared in a pure
symmetric (with respect to permutations) state with just one qubit in the basis
state |0> and the others in the basis state |1>.
