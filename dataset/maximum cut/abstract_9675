We calibrate and then use the relation between equivalent width (EW) and
full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of metallic absorption lines in the spectra of
RR Lyrae stars to estimate a new upper limit of Vrot sini less than or equal to
6 km/s on their axial equatorial rotational velocities, and to derive the
variations of macroturbulent velocities in their atmospheres during pulsation
cycles. Finally, we present a simple way to estimate macroturbulent/rotational
velocity from FWHM of the cross-correlation function.
