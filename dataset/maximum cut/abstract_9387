Co-doping of lanthanum and phosphorus in CaFe2As2 induces superconductivity
at 45 K. This superconducting transition temperature is higher than the 38 K
transition in Ba1-xKxFe2As2, which is the maximum found thus far among the 122
phases. Superconductivity with a substantial shielding volume fraction was
observed at 0.12 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 0.18 and y = 0.06 in Ca1-xLaxFe2(As1-yPy)2.
The superconducting phase of the present system seems to be not adjacent to an
antiferromagnetic phase.
