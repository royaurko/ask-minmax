We present the initial results from our XMM program aimed at searching for
X-ray activity cycles in solar-type stars. HD 81809 is a G2-type star (somewhat
more evolved than the Sun, and with a less massive companion) with a pronounced
8.2 yr chromospheric cycle, as evident from from the Mt. Wilson program data.
We present here the results from the initial 2.5 years of XMM observations,
showing that large amplitude (a factor of approx. 10) modulation is present in
the X-ray luminosity, with a clearly defined maximum in mid 2002 and a steady
decrease since then. The maximum of the chromospheric cycle took place in 2001;
if the observed X-ray variability is the initial part of an X-ray cycle, this
could imply a phase shift between chromospheric and coronal activity, although
the current descent into chromospheric cycle minimum is well reflected into the
star's X-ray luminosity. The observations presented here provide clear evidence
for the presence of large amplitude X-ray variability coherent with the
activity cycle in the chromosphere in a star other than the Sun.
