We have established a new convergent scheme to treat analytically
nucleon-nucleon interactions from a chiral effective field theory. The
Kaplan-Savage-Wise (KSW) amplitudes are resummed to fulfill the unitarity or
right hand cut to all orders below pion production threshold. This is achieved
by matching order by order in the KSW power counting the general expression of
a partial wave with resummed unitarity cut, with the inverses of the KSW
amplitudes. As a result, a new convergent and systematic KSW expansion is
derived for an on-shell interacting kernel \cR in terms of which the partial
waves are computed. The agreement with data for the S-waves is fairly good up
to laboratory energies around 350 MeV and clearly improves and reestablishes
the phenomenological success of the KSW amplitudes when treated within this
scheme.
