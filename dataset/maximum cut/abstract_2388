We investigate the self-energy of one electron coupled to a quantized
radiation field by extending the ideas developed recently by C. Hainzl. We fix
an arbitrary cut-off parameter Lambda and recover the alpha^2-term of the
self-energy, where alpha is the coupling parameter representing the fine
structure constant. Thereby we develop a method which allows to expand the
self-energy up to any power of alpha. This implies that perturbation theory is
correct if Lambda is fix.
  As an immediate consequence we obtain enhanced binding for electrons.
