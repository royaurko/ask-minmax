We examine the r-process in the neutrino-driven proto-neutron-star (PNS) wind
of core-collapse supernovae in light of the recent findings of massive neutron
stars in binaries as well as of an indication of neutron-richness in the PNS
ejecta because of the nucleon potential corrections on neutrino opacities. To
this end, a spherically symmetric, general relativistic, steady-state wind
model is applied for a wide range of PNS masses between 1.2 M_sun and 2.4 M_sun
with the latter reaching the causality limit. Nucleosynthesis calculations with
these PNS models are performed by assuming a time evolution of electron
fraction with its minimal value of Y_e = 0.4, which mimics recent
hydrodynamical results. The fundamental nucleosynthetic aspect of the PNS wind
is found to be the production of Sr, Y and Zr in quasi-equilibrium and of the
elements with A = 90-110 by a weak r-process, which can be an explanation for
the abundance signatures in r-process-poor Galactic halo stars. PNSs more
massive than 2.0 M_sun can eject heavy r-process elements, however, with
substantially smaller amount than what is needed to account for the solar
content. PNS winds can be thus the major origin of light trans-iron elements
but no more than 10% of those heavier than A ~ 110, although they may be the
sources of the low-level abundances of Sr and Ba found in numerous metal-poor
stars if the maximum mass of PNS exceeds 2.0 M_sun.
