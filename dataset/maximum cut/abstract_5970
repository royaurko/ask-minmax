We have measured the pressure dependence of the supersolid fraction by a
torsional oscillator technique. Superflow is found from 25.6 bar up to 136.9
bar. The supersolid fraction in the low temperature limit increases from 0.6 %
at 25.6 bar near the melting boundary up to a maximum of 1.5% near 55 bar
before showing a monotonic decrease with pressure extrapolating to zero near
170 bar.
