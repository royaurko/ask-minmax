Using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, we calculate the phase diagram for a
square shoulder-square well potential in two dimensions that has been
previously shown to exhibit liquid anomalies consistent with a metastable
liquid-liquid critical point. We consider the liquid, gas and five crystal
phases, and find that all the melting lines are first order, despite a small
range of metastability. One melting line exhibits a temperature maximum, as
well as a pressure maximum that implies inverse melting over a small range in
pressure.
