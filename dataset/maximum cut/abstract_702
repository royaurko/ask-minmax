Techni-fermions are added as stacks of D7-anti-D7 techni-branes within the
framework of a holographic technicolor model that has been proposed as a
realization of walking technicolor. The stability of the embedding of these
branes is determined. When a sufficiently low bulk cut-off is provided the
fluctuations remain small. For a longer walking region, as would be required in
any realistic model of electroweak symmetry breaking, a larger bulk cut-off is
needed and in this case the oscillations destabilize.
