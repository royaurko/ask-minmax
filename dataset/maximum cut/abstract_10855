We have measured the rest-frame B,V, and I-band light curves of a
high-redshift type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 1999Q (z=0.46), using HST and
ground-based near-infrared detectors.
  A goal of this study is the measurement of the color excess, E_{B-I}, which
is a sensitive indicator of interstellar or intergalactic dust which could
affect recent cosmological measurements from high-redshift SNe Ia. Our
observations disfavor a 30% opacity of SN Ia visual light by dust as an
alternative to an accelerating Universe. This statement applies to both
Galactic-type dust
 (rejected at the 3.4 sigma confidence level) and greyer dust (grain size > 0.1
microns; rejected at the 2.3 to 2.6 sigma confidence level) as proposed by
Aguirre (1999). The rest-frame $I$-band light cur ve shows the secondary
maximum a month after B maximum typical of nearby SNe Ia of normal luminosi ty,
providing no indication of evolution as a function of redshift out to z~0.5. A
n expanded set of similar observations could improve the constraints on any
contribution of extragalactic dust to the dimming of high-redshift SNe Ia.
