Scales engagement can contribute significantly to nonlinear bending behavior
of elastic substrates with rigid biomimetic scales. In this letter, we
investigate the role of friction in modulating the nonlinearity that arises due
to self-contact of scales through an analytical investigation. We model the
friction as dry Coulomb type friction between rigid links and the substrate is
taken to be linear elastic. Our results reveal that frictional effects give
rise to two possible locking mechanisms, namely static friction lock and
kinetic friction lock. These locks arise due to a combination of interfacial
behavior and geometry. In addition to these extremes, the frictional behavior
is found to increase stiffness of the structure. This dual nature of friction
which influences both system operation and its terminal limit results in the
maximum relative frictional work to lie at intermediate friction coefficients
and not at the extremes of frictional limits.
