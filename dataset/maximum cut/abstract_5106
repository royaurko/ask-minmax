We present evidence for a new class of strongly coupled N = 1 superconformal
field theories (SCFTs) motivated by F-theory GUT constructions. These SCFTs
arise from D3-brane probes of tilted seven-branes which undergo monodromy. In
the probe theory, this tilting corresponds to an N = 1 deformation of an N = 2
SCFT by a matrix of field-dependent masses with non-trivial branch cuts in the
eigenvalues. Though these eigenvalues characterize the geometry, we find that
they do not uniquely specify the holomorphic data of the physical theory. We
also comment on some phenomenological aspects of how these theories can couple
to the visible sector. Our construction can be applied to many N = 2 SCFTs,
resulting in a large new class of N = 1 SCFTs.
