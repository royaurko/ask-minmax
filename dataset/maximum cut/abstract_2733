This paper discusses a new wormhole solution that admits conformal motion,
given a noncommutative-geometry background. After a discussion of the wormhole
geometry and the energy conditions, the analysis proceeds with the calculation
of the active gravitational mass, a discussion of the TOV equation describing
the equilibrium conditions, as well as the nature of the total gravitational
energy. The wormhole spacetime is not asymptotically flat and is therefore cut
off at some radial distance and joined to an exterior vacuum solution.
