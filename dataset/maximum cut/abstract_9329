Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), like wireless networks based upon the
IEEE 802.15.4 standard, have strong energy constraints, and are moreover
subject to frequent transmission errors, not only due to congestion but also to
collisions and to radio channel conditions. This paper introduces an analytical
model to compute the total energy consumption in an LLN due to the TCP
protocol. The model allows us to highlight some tradeoffs as regards the choice
of the TCP maximum segment size, of the Forward Error Correction (FEC)
redundancy ratio, and of the number of link-layer retransmissions, in order to
minimize the total energy consumption.
