The field of gamma ray astronomy relies heavily on the statistical analysis
of data. Because of the paucity of data, and the often large errors associated
with detecting gamma rays, analysis and interpretation of the data require
sophisticated statistical techniques. Techniques for extending the currently
used maximum likelihood technique to more complicated data sets are presented.
Similarly presented are methods of calculating the distribution and behavior of
the maximum likelihood statistic used to measure source significance. A new
method for calculating source variability is also proposed, and used to examine
the sources found by the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) on
board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO). The results show that the
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and unidentified sources have markedly
different variability, and that the unidentified sources fall into at least two
classes, differing in variability and spatial distribution. A class composed of
possible Supernova Remnant associations (SNR) is distinctly more variable than
the pulsars, but has a variability consistent with that of the other low
latitude unidentified sources. Finally, the results of the Fall 1997 GLAST
prototype beam test are presented. The results of the beam test are compared
with simulated results, and found to be in remarkably good agreement.
