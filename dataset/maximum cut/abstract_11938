Magnetoelectric (ME) interactions in layered structures of magnetostrictive
and piezoelectric phases are mediated by mechanical deformation. Here we
discuss the frequency dependence of ME coupling in bilayers and trilayers of
Permendur, a ferromagnetic alloy, and lead zirconate titanate. Data on ME
voltage coefficient versus frequency profiles reveal a giant ME coupling at
electromechanical resonance. The maximum voltage coefficient of 90 V/cm Oe is
three orders of magnitude higher than low-frequency values. The ME interactions
for transverse fields is an order of magnitude stronger than for longitudinal
fields. These results are in agreement with theory. The resonance ME effect,
therefore, is a novel tool for enhancing the magnetic-to-electric field
conversion efficiency in the composites.
