Under the assumption that the dijet excess seen by the CDF Collaboration near
150 Gev in Wjj production is due to the lightest technipion of the low-scale
technicolor process $\rho_T \rightarrow W \pi_T$, we study its observability in
LHC detectors with 1-5 fb^{-1} of data. We find that cuts similar to those
employed by CDF are unlikely to confirm its signal. We propose cuts tailored to
the LSTC hypothesis and its backgrounds at the LHC that can reveal $\pi_T
\rightarrow jj$. We also stress the importance at the LHC of the
isospin-related channel $\rho^{\pm}_T \rightarrow Z\pi^{\pm}_T \rightarrow
\ell\ell jj$ and the all-lepton mode $\rho^{pm}_T \rightarrow WZ \rightarrow
3\ell + \nu$.
