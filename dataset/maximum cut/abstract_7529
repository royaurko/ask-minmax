We present precision calculations of the processes e+e- -> 4-fermions in
which the double resonant W+W- intermediate state occurs. Referring to this
latter intermediate state as the 'signal process', we show that, by using the
YFS Monte Carlo event generators YFSWW3-1.14 and KORALW1.42 in an appropriate
combination, we achieve a physical precision on the signal process, as isolated
with LEP2 MC Workshop cuts, below 0.5 per cent. We stress the full gauge
invariance of our calculations and we compare our results with those of other
contributors where appropriate. In particular, sample Monte Carlo data are
explicitly illustrated and compared with the results of the program RacoonWW of
Dittmaier {\it et al.}. In this way, we show that the total (physical plus
technical) precision tag for the WW signal process cross section is 0.4 per
cent for 200 GeV, for example. Results are also given for 500 GeV with an eye
toward the LC.
