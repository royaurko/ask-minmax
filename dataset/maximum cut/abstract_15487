We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function on the bounded
integer lattice. As a direct generalization of submodular set functions, $f:
\{0, \ldots, C\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ is submodular, if $f(x) + f(y) \geq
f(x \land y) + f(x \lor y)$ for all $x,y \in \{0, \ldots, C\}$ where $\land$
and $\lor$ denote element-wise minimum and maximum. The objective is finding a
vector $x$ maximizing $f(x)$. In this paper, we present a deterministic
$\frac{1}{3}$-approximation using a framework inspired by Buchbinder et al. We
also provide an example that shows the analysis is tight and yields additional
insight into the possibilities of modifying the algorithm. Moreover, we examine
some structural differences to maximization of submodular set functions which
make our problem harder to solve.
