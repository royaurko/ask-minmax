We present ultraviolet and optical light curves in six broadband filters and
grism spectra obtained by Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope for the Type Ia
supernova SN2005am. The data were collected beginning about four days before
the B-band maximum, with excellent coverage of the rapid decline phase and
later observations extending out to 69 days after the peak. The optical and
near UV light curve match well those of SN1992A. The other UV observations
constitute the first set of light curves shorter than 2500 Angstroms and allow
us to compare the light curve evolution in three UV bands. The UV behavior of
this and other low redshift supernovae can be used to constrain theories of
progenitor evolution or to interpret optical light curves of high redshift
supernovae. Using Swift's X-Ray Telescope, we also report the upper limit to
SN2005am's X-ray luminosity to be 1.77 x 10^40 erg s^-1 in the 0.3--10 keV
range from 58,117 s of exposure time.
