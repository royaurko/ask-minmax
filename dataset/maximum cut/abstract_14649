This paper studies the mitigation of intersymbol interference in a diffusive
molecular communication system using enzymes that freely diffuse in the
propagation environment. The enzymes form reaction intermediates with
information molecules and then degrade them so that they cannot interfere with
future transmissions. A lower bound expression on the expected number of
molecules measured at the receiver is derived. A simple binary receiver
detection scheme is proposed where the number of observed molecules is sampled
at the time when the maximum number of molecules is expected. Insight is also
provided into the selection of an appropriate bit interval. The expected bit
error probability is derived as a function of the current and all previously
transmitted bits. Simulation results show the accuracy of the bit error
probability expression and the improvement in communication performance by
having active enzymes present.
