The descriptions (up to isomorphism) of naturally graded $p$-filiform Leibniz
algebras and $p$-filiform ($p\leq 3$) Leibniz algebras of maximum length are
known. In this paper we study the gradation of maximum length for $p$-filiform
Leibniz algebras. The present work aims at the classification of complex
$p$-filiform ($p \geq 4$) Leibniz algebras of maximum length.
