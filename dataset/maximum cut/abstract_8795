In [6] we proved Chen's inequality regarded as a problem of constrained
maximum. In this paper we introduce a Riemannian invariant obtained from Chen's
invariant, replacing the sectional curvature by the Ricci curvature of k-order.
This invariant can be estimated, in the case of submanifolds M in space forms
$\widetilde{M}(c)$, varying with c and the mean curvature of M in
$\widetilde{M}(c)$. A improuvement of this inequality in the Lagrangian case is
obtained.
