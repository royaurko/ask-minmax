The electronic quasiparticle spectrum of a ferromagnetic film is investigated
within the framework of the s-f model. Starting from the exact solvable case of
a single electron in an otherwise empty conduction band being exchange coupled
to a ferromagnetically saturated localized spin system we extend the theory to
finite temperatures. Our approach is a moment-conserving decoupling procedure
for suitable defined Green functions. The theory for finite temperatures
evolves continuously from the exact limiting case. The restriction to zero
conduction band occupation may be regarded as a proper model description for
ferromagnetic semiconductors like EuO and EuS. Evaluating the theory for a
simple cubic film cut parallel to the (100) crystal plane, we find some marked
correlation effects which depend on the spin of the test electron, on the
exchange coupling, and on the temperature of the local-moment system.
