We report the discovery of a short-duration microlensing candidate in the
Northern field of the POINT-AGAPE pixel lensing survey towards M31. The
full-width at half-maximum timescale is very short (tfwhm = 1.8 days) and the
source star has almost certainly been identified on HST images, allowing to
infer an Einstein crossing time : te=10.4 days and a magnification at maximum :
Amax=18.
