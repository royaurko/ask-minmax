A precise comparison is made between the Dalitz decay
$H\to\ell\bar{\ell}\gamma$ and the two body decay $H\to\gamma
Z,Z\to\ell\bar{\ell}$ for electrons and for muons including experimental cuts
appropriate for the ATLAS detector. The widths for these two processes differ
by 8% for electrons and 3% for muons. Given that there remain QCD radiative
corrections of this order that are not included, this suggests that the
isolation of the Dalitz decay will be challenging.
