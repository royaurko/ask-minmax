We consider isospin correlations of pions produced in a relativistic nuclear
collision, using an effective theory of the chiral order parameter. Our theory
has (1+1) Lorentz invariance as appropriate for the central rapidity region. We
argue that in certain regions of space correlations of the chiral order
parameter are described by the fixed point of the (1+1) WZNW model. The
corresponding anomalous dimension determines scaling of the probability to
observe a correlated cluster of pions with the size of this cluster in
rapidity. Though the maximal size of clusters for which this scaling is
applicable is cut off by pion mass, such clusters can still include
sufficiently many particles to make the scaling observable.
