We propose a diffusion model for the recently discovered diffusion-induced
Ramsey narrowing arising when atoms diffuse in a buffer-gas cell in the laser
radiation field. The diffusion equation for the coherence of metastable states
coupled with an excited state by laser radiation of different frequencies in a
three-level scheme of the atom-field interaction is obtained in the
strong-collision approximation. The dependence of the shape of an absorption
line near the transmission maximum of one of the frequencies on the two-photon
resonance detuning for various geometries of the cell is investigated.
