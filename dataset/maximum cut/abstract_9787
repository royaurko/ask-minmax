We have investigated multiple caloric effects in multiferroic Y2CoMnO6.
Polycrystalline sample prepared by solid state method has shown a ferromagnetic
Curie temperature 75 K with second order phase transition; a maximum magneto
entropy change -$\Delta$S_{Mmax}) of ~ 7.3 J/kg K with reasonable relative
cooling power 220 J/kg is found without thermal and magnetic hysteresis loss.
Electric field driven entropy change (-$\Delta$S_{Emax}) of ~ 0.26 J/m^3 K
obtained using the Maxwells relation and estimated magnetically induced total
temperature change of 5.45 K around Curie temperature that confirms the
multicaloric effect in the sample.
