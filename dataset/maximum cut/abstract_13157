The interactions between linear elastic waves and a nonlinear crack with
finite compressibility are studied in the one-dimensional context. Numerical
studies on a hyperbolic model of contact with sinusoidal forcing have shown
that the mean values of the scattered elastic displacements are discontinuous
across the crack. The mean dilatation of the crack also increases with the
amplitude of the forcing levels. The aim of the present theoretical study is to
analyse these nonlinear processes under a larger range of nonlinear jump
conditions. For this purpose, the problem is reduced to a nonlinear
differential equation. The dependence of the periodic solution on the forcing
amplitude is quantified under sinusoidal forcing conditions. Bounds for the
mean, maximum and minimum values of the solution are presented. Lastly,
periodic forcing with a null mean value is addressed. In that case, a result
about the mean dilatation of the crack is obtained.
