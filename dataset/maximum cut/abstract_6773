This article is present high precision multiwave rectifier circuit operating
in low voltage plus or minus 1.5 Volt current modes by CMOS technology 0.5
\mum, receive input and give output in current mode, respond at high frequency
period. The structure compound with high speed current comparator circuit,
current mirror circuit, and CMOS inverter circuit. PSpice program used for
confirmation the performance of testing. The PSpice program shows operating of
circuit is able to working at maximum input current 400 \muAp p, maximum
frequency responding 200 MHz, high precision and low power losses, and
non-precision zero crossing output signal.
