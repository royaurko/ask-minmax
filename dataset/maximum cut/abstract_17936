In this paper, an energy harvesting dual-hop relaying system without/with the
presence of co-channel interference (CCI) is investigated. Specifically, the
energy constrained multi-antenna relay node is powered by either the
information signal of the source or via the signal receiving from both the
source and interferer. In particular, we first study the outage probability and
ergodic capacity of an interference free system, and then extend the analysis
to an interfering environment. To exploit the benefit of multiple antennas,
three different linear processing schemes are investigated, namely, 1) Maximum
ratio combining/maximal ratio transmission (MRC/MRT), 2) Zero-forcing/MRT
(ZF/MRT) and 3) Minimum mean-square error/MRT (MMSE/MRT). For all schemes, both
the systems outage probability and ergodic capacity are studied, and the
achievable diversity order is also presented. In addition, the optimal power
splitting ratio minimizing the outage probability is characterized. Our results
show that the implementation of multiple antennas increases the energy
harvesting capability, hence, significantly improves the systems performance.
Moreover, it is demonstrated that the CCI could be potentially exploited to
substantially boost the performance, while the choice of a linear processing
scheme plays a critical role in determining how much gain could be extracted
from the CCI.
