We study the energy dependence of the contribution of pion exchange to
large-rapidity-gap events in deep inelastic scattering. The results show that
this contribution can be quite significant at low energy and that the LRG
events observed by E665 collaboration in \mu Xe and \mu D interactions at 490
$GeV$ can be reasonably well described in terms of meson exchange. We also show
that the distribution of the maximum rapidity for all hadrons is quite
different from that for charged hadrons only and that the former exhibits also
shoulder-like structure for events at 490 $GeV$ similar to that at HERA.
