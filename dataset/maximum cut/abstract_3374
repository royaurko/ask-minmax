Bayesian inference and the principle of maximum entropy (PME) are usually
presented as separate but complementary branches of inference, the latter
playing a central role in the foundations of Statistical Mechanics. In this
work it is shown that the PME can be derived from Bayes' theorem and the
divergence theorem for systems whose states can be mapped to points in a
differentiable manifold. In this view, entropy must be interpreted as the
invariant measure (non-informative prior) on the space of probability
densities.
