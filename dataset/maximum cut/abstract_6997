Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods rely on asymptotic arguments,
implying that parameter inference can be systematically biased even when
sufficient statistics are available. We propose to construct the ABC
accept/reject step from decision theoretic arguments on a suitable auxiliary
space. This framework, referred to as ABC*, fully specifies which test
statistics to use, how to combine them, how to set the tolerances and how long
to simulate in order to obtain accuracy properties on the auxiliary space. Akin
to maximum-likelihood indirect inference, regularity conditions establish when
the ABC* approximation to the posterior density is accurate on the original
parameter space in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the maximum a
posteriori point estimate. Fundamentally, escaping asymptotic arguments
requires knowledge of the distribution of test statistics, which we obtain
through modelling the distribution of summary values, data points on a summary
level. Synthetic examples and an application to time series data of influenza A
(H3N2) infections in the Netherlands illustrate ABC* in action.
