We see how nested sequents, a natural generalisation of hypersequents, allow
us to develop a systematic proof theory for modal logics. As opposed to other
prominent formalisms, such as the display calculus and labelled sequents,
nested sequents stay inside the modal language and allow for proof systems
which enjoy the subformula property in the literal sense. In the first part we
study a systematic set of nested sequent systems for all normal modal logics
formed by some combination of the axioms for seriality, reflexivity, symmetry,
transitivity and euclideanness. We establish soundness and completeness and
some of their good properties, such as invertibility of all rules,
admissibility of the structural rules, termination of proof-search, as well as
syntactic cut-elimination. In the second part we study the logic of common
knowledge, a modal logic with a fixpoint modality. We look at two infinitary
proof systems for this logic: an existing one based on ordinary sequents, for
which no syntactic cut-elimination procedure is known, and a new one based on
nested sequents. We see how nested sequents, in contrast to ordinary sequents,
allow for syntactic cut-elimination and thus allow us to obtain an ordinal
upper bound on the length of proofs.
