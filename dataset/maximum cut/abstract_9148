Parvan [arXiv:0911.0383v1] [1] has recently presented some calculations in
order to demonstrate the incorrectness of the results obtained from the
generalized multinomial coefficients (GMC) presented in Ref. [2]. According to
Parvan, the aforementioned approach of studying maximum entropy probability
distributions is erroneous. In this comment I demonstrate that Parvan's
arguments do not hold true and that the obtained results from GMC do not
present either mathematical or physical discrepancies.
