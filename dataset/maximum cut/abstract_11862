We have measured the magnetoresistance in a series of Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$As
samples with 0.033$\le x \le$ 0.053 for three mutually orthogonal orientations
of the applied magnetic field. The spontaneous resistivity anisotropy (SRA) in
these materials is negative (i.e. the sample resistance is higher when its
magnetization is perpendicular to the measuring current than when the two are
parallel) and has a magnitude on the order of 5% at temperatures near 10K and
below. This stands in contrast to the results for most conventional magnetic
materials where the SRA is considerably smaller in magnitude for those few
cases in which a negative sign is observed. The magnitude of the SRA drops from
its maximum at low temperatures to zero at T$_C$ in a manner that is consistent
with mean field theory. These results should provide a significant test for
emerging theories of transport in this new class of materials.
