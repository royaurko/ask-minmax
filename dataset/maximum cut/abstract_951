In this paper, the maximum entropy property of the discrete-time first-order
stable spline kernel is studied. The advantages of studying this property in
discrete-time domain instead of continuous-time domain are outlined. One of
such advantages is that the differential entropy rate is well-defined for
discrete-time stochastic processes. By formulating the maximum entropy problem
for discrete-time stochastic processes we provide a simple and self-contained
proof to show what maximum entropy property the discrete-time first-order
stable spline kernel has.
