We study the effect of filter zero-point uncertainties on future supernova
dark energy missions. Fitting for calibration parameters using simultaneous
analysis of all Type Ia supernova standard candles achieves a significant
improvement over more traditional fit methods. This conclusion is robust under
diverse experimental configurations (number of observed supernovae, maximum
survey redshift, inclusion of additional systematics). This approach to
supernova fitting considerably eases otherwise stringent mission calibration
requirements. As an example we simulate a space-based mission based on the
proposed JDEM satellite; however the method and conclusions are general and
valid for any future supernova dark energy mission, ground or space-based.
