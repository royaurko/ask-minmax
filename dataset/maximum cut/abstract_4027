We study by theoretical analysis and by direct numerical simulation the
dynamics of a wide class of asynchronous stochastic systems composed of many
autocatalytic degrees of freedom. We describe the generic emergence of
truncated power laws in the size distribution of their individual elements. The
exponents $\alpha$ of these power laws are time independent and depend only on
the way the elements with very small values are treated. These truncated power
laws determine the collective time evolution of the system. In particular the
global stochastic fluctuations of the system differ from the normal Gaussian
noise according to the time and size scales at which these fluctuations are
considered. We describe the ranges in which these fluctuations are
parameterized respectively by: the Levy regime $\alpha < 2$, the power law
decay with large exponent ($\alpha > 2$), and the exponential decay. Finally we
relate these results to the large exponent power laws found in the actual
behavior of the stock markets and to the exponential cut-off detected in
certain recent measurement.
