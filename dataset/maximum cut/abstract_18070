The NEXT Generation Health study investigates the dating violence of
adolescents using a survey questionnaire. Each student is asked to affirm or
deny multiple instances of violence in his/her dating relationship. There is,
however, evidence suggesting that students not in a relationship responded to
the survey, resulting in excessive zeros in the responses. This paper proposes
likelihood-based and estimating equation approaches to analyze the
zero-inflated clustered binary response data. We adopt a mixed model method to
account for the cluster effect, and the model parameters are estimated using a
maximum-likelihood (ML) approach that requires a Gaussian-Hermite quadrature
(GHQ) approximation for implementation. Since an incorrect assumption on the
random effects distribution may bias the results, we construct generalized
estimating equations (GEE) that do not require the correct specification of
within-cluster correlation. In a series of simulation studies, we examine the
performance of ML and GEE methods in terms of their bias, efficiency and
robustness. We illustrate the importance of properly accounting for this zero
inflation by reanalyzing the NEXT data where this issue has previously been
ignored.
