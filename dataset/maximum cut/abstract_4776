We evaluate the large momentum transfer $J/\psi$ photoproduction with
rapidity gaps in ultraperipheral proton-ion collisions at the LHC which
provides an effective method of probing dynamics of large t elastic hard QCD
Pomeron interactions. It is shown that the experimental studies of this process
would allow to investigate the energy dependence of cross section of elastic
scattering of a small $c\bar c$ dipole off the gluon over a wide range of
invariant energies 10^3 < s_{c\bar c - gluon} < 10^6 GeV^2. The accessible
energy range exceeds the one reached in \gamma p at HERA by a factor of 10 and
allows the kinematic cuts which improve greatly sensitivity to the Pomeron
dynamics as compared to the HERA measurements. The cross section is expected to
change by a factor \ge 20 throughout this interval and our estimates predict
quite reasonable counting rates for this process with the several of the LHC
detectors.
