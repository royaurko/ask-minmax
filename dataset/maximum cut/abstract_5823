UBVRI photometry and optical spectra of type Ia supernova SN 2003du obtained
at the Indian Astronomical Observatory for nearly a year since discovery are
presented.
  The apparent magnitude at maximum was B=13.53 +/- 0.02 mag, and the colour
(B-V) = -0.08 +/- 0.03 mag. The luminosity decline rate, Delta(m_{15}(B)) =
1.04 +/- 0.04 mag indicates an absolute B magnitude at maximum of M_B = -19.34
+/- 0.3 mag and the distance modulus to the parent galaxy as mu=32.89 +/-
0.4.The light curve shapes are similar, though not identical, to those of SNe
1998bu and 1990N, both of which had luminosity decline rates similar to that of
SN 2003du and occurred in spiral galaxies. The peak bolometric luminosity
indicates that 0.9 Msun mass of 56Ni was ejected by the supernova. The spectral
evolution and the evolution of the Si II and Ca II absorption velocities
closely follows that of SN 1998bu, and in general, is within the scatter of the
velocities observed in normal type Ia supernovae.
  The spectroscopic and photometric behaviour of SN 2003du is quite typical for
SNe Ia in spirals.
  A high velocity absorption component in the Ca II (H & K) and IR-triplet
features, with absorption velocities of ~20,000 km/s and ~22,000 km/s
respectively, is detected in the pre-maximum spectra of days -11 and -7.
