Deep-inelastic diffractive scaling violations have provided fundamental
insight into the QCD pomeron, suggesting a single gluon inner structure rather
than that of a perturbative two-gluon bound state. This talk outlines a
derivation of a high-energy, transverse momentum cut-off, confining solution of
QCD. The pomeron, in first approximation, is a single reggeized gluon plus a
``wee parton'' component that compensates for the color and particle properties
of the gluon. This solution corresponds to a supercritical phase of Reggeon
Field Theory.
