A static string in an AdS Schwarzschild space is dual to a heavy quark
anti-quark pair in a gauge theory at high temperature. This space is non
confining in the sense that the energy is finite for infinite quark anti-quark
separation. We introduce an infrared cut off in this space and calculate the
corresponding string energy. We find a deconfining phase transition at a
critical temperature T_C. Above T_C the string tension vanishes representing
the deconfined phase. Below T_C we find a linear confining behavior for large
quark anti-quark separation. This simple phenomenological model leads to the
appropriate zero temperature limit, corresponding to the Cornell potential and
also describes a thermal deconfining phase transition. However the temperature
corrections to the string tension do not recover the expected results for low
temperatures.
