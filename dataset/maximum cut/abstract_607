A holographic description of chiral symmetry breaking in the pattern of QCD
is reviewed. D7 brane probes are used to include quark fields in a simple
non-supersymmetric deformation of the AdS/CFT Correspondence. The axial
symmetry breaking is realized geometrically and the quark condensate and meson
masses are computable. Surprisingly, treating the model as a description of QCD
works quantitatively at the 15% level. Models of this AdS/QCD type typically
have a strongly coupled, conformal UV regime that is far from QCD. To
systematically move closer to QCD, we propose cutting out the large radius
gravitational description and matching operators and couplings at a finite UV
cut off in the spirit of a perfect lattice action. A simple example is
discussed.
