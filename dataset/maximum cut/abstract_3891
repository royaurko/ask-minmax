We use the cyclotron-maser theory to explain the core emission from the
magnetosphere of pulsars. As a kind of direct and efficient maser type of
emission, it can give rise to escaping radiation with extremely high brightness
temperature and narrow angle with respect to the magnetic axis. We find that
the growth rates and real frequencies of the O-mode electromagnetic wave
propagating parallel to the magnetic fields depend on the ratio of the plasma
frequency $\omega_p$ and the gyrofrequency $\omega_b$ rather than the plasma
frequency alone, as described by other models. The emission takes place in the
region where the magnitude of $\omega_p/\omega_b$ is $10^{-2}$. The
corresponding altitude is about a few decades of neutron star radius, where the
magnetic field strength is about $10^6-10^8 G$. The qualitative spectrum and
the lower frequency cut-off of the radio emission is obtained by this model.
