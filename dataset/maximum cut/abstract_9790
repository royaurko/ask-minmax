We present the observation of strain induced sign reversal of anisotropic
magnetoresistance (AMR) in LCMO (LCMO) ultrathin films (thickness 4 nm)
deposited on STO (001) substrate (STO). We have also observed unusually large
AMR in LCMO/STO thin films with thickness of 6 nm below but close to its Curie
temperature (TC) which decrease as the film thickness increases. The sign
reversal of AMR (with a maximum value of - 6) with magnetic field or
temperature for the 4 nm thin film may be attributed to the increase in tensile
strain in the plane of the thin film which in turn facilitates the rotation of
the magnetization easy axis.
