The stabilization of steady state entanglement caused by action of a
classical driving field in the system of two-level atoms with the dipole
interaction accompanied by spontaneous emission is discussed. An exact solution
shows that the maximum amount of concurrence that can be achieved in Lamb-Dicke
limit is 0.43, which corresponds to the entanglement $\mathcal{E}_{max}=0.285$
ebit. Dependence of entanglement on interatomic distance and classical driving
field is examined numerically.
