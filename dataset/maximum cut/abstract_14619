In the field of population genetics measures of genetic differentiation are
widely used to gather information on the structure and gene flow between
populations. These measures are based on a number of simplifying assumptions,
for instance equal population size and symmetric migration. However, asymmetric
migration frequently occurs in nature and information about directional gene
flow would here be of great interest. Nevertheless current measures of genetic
differentiation cannot be used in such systems without violating their
assumptions. To get information on asymmetric migration patterns from genetic
data rather complex models using maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches
generally need to be applied. We here introduce a new approach that intends to
fill the gap between the complex approaches and the symmetric measures of
genetic differentiation. Our approach makes it possible to calculate a
directional component of genetic differentiation at low computational effort
using any of the classical measures of genetic differentiation. The directional
measures of genetic differentiation can further be used to calculate asymmetric
migration. Using a simulated dataset with known migration, directional
differentiation and migration are estimated to show that our method captures
relevant properties of migration patterns even at low migration frequencies and
with few marker loci.
