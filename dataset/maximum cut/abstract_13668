Set of neutron star observational results is used to test some selected
equations of state of dense nuclear matter. The first observational result
comes from the mass--baryon number relation for pulsar B of the double pulsar
system J 0737--3039. The second one is based on the mass--radius relation
coming from observation of the thermal radiation of the neutron star RX J
1856.35--3754. The third one follows the population analysis of isolated
neutron star thermal radiation sources. The last one is the test of maximum
mass. The equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter is given by the
parameterized form of the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock mean field, and
we test selected parameterizations that represent fits of full relativistic
mean field calculation. We show that only one of them is capable to pass the
observational tests. This equation of state represents the first equation of
state that is able to explain all the mentioned observational tests, especially
the very accurate test given by the double pulsar even if no mass loss is
assumed.
