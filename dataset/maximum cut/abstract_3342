We investigate the azimuthal anisotropy v2 of particle production in
nucleus-nucleus collisions in the maximum entropy approach. This necessitates
two new parameters delta and lambda2. The parameter delta describes the
deformation of transverse configuration space and is related to the anisotropy
of the overlap zone of the two nuclei. The parameter lambda2 defines the
anisotropy of the particle distribution in momentum space. Assuming deformed
flux tubes at the early stage of the collision we relate the momentum to the
space asymmetry i.e. lambda2 to delta with the uncertainty relation. We compute
the anisotropy v2 as a function of centrality, transverse momentum and rapidity
using gluon-hadron duality. The general features of LHC data are reproduced.
