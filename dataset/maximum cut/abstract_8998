Experimental results related with the movement of the position of pressure
and intensity maxima along the axis of focused acoustic beams under increasing
driving voltages and its interpretation are presented. It is shown that in the
nonlinear regime the points of the pressure and intensity maximum are separated
and move differently along the axis, contrary to the linear regime, where these
points coincide. The considered effects are particularly strong in the case of
low-Fresnel-number beams.
