We present a systematic overview of granular deposits composed of ellipsoidal
particles with different particle shapes and size polydispersities. We study
the density and anisotropy of such deposits as functions of size polydispersity
and two shape parameters that fully describe the shape of a general ellipsoid.
Our results show that, while shape influences significantly the macroscopic
properties of the deposits, polydispersity plays apparently a secondary role.
The density attains a maximum for a particular family of non-symmetrical
ellipsoids, larger than the density observed for prolate or oblate ellipsoids.
As for anisotropy measures, the contact forces show are increasingly preferred
along the vertical direction as the shape of the particles deviates for a
sphere. The deposits are constructed by means of an efficient molecular
dynamics method, where the contact forces are efficiently and accurately
computed. The main results are discussed in the light of applications for
porous media models and sedimentation processes.
