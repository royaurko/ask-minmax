Recent observations of ultra high energy cosmic rays and gamma rays suggest
that there are small violations of Lorentz symmetry. If there were no such
violations, then the GZK cut off would hold and cosmic rays with energy $\sim
10^{20}eV$ or higher would not be reaching the earth. However some such events
seem to have been observed. This has lead to phenomenological models in which
there is a small violation of the Lorentz symmetry or the velocity of light.
However recent Quantum Gravity and String Theory approaches which no longer
consider a differentiable spacetime manifold already predict such violations.
Similarly there are other theoretical reasons which also point to this. We
briefly discuss the various possibilities.
