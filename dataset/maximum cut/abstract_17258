In the present era of technology computer has facilitated the human life up
to a great extent. The speed of computation has raised to astonish level but
the pace of development of other technologies which have core dependency over
computers have raised relatively exponentially huge, though the computer speed
of computation is very fast with respect to human abilities but still it has to
be increased a lot more to meet the future requirements. We have pushed
electrons to their maximum limit to a stage that nothing further could be
expected from electrons. Alternately one can use photon to replace the
relatively sluggish electrons. An alternate that posses all feature that an
electron holds but only millions of time faster and with a far more reliability
in one way or the other stretching the computers speed to a stage that no one
would have ever even wonder. In this research paper the photonics
implementations in computation industry have been presented along with its
scope as an alternate to electron with comparative study of electron and photon
under the computation perspective, generalized working of silicon based optical
computers, the application of photons and their crucial role in the upcoming
times. Keywords: Photonic Technology, H
