We investigate the transience/recurrence of a non-Markovian, one-dimensional
diffusion process which consists of a Brownian motion with a non-anticipating
drift that has two phases---a transient to $+\infty$ mode which is activated
when the diffusion is sufficiently near its running maximum, and a recurrent
mode which is activated otherwise. We also consider the speed of a diffusion
with a two-phase drift, where the drift is equal to a certain positive constant
when the diffusion is sufficiently near its running maximum, and is equal to
another positive constant otherwise.
