We consider the statistics of light amplitude fluctuations for the
propagation of a laser beam subjected to multiple filamentation in an amplified
Kerr media, with both linear and nonlinear dissipation. Dissipation arrests the
catastrophic collapse of filaments, causing their disintegration into almost
linear waves. These waves form a nearly-Gaussian random field which seeds new
filaments. For small amplitudes the probability density function (PDF) of light
amplitude is close to Gaussian, while for large amplitudes the PDF has a long
power-like tail which corresponds to strong non-Gaussian fluctuations, i.e.
intermittency of strong optical turbulence. This tail is determined by the
universal form of near singular filaments and the PDF for the maximum
amplitudes of the filaments.
