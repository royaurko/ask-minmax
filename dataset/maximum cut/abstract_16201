We present UVES observations of the log N(HI)= 21.7 damped Lyman-alpha system
at z=2.03954 towards the quasar PKS 0458-020. HI Lyman-alpha emission is
detected in the center of the damped Lyman-alpha absorption trough.
Metallicities are derived for MgII, SiII, PII, CrII, MnII, FeII and ZnII and
are found to be -1.21\pm0.12, -1.28\pm0.20, -1.54\pm0.11, -1.66\pm0.10,
-2.05\pm0.11, -1.87\pm0.11, -1.22\pm0.10, respectively, relative to solar. The
depletion factor is therefore of the order of [Zn/Fe]=0.65. We observe metal
absorption lines to be blueshifted compared to the Lyman-alpha emission up to a
maximum of 100 and 200 km/s for low and high-ionization species respectively.
This can be interpreted either as the consequence of rotation in a large
(~7kpc) disk or as the imprint of a galactic wind. The star formation rate
(SFR) derived from the Lyman-alpha emission, 1.6 solar masses/yr, is compared
with that estimated from the observed CII* absorption. No molecular hydrogen is
detected in our data, yielding a molecular fraction f<-6.52. This absence of H2
can be explained as the consequence of a high ambient UV flux which is one
order of magnitude larger than the radiation field in the ISM of our Galaxy and
originates in the observed emitting region.
