We present a cut elimination argument that witnesses the conservativity of
the compositional axioms for truth (without the extended induction axiom) over
any theory interpreting a weak subsystem of arithmetic. In doing so we also fix
a critical error in Halbach's original presentation. Our methods show that the
admission of these axioms determines a hyper-exponential reduction in the size
of derivations of truth-free statements.
