We explore the magneto-ionic environment of the isolated radio galaxy B2
0755+37 using detailed imaging of the distributions of Faraday rotation and
depolarization over the radio source from Very Large Array observations at
1385,1465 and 4860 MHz and new X-ray data from XMM-Newton. The Rotation Measure
(RM) distribution is complex, with evidence for anisotropic fluctuations in two
regions. The approaching lobe shows low and uniform RM in an unusual `stripe'
along an extension of the jet axis and a linear gradient transverse to this
axis over its Northern half. The leading edge of the receding lobe shows
arc-like RM structures with sign reversals. Elsewhere, the RM structures are
reasonably isotropic. The RM power spectra are well described by cut-off power
laws with slopes ranging from 2.1 to 3.2 in different sub-regions. The
corresponding magnetic-field autocorrelation lengths, where well-determined,
range from 0.25 to 1.4 kpc. It is likely that the fluctuations are mostly
produced by compressed gas and field around the leading edges of the lobes. We
identify areas of high depolarization around the jets and inner lobes. These
could be produced by dense gas immediately surrounding the radio emission
containing a magnetic field which is tangled on small scales. We also identify
four ways in which the well known depolarization (Faraday depth) asymmetry
between jetted and counter-jetted lobes of extended radio sources can be
modified by interactions with the surrounding medium.
