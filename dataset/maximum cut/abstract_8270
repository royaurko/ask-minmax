Analysing the weak lensing distortions of the images of faint background
galaxies provides a means to constrain the mass distribution of cluster
galaxies and potentially to test the extent of their dark matter halos as a
function of the density of the environment. Here I describe simulations of
observational data and present a maximum likelihood method to infer the average
properties of an ensemble of cluster galaxies.
