We propose an scenario to study, from a dynamical point of view, the thermal
recombination of quarks in the midsts of a relativistic heavy-ion collision. We
coin the term dynamical quark recombination to refer to the process of
quark-antiquark and three-quark clustering, to form mesons and baryons,
respectively, as a function of energy density. Using the string-flip model we
show that the probabilities to form such clusters differ. We apply these ideas
to the calculation of the proton and pion spectra in a Bjorken-like scenario
that incorporates the evolution of these probabilities with proper time and
compute the proton to pion ratio, comparing to recent RHIC data at the highest
energy. We show that for a standard choice of parameters, this ratio reaches
one, though the maximum is very sensitive to the initial evolution proper time.
