Accretion-powered X-ray pulsars exhibit significant variability of the
Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature (CRSF) centroid energy on pulse-to-pulse
timescales, and also on much longer timescales. Two types of spectral
variability are observed. For sources in group 1, the CRSF energy is negatively
correlated with the variable source luminosity, and for sources in group 2, the
opposite behavior is observed. The physical basis for this bimodal behavior is
currently not understood. We explore the hypothesis that the accretion dynamics
in the group 1 sources is dominated by radiation pressure near the stellar
surface, and that Coulomb interactions decelerate the gas to rest in the group
2 sources. We derive a new expression for the critical luminosity such that
radiation pressure decelerates the matter to rest in the supercritical sources.
The formula for the critical luminosity is evaluated for 5 sources, using the
maximum value of the CRSF centroid energy to estimate the surface magnetic
field strength. The results confirm that the group 1 sources are supercritical
and the group 2 sources are subcritical, although the situation is less clear
for those highly variable sources that cross over the critical line. We also
explain the variation of the CRSF energy with luminosity as a consequence of
the variation of the characteristic emission height. The sign of the height
variation is opposite in the supercritical and subcritical cases, hence
creating the observed bimodal behavior.
