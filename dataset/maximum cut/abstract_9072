We consider a nonlinear polynomial regression model in which we wish to test
the null hypothesis of structural stability in the regression parameters
against the alternative of a break at an unknown time. We derive the extreme
value distribution of a maximum-type test statistic which is asymptotically
equivalent to the maximally selected likelihood ratio. The resulting test is
easy to apply and has good size and power, even in small samples.
