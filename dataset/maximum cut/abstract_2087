Recently, it has been claimed that the back reaction of vacuum polarization
on a black hole spacetime naturally regularizes infinities in the black hole
entropy. We examine the back reaction calculation and find no such
short-distance cut-off,in contradiction with these recent claims. Moreover, the
intuitive expectation that the perturbative calculation breaks down near the
event horizon is confirmed. The new surface gravity diverges and the metric is
degenerate at the stretched horizon.
