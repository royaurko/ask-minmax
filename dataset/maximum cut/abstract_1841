A comparative study of near-maximum-light optical spectra of 24 Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) is presented. The spectra are quantified in two ways, and
assigned to four groups. Seven "core-normal" SNe Ia have very similar spectra,
except for strong high-velocity CaII absorption in SN 2001el. Seven SNe Ia are
assigned to a "broad-line" group, the most extreme of which is SN 1984A. Five
SNe Ia, including SN 1991bg, are assigned to a "cool" group. Five SNe Ia,
including SN 1991T, are assigned to a "shallow-silicon" group. Comparisons with
SYNOW synthetic spectra provide a basis for discussion of line identifications,
and an internally consistent quantification of the maximum-light spectroscopic
diversity among SNe Ia. The extent to which SN Ia maximum-light spectra appear
to have a continuous distribution of properties, rather than consisting of
discrete subtypes, is discussed.
