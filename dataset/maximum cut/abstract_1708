The contribution of the higher-twist mechanism to the large-$p_T$ inclusive
gluon production cross section in $\pi p$ collisions is calculated in case of
the principle of maximum conformality and Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie approaches
in the dependence of the pion distribution amplitudes. The higher-twist cross
sections obtained in the framework of the principle of maximum conformality and
Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie approaches, and compared and analyzed in relation to
the leading-twist cross sections and each other.
