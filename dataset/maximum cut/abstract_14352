We present a 2-\mum frequency comb based on a reliable mode-locked Er:fiber
laser with 100 MHz repetition rate. After shifting the spectrum of the
amplified Er:fiber comb to longer wavelengths, a single-clad Tm/Ho:fiber is
used as a self-pumped pre-amplifier to generate a coherent and broadband
spectrum centered at 1.93 \mum. Subsequently, a cladding-pumped Tm:fiber
amplifier boosts the system to a maximum output power of 4.8 W at 1.96 \mum.
After compression in a compact grating compressor, our amplified
Er:fiber/Tm:fiber hybrid system delivers as much as 2.9 W with a pulse duration
of 141 fs. The system's comb properties are examined via heterodyne
measurement.
