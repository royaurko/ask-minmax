With the discovery of massive neutron stars such as PSR J1614-2230, the
question has arisen whether exotic matter such as hyperons can exist in the
neutron star core. We examine the conditions under which hyperons can exist in
massive neutron stars. We consistently investigate the vector meson-hyperon
coupling, going from SU(6) quark model to a broader SU(3) symmetry. We propose
that the maximum neutron star mass decreases linearly with the strangeness
content f_s of the neutron star core as M_max(f_s) = M_max(0) - 0.6 M_solar
(f_s/0.1), which seems to be independent of the underlying nuclear equation of
state and the vector baryon-meson coupling scheme. Thus, pulsar mass
measurements can be used to constrain the hyperon fraction in neutron stars.
