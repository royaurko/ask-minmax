The production of a hard and isolated photon accompanied by one or two jets
in large-Q2 deep inelastic ep scattering is calculated at next-to-leading
order. We include consistently contributions from quark-to-photon fragmentation
and study various differential cross sections and their dependence on isolation
cut parameters. Numerical results relevant for HERA experiments are presented.
