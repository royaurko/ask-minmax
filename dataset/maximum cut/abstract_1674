A modified four-state CVQKD protocol is proposed to increase the maximum
transmission distance and tolerable excess noise in the presence of Gaussian
lossy and noisy channel by using a noiseless linear amplifier (NLA). A NLA with
amplitude gain g can increase the maximum admission losses by 20log(g) dB.
