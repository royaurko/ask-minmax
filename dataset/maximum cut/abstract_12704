We study the first steps of ice formation in fresh water turbulent convection
(frazil ice regime). We explore the sensitivity of the ice formation process to
the set of non-dimensional parameters governing the system. We model the
mixture of ice crystals and water as a two-phase medium composed of water and
ice particles of fixed diameter. We use the Boussinesq approximation and we
integrate numerically the set of equation making use of a numerical code based
on second order finite difference. A dynamic LES model for the subgrid scales
is used. We show that the ice particle rise velocity and the ice concentration
source term coefficient significantly affect the frazil ice dynamics. The
maximum of ice production is obtained in those situations where the rise
velocity is of the same order of magnitude of a characteristic velocity of the
thermal downwelling plumes. We develop a simple model which captures the trend
of the growth rate as a function of the relevant parameters. Finally, we
explore the nonlinear regime and we show that the parameter which plays a key
role in fixing the concentration value at the statistically steady state is the
heat exchange source term coefficient.
