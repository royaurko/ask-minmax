We introduce a family of multi-way Cheeger-type constants $\{h_k^{\sigma},
k=1,2,\ldots, N\}$ on a signed graph $\Gamma=(G,\sigma)$ such that
$h_k^{\sigma}=0$ if and only if $\Gamma$ has $k$ balanced connected components.
These constants are switching invariant and bring together in a unified
viewpoint a number of important graph-theoretical concepts, including the
classical Cheeger constant, the non-bipartiteness parameter of Desai and Rao,
the bipartiteness ratio of Trevisan, the dual Cheeger constant of Bauer and
Jost on unsigned graphs, and the frustration index (originally called the line
index of balance by Harary) on signed graphs. We further unify the
(higher-order or improved) Cheeger and dual Cheeger inequalities for unsigned
graphs as well as the underlying algorithmic proof techniques by establishing
their corresponding versions on signed graphs. In particular, we develop a
spectral clustering method for finding $k$ almost-balanced subgraphs, each
defining a sparse cut. The proper metric for such a clustering is the metric on
a real projective space. We also prove estimates of the extremal eigenvalues of
signed Laplace matrix in terms of number of signed triangles ($3$-cycles).
