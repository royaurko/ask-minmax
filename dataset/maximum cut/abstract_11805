The antiferromagnetic (AFM) state has been investigated in the three
heavy-fermion compounds URu2Si2, UPd2Al3, and UNi2Al3 by measuring dV/dI(V)
curves of point contacts at different temperatures (1.5-20 K) and magnetic
fields (0-28 T). The zero-bias maximum in dV/dI(V) for URu2Si2 points to a
partially gapped Fermi-surface related to the itinerant nature of the AFM state
contrary to UPd2Al3 where analogous features have not been found. The AFM state
in UNi2Al3 has more similarities with URu2Si2. For URu2Si2, the same critical
field of about 40 T along the easy c axis is found for all features in dV/dI(V)
corresponding to the Neel temperature, the gap in the electronic density of
states, and presumably the ordered moments.
