A recent conjecture of Caputo, Carlen, Lieb, and Loss, and, independently, of
the contributor, states that the maximum of the permanent of a matrix whose rows are
unit vectors in l_p is attained either for the identity matrix I or for a
constant multiple of the all-1 matrix J.
  The conjecture is known to be true for p = 1 (I) and for p \ge 2 (J).
  We prove the conjecture for a subinterval of (1,2), and show the conjectured
upper bound to be true within a subexponential factor (in the dimension) for
all 1 < p < 2. In fact, for p bounded away from 1, the conjectured upper bound
is true within a constant factor.
  This leads to a mild (subexponential) improvement in deterministic
approximation factor for the permanent. We present an efficient deterministic
algorithm that approximates the permanent of a nonnegative n\times n matrix
within exp{n - O(n/\log n)}.
