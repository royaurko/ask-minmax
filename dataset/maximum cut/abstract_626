In this note we will show how to get consistency for first order classical
logic, in a purely syntactic way, without going through cut elimination. The
procedure is very simple and it uses the calculus of structures in an essential
way. It also shows how finitaryness (in the sense of finite choice of premises
for each rule) is actually a triviality (contrarily to what one would guess
from textbooks).
