We use ab initio molecular dynamics as a basis for quasi-chemical theory
evaluation of the free energy of water near conventional liquid thermodynamic
states. The PW91, PBE, and revised PBE (rPBE) functionals are employed. The
oxygen radial density distribution, gOO(r), using the rPBE functional is in
reasonable agreement with current experiments, whereas the PW91 and PBE
functionals predict a more structured gOO(r). The diffusion coefficient with
the rPBE functional is in reasonable accord with experiments. Using a maximum
entropy procedure, we obtain x_0 from the coordination number distribution x_n
for oxygen atoms having n neighbors. Likewise, we obtain p_0 from p_n, the
probability of observing cavities of specified radius containing n water
molecules. The probability x_0 is a measure of the local chemical interactions
and is central to the quasi-chemical theory of solutions. The probability p_0,
central to the theory of liquids, is a measure of the free energy required to
open cavities of defined sizes in the solvent. Using these values and a
reasonable model for electrostatic and dispersion effects, the hydration free
energy of water in water at 314K is calculated to be -5.1kcal/mole with the
rPBE functional, in encouraging agreement with the experimental value of
-6.1kcal/mole.
