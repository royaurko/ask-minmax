Longitudinal ternary and binary fission barriers of $^{36}$Ar, $^{56}$Ni and
$^{252}$Cf nuclei have been determined within a rotational liquid drop model
taking into account the nuclear proximity energy. For the light nuclei the
heights of the ternary fission barriers become competitive with the binary ones
at high angular momenta since the maximum lies at an outer position and has a
much higher moment of inertia.
