We study a class of martingale inequalities involving the running maximum
process. They are derived from pathwise inequalities introduced by
Henry_Labordere et al. (2013) and provide an upper bound on the expectation of
a function of the running maximum in terms of marginal distributions at n
intermediate time points. The class of inequalities is rich and we show that in
general no inequality is uniformly sharp - for any two inequalities we specify
martingales such that one or the other inequality is sharper. We then use our
inequalities to recover Doob's L^p inequalities. For p in (0,1] we obtain new,
or refined, inequalities.
