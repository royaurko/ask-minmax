It has been recently proposed by Dvali et al that high energy scattering in
non-renormalizable theories, like the higgsless Standard Model, can be
unitarized by the formation of classical configurations called classicalons. In
this work we argue that classicalons should have analogs of thermodynamic
properties like temperature and entropy and perform a model-independent
statistical mechanical analysis of classicalon decays. We find that, in the
case of massless quanta, the decay products have a Planck distribution with an
effective temperature T~1/r_* where r_* is the classicalon radius. These
results, in particular a computation of the decay multiplicity, N_*, allow us
to make the first collider analysis of classicalization. In the model for
unitarization of WW scattering by classicalization of longitudinal Ws and Zs we
get spectacular multi-W/Z final states that decay into leptons, missing energy
and a very high multiplicity (at least 10) of jets. We find that for the
classicalization scale, M_* = v=246 GeV (M_*=1 TeV) discovery should be
possible in the present 7 TeV (14 TeV) run of the LHC with about 10 /fb (100
/fb) data. We also consider a model to solve the hierarchy problem, where the
classicalons are configurations of the Higgs field which decay into to
multi-Higgs boson final states. We find that, in this case, for M_*=500 GeV
(M_*=1 TeV), discovery should be possible in the top fusion process with about
10 /fb (100 /fb) data at 14 TeV LHC.
