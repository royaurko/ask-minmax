Motivated by the algebraic open-closed string models, we introduce and
discuss an infinite-dimensional counterpart of the open-closed Hurwitz theory
describing branching coverings generated both by the compact oriented surfaces
and by the foam surfaces. We manifestly construct the corresponding
infinite-dimensional equipped Cardy-Frobenius algebra, with the closed and open
sectors are represented by conjugation classes of permutations and the pairs of
permutations, i.e. by the algebra of Young diagrams and bipartite graphes
respectively.
