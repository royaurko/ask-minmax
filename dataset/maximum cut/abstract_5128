We test the hypothesis of partially conserved axial current (PCAC) in high
energy diffractive neutrino production of pions. Since the pion pole
contribution to the Adler relation (AR) is forbidden by conservation of the
lepton current, the heavier states, like the a_1 pole, \rho-\pi-cut, etc.,
control the lifetime of the hadronic fluctuations of the neutrino. We evaluate
the deviation from the AR in diffractive neutrino-production of pions on proton
and nuclear targets. At high energies, when all the relevant time scales
considerably exceed the size of the target, the AR explicitly breaks down on an
absorptive target, such as a heavy nucleus. In this regime, close to the black
disc limit, the off-diagonal diffractive amplitudes vanish, while the diagonal
one, \pi->\pi, which enters the AR, maximizes and saturates the unitarity
bound. At lower energies, in the regime of short lifetime of heavy hadronic
fluctuations the AR is restored, i.e. it is not altered by the nuclear effects.
