We show that tidal interaction among galaxy clusters can account for their
observed alignments and very marked elongation and, consequently, that these
characteristics of clusters are actually consistent with them being formed in
hierarchical clustering. The well-established distribution of projected axial
ratios of clusters with richness class $R\ge 0$ is recovered very
satisfactorily by means of a simple model with no free parameters. The main
perturbers are relatively rich ($R\ge 1$) single clusters and/or groups of
clusters (superclusters) of a wider richness class ($R\ge 0$) located within a
distance of about 65 $h^{-1}$ Mpc from the perturbed cluster. This makes the
proposed scheme be also consistent with all reported alignment effects
involving clusters. We find that this tidal interaction is typically in the
saturate regime (\ie the maximum elongation allowed for systems in equilibrium
is reached), which explains the very similar intrinsic axial ratio shown by all
clusters. Tides would therefore play an important role in the dynamics of large
scale structures, in particular, they should be taken into account when
estimating the virial mass of clusters.
