Saturn's rings, reminiscent of an early Solar System present a unique
opportunity to investigate experimentally some mechanisms thought to be
responsible for planet and planetesimal formation in protoplanetary discs. Here
we extended the comparison of our numerical models of Prometheus encountering
the F ring employing non-interacting and interacting particles. Higher
resolution analysis revealed that the density increases known to exist at
channel edges is more complex and localised than previously thought. Asymmetry
between density increases on channel edges revealed that the channel edge
facing way from Prometheus to be the most stable but with lowest maximum
increases. However, on the channel edge facing Prometheus the interacting model
showed large chaotic fluctuations in the maximum density of some clumps, much
larger than those of the other channel. The likely cause of this asymmetry is a
variance in localised turbulence introduced into the F ring by Prometheus. High
resolution velocity dispersion maps showed that there was a spatial link
between the highest densities and the highest velocity dispersions in the
interacting model. Thus suggesting that the high velocity dispersion we see is
the reason for the observed inhomogeneous distribution of fans (evidence of
embedded moonlets) on some of the channel edges facing Prometheus.
