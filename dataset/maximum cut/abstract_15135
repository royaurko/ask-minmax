We present magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the atmospheres of hot
Jupiters ranging in temperature from 1100-1800K. Magnetic effects are
negligible in atmospheres with temperatures $\lesssim$ 1400K. At higher
temperatures winds are variable and in many cases, mean equatorial flows can
become westward, opposite to their hydrodynamic counterparts. Ohmic dissipation
peaks at temperatures $\sim$1500-1600K, depending on field strength, with
maximum values $\sim 10^{18}$W at 10bar, substantially lower than previous
estimates. Based on the limited parameter study done, this value can not be
increased substantially with increasing winds, higher temperatures, higher
field strengths, different boundary conditions or lower diffusivities. Although
not resolved in these simulations there is modest evidence that a magnetic
buoyancy instability may proceed in hot atmospheres.
