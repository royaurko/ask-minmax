The Maximum Entropy Method provides a Bayesian approach to reconstruct the
spectral functions from discrete points in Euclidean time. The applicability of
the approach at finite temperature is probed with the thermal meson correlation
function. Furthermore the influence of fuzzing/smearing techniques on the
spectral shape is investigated. We present first results for meson spectral
functions at several temperatures below and above $T_c$. The correlation
functions were obtained from quenched calculations with Clover fermions on
large isotropic lattices of the size $(24-64)^3 \times 16$. We compare the
resulting pole masses with the ones obtained from standard 2-exponential fits
of spatial and temporal correlation functions at finite temperature and in the
vacuum. The deviation of the meson spectral functions from free spectral
functions is examined above the critical temperature.
