In this paper we study a new family of black hole initial data sets
corresponding to distorted ``Kerr'' black holes with moderate rotation
parameters, and distorted Schwarzschild black holes with even- and odd-parity
radiation. These data sets build on the earlier rotating black holes of Bowen
and York and the distorted Brill wave plus black hole data sets. We describe
the construction of this large family of rotating black holes. We present a
systematic study of important properties of these data sets, such as the size
and shape of their apparent horizons, and the maximum amount of radiation that
can leave the system during evolution. These data sets should be a very useful
starting point for studying the evolution of highly dynamical black holes and
can easily be extended to 3D.
