The structure of graphs with a 2-vertex-cut that are critical with respect to
the Euler genus is studied. A general theorem describing the building blocks is
presented. These constituents, called hoppers and cascades, are classified for
the case when Euler genus is small. As a consequence, the complete list of
obstructions of connectivity 2 for embedding graphs into the Klein bottle is
obtained.
