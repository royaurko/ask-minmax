Continuous-time Markov processes over finite state-spaces are widely used to
model dynamical processes in many fields of natural and social science. Here,
we introduce an maximum likelihood estimator for constructing such models from
data observed at a finite time interval. This estimator is dramatically more
efficient than prior approaches, enables the calculation of deterministic
confidence intervals in all model parameters, and can easily enforce important
physical constraints on the models such as detailed balance. We demonstrate and
discuss the advantages of these models over existing discrete-time Markov
models for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations.
