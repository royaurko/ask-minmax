We investigate the localization observed recently for locally non-hermitian
Hamiltonians by studying the effect of the amplification on the scaling
behavior of the transmission and reflection phases in 1D periodic chains of
$\delta$-potentials. The amplification here is represented by an imaginary term
added to the on-site potential. It is found that both phases of the
transmission and reflection amplitudes are strongly affected by the
amplification term. In particular, the phases in the region of amplification
become independent of the length scale while they oscillate strongly near the
maximum transmission (or reflection). The interference effects on the phase in
passive systems are used to interpret those observed in the presence of
amplification. The phases of the transmission and reflection are found to
oscillate in passive systems whith increasing periods in the allowed band for
the transmission phase while for the reflection phase, its initial value is
always less than $\pi /2$ in this band.
