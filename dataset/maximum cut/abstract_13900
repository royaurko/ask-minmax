Strong stability preserving (SSP) integrators for initial value ODEs preserve
temporal monotonicity solution properties in arbitrary norms. All existing SSP
methods, including implicit methods, either require small step sizes or achieve
only first order accuracy. It is possible to achieve more relaxed step size
restrictions in the discretization of hyperbolic PDEs through the use of both
upwind- and downwind-biased semi-discretizations. We investigate bounds on the
maximum SSP step size for methods that include negative coefficients and
downwind-biased semi-discretizations. We prove that the downwind SSP
coefficient for linear multistep methods of order greater than one is at most
equal to two, while the downwind SSP coefficient for explicit Runge--Kutta
methods is at most equal to the number of stages of the method. In contrast,
the maximal downwind SSP coefficient for second order Runge--Kutta methods is
shown to be unbounded. We present a class of such methods with arbitrarily
large SSP coefficient and demonstrate that they achieve second order accuracy
for large CFL number.
