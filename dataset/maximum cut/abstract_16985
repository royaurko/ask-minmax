Detection of the September maximum in the primary near-Earth daemon flux at
high (~60o) Northern latitudes by our set-up with a plane horizontal
scintillator is plagued by purely geometric factors; indeed, because of the
Earth's rotation axis being tilted, the daemons catching up with the Earth in
outer Near-Earth, Almost Circular Heliocentric Orbits (NEACHOs) strike the
Earth along close-to-horizontal paths. Nevertheless, application of only two
oppositely oriented, specially designed "dark electron multipliers" of the type
TEU-167d (only their dia.125-mm front disc is coated on the inside by a thick,
~0.5 um Al layer, which permits such multipliers to detect primarily daemons
flying inside them from the base to the disc) has made it possible for us to
detect in one experiment, at a confidence level of >3 sigma, a flux of daemons
captured from NEACHOs into Geocentric Earth-Surface-Crossing Orbits, as well as
to record a decrease in the velocity of these objects from ~10 to ~7 km/s in a
characteristic time of ~1 month resulting from their being slowed down in
transits through the Earth's body.
