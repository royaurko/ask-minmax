The time evolution equations of a simplified isolated ideal gas, the
"tetrahe- dral" gas, are derived. The dynamical behavior of the LMC complexity
[R. Lopez-Ruiz, H. L. Mancini, and X. Calbet, Phys. Lett. A 209, 321 (1995)] is
studied in this system. In general, it is shown that the complexity remains
within the bounds of minimum and maximum complexity. We find that there are
certain restrictions when the isolated "tetrahedral" gas evolves towards
equilibrium. In addition to the well-known increase in entropy, the quantity
called disequilibrium decreases monotonically with time. Furthermore, the
trajectories of the system in phase space approach the maximum complexity.
