The use of the minus identity lenses with the angle-cut collimator can
achieve high contrast image in high-energy proton radiography. This article
presents the principle of choosing the angle-cut aperture of the collimator for
the different energies and objects. The numerical simulation using the Monte
Carlo code Geant4 has been implemented to investigate the entire radiography
for the French test object. The optimum angle-cut apertures of the collimators
are also obtained for different energies.
