We study cut elimination for a multifocused variant of full linear logic in
the sequent calculus. The multifocused normal form of proofs yields problems
that do not appear in a standard focused system, related to the constraints in
grouping rule instances in focusing phases. We show that cut elimination can be
performed in a sensible way even though the proof requires some specific lemmas
to deal with multifocusing phases, and discuss the difficulties arising with
cut elimination when considering normal forms of proofs in linear logic.
