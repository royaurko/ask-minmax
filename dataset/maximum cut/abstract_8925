I begin by reviewing the arguments leading to a nonlinear generalisation of
Schrodinger's equation within the context of the maximum uncertainty principle.
Some exact and perturbative properties of that equation are then summarised:
those results depend on a free regulating/interpolation parameter $\eta$. I
discuss here how one may fix that parameter using energetics. Other issues
discussed are, a linear theory with an external potential that reproduces some
unusual exact solutions of the nonlinear equation, and possible symmetry
enhancements in the nonlinear theory.
