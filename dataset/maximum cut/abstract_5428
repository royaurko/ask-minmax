The Kepler spacecraft observes a host of target stars to detect transiting
planets. Requiring a 7.1 sigma detection in twelve quarters of data yields over
100,000 detections, many of which are false alarms. After a second cut is made
on a robust detection statistic, some 50,000 or more targets still remain.
These false alarms waste resources as they propagate through the remainder of
the software pipeline and so a method to discriminate against them is crucial
in maintaining the desired sensitivity to true events. This paper describes a
chi-square test which represents a novel application of the formalism developed
by Allen for false alarm mitigation in searches for gravitational waves. Using
this technique, the false alarm rate can be lowered to ~5%.
