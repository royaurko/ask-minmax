We analyze the renormalization of the NN interaction at low energies and the
deuteron bound state through the Chiral Two Pion Exchange Potential assumed to
be valid from zero to infinity. The short distance Van der Waals singularity
structure of the potential as well as the requirement of orthogonality
conditions on the wave functions determines that, after renormalization, in the
1S0 singlet channel and in the 3S1-3D1 triplet channel one can use the deuteron
binding energy, the asymptotic D/S ratio and the S-wave scattering lengths as
well as the chiral potential parameters as independent variables. We use then
the asymptotic wave function normalization As of the deuteron and the singlet
and triplet effective ranges to determine the chiral constants yielding c1, c3
and c4. The role of finite cut-off corrections, the loss of predictive power
due to uncertainties in the input data and the connection to OPE distorted
waves perturbative approaches is also discussed.
