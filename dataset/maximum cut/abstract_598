The transverse lattice approach to non-perturbative light-front hamiltonian
QCD is described. Preliminary results on the pi-rho system are presented, at
fixed DLCQ and Tamm-Dancoff cut-offs. A renormalised, approximately Lorentz
covariant light-front hamiltonian is found to leading order of the
colour-dielectric expansion, compatible with a massless pion. The pi
light-front wavefunction is compared with experiment. Exclusive processes agree
reasonably well, given the approximations, but inclusive processes, sensitive
to higher Fock state structure, still exhibit large cut-off artifacts.
