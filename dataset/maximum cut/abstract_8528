In this paper, we present some geometric properties of the maximum entropy
(MaxEnt) Tsallis- distributions under energy constraint. In the case q > 1,
these distributions are proved to be marginals of uniform distributions on the
sphere; in the case q < 1, they can be constructed as conditional distribu-
tions of a Cauchy law built from the same uniform distribution on the sphere
using a gnomonic projection. As such, these distributions reveal the relevance
of using Tsallis distributions in the microcanonical setup: an example of such
application is given in the case of the ideal gas.
