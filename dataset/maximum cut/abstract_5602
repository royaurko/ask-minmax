Negative differential resistance (NDR) with room temperature
peak-valley-ratio of 8 has been observed in a ballistic field-effect-transistor
(FET) based on graphene, having an oblique top gate. Graphene FETs with a top
gate inclination angle of 45 degrees and a drain-source distance of 400 nm were
fabricated on a chip cut from a 4 inch graphene wafer grown by CVD. From the 60
measured devices, NDR was observed only in the regions where the CVD graphene
displays the Raman signature of defectless monolayers. In other specific
positions on the wafer, where graphene quality was not high enough and the
Raman signature indicated the presence of defects, the ballistic character of
transport is lost and the graphene FETs display nonlinear drain-voltage
dependences tuned by the top and back gate voltage.
