A \emph{unichord} in a graph is an edge that is the unique chord of a cycle.
A \emph{square} is an induced cycle on four vertices. A graph is
\emph{unichord-free} if none of its edges is a unichord. We give a slight
restatement of a known structure theorem for unichord-free graphs and use it to
show that, with the only exception of the complete graph $K_4$, every
square-free, unichord-free graph of maximum degree~3 can be total-coloured with
four colours. Our proof can be turned into a polynomial time algorithm that
actually outputs the colouring. This settles the class of square-free,
unichord-free graphs as a class for which edge-colouring is NP-complete but
total-colouring is polynomial.
