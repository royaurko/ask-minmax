Inspired by the problem of sensory coding in neuroscience, we study the
maximum entropy distribution on weighted graphs with a given expected degree
sequence. This distribution on graphs is characterized by independent edge
weights parameterized by vertex potentials at each node. Using the general
theory of exponential family distributions, we prove the existence and
uniqueness of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the vertex parameters.
We also prove the consistency of the MLE from a single graph sample, extending
the results of Chatterjee, Diaconis, and Sly for unweighted (binary) graphs.
Interestingly, our extensions require an intricate study of the inverses of
diagonally dominant positive matrices. Along the way, we derive analogues of
the Erd\H{o}s-Gallai criterion of graphical sequences for weighted graphs.
