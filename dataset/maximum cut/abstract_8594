We consider static spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's equations
coupled to an SU(2) Yang Mills field that are smooth at the center of spherical
symmetry. We prove that with small cosmological constant there exist solutions
that possess a coordinate singularity at some r that is not maximum. The
singularity can be removed with a Kruskal-like change of coordinates.
