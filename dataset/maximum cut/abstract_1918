Semi-supervised clustering is an very important topic in machine learning and
computer vision. The key challenge of this problem is how to learn a metric,
such that the instances sharing the same label are more likely close to each
other on the embedded space. However, little attention has been paid to learn
better representations when the data lie on non-linear manifold. Fortunately,
deep learning has led to great success on feature learning recently. Inspired
by the advances of deep learning, we propose a deep transductive
semi-supervised maximum margin clustering approach. More specifically, given
pairwise constraints, we exploit both labeled and unlabeled data to learn a
non-linear mapping under maximum margin framework for clustering analysis.
Thus, our model unifies transductive learning, feature learning and maximum
margin techniques in the semi-supervised clustering framework. We pretrain the
deep network structure with restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) layer by layer
greedily, and optimize our objective function with gradient descent. By
checking the most violated constraints, our approach updates the model
parameters through error backpropagation, in which deep features are learned
automatically. The experimental results shows that our model is significantly
better than the state of the art on semi-supervised clustering.
