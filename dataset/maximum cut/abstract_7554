Splitting amplitudes are universal functions governing the collinear behavior
of scattering amplitudes for massless particles. We compute the two-loop g ->
gg splitting amplitudes in QCD, N=1, and N=4 super-Yang-Mills theories, which
describe the limits of two-loop n-point amplitudes where two gluon momenta
become parallel. They also represent an ingredient in a direct x-space
computation of DGLAP evolution kernels at next-to-next-to-leading order. To
obtain the splitting amplitudes, we use the unitarity sewing method. In
contrast to the usual light-cone gauge treatment, our calculation does not rely
on the principal-value or Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescriptions, even though the
loop integrals contain some of the denominators typically encountered in
light-cone gauge. We reduce the integrals to a set of 13 master integrals using
integration-by-parts and Lorentz invariance identities. The master integrals
are computed with the aid of differential equations in the splitting momentum
fraction z. The epsilon-poles of the splitting amplitudes are consistent with a
formula due to Catani for the infrared singularities of two-loop scattering
amplitudes. This consistency essentially provides an inductive proof of
Catani's formula, as well as an ansatz for previously-unknown 1/epsilon pole
terms having non-trivial color structure. Finite terms in the splitting
amplitudes determine the collinear behavior of finite remainders in this
formula.
