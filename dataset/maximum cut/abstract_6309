We show that the absence of outbursts during low states of VY Scl stars is
easily explained if white dwarfs in these systems are weakly magnetized ($\mu
\gta 5 10^{30}$ G cm$^{3}$). However, some of the VY Scl stars are observed to
have very slow declines to minimum and similarly slow rises to maximum. The
absence of outbursts during such intermediate (as opposed to low) states, which
last much longer than typical disc's viscous times, can be explained only if
accretion discs are absent when their temperatures would correspond to an
unstable state. This requires magnetic fields stronger than those explaining
outburst absence during low states, since white dwarfs in this sub-class of VY
Scl stars should have magnetic moments $\mu \gta 1.5 10^{33}$ G cm$^{3}$ i.e.
similar to those of Intermediate Polars. Since at maximum brightness several VY
Scl stars are SW Sex stars, this conclusion is in agreement with recent claims
about the magnetic nature of these systems.
