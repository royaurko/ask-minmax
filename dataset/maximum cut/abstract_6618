We solve the Faddeev equation in an exactly Poincare invariant formulation of
the three-nucleon problem. The dynamical input is a relativistic
nucleon-nucleon interaction that is exactly on-shell equivalent to the high
precision CDBonn NN interaction. S-matrix cluster properties dictate how the
two-body dynamics is embedded in the three-nucleon mass operator. We find that
for neutron laboratory energies above 20 MeV relativistic effects on Ay are
negligible. For energies below 20 MeV dynamical effects lower the nucleon
analyzing power maximum slightly by 2% and Wigner rotations lower it further up
to 10 % increasing thus disagreement between data and theory. This indicates
that three-nucleon forces must provide an even larger increase of the Ay
maximum than expected up to now.
