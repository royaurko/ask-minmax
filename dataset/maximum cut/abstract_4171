We study the scaling behavior of the step scaling function for SU(3) gauge
theory, employing the renormalization-group improved Iwasaki gauge action and
the perturbatively improved L\"uscher-Weisz gauge action. We confirm that the
step scaling functions from the improved gauge actions agree with that
previously obtained from the plaquette action within errors in the continuum
limit at both weak and strong coupling regions. We also investigate how
different choices of boundary counter terms for the improved gauge actions
affect the scaling behavior. In the extrapolation to the continuum limit, we
observe that the cut off dependence becomes moderate for the Iwasaki action, if
a perturbative reduction of scaling violations is applied to the simulation
results. We also measure the low energy scale ratio with the Iwasaki action,
and confirm its universality.
