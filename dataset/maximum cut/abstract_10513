We discuss various aspects of centimeter and millimeter wavelength continuum
and line observations of high redshift star forming galaxies. Perhaps the most
important lesson is that sensitive observations at submm through cm wavelengths
reveal a population of active star forming galaxies at high redshift which are
unseen in deep optical surveys due to dust obscuration. Current models suggest
that this population represents the formation of the spheroidal components of
galaxies at z between 2 and 5, constituting about half of the total amount of
cosmic star formation from the big bang to the present. High resolution imaging
at cm wavelengths provides sub-arcsecond astrometry, and can be used to search
for gravitational lensing and/or for the presence of an AGN. Radio continuum
observations provide unique information on the magnetic fields in early
galaxies, and give a gross indication of the star formation rate, while the
radio-to-submm spectral index provides a rough indication of source redshift.
Low J transitions of CO are redshifted into the cm bands for z > 2, allowing
for sensitive searches for CO emission over large volumes at high redshift. We
present recent results from the Very Large Array (VLA), and from the new 230
GHz MPIfR bolometer array at the IRAM 30m telescope. A wide field survey with
the bolometer array indicates a cut-off in the source distribution function at
FIR luminosities > 3e12 L_sun. Lastly, we summarize the scientific promise of
the New VLA.
