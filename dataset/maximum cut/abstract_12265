Since 1978 superconducting coupled cavities have been proposed as a sensitive
detector of gravitational waves. The interaction of the gravitational wave with
the cavity walls, and the esulting motion, induces the transition of some
energy from an initially excited cavity mode to an empty one. The energy
transfer is maximum when the frequency of the wave is equal to the frequency
difference of the two cavity modes. In 1984 Reece, Reiner and Melissinos built
a detector of the type proposed, and used it as a transducer of harmonic
mechanical motion, achieving a sensitivity to fractional deformations of the
order dx/x ~ 10^(-18). In this paper the working principles of the detector are
discussed and the last experimental results summarized. New ideas for the
development of a realistic gravitational waves detector are considered; the
outline of a possible detector design and its expected sensitivity are also
shown.
