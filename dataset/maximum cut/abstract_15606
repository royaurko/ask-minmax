We report on the observation of the Josephson effect between two strongly
interacting fermionic superfluids coupled through a thin tunneling barrier. We
prove that the relative population and phase are canonically conjugate
dynamical variables, coherently oscillating throughout the entire crossover
from molecular Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) superfluids. We measure the plasma frequency and we extract the Josephson
coupling energy, both exhibiting a non-monotonic behavior with a maximum near
the crossover regime. We also observe the transition from coherent to
dissipative dynamics, which we directly ascribe to the propagation of vortices
through the superfluid bulk. Our results highlight the robust nature of
resonant superfluids, opening the door to the study of the dynamics of
superfluid Fermi systems in the presence of strong correlations and
fluctuations.
