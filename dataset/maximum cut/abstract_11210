We report evidence for persistent giant and rapid X-ray variability in the
radio-quiet, ultrasoft, strong Fe II, narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy IRAS
13224-3809. Within a 30 day ROSAT High Resolution Imager (HRI) monitoring
observation at least five giant amplitude count rate variations are visible,
with the maximum observed amplitude of variability being about a factor of 60.
We detect a rise by a factor of about 57 in just two days. IRAS 13224-3809
appears to be the most X-ray variable Seyfert known, and its variability is
probably nonlinear. We carefully check the identification of the highly
variable X-ray source with the distant galaxy, and it appears to be secure. We
examine possible explanations for the giant variability. Unusually strong
relativistic effects and partial covering by occulting structures on an
accretion disc can provide plausible explanations of the X-ray data, and we
explore these two scenarios. Relativistic boosting effects may be relevant to
understanding the strong X-ray variability of some steep spectrum Seyferts more
generally.
