We report here that a new superconducting phase with much higher Tc has been
found in K intercalated FeSe compound with excess Fe. We successfully grew
crystals by precisely controlling the starting amount of Fe. Besides the
superconducting (SC) transition at ~30 K, we observed a sharp drop in
resistivity and a kink in susceptibility at 44 K. By combining thermodynamic
measurements with electron spin resonance (ESR), we demonstrate that this is a
new SC transition. Structural analysis unambiguously reveals two phases
coexisting in the crystals, which are responsible respectively for the SC
transitions at 30 and 44 K. The structural experiments and first-principles
calculations consistently indicate that the 44 K SC phase is close to a 122
structure, but with an unexpectedly large c-axis of 18.10 {\AA}. We further
find a novel monotonic dependence of the maximum Tc on the separation of
neighbouring FeSe layers.
