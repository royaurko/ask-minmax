In this paper we discuss the normal and superconducting state properties of
two pnictide superconductors, LaOFeAs and LaONiAs, using Migdal-Eliashberg
theory and density functional perturbation theory. For pure LaOFeAs, the
calculated electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda=0.21$ and
logarithmic-averaged frequency $\omega_{ln}=206 K$, give a maximum $T_c$ of 0.8
K, using the standard Migdal-Eliashberg theory. Inclusion of multiband effects
increases the Tc only marginally. To reproduce the experimental $T_c$, a 5-6
times larger coupling constant would be needed. Our results indicate that
standard electron-phonon coupling is not sufficient to explain
superconductivity in the whole family of Fe-As based superconductors. At the
same time, the electron-phonon coupling in Ni-As based compounds is much
stronger and its normal and superconducting state properties can be well
described by standard Migdal-Eliashberg theory.
