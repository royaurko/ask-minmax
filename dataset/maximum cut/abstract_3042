We present a correlation between two intrinsic parameters of GRB optical
afterglows. These are the isotropic luminosity at the maximum of the light
curve (Lpeak) and the time-integrated isotropic energy (Eiso) radiated after
the observed maximum. We test the correlation between the logarithms of (Eiso)
and (Lpeak) and finally we value the effect of the different samples of GRBs in
according with the first optical observation reduced to proper time.
