In this paper we outline the considerations required in order to select a
target star system for the Icarus interstellar mission. It is considered that
the maximum likely range for the Icarus vehicle will be 15 light-years, and a
list is provided of all known stars within this distance range. As the
scientific objectives of Icarus are weighted towards planetary science and
astrobiology, a final choice of target star(s) cannot be made until we have a
clearer understanding of the prevalence of planetary systems within 15
light-years of the Sun, and we summarize what is currently known regarding
planetary systems within this volume. We stress that by the time an
interstellar mission such as Icarus is actually undertaken, astronomical
observations from the solar system will have provided this information.
Finally, given the high proportion of multiple star systems within 15
light-years (including the closest of all stars to the Sun in the {\alpha}
Centauri system), we stress that a flexible mission architecture, able to visit
stars and accompanying planets within multiple systems, is desirable. This
paper is a submission of the Project Icarus Study Group.
