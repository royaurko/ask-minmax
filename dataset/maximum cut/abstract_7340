We study first structure formation in Lambda-dominated universes using large
cosmological N-body/SPH simulations. We consider a standard LCDM model and a
LWDM model in which the mass of the dark matter particles is taken to be m_X=10
keV. The linear power spectrum for the LWDM model has a characteristic cut-off
at a wavenumber k=200 /Mpc, suppressing the formation of low mass (< 10^6 Msun)
nonlinear objects early on. The absence of low mass halos in the WDM model
makes the formation of primordial gas clouds with molecular hydrogen very
inefficient at high redshifts. The first star-forming gas clouds form at z~21
in the WDM model, considerably later than in the CDM counterpart, and the
abundance of these gas clouds differs by an order of magnitude between the two
models. We carry out radiative transfer calculations by embedding massive
Population III stars in the gas clouds. We show that the volume fraction of
ionized gas rises up close to 100% by z=18 in the CDM case, whereas that of the
WDM model remains extremely small at a level of a few percent. Thus the WDM
model with m_X=10 keV is strongly inconsistent with the observed high optical
depth by the WMAP satellite.
