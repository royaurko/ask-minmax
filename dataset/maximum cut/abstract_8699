We study the tensor form factors for $P \to P$ and $P \to V$ transitions in
the light-front quark model with $P$ and $V$ being pseudoscalar and vector
mesons, respectively. We explore the behaviors of these form factors in the
entire physical range of $0\leq p^2\leq (M_i - M_f)^2$. At the maximum recoil
of $p^2=0$, we compare our results of the form factors in $B\to \pi,K,\rho,K^*$
with various other calculations in the literature.
