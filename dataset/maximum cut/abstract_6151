Convex operational models (COMs) are considered as great extrapolations to
larger settings of any statistical theory. In this article we generalize the
maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt) of Jaynes' to any COM. After expressing
Max-Ent in a geometrical and latttice theoretical setting, we are able to cast
it for any COM. This scope-ampli?cation opens the door to a new systematization
of the principle and sheds light into its geometrical structure.
