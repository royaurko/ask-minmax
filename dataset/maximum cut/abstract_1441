Recent numerical studies have demonstrated the possibility of achieving
substantial enhancements in the transmission of transverse-electric-polarized
electromagnetic fields through subwavelength slits in a thin metallic screen by
placing single or paired metallic cut-wire arrays at a close distance from the
screen. In this Letter, we report on the first experimental evidence of such
extraordinary transmission phenomena, via microwave (X/Ku-band) measurements on
printed-circuit-board prototypes. Experimental results agree very well with
full-wave numerical predictions, and indicate an intrinsic robustness of the
enhanced transmission phenomena with respect to fabrication tolerances and
experimental imperfections.
