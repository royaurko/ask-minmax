We consider the behavior of the slope of the nuclear structure function
$F_2^A$ in the kinematic region which will be explored in the eA HERA
collider. We demonstrate that, similarly to the nucleon case, a `turn over' is
predicted in this observable. Moreover, we predict that the presence of the
shadowing corrections implies that the maximum value of the slope is dependent
of the number of nucleons A, differently from the DGLAP predictions. Our
conclusion is that the measurement of this observable will allow to evidentiate
the presence of the shadowing corrections.
