We present theoretical and experimental considerations pertaining to deeply
inelastic heavy-flavour production at HERA. The various theoretical
uncertainties in the cross section calculation are discussed. Cuts are imposed
to determine the fraction of charm production accessible to the detectors. The
production of charm at asymptotic $Q^2$ and bottom production are also covered.
Experimental aspects include current charm production data analysis and
prospects for future analyses including anticipated high precision and
distinguishing photon-gluon fusion charm events from excitation from the charm
parton density. The feasibility of measuring $F_2^{b\overline b}(x,Q^2)$ is
investigated.
