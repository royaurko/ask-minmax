We use Integrability techniques to compute structure constants in N=4 SYM to
leading order. Three closed spin chains, which represent the single trace
gauge-invariant operators in N=4 SYM, are cut into six open chains which are
then sewed back together into some nice pants, the three-point function. The
algebraic and coordinate Bethe ansatz tools necessary for this task are
reviewed. Finally, we discuss the classical limit of our results, anticipating
some predictions for quasi-classical string correlators in terms of algebraic
curves.
