The production of the isoscalar Jp = 3+ didelta dibaryon d* by proton
inelastic scattering from deuteron targets is described in a double-scattering
Glauber approximation. Each scattering changes a target nucleon into a Delta
with the help of the isovector tensor force transmitted by pi and rho mesons.
The differential cross section constructed from empirical Love-Franey
nucleon-nucleon t-matrices and a simple model of d* shows a maximum of some 10
micro-b/sr at 70 deg (c.m.) for 500 MeV protons. The partial width of the decay
d* -> NN caused by the exchanges of the same mesons is found for this simple
model of d* to be about 9 MeV if the d* mass is 2100 MeV. The implications of
these results are discussed.
