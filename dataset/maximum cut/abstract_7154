We study the effects of anisotropic pressure on properties of the neutron
stars with hyperons inside its core within the framework of extended
relativistic mean field. It is found that the main effects of anisotropic
pressure on neutron star matter is to increase the stiffness of the equation of
state, which compensates for the softening of the EOS due to the hyperons. The
maximum mass and redshift predictions of anisotropic neutron star with
hyperonic core are quite compatible with the result of recent observational
constraints if we use the parameter of anisotropic pressure model $h \le
0.8$[1] and $\Lambda \le -1.15$ [2]. The radius of the corresponding neutron
star at $M$=1.4 $M_\odot$ is more than 13 km, while the effect of anisotropic
pressure on the minimum mass of neutron star is insignificant. Furthermore, due
to the anisotropic pressure in the neutron star, the maximum mass limit of
higher than 2.1 $M_\odot$ cannot rule out the presence of hyperons in the
neutron star core.
