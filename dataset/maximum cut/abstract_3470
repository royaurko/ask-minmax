We present the spectroscopic characterization of the unusual high-amplitude
very low mass pre-main-sequence periodic variable CHS7797. This study is based
on optical medium-resolution (R=2200) spectroscopy in the 6450-8600 A range,
carried out with GMOS-GEMINI-S in March 2011. Observations of CHS7797 have been
carried out at two distinct phases of the 17.8d period, namely at maximum and
four days before maximum. Four different spectral indices were used for the
spectral classification at these two phases, all of them well-suited for
spectral classification of young and obscured late M dwarfs. In addition, the
gravity-sensitive NaI (8183/8195 A) and KI (7665/7699 A) doublet lines were
used to confirm the young age of CHS7797. From the spectrum obtained at maximum
light we derived a spectral type (SpT) of M6.05, while for the spectrum taken
four days before maximum the derived SpT is M5.75. The derived SpTs confirm
that CHS7797 has a mass in the stellar-substellar boundary mass range. In
addition, the small differences in the derived SpTs at the two observed phases
may provide indirect hints that CHS7797 is a binary system of similar mass
components surrounded by a tilted circumbinary disk, a system similar to KH15D.
