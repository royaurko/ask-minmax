We report on the impact of hydrostatic pressure on the superconductivity of
optimally (Indium) doped SnTe which is established to be derived from a
topological crystalline insulating phase. Single crystals of Sn1-xInxTe were
synthesized by a modified Bridgman method that exhibited maximum
superconducting Tc of 4.4 K for x= 0.5. Hydrostatic pressure upto 2.5 GPa was
applied on the crystals of Sn0.5In0.5Te and electrical resistivity as a
function of temperature and pressure was measured. We observed decrease in
onset superconducting transition temperature from 4.4 K to 2.8 K on increasing
pressure from ambient to 2.5 GPa. The normal state resistivity also decreased
abruptly by an order of magnitude at 0.5 GPa but for higher pressures, the same
decreased marginally. From onset, offset and zero resistivity values, dTc/dP of
-0.6K/GPa was confirmed. The low temperature normal state resistivity followed
T^2 dependence suggesting Fermi liquid behaviour both for ambient and high
pressure data. This increase in metallic characteristics accompanied by normal
state Fermi liquid behaviour is in accordance with a dome structure for Tc
variation with varying carrier concentration.
