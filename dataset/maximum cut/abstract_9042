A beam's density matrix that is described by the superposition of excitation
on coherent states with thermal noise (SECST) is presented, and its matrix
elements in Fock space are calculated. The maximum information transmitted by
the SECST beam is derived. It is more than that by coherent light beam and
increases as the excitation photon number increases. In addition, the
nonclassicality of density matrix is demonstrated by calculating its Wigner
function.
