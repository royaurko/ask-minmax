In this Letter we present evidence for a spectral sequence among Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia). The sequence is based on the systematic variation of
several features seen in the near-maximum light spectrum. This sequence is
analogous to the recently noted photometric sequence among SNe Ia which shows a
relationship between the peak brightness of a SN Ia and the shape of its light
curve. In addition to the observational evidence we present a partial
theoretical explanation for the sequence. This has been achieved by producing a
series of non-LTE synthetic spectra in which only the effective temperature is
varied. The synthetic sequence nicely reproduces most of the differences seen
in the observed one and presumably corresponds to the amount of 56Ni produced
in the explosion.
