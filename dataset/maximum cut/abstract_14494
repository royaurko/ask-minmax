The enhancement of Er$^{3+}$-based up-conversion for photovoltaics in
multilayer porous silicon photonic structures is considered theoretically and
experimentally. Transfer matrix simulations are used to assess the increased
photonic density of states that results from the slowing of energy propagation
at the short-wavelength edge of one-dimensional photonic band gaps. An indirect
calculation of Er$^{3+}$ absorption enhancement within slow-light modes is then
used to illustrate an increase in absorption over the bulk value: the effective
absorption coefficient is shown to increase by more than 22% over a broad
spectral region and by more than 400% over a narrow region. Erbium-doped porous
silicon photonic crystals are fabricated with the photonic band edge coincident
with the $^{4}I_{15/2} \rightarrow^{4}I_{13/2}$ Er$^{3+}$ transition.
Challenges in fabrication and the results of compositional analysis are
discussed. An angular-dependent photoluminescence measurement demonstrates
emission intensity that varies non-monotonically with the position of the
photonic band edge. A maximum of 26.6$\times$ enhancement of Er$^{3+}$ emission
intensity is observed for the 550-nm transition, with lower enhancement factors
seen for longer wavelengths.
