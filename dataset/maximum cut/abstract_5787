The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory records the air showers
produced by cosmic rays and gamma rays at a rate of about 20 kHz. While the
events observed by HAWC are 99.9% hadronic cosmic rays, this background can be
strongly suppressed using topological cuts that preferentially select
electromagnetic air showers. Using this capability of HAWC, we can create a
sample of air showers dominated by gamma rays and cosmic electrons and
positrons. HAWC is one of the few operating observatories capable of measuring
showers produced by electron and positron primaries above 1 TeV, and can record
these showers from two-thirds of the sky each day. We describe the sensitivity
of HAWC to leptonic cosmic rays, and discuss prospects for the measurement of
the combined $e^+e^-$ flux and possible approaches for positron and electron
charge separation with the HAWC detector.
