We present the results based on R-band polarimetric follow-up observations of
the nearby (~10 Mpc) Type II-plateau SN 2012aw. Starting from ~10 days after
the SN explosion, these polarimetric observations cover ~90 days (during the
plateau phase) and are distributed over 9 epochs. To characterize the Milky Way
interstellar polarization (ISP_MW ), we have observed 14 field stars lying in a
radius of 10 degree around the SN. We have also tried to subtract the host
galaxy dust polarization component assuming that the dust properties in the
host galaxy are similar to that observed for Galactic dust and the general
magnetic field follow the large scale structure of the spiral arms of a galaxy.
After correcting the IS_PMW , our analysis infer that SN 2012aw has maximum
polarization of 0.85% +- 0.08% but polarization angle does not show much
variation with a weighted mean value of ~138 degree. However, if both ISP_MW
and host galaxy polarization (ISP_HG ) components are subtracted from the
observed polarization values of SN, maximum polarization of the SN becomes
0.68% +- 0.08%. The distribution of Q and U parameters appears to follow a loop
like structure. The evolution of polarimetric light curve (PLC) properties of
this event is also compared with other well studied core-collapse supernovae of
similar type.
