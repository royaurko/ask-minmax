Today reactor neutrino experiments are at the cutting edge of fundamental
research in particle physics. Understanding the neutrino is far from complete,
but thanks to the impressive progress in this field over the last 15 years, a
few research groups are seriously considering that neutrinos could be useful
for society. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) works with its
Member States to promote safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies. In a
context of international tension and nuclear renaissance, neutrino detectors
could help IAEA to enforce the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT). In this article we discuss a futuristic neutrino application to
detect and localize an undeclared nuclear reactor from across borders. The SNIF
(Secret Neutrino Interactions Finder) concept proposes to use a few hundred
thousand tons neutrino detectors to unveil clandestine fission reactors. Beyond
previous studies we provide estimates of all known background sources as a
function of the detector's longitude, latitude and depth, and we discuss how
they impact the detectability.
