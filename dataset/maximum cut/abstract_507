We introduce a new concept of split-ball resonator and demonstrate a strong
magnetic dipole response for both gold and silver spherical plasmonic
nanoparticles with nanometer-scale cuts. Tunability of the magnetic dipole
resonance throughout the visible spectral range is demonstrated by changing the
depth and width of the nanoscale cut. We realize this novel concept
experimentally by employing the laser-induced transfer method to produce
near-perfect spheres and helium ion beam milling to make cuts with the
nanometer resolution. Due to high quality of the spherical particle shape
governed by strong surface tension forces during the laser transfer process and
clean, straight side walls of the cut made by helium ion milling, the magnetic
resonance is observed at 600 nm in gold and at 565 nm in silver nanoparticles.
Structuring arbitrary features on the surface of nanoscale spherical resonators
provides new ways for engineering hybrid resonant modes and ultra-high
near-field enhancement.
