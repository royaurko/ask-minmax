The stationary states of systems with many molecular motors are studied
theoretically for uniaxial and centered (aster-like) arrangements of
cytoskeletal filaments using Monte Carlo simulations and a two-state model.
Mutual exclusion of motors from binding sites of the filaments is taken into
account. For small overall motor concentration, the density profiles are
exponential and algebraic in uniaxial and centered filament systems,
respectively. For uniaxial systems, exclusion leads to the coexistence of
regions of high and low densities of bound motors corresponding to motor
traffic jams, which grow upon increasing the overall motor concentration. These
jams are insensitive to the motor behavior at the end of the filament. In
centered systems, traffic jams remain small and an increase in the motor
concentration leads to a flattening of the profile, if the motors move inwards,
and to the build-up of a concentration maximum in the center of the aster if
motors move outwards. In addition to motors density patterns, we also determine
the corresponding patterns of the motor current.
