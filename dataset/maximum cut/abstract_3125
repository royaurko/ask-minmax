We show that Skilling's method of induction leads to a unique general theory
of inductive inference, the method of Maximum relative Entropy (ME). The main
tool for updating probabilities is the logarithmic relative entropy; other
entropies such as those of Renyi or Tsallis are ruled out. We also show that
Bayes updating is a special case of ME updating and thus, that the two are
completely compatible.
