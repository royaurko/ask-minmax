We report that electricity can be generated from limitless thermal motion of
ions by two dimensional (2D) surface of silicon wafer at room temperature. A
typical silicon device, on which asymmetric electrodes with Au and Ag thin
films were fabricated, can generate a typical open-circuit voltage up to 0.40 V
in 5 M CuCl2 solution and an output current over 11 {\mu}A when a 25 k{\Omega}
resistor was loaded into the circuit. Positive correlation between the output
current and the temperature, as well as the concentration, was observed. The
maximum output current and power density are 17 {\mu}A and 8.6 {\mu}W/cm2,
respectively. The possibility of chemical reaction was excluded by four groups
of control experiments. A possible dynamic drag mechanism was proposed to
explain the experimental results. This finding further demonstrates that
ambient heat in the environment can be harvested by 2D semiconductor surfaces
or low dimensional materials and would contribute significantly to the research
of renewable energy. However, this finding does not agree with the second law
of thermal dynamatics. A lot of future work will be needed to study the
mechanism behind this phenomenon.
