We describe a new method, based on an extension of the unitarity cutting
rules proposed earlier, which is very efficient for the algorithmic evaluation
of phase-space integrals for various differential distributions. As a first
application, we compute the next-to-leading order normalized rapidity
distribution of the CP-even and the CP-odd Higgs boson produced in hadron
collisions through gluon fusion. We work in the heavy top-quark approximation;
we find that the NLO corrections at the LHC are approximately 5% in the zero
rapidity region.
