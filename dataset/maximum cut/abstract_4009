Starting from a random matrix model, we construct the low-energy effective
field theory for the noninteracting gas of quasiparticles of a disordered
superconductor in the mixed state. The theory is a nonlinear sigma model, with
the order parameter field being a supermatrix whose form is determined solely
on symmetry grounds. The weak localization correction to the field-axis thermal
conductivity is computed for a dilute array of s-wave vortices near the lower
critical field H_c1. We propose that weak localization effects, cut off at low
temperatures by the Zeeman splitting, are responsible for the field dependence
of the thermal conductivity seen in recent high-T_c experiments by Aubin et al.
