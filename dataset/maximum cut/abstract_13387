In order to study the origin of high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations
observed in X-ray binaries, Kato (2004) suggested a resonant excitation
mechanism of disk oscillations in deformed disks. In this paper, we study
numerically, following his formulation, whether trapped g-mode oscillations in
a warped disk, where the warp amplitude varies with radius, can be excited by
this mechanism. For simplicity, we adopt Newtonian hydrodynamic equations with
relativistic expressions for the characteristic frequencies of disks. We also
assume that the accretion disk is isothermal. We find that the fundamental
modes of trapped g-mode oscillations with eigenfrequencies close to the maximum
of epycyclic frequency are excited. The intermediate oscillations found are
isolated in a narrow region around the resonance radius. After varying some
parameters, we find that the growth rate increases as the warp amplitude or the
black hole spin parameter increases, while it decreases as the sound speed
increases.
