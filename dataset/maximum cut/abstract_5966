By using the maximum entropy principle, with Tsallis entropy, we obtain an
explicit dependence for energy distribution of earthquakes. This function
describes very well the observations in a wide range of energies, where other
distribution functions fail. We assume that the fragments filling the gap
between the fault planes play an active role in the triggering of earthquakes.
The energy distribution function is related to the size distribution function
of these fragments.
