We study the effects of electron correlation on transport through an
interacting region connected to multi-mode leads based on the perturbation
expansion with respect to the inter-electron interaction. At zero temperature
the conductance defined in the Kubo formalism can be written in terms of a
single-particle Green's function at the Fermi energy, and it can be mapped onto
a transmission coefficient of the free quasiparticles described by an effective
Hamiltonian. We apply this formulation to a two-dimensional Hubbard model of
finite size connected to two noninteracting leads. We calculate the conductance
in the electron-hole symmetric case using the order $U^2$ self-energy. The
conductance shows several maximums in the $U$ dependence in some parameter
regions of $t_y/t_x$, where $t_x$ ($t_y$) is the hopping matrix element in the
$x$- ($y$-) directions. This is caused by the resonance occurring in some of
the subbands, and is related with the $U$ dependence of the eigenvalues of the
effective Hamiltonian.
