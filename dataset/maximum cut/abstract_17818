In multiple antenna systems, phase noise due to instabilities of the
radio-frequency (RF) oscillators, acts differently depending on whether the RF
circuitries connected to each antenna are driven by separate (independent)
local oscillators (SLO) or by a common local oscillator (CLO). In this paper,
we investigate the high-SNR capacity of single-input multiple-output (SIMO) and
multiple-output single-input (MISO) phase-noise channels for both the CLO and
the SLO configurations.
  Our results show that the first-order term in the high-SNR capacity expansion
is the same for all scenarios (SIMO/MISO and SLO/CLO), and equal to $0.5\ln
(\rho)$, where $\rho$ stands for the SNR. On the contrary, the second-order
term, which we refer to as phase-noise number, turns out to be
scenario-dependent. For the SIMO case, the SLO configuration provides a
diversity gain, resulting in a larger phase-noise number than for the CLO
configuration. For the case of Wiener phase noise, a diversity gain of at least
$0.5 \ln(M)$ can be achieved, where $M$ is the number of receive antennas. For
the MISO, the CLO configuration yields a higher phase-noise number than the SLO
configuration. This is because with the CLO configuration one can obtain a
coherent-combining gain through maximum ratio transmission (a.k.a. conjugate
beamforming). This gain is unattainable with the SLO configuration.
