Influence of the neutrino mass submatrix $M_L$ on the e-e- -> W-W- process is
discussed. Taking into account various possible CP signatures of heavy
neutrinos it is shown that, in some cases, nonzero $M_L$ substantially changes
predictions for maximum possible values of the e-e- -> W-W- cross section. A
direct role of the $\omega^2$ parameter (coming from neutrinoless double beta
decay) is clarified. The consequences of doubly charged Higgs particles
$\delta^{--}$ with resonances even far away from energies of the future linear
lepton collider ($\sqrt{s}=0.5-1$ TeV) are studied.
