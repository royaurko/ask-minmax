This paper describes a graph clustering algorithm that aims to minimize the
normalized cut criterion and has a model order selection procedure. The
performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to spectral approaches in
terms of minimizing normalized cut. However, unlike spectral approaches, the
proposed algorithm scales to graphs with millions of nodes and edges. The
algorithm consists of three components that are processed sequentially: a
greedy agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure, model order selection,
and a local refinement.
  For a graph of n nodes and O(n) edges, the computational complexity of the
algorithm is O(n log^2 n), a major improvement over the O(n^3) complexity of
spectral methods. Experiments are performed on real and synthetic networks to
demonstrate the scalability of the proposed approach, the effectiveness of the
model order selection procedure, and the performance of the proposed algorithm
in terms of minimizing the normalized cut metric.
