This paper introduces a graph Laplacian regularization in the hyperspectral
unmixing formulation. The proposed regularization relies upon the construction
of a graph representation of the hyperspectral image. Each node in the graph
represents a pixel's spectrum, and edges connect spectrally and spatially
similar pixels. The proposed graph framework promotes smoothness in the
estimated abundance maps and collaborative estimation between homogeneous areas
of the image. The resulting convex optimization problem is solved using the
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). A special attention is
given to the computational complexity of the algorithm, and Graph-cut methods
are proposed in order to reduce the computational burden. Finally, simulations
conducted on synthetic data illustrate the effectiveness of the graph Laplacian
regularization with respect to other classical regularizations for
hyperspectral unmixing.
