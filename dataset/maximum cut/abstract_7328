We study here, from first principles, what properties of voids are to be
expected in a fractal point distribution and how the void distribution is
related to its morphology. We show this relation in various examples and apply
our results to the distribution of galaxies. If the distribution of galaxies
forms a fractal set, then this property results in a number of scaling laws to
be fulfilled by voids. Consider a fractal set of dimension $D$ and its set of
voids. If voids are ordered according to decreasing sizes (largest void has
rank R=1, second largest R=2 and so on), then a relation between size $\Lambda$
and rank of the form $\Lambda (R) \propto R^{-z}$ must hold, with $z = d/D$,
and where $d$ is the euclidean dimension of the space where the fractal is
embedded. The physical restriction $D < d$ means that $z > 1$ in a fractal set.
The average size $\bar \Lambda$ of voids depends on the upper ($\Lambda_u$) and
the lower ($\Lambda_l$) cut-off as ${\bar \Lambda} \propto \Lambda_u^{1-D/d}
\Lambda_l^{D/d}$. Current analysis of void sizes in the galaxy distribution do
not show evidence of a fractal distribution, but are insufficient to rule it
out. We identify possible shortcomings of current void searching algorithms,
such as changes of shape in voids at different scales or merging of voids, and
propose modifications useful to test fractality in the galaxy distribution.
