This paper considers the controllability analysis and fault tolerant control
problem for a class of hexacopters. It is shown that the considered hexacopter
is uncontrollable when one rotor fails, even though the hexacopter is
over-actuated and its controllability matrix is row full rank. According to
this, a fault tolerant control strategy is proposed to control a degraded
system, where the yaw states of the considered hexacopter are ignored.
Theoretical analysis indicates that the degraded system is controllable if and
only if the maximum lift of each rotor is greater than a certain value. The
simulation and experiment results on a prototype hexacopter show the
feasibility of our controllability analysis and degraded control strategy.
