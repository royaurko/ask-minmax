Intermediate resolution phase-resolved spectra of WZ Sge were obtained on
five consecutive nights (July 23 -- 27) covering the initial stage of the 2001
superoutburst. Double-peaked emission lines of He\textsc{II} at 4686 \AA, which
were absent on July 23, emerged on July 24 together with emission lines of
C\textsc{III} / N\textsc{III} Bowen blend. Analyses of the He\textsc{II}
emission lines using the Doppler tomography revealed an asymmetric spiral
structure on the accretion disk. This finding demonstrates that spiral shocks
with a very short orbital period can arise during the initial stage of an
outburst and may be present in all SU UMa stars.
