The THGEMs based on ceramic substrate were developed successfully for neutron
and single photon detection. The influences on thermal neutron scattering and
the internal radioactivity of both ceramic and FR-4 substrates were studied and
compared. The ceramic THGEMs are homemade of 200 um hole diameter, 600 um
pitch, 200 um thickness, 80 um rim, and 50 mm*50 mm sensitive area. The FR-4
THGEMs with the same geometry were used for the reference. The gas gain, energy
resolution and gain stability were measured in different gas mixtures by using
the 5.9 keV X-rays. The maximum gain of single layer ceramic THGEM reaches
6*104 and 1.5*104 at Ne+CH4 = 95:5 and Ar+i-C4H10 = 97:3, respectively. The
energy resolution is better than 24%. The good gain stability was obtained
during more than 100 hour continuous test at Ar+CO2 = 80:20. By using the 239Pu
source, the alpha deposited energy spectrum and gain curve of ceramic THGEM
were measured.
