In this contribution we review a series of simple one dimensional lattice
models that with an appropriate choice of parameters can account for various
anomalous features of the behaviour of complex systems such as water. In
particular, we will focus on the presence of $p-T$ fluid-solid coexistence
lines with negative slope (i.e. solids that melt upon compression), solid
phases less dense than the liquid phase, and the existence of temperatures of
maximum density. We will see how a simple two-parameter model can reproduce the
phase behaviour of a range of systems well known for their anomalous behaviour
regarding the temperature and pressure dependence of properties such as
density, diffusivity or viscosity.
