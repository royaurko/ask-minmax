A complete version of the Moscow NN potential model is presented. The
excellent description for all essential partial waves has been found in the
energy range 0 -- 350 MeV. The one-channel version of the model includes the
orthogonality condition to most symmetric six-quark states in all lowest
partial waves and thus, from this point of view, the model generalizes the well
known Saito's orthogonality condition model (OCM) for the baryon-baryon
interaction case. The specific features of the presented model which
distinguish it from many conventional force models are discussed in details.
One of them is a specific tensor mixing between nodal and nodeless
wavefunctions which results in very reasonable values of the OPE cut-off
parameter \Lambda =0.78 GeV and the \pi NN-coupling constant value f^2=0.075 in
nice agreement with modern trends. The model, in case of its confirmation in
precise few-nucleon calculations, can lead to noticeable revisions for many
nuclear properties given by conventional force models.
