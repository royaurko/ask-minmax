We test accurate models of Comptonisation spectra over BeppoSAX observations
of Seyfert galaxies focusing on the long look at NGC 5548. The hot plasma
temperature derived with these models is significantly higher than that
obtained fitting the same data with a power law plus high energy cut off model
for the continuum. This is due to the fact that in anisotropic geometries
Comptonisation spectra show "intrinsic" curvature which moves the fitted high
energy cut-off to higher energies. We also show preliminary results of our
analysis of a sample of 5 other Seyfert galaxies.
