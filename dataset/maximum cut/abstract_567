Fixed point actions for free and interacting staggered lattice fermions are
constructed by iterating renormalization group transformations. At large N the
fixed point action for the Gross-Neveu model is a perfect action in the sense
of Hasenfratz and Niedermayer, i.e. cut-off effects are completely eliminated.
In particular, the fermionic 1-particle energy spectrum of the lattice theory
is identical with the one of the continuum even for arbitrarily small
correlation lengths. The cut-off effects of the chiral condensate are
eliminated using a perfect operator. (The paper is stored as a ps-file
containing both the text and 5 figures.)
