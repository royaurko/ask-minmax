We construct an effective action for QCD by expanding the quark determinant
in powers of the chemical potential at finite temperature in the case of
massless quarks. To cut the infinite series we adopt the Weinberg power
counting criteria. We compute the minimal effective action (~p^4), expanding in
the external momentum, which implies the use of the hard thermal loop
approximation. Our main result is a gauge invariant expression for the phase
theta of the functional determinant in QCD, and recovers dimensional reduction
in the high-temperature limit. We compute, analytically, <theta^2> in the range
of p << 2 pi T, including perturbative and nonperturbative contributions, the
latter treated within the mean field approximation. Implications for lattice
simulations are briefly discussed.
