We study the small time asymptotics of the gradient and Hessian of the
logarithm of the heat kernel at the cut locus, giving, in principle, complete
expansions for both quantities. We relate the leading terms of the expansions
to the structure of the cut locus, especially to conjugacy, and we provide a
probabilistic interpretation in terms of the Brownian bridge. In particular, we
show that the cut locus is the set of points where the Hessian blows up faster
than 1/t. We also study the distributional asymptotics and use them to compute
the distributional Hessian of the energy function (that is, one-half the
distance function squared).
