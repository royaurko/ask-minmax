It is found here that the 1/2+ first excited state of 9Be is a virtual state
with the energy of -23.5 KeV. The line shape for the excitation of the state is
approximated with a simple analytic form based on the effective range
expansion. The partner in 9B of this state is found to be a resonance with a
maximum in the peak at about 1.1 MeV, FWHM of 1.5 MeV, and complex energy of
0.6-i0.75 MeV. The line shape for its excitation is calculated in terms of the
p-8Be phase shift. The phase shifts are obtained from N-8Be effective
potentials deduced from the data on on the photodisintegration of 9Be. A
possibility for direct extraction of the energy of the resonant state from
experimental data is also discussed, and an expression for a residue at a
virtual state pole in terms of a quadrature taken over the virtual state
eigenfunction is given.
