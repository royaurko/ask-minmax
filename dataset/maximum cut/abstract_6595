We present angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data on
moderately underdoped La$_{1.855}$Sr$_{0.145}$CuO$_4$ at temperatures below and
above the superconducting transition temperature. Unlike previous studies of
this material, we observe sharp spectral peaks along the entire underlying
Fermi surface in the superconducting state. These peaks trace out an energy gap
that follows a simple {\it d}-wave form, with a maximum superconducting gap of
14 meV. Our results are consistent with a single gap picture for the cuprates.
Furthermore our data on the even more underdoped sample
La$_{1.895}$Sr$_{0.105}$CuO$_4$ also show sharp spectral peaks, even at the
antinode, with a maximum superconducting gap of 26 meV.
