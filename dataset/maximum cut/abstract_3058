We have developed a model for a life insurance policy. In this model the net
gain is calculated by computer simulation for a particular type of lifetime
distribution function. We observed that the net gain becomes maximum for a
particular value of upper age of last premium. This paper is dedicated to
Professor Dietrich Stauffer on the occassion of his 60-th birthday.
