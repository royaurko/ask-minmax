We have reexamined data on the possible two dimensional metal-insulator
transition at B=0 in Si-MOSFETs using a nonlinear regression method to extract
all scaling parameters in a single fit. By keeping track of the magnitude of
errors in the data we can use the normalized mean square deviation \chi^2 of
the fit as a quantitative measure of how well the data is compatible with
scaling. We have used this method to study electric field scaling in three
different samples. We find rather good agreement of the data with scaling in
individual fits, i.e. \chi^2's of about 1, but also rather large variations in
the fits depending on how cut-offs are introduced in the data. In particular,
we report how fitted parameters vary when we cut away data that are either far
from the critical point or at low excitation power, where temperature effects
presumably dominate. In this way we find the critical E-field exponent \beta to
vary from about 3.2 to 3.9 with considerably smaller statistical error
estimates in each fit.
