Isothermal magnetization curves are plotted as the magnetization times the
magnetic induction, $4 \pi M \cdot B$, versus the applied field, H. We show
here that this new curve is the average kinetic energy of the superconducting
state versus the applied field, for type-II superconductors with a high
Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa$. The maximum of $4 \pi M \cdot B$ occurs at
a field, $H^{*}$, directly related to the upper critical field, $H_{c2}$,
suggesting that $H_{c2}(T)$ may be extracted from such plots even in cases when
it is too high for direct measurement. We obtain these plots both
theoretically, from the Ginzburg-Landau theory, and experimentally, using a
Niobium sample with $T_c = 8.5 K$, and compare them.
