We prove the existence of at least two solutions for a fourth order equation,
which includes the vortex equations for the U(1) and CP(1) self-dual
Maxwell-Chern-Simons models as special cases. Our method is variational, and it
relies on an "asymptotic maximum principle" property for a special class of
supersolutions to this fourth order equation.
