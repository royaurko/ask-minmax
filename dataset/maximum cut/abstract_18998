The results of a spectroscopic survey of epsilon Aurigae during eclipse using
a network of small telescopes are presented. The spectra have a resolution of
0.35 to 0.65{\AA} and cover the period 2008 to 2012 with a typical interval of
4 days during eclipse. This paper specifically covers variations in the K I
7699{\AA}, Na D and Mg II 4481{\AA} lines. Absorption started increasing in the
KI 7699{\AA} line 3 months before the eclipse began photometrically and had not
returned to pre eclipse levels by the end of the survey March 2012, 7 months
after the brightness had returned to normal outside eclipse levels. The
contribution of the eclipsing object to the KI 7699{\AA} line has been isolated
and the data show the excess absorption increasing and decreasing in a series
of steps during ingress and egress. This is interpreted as an indication of
structure within the eclipsing object. The F star is totally obscured by the
eclipsing object at the Na D wavelength during eclipse. The radial velocity of
the F star and the mean and maximum radial velocity of the eclipsing material
in front of the F star at any given time have been isolated and tracked
throughout the eclipse. The quasi-periodic variations seen in the F star RV
outside eclipse continued during the eclipse. It is hoped that these results
can be used to constrain proposed models of the system and its components.
