It is well known that the particular form of the two-particle correlation
function, in the collisional integral of the classical Boltzmman equation, fix
univocally the entropy of the system, which turn out to be the
Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy.
  In the ordinary relativistic Boltzmann equation, some standard
generalizations, with respect its classical version, imposed by the special
relativity, are customarily performed. The only ingredient of the equation,
which tacitly remains in its original classical form, is the two-particle
correlation function, and this fact imposes that also the relativistic kinetics
is governed by the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy. Indeed the ordinary
relativistic Boltzmann equation admits as stationary stable distribution, the
exponential Juttner distribution.
  Here, we show that the special relativity laws and the maximum entropy
principle, suggest a relativistic generalization also of the two-particle
correlation function and then of the entropy. The so obtained, fully
relativistic Boltzmann equation, obeys the H-theorem and predicts a stationary
stable distribution, presenting power-law tails in the high energy region. The
ensued relativistic kinetic theory preserves the main features of the classical
kinetics, which recovers in the $c \to \infty$ limit.
