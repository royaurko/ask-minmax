We have carried out an analysis of about 160 eclipse timings spanning over 30
years of the Hyades eclipsing binary V471 Tauri that shows a long-term
quasi-sinusoidal modulation of its observed eclipse arrival times. The O-Cs
have been analyzed for the ``light-time'' effect that arises from the
gravitational influence of a tertiary companion. The presence of a third body
causes the relative distance of the eclipsing pair to the Earth to change as it
orbits the barycenter of the triple system. The result of the analysis of the
eclipse times yields a light-time semi-amplitude of 137.2+/-12.0 s, an orbital
period of P_3 = 30.5+/-1.6 yr and an eccentricity of e_3 = 0.31+/-0.04. The
mass of the tertiary component is M_3 sin i_3 = 0.0393+/-0.0038 Mo when a total
mass of 1.61+/-0.06 Mo for V471 Tau is adopted. For orbital inclinations i_3 >
35 deg, the mass of the third body would be below the stable hydrogen burning
limit of M = 0.07 Mo and it thus would be a brown dwarf. In the next several
years (near maximum elongation), it should be feasible to obtain IR images and
spectra of V471 Tau C that, when combined with the known mass, age, distance,
and [Fe/H], will serve as a benchmark for understanding the physical properties
and evolution of brown dwarfs.
