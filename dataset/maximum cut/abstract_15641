The electron beam propagation in a plasma medium is susceptible to several
instabilities. In the relativistic regime typically the weibel instability
leading to the current separation dominates. The linear instability analysis is
carried out for a system wherein the transverse extent of the beam is infinite.
Even in simulations, infinite transverse extent of the beam has been chosen. In
real situations, however, beam width will always be finite. keeping this in
view the role of finite beam width on the evolution of the beam plasma system
has been studied here using Particle - in - Cell simulations. It is observed
that the current separation between the forward and return shielding current
for a beam with finite beam occurs at the scale length of the beam width
itself. Consequently the magnetic field structures that form have maximum power
at the scale length of the beam width. This behaviour is distinct from what
happens with a beam with having an infinite extent represented by simulations
in a periodic box, where the initial scale length at which the magnetic field
appears is that of the electron skin depth.
