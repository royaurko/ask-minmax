Define f(n,p) to be the maximum number of edges in a graph on n vertices with
p perfect matchings. Dudek and Schmitt proved there exist constants n_p and c_p
so that for even n >= n_p, f(n,p) = (n^2)/4+c_p. A graph is p-extremal if it
has p perfect matchings and (n^2)/4+c_p edges. Based on Lovasz's Two Ear
Theorem and structural results of Hartke, Stolee, West, and Yancey, we develop
a computational method for determining c_p and generating the finite set of
graphs which describe the infinite family of p-extremal graphs. This method
extends the knowledge of the size and structure of p-extremal graphs from p <=
10 to p <= 27. These values provide further evidence towards a conjectured
upper bound and prove the sequence c_p is not monotonic.
