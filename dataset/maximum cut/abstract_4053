We investigate the growth of a film of some element B on a substrate made of
another substrance A in a model of molecular beam epitaxy. A vertical exchange
mechanism allows the A-atoms to stay on the growing surface with a certain
probability. Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations as well as scaling
arguments, the incorporation of the A's into the growing B-layer is
investigated. Moreover we develop a rate equation theory for this process. In
the limit of perfect layer-by-layer growth, the density of A-atoms decays in
the B-film like the inverse squared distance from the interface. The power law
is cut off exponentially at a characteristic thickness of the interdiffusion
zone that depends on the rate of exchange of a B-adatom with an A-atom in the
surface and on the system size. Kinetic roughening changes the exponents. Then
the thickness of the interdiffusion zone is determined by the diffusion length.
