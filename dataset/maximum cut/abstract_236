In this paper we investigate the small time heat kernel asymptotics on the
cut locus on a class of surfaces of revolution, which are the simplest
2-dimensional Riemannian manifolds different from the sphere with non trivial
cut-conjugate locus. We determine the degeneracy of the exponential map near a
cut-conjugate point and present the consequences of this result to the small
time heat kernel asymptotics at this point. These results give a first example
where the minimal degeneration of the asymptotic expansion at the cut locus is
attained.
