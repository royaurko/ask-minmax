This work introduces algorithms able to exploit contextual information in
order to improve maximum-likelihood (ML) parameter estimation in finite mixture
models (FMM), demonstrating their benefits and properties in several scenarios.
The proposed algorithms are derived in a probabilistic framework with regard to
situations where the regular FMM graphs can be extended with context-related
variables, respecting the standard expectation-maximization (EM) methodology
and, thus, rendering explicit supervision completely redundant. We show that,
by direct application of the missing information principle, the compared
algorithms' learning behaviour operates between the extremities of supervised
and unsupervised learning, proportionally to the information content of
contextual assistance. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of
context-aware FMM training as compared to conventional unsupervised training in
terms of estimation precision, standard errors, convergence rates and
classification accuracy or regression fitness in various scenarios, while also
highlighting important differences among the outlined situations. Finally, the
improved classification outcome of contextually enhanced FMMs is showcased in a
brain-computer interface application scenario.
