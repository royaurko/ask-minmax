Financial data are as a rule asymmetric, although most econometric models are
symmetric. This applies also to continuous-time models for high-frequency and
irregularly spaced data. We discuss some asymmetric versions of the
continuous-time GARCH model, concentrating then on the GJR-COGARCH. We
calculate higher order moments and extend the first jump approximation. These
results are prerequisites for moment estimation and pseudo maximum likelihood
estimation of the GJR-COGARCH parameters, respectively, which we derive in
detail.
