We investigate the possibility of detecting dark matter at TeV scale linear
colliders in the scenario where the dark matter is a massive particle weakly
interacting only with the Higgs boson $h$ in the low energy effective theory
(the Higgs portal dark matter scenario). The dark matter in this scenario would
be difficult to be tested at the CERN Large Hadron Collider when the decay of
the Higgs boson into a dark matter pair is not kinematically allowed. We study
whether even in such a case the dark matter $D$ can be explored or not via the
$Z$ boson fusion process at the International Linear Collider and also at a
multi TeV lepton collider. It is found that for the collision energy
$\sqrt{S}>1$ TeV with the integrated luminosity 1 ab$^{-1}$, the signal
($e^{\pm}e^-\to e^{\pm}e^-h^\ast \to e^{\pm}e^-DD$) can be seen after
appropriate kinematic cuts. In particular, when the dark matter is a fermion or
a vector, which is supposed to be singlet under the standard gauge symmetry,
the signal with the mass up to 100 GeV can be tested for the Higgs boson mass
to be 120 GeV.
