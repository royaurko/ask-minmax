Two separate statistical tests are applied to the AGASA and preliminary Auger
Cosmic Ray Energy spectra in an attempt to find deviation from a pure
power-law. The first test is constructed from the probability distribution for
the maximum event of a sample drawn from a power-law. The second employs the
TP-statistic, a function defined to deviate from zero when the sample deviates
from the power-law form, regardless of the value of the power index. The AGASA
data show no significant deviation from a power-law when subjected to both
tests. Applying these tests to the Auger spectrum suggests deviation from a
power-law. However, potentially large systematics on the relative energy scale
prevent us from drawing definite conclusions at this time.
