We have recently discovered that the modified dynamics (MOND) implies some
universal upper bound on the acceleration that can be contributed by a `dark
halo'--assumed in a Newtonian analysis to account for the effects of MOND. Not
surprisingly, the limit is of the order of the acceleration constant of the
theory. This can be contrasted directly with the results of structure-formation
simulations. The new limit is substantial and different from earlier MOND
acceleration limits (discussed in connection with the MOND explanation of the
Freeman law for galaxy disks, and the Fish law for ellipticals): It pertains to
the `halo', and not to the observed galaxy; it is absolute, and independent of
further physical assumptions on the nature of the galactic system; and it
applies at all radii, whereas the other limits apply only to the mean
acceleration in the system.
