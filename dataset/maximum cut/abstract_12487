We show the existence of surfaces of degree $d$ in $\dP^3(\dC)$ with
approximately ${3j+2\over 6j(j+1)} d^3$ singularities of type $A_j, 2\le j\le
d-1$. The result is based on Chmutov's construction of nodal surfaces. For the
proof we use plane trees related to the theory of Dessins d'Enfants. Our
examples improve the previously known lower bounds for the maximum number
$\mu_{A_j}(d)$ of $A_j$-singularities on a surface of degree $d$ in most cases.
We also give a generalization to higher dimensions which leads to new lower
bounds even in the case of nodal hypersurfaces in $\dP^n, n\ge5$. To conclude,
we work out in detail a classical idea of B. Segre which leads to some
interesting examples, e.g. to a sextic with 36 cusps.
