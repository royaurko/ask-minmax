Let $P$ and $Q$ be two simple polygons in the plane of total complexity $n$,
each of which can be decomposed into at most $k$ convex parts. We present an
$(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm, for finding the translation of $Q$,
which maximizes its area of overlap with $P$. Our algorithm runs in $O(c n)$
time, where $c$ is a constant that depends only on $k$ and $\varepsilon$.
  This suggest that for polygons that are "close" to being convex, the problem
can be solved (approximately), in near linear time.
