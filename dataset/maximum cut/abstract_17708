In this paper, we asymptotically enumerate graphs with a given degree
sequence (d_1,...,d_n) satisfying restrictions designed to permit heavy-tailed
sequences in the sparse case (i.e. where the average degree is rather small).
Our general result requires upper bounds on functions of M_k= \sum_{i=1}^n
[d_i]_k for a few small integers k>=1. Note that M_1 is simply the total degree
of the graphs. As special cases, we asymptotically enumerate graphs with (i)
degree sequences satisfying M_2=o(M_1^{9/8}); (ii) degree sequences following a
power law with parameter gamma>5/2; (iii) degree sequences following a certain
``long-tailed'' power law; (iv) certain bi-valued sequences. A previous result
on sparse graphs by McKay and the second contributor applies to a wide range of
degree sequences but requires Delta =o(M_1^{1/3}), where Delta is the maximum
degree. Our new result applies in some cases when Delta is only barely o(M_1^
{3/5}). Case (i) above generalises a result of Janson which requires M_2=O(M_1)
(and hence M_1=O(n) and Delta=O(n^{1/2})). Case (ii) provides the first
asymptotic enumeration results applicable to degree sequences of real-world
networks following a power law, for which it has been empirically observed that
2<gamma<3.
