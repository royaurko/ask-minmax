Progress in the theory of anomalous diffusion in weakly turbulent cold
magnetized plasmas is explained. Several proposed models advanced in the
literature are discussed. Emphasis is put on a new proposed mechanism for
anomalous diffusion transport mechanism based on the coupled action of
conductive walls (excluding electrodes) bounding the plasma drain current (edge
diffusion) together with the magnetic field flux "cutting" the area traced by
the charged particles in their orbital motion. The same reasoning is shown to
apply to the plasma core anomalous diffusion. The proposed mechanism is
expected to be valid in regimes when plasma diffusion scales as Bohm diffusion
and at high $B/N$, when collisions are of secondary importance.
