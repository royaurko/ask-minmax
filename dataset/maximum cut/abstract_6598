In this paper, the inherent drawbacks of the naive lattice decoding for MIMO
fading systems is investigated. We show that using the naive lattice decoding
for MIMO systems has considerable deficiencies in terms of the rate-diversity
trade-off. Unlike the case of maximum-likelihood decoding, in this case, even
the perfect lattice space-time codes which have the non-vanishing determinant
property can not achieve the optimal rate-diversity trade-off. Indeed, we show
that in the case of naive lattice decoding, when we fix the underlying lattice,
all the codes based on full-rate lattices have the same rate-diversity
trade-off as V-BLAST. Also, we drive a lower bound on the symbol error
probability of the naive lattice decoding for the fixed-rate MIMO systems (with
equal numbers of receive and transmit antennas). This bound shows that
asymptotically, the naive lattice decoding has an unbounded loss in terms of
the required SNR, compared to the maximum likelihood decoding.
