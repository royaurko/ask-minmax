We prove that the Poisson distribution maximises entropy in the class of
ultra-log-concave distributions, extending a result of Harremo\"{e}s. The proof
uses ideas concerning log-concavity, and a semigroup action involving adding
Poisson variables and thinning. We go on to show that the entropy is a concave
function along this semigroup.
