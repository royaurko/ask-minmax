The calculation of the moments in inclusive B meson semileptonic decays is
upgraded to O(alphas^2). The first three moments of the lepton energy and
invariant hadronic mass distributions are computed for arbitrary cuts on the
lepton energy and in various renormalization schemes, finding in general small
deviations from the O(alphas^2 beta0) calculation. I also review the relation
between MSbar and kinetic heavy quark masses.
