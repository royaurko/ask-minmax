We propose a new approach to high-intensity relativistic laser-driven
electron acceleration in a plasma. Here, we demonstrate that a plasma wave
generated by a stimulated forward-scattering of an incident laser pulse can be
in the longest acceleration phase with injected relativistic beam electrons.
This is why the plasma wave has the maximum amplification coefficient which is
determined by the acceleration time and the breakdown (overturn) electric field
in which the acceleration of the injected beam electrons occurs. We must note
that for the longest acceleration phase the relativity of the injected beam
electrons plays a crucial role in our scheme. We estimate qualitatively the
acceleration parameters of relativistic electrons in the field of a plasma wave
generated at the stimulated forward-scattering of a high-intensity laser pulse
in a plasma.
