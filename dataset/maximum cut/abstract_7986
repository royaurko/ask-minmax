We prove the existence of novel, shock-fronted travelling wave solutions to a
model of wound healing angiogenesis studied in Pettet et al., IMA J. Math. App.
Med., 17, 2000. In this work, the contributors showed that for certain parameter
values, a heteroclinic orbit in the phase plane representing a smooth
travelling wave solution exists. However, upon varying one of the parameters,
the heteroclinic orbit was destroyed, or rather cut-off, by a wall of
singularities in the phase plane. As a result, they concluded that under this
parameter regime no travelling wave solutions existed. Using techniques from
geometric singular perturbation theory and canard theory, we show that a
travelling wave solution actually still exists for this parameter regime: we
construct a heteroclinic orbit passing through the wall of singularities via a
folded saddle canard point onto a repelling slow manifold. The orbit leaves
this manifold via the fast dynamics and lands on the attracting slow manifold,
finally connecting to its end state. This new travelling wave is no longer
smooth but exhibits a sharp front or shock. Finally, we identify regions in
parameter space where we expect that similar solutions exist. Moreover, we
discuss the possibility of more exotic solutions.
