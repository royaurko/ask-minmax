In coupled rotor models which describe identical rotating nuclei the nuclear
spin states restrict the possible angular momenta of each molecule. There are
two mean-field approaches to determining the orientational phase diagrams in
such systems. In one the nuclear spin conversion times are assumed to be
instantaneous in the other infinite. In this paper the intermediate case, when
the spin conversion times are significantly slower than those of rotational
time scales, but are not infinite on the time-scale of the experiment, is
investigated. Via incorporation of the configurational degeneracy it is shown
that in the thermodynamic limit the mean-field approach in the intermediate
case is identical to the instantaneous spin conversion time approximation. The
total entropy can be split into configurational and rotational terms. The
mean-field phase diagram of a model of coupled rotors of three-fold symmetry is
also calculated in the two approximations. It is shown that the configurational
entropy has a maximum as a function of temperature which shifts to lower
temperatures with increasing order.
