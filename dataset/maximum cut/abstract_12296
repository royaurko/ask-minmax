The LISA International Science Team Working Group on Data Analysis
(LIST-WG1B) is sponsoring several rounds of mock data challenges, with the
purpose of fostering development of LISA data-analysis capabilities, and of
demonstrating technical readiness for the maximum science exploitation of the
LISA data. The first round of challenge data sets were released at this
Symposium. We describe the models and conventions (for LISA and for
gravitational-wave sources) used to prepare the data sets, the file format used
to encode them, and the tools and resources available to support challenge
participants.
