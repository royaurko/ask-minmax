We present the results of a wide-field [O III] $\lambda 5007$ survey for
planetary nebulae (PN) in M87 and its surrounding halo. We show that the
planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) of M87's halo is unlike any PNLF
observed to date, with a shape that differs from that of the empirical law at
the 99.9% confidence level. In addition, we find that the PNLF of M87's outer
halo differs from that of the galaxy's inner regions at a high degree of
certainty ($\sim 92%$). We show that both these effects are most likely due to
the existence of intracluster PN, many of which are foreground to M87. These
intracluster objects explain the ``overluminous'' [O III] $\lambda 5007$
sources previously identified by Jacoby, Ciardullo, & Ford (1990), and present
us with a new tool with which to probe the morphological and dynamical
properties of the cluster. By modifying the maximum likelihood procedures of
Ciardullo et al (1989a) and using an assumed M31 distance of 770 Kpc (Freedman
& Madore 1990), we derive a distance modulus to M87 of $30.79 \pm 0.16$ ($14.4
\pm 1.1$ Mpc).
