We study the phenomenology at the Large Hadron Collider of an exotic
vector-like quark X with charge +5/3. We relax the assumption of a 100%
branching into W t and allow for an arbitrary rate into W plus light quarks,
thus covering all possible scenarios. Sizeable decays into light quarks can be
achieved, for instance, in a model where the X quark is embedded in a doublet
with hypercharge 7/6, which also contains a t' quark. We study the bounds on
the parameter space of this model, and perform a detailed simulation of the X
pair production and decays. We show that the final state with W t W q, where
q=u or c, contributes to the same sign dilepton searches, and that the reach
can be improved with alternative cuts optimised on such final state.
