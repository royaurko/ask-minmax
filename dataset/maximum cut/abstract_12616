We study the role of Coulomb and surface effects on the phase transition from
dense nuclear matter to a mixed phase of nuclear and kaon-condensed matter. We
calculate corrections to the bulk calculation of the equation of state (EOS)
and the critical density for the transition by solving explicitly for
spherical, cylindrical, and planar structures. The importance of Debye
screening in the determination of the charged particle profiles is studied in
some detail. We find that the surface and Coulomb contributions to the energy
density are small, but that they play an important role in the determination of
the critical pressure for the transition, as well as affecting the size and
geometry of favored structures. This changes the EOS over a wide range of
pressure and consequently increases the maximum mass by about 0.1 solar masses.
Implications for transport properties of the mixed phase are also discussed.
