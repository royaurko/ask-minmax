It is possible to formulate 2d field theory on the ultrametric space with the
free correlators identical to 2d correlators and the same potential. Such model
should carry some features of original model for scale invariant theories. For
the case of strings and 2d conformal models it is possible to derive exact
results. It is possible to investigate not only bulk structure (phase
transition points) of theory, but sometimes also correlators. Such ultrametric
models could be naturally expressed via Random energy model and directed
polymer on Cayley tree.
