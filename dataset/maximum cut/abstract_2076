We present a very simple model for realizing directed transport with cold
atoms in a pair of periodically flashed optical lattices. The origin of this
ratchet effect is explained and its robustness demonstrated under imperfections
typical of cold atom experiments. We conclude that our model offers a clear-cut
way to implement directed transport in an atom optical experiment.
