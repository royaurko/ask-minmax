The recent progress in the area of self-interference cancellation (SIC)
design has enabled the development of full-duplex (FD) single and multiple
antenna systems. In this paper, we propose a design for FD eNodeB (eNB) and
user equipment (UE) for 5G networks. The use of FD operation enables
simultaneous in-band uplink and downlink operation and thereby cutting down the
spectrum requirement by half. FD operation requires the same subcarrier
allocation to UE in both uplink and downlink. Long Term Evolution LTE) uses
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) for downlink. To enable
FD operation, we propose using single carrier frequency division multiple
access SC-FDMA) for downlink along with the conventional method of using it for
uplink. Taking advantage of channel reciprocity, singular value decomposition
(SVD) based eamforming in the downlink allows multiple users (MU) to operate on
same set of subcarriers. In uplink, frequency domain minimum mean square error
(MMSE) equalizer along with successive interference cancellation with optimal
ordering (SSIC-OO) algorithm is used to decouple signals of users operating in
the same set of subcarriers. The work includes simulations showing efficient FD
operation both at UE and eNB for downlink and uplink respectively.
