We present an in-depth analysis of the spectral and temporal behavior of a
long almost uninterrupted INTEGRAL observation of Vela X-1 in Nov/Dec 2003. In
addition to an already high activity level, Vela X-1 exhibited several very
intense flares with a maximum intensity of more than 5 Crab in the 20-40 keV
band. Furthermore Vela X-1 exhibited several off states where the source became
undetectable with ISGRI. We interpret flares and off states as being due to the
strongly structured wind of the optical companion: when Vela X-1 encounters a
cavity in the wind with strongly reduced density, the flux drops, thus
potentially triggering the onset of the propeller effect which inhibits further
accretion, thus giving rise to the off states. The required drop in density to
trigger the propeller effect in Vela X-1 is of the same order as predicted by
theoretical papers for the densities in the OB star winds. The same structured
wind can give rise to the giant flares when Vela X-1 encounters a dense blob in
the wind. Further temporal analysis reveals that a short lived QPO with a
period of ~6800 sec is present. The part of the light curve during which the
QPO is present is very close to the off states and just following a high
intensity state, thus showing that all these phenomena are related.
