We study a planar metamaterial supporting electromagnetically-induced
transparency (EIT)-like effect by exploiting the coupling between bright and
quasi-dark eigenmodes. The specific design of such a metamaterial consists of a
cut-wire (CW) and a single-gap split-ring resonator (SRR). From the numerical
and the analytical results we demonstrate that the response of SRR, which is
weakly excited by external electric field, is mitigated to be a quasi-dark
eigenmode in the presence of strongly radiative CW. This result suggests more
relaxed conditions for the realization of devices utilizing the EIT-like
effects in metamaterial, and thereby widens the possibilities for many
different structural implementations.
