The experiments of 2005 aimed at detection of low-velocity (~10-15 km s-1)
daemons falling on to the Earth's surface from Near-Earth, Almost Circular
Heliocentric Orbits (NEACHOs) have corroborated once more the existence of the
March maximum in their flux by raising its confidence level to 99.99%. In
addition, these experiments permitted us to identify several FEU-167-1-type PM
tubes, with a few times thicker inner Al coating, which appear to be capable to
detect, without any scintillator, the crossing of negatively charged daemons.
As a result, detection efficiency increases tens of times, thus raising the
measured level of the March daemon flux to f > 0.5E-7 cm-2s-1.
