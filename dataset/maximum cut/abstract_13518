Using a recently developed model, inspired by mean field theory in
statistical physics, and data from the UK's Research Assessment Exercise, we
analyse the relationship between the quality of statistics and operational
research groups and the quantity researchers in them. Similar to other academic
disciplines, we provide evidence for a linear dependency of quality on quantity
up to an upper critical mass, which is interpreted as the average maximum
number of colleagues with whom a researcher can communicate meaningfully within
a research group. The model also predicts a lower critical mass, which research
groups should strive to achieve to avoid extinction. For statistics and
operational research, the lower critical mass is estimated to be 9 $\pm$ 3. The
upper critical mass, beyond which research quality does not significantly
depend on group size, is about twice this value.
