We consider a directed graph on the 2-dimensional integer lattice, placing a
directed edge from vertex $(i_1,i_2)$ to $(j_1,j_2)$, whenever $i_1 \le j_1$,
$i_2 \le j_2$, with probability $p$, independently for each such pair of
vertices. Let $L_{n,m}$ denote the maximum length of all paths contained in an
$n \times m$ rectangle. We show that there is a positive exponent $a$, such
that, if $m/n^a \to 1$, as $n \to \infty$, then a properly centered/rescaled
version of $L_{n,m}$ converges weakly to the Tracy-Widom distribution. A
generalization to graphs with non-constant probabilities is also discussed.
