We study the structure of hadronic protoneutron stars within the finite
temperature Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone theoretical approach. Assuming
beta-equilibrated nuclear matter with nucleons and leptons in the stellar core,
with isothermal or isentropic profile, we show that particle populations and
equation of state are very similar. As far as the maximum mass is concerned, we
find that its value turns out to be almost independent on T, while a slight
decrease is observed in the isentropic case, due to the enhanced proton
fraction in the high density range.
