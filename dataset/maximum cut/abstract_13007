We report the specific heat measurements on the newly discovered Fe-based
layered superconductor LaO_0.9F_{0.1-delta}FeAs with the onset transition
temperature T_c \approx 28 K. A nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the
electronic specific heat coefficient gamma(H) has been found in the low
temperature limit, which is consistent with the prediction for a nodal
superconductor. The maximum gap value Delta_0 \approx 3.4$\pm$0.5 meV was
derived by analyzing gamma(H) based on the d-wave model. We also detected the
electronic specific heat difference between 9 T and 0 T in wide temperature
region, a specific heat anomaly can be clearly observed near T_c. The Debye
temperature of our sample was determined to be about 315.7 K. Our results
suggest an unconventional mechanism for this new superconductor.
