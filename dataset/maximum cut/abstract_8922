We extend the idea of entanglement concentration for pure states(Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 88}, 187903) to the case of mixed states. The scheme works only with
particle statistics and local operations, without the need of any other
interactions. We show that the maximally entangled state can be distilled out
when the initial state is pure, otherwise the entanglement of the final state
is less than one. The distillation efficiency is a product of the diagonal
elements of the initial state, it takes the maximum 50%, the same as the case
for pure states.
