An attempt is made to estimate the velocity $V_{\nu}$ of electron
antineutrino by using a theory of nuclear reactions \cite{1}. To estimate it,
the experimental values of absorption cross sections $\mathbf{\sigma}%
_{a}(\widetilde{\nu}_{e})$ and $\mathbf{\sigma}_{a}(n)$ for electron
antineutrinos and neutrons by nuclei are compared. Based on the approach
proposed below, one could assume that the maximum velocity at weak interactions
$c_{w}>c,$ which is inconsistent with the theory of relativity (TR)
