Using the potential of two unprecedented missions, STEREO and RHESSI, we
study three well observed fast CMEs that occurred close to the limb together
with their associated high energy flare emissions in terms of RHESSI HXR
spectra and flux evolution. From STEREO/EUVI and STEREO/COR1 data the full CME
kinematics of the impulsive acceleration phase up to 4 Rs is measured with a
high time cadence of less equal 2.5 min. For deriving CME velocity and
acceleration we apply and test a new algorithm based on regularization methods.
The CME maximum acceleration is achieved at heights h < 0.4 Rs, the peak
velocity at h < 2.1 Rs (in one case as small as 0.5 Rs). We find that the CME
acceleration profile and the flare energy release as evidenced in the RHESSI
hard X-ray flux evolve in a synchronized manner. These results support the
standard flare/CME model which is characterized by a feed-back relationship
between the large-scale CME acceleration process and the energy release in the
associated flare.
