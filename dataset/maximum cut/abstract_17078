In the mathematical modeling of strongly nonequilibrium and nonlinear
processes in a tornado approach based on the momentum transfer equations with a
model function of sources and sinks is used, which puts this approach to the
sharpening problems, where the maximum velocity distribution over the space of
indefinitely growing for a limited time. Nonlinear momentum source in the
medium leads to a blow-up regime, and the development of the regime, itself
generated by a nonlinear medium, leads to self-organization, which is described
by numerical methods. In this case, the competition between processes of the
increasing due to nonlinear source and pulse propagation taking into account
the viscosity of the medium leads to the appearance of new medium
characteristic - some linear size - the spatial diameter of the tornado, on
which these processes "balance" each other. The approach allows to obtain
equations that describe the physical effects observed and explain nonlinear
transfer mechanisms of layering momentum in a tornado, determining the speeds
and pressure gradients for nonpotential flow, as well as each altitude local
layer thermodynamic properties - entropy production, entropy change rate and
free energy. We describe the spatial and velocity characteristics of tornado
various intensities, speed components in the tornado core and its surroundings,
the emergence of spiral waves, rising to a arm height, the appearance of
spatial ring (thrombus) and mesovortexes outside.
