In orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, carrier and
sampling frequency offsets (CFO and SFO, respectively) can destroy the
orthogonality of the subcarriers and degrade system performance. In the
literature, Nguyen-Le, Le-Ngoc, and Ko proposed a simple maximum-likelihood
(ML) scheme using two long training symbols for estimating the initial CFO and
SFO of a recursive least-squares (RLS) estimation scheme. However, the results
of Nguyen-Le's ML estimation show poor performance relative to the Cramer-Rao
bound (CRB). In this paper, we extend Moose's CFO estimation algorithm to joint
ML estimation of CFO and SFO using two long training symbols. In particular, we
derive CRBs for the mean square errors (MSEs) of CFO and SFO estimation.
Simulation results show that the proposed ML scheme provides better performance
than Nguyen-Le's ML scheme.
