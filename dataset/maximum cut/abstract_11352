We calculate the temperature profiles of (thin) accretion disks around
rapidly rotating neutron stars (with low surface magnetic fields), taking into
account the full effects of general relativity. We then consider a model for
the spectrum of the X-ray emission from the disk, parameterized by the mass
accretion rate, the color temperature and the rotation rate of the neutron
star. We derive constraints on these parameters for the X-ray source Cygnus X-2
using the estimates of the maximum temperature in the disk along with the disk
and boundary layer luminosities, using the spectrum inferred from the EXOSAT
data. Our calculations suggest that the neutron star in Cygnus X-2 rotates
close to the centrifugal mass-shed limit. Possible constraints on the neutron
star equation of state are also discussed.
