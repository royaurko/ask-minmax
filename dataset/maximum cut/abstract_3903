We study the (newtonian) gravitational force distribution arising from a
fractal set of sources. We show that, in the case of real structures in finite
samples, an important role is played by morphological properties and finite
size effects. For dimensions smaller than d-1 (being $d$ the space dimension)
the convergence of the net gravitational force is assured by the fast decaying
of the density, while for fractal dimension D>d-1 the morphological properties
of the structure determine the eventual convergence of the force as a function
of distance. We clarify the role played by the cut-offs of the distribution.
Some cosmological implications are discussed.
