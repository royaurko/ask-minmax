We propose an alternative way to represent graphs via OBDDs based on the
observation that a partition of the graph nodes allows sharing among the
employed OBDDs. In the second part of the paper we present a method to compute
at the same time the quotient w.r.t. the maximum bisimulation and the OBDD
representation of a given graph. The proposed computation is based on an
OBDD-rewriting of the notion of Ackermann encoding of hereditarily finite sets
into natural numbers.
