We present the results of a next-to-leading order calculation of Wt
production, including the decays of both the top quark and the W boson. The
effects of radiation in the decay of the top quark are also included. The
separation of diagrams which appear in the real corrections, into singly- and
doubly-resonant contributions, is performed using a b-jet veto which is
motivated by the use of the bottom quark distribution function. We find that,
for a choice of scale which is suitable for this approach, the QCD corrections
are very mild and only change the cross section by up to 10% at the LHC,
depending on the severity of the b-jet veto. When further cuts are applied,
applicable for a Higgs boson search in the H->WW channel, we find that the
radiative effects greatly decrease the number of background events expected
from this process. In addition, the shapes of relevant distributions can be
significantly changed at next-to-leading order.
