A conformally invariant hidden sector is considered, with a scalar operator
$O$ of low dimension that couples to the electro-weak gauge bosons of the
Standard Model, via terms such as $O F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}$. By examining single
photon production at LEP, we bound the strength of these interactions. We apply
our results, along with those of Delgado and Strassler and of Caracciolo and
Rychkov, to improve the bound on four-photon production through "unparticle
self-interactions", as proposed by Feng et al. We find the maximum allowable
cross-section is of order a few tens of femtobarns at the 14 TeV LHC, and lies
well below 1 fb for a wide range of parameters.
