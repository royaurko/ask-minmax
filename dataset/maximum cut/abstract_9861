In this paper we show that a gradient Ricci soliton warped product whose
warping function reaches both maximum and minimum must be a Riemannian product.
Moreover, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for constructing a
gradient Ricci soliton warped product. As an application, we present a new
class of complete expanding Ricci soliton warped product having as fiber an
Einstein manifold with non-positive scalar curvature. We also discuss some
obstructions to this construction, especially in the case when the base of the
warped product is compact.
