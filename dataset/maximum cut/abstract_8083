Oriented circular cylinders in an opaque medium are used to represent certain
microstructural objects in steel. The opaque medium is sliced parallel to the
cylinder axes of symmetry and the cut-plane contains the observable rectangular
profiles of the cylinders. A one-to-one relation between the joint density of
the squared radius and height of the 3D cylinders and the joint density of the
squared half-width and height of the observable 2D rectangles is established.
We propose a nonparametric estimation procedure to estimate the distributions
and expectations of various quantities of interest, such as the cylinder
radius, height, aspect ratio, surface area and volume from the observed 2D
rectangle widths and heights. Also, the covariance between the radius and
height of a cylinder is estimated. The asymptotic behavior of these estimators
is established to yield point-wise confidence intervals for the expectations
and point-wise confidence sets for the distributions of the quantities of
interest. Many of these quantities can be linked to the mechanical properties
of the material, and are, therefore, useful for industry. We illustrate the
mathematical model and estimation procedures using a banded microstructure for
which nearly 90 \textmu m of depth have been observed via serial sectioning.
