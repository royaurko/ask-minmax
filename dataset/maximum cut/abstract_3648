Extra cellular alkaline protease producing species is an isolate from soil
which was characterized and identified as Streptomyces pulvereceus MTCC 8374.
Studies on submerged fermentation revealed that maximum level of enzyme
production was during early stationary phase. Optimum pH, inoculum and
temperature were 9.0, 3 percent and 33 C respectively. Among carbon sources 0.3
peccent starch gave a maximum production followed by maltose, xylose and
fructose. High yield of protease production was reported with 1.0 percent
casein followed by soybean meal, yeast extract and malt extract. Further, it
was optimized with 0.5 percent, 1.0 percentand 1.5 percent of NaCl among which
1 percent NaCl resulted in maximum level of protease. The protease profile of
the isolate shows its potential as a good source for industrial application.
