Using a program of perturbative resummation I compute the damping rates for
fields at nonzero spatial momentum to leading order in weak coupling in hot
$QCD$. Sum rules for spectral densities are used to simplify the calculations.
For massless fields the damping rate has an apparent logarithmic divergence in
the infrared limit, which is cut off by the screening of static magnetic fields
(``magnetic mass''). This demonstrates how at high temperature even
perturbative quantities are sensitive to nonperturbative phenomenon.
