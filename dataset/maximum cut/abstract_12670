The population is composed of individuals characterised by their genetic
strings, phenotypes and ages. We discuss the influence of probabilities of
survival of the individuals on the dynamics and phenotypic variability of the
population.
  We show that constant survival probabilities of individuals are propitious
for preserving phenotypic variability of the population. For constant survival
probabilities oscillations of 'the average fitness' of the population and
normal distributions of the phenotypes are observed. When the probabilities of
survival are directly proportinal to the individuals' adaptations the
population can reach the maximum possible average adaptation, but the
phenotypic variability of the population is completely lost and oscillations of
'the average fitness' of the population do not occur.
  We also investigate the behaviour of the population caused by the
probabilities of survival that partly depend on the individuals' adaptations.
The role of the length of the individuals' genetic strings is considered here.
