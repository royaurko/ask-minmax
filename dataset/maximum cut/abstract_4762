Stable, quantized gravitational bound states of primordial black holes called
Holeums could have been produced in the early universe and could be a component
of the Super Heavy Dark Matter (SHDM) present in galactic halos. We show that
Holeums of masses of the order of 10**13 to 10**14 GeV and above are stable
enough to survive in the present-day universe. We identify such Holeums as
promising candidates for the SHDM "X-particle" and show that the decay of such
Holeums by pressure ionization can give rise to cosmic rays of all observed
energies, including Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR). The absence of the
GZK cut-off is explained by the galactic halo origin of the UHECR. We predict
that the cosmic rays are a manifestation of the end-stage Hawking radiation
burst of the primordial black holes (PBH) liberated by the ionization of
Holeums. Antimatter detected in cosmic rays could be a signature of their
Holeum origin.
