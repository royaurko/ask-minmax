We show that the superconductivity observed recently in the weak itinerant
ferromagnet ZrZn2 [C. Pfleiderer et al., Nature (London) 412, 58 (2001)] is due
to remnants of a superconducting layer induced by spark erosion. Results of
resistivity, susceptibility, specific heat and surface analysis measurements on
high-quality ZrZn2 crystals show that cutting by spark erosion leaves a
superconducting surface layer. The resistive superconducting transition is
destroyed by chemically etching a layer of 5 microns from the sample. No
signature of superconductivity is observed in rho(T) of etched samples at the
lowest current density measured, J=675 Am-2, and at T < 45 mK. EDX analysis
shows that spark-eroded surfaces are strongly Zn depleted. The simplest
explanation of our results is that the superconductivity results from an alloy
with higher Zr content than ZrZn2.
