We present the results of our UBVRI CCD photometry for the second brightest
supernova of 2009, SN 2009nr, discovered during a sky survey with the
telescopes of the MASTER robotic network. Its light and color curves and
bolometric light curves have been constructed. The light-curve parameters and
the maximum luminosity have been determined. SN 2009nr is shown to be similar
in light-curve shape and maximum luminosity to SN 1991T, which is the prototype
of the class of supernovae Ia with an enhanced luminosity. SN 2009nr exploded
far from the center of the spiral galaxy UGC 8255 and most likely belongs to
its old halo population. We hypothesize that this explosion is a consequence of
the merger of white dwarfs.
