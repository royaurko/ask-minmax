A generalization of the Gibbs entropy postulate is proposed based on the
BBGKY hierarchy as the nonequilibrium entropy for a system of N interacting
particles. This entropy satisfies the basic principles of thermodynamics in the
sense that it reaches its maximum at equilibrium and is coherent with the
second law. By using a generalization of the Liouville equation describing the
evolution of the distribution vector, it is demonstrated that the entropy
production is a non-negative quantity. Moreover, following the procedure of
non-equilibrium thermodynamics a transport matrix is introduced and a
microscopic expression for this is derived. This framework allows one to
perform the thermodynamic analysis of non-equilibrium steady states which, as
proven here, constitute the states of minimum entropy production when one
considers small departures from stationarity.
