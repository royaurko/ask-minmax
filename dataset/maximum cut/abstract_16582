A release of multicolor broad band (BVRI) photometry for a subsample of 44
isolated spirals drawn from the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies (CIG) is
presented. Total magnitudes and colors at various circular apertures, as well
as some global structural/morphological parameters are estimated. Morphology is
reevaluated through optical and sharp/filtered R band images, (B-I) color index
maps, and archive near-IR JHK images from the Two-Micron Survey. The CAS
structural parameters (Concentration, Asymmetry, and Clumpiness) were
calculated from the images in each one of the bands. The fraction of galaxies
with well identified optical/near-IR bars (SB) is 63%, while a 17% more shows
evidence of weak or suspected bars (SAB). The sample average value of the
maximum bar ellipticity is 0.4. Half of the galaxies in the sample shows rings.
We identify two candidates for isolated galaxies with disturbed morphology. The
structural CAS parameters change with the observed band, and the tendencies
they follow with the morphological type and global color are more evident in
the redder bands. In any band, the major difference between our isolated
spirals and a sample of interacting spirals is revealed in the A-S plane. A
deep and uniformly observed sample of isolated galaxies is intended for various
purposes including (i) comparative studies of environmental effects, (ii)
confronting model predictions of galaxy evolution and (iii) evaluating the
change of galaxy properties with redshift.
