We present recent progresses in radiative penguin decays of $B$ meson using a
large sample of $B\bar{B}$ pairs recorded at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with
the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy $e^+e^-$ collider. We report
precise measurement of inclusive $b\to s\gamma$ branching ratio with cut
$E_\gamma > 1.7$ GeV, first measurement of time-dependent CP-violation in
$B^0\to K_s\rho^0\gamma$, measurement of $B^+\to K^+\eta'\gamma$ branching
fraction, and improved branching fraction results for
$B^0\to(\rho,\omega)\gamma$ with new CP and isospin violation results in the
mode.
