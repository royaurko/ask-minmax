We present the DTFE public software, a code for reconstructing fields from a
discrete set of samples/measurements using the maximum of information contained
in the point distribution. The code is written in C++ using the CGAL library
and is parallelized using OpenMP. The software was designed for the analysis of
cosmological data but can be used in other fields where one must interpolate
quantities given at a discrete point set. The software comes with a wide suite
of options to facilitate the analysis of 2- and 3-dimensional data and of both
numerical simulations and galaxy redshift surveys. For comparison purposes, the
code also implements the TSC and SPH grid interpolation methods. The code comes
with an extensive user guide detailing the program options, examples and the
inner workings of the code. The DTFE public software and further information
