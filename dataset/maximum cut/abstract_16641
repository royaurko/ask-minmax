This thesis presents a study of the prospects of measuring electroweak
production of the top quark at the LHC. The study of the top quark is a highly
topical subject as we expect significant numbers of top quarks at the LHC which
will enable us to conduct precision measurements of the properties of the top.
The t-channel "single top" is a relatively rare mode of top production but with
it we can probe the spin structure of the Wtb vertex in the weak interaction at
an unprecedented energy scale through the measurement of the top polarisation.
  Analysis strategies and computing tools were developed and tested
extensively. The study was performed using the signal and background events
modelled with Monte Carlo generators, many of which have been newly developed
for the LHC analyses. Full and fast simulation of the ATLAS detector was
performed to obtain realistic estimates of the sensitivity of the measurements.
A new fully fledged analysis framework, "EventView" was developed for the ATLAS
collaboration to process these data at the first level of analysis.
Parameterised vertex tagging was developed to estimate the level of background
for this analysis and a maximum likelihood fit was used for the precise
extraction of the top polarisation.
  In the high energy hadronic environment at the LHC, the estimation of
possible systematic errors, both experimental and theoretical, needs to be
carefully considered. Important elements of the systematic errors were
investigated and the main contributions were evaluated.
