The maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) quantifies the practical upper bound
for useful circuit operation. We report here an fmax of 70 GHz in transistors
using epitaxial graphene grown on the C-face of SiC. This is a significant
improvement over Si-face epitaxial graphene used in the prior high frequency
transistor studies, exemplifying the superior electronics potential of C-face
epitaxial graphene. Careful transistor design using a high {\kappa} dielectric
T-gate and self-aligned contacts, further contributed to the record-breaking
fmax.
