Resurgent transseries have recently been shown to be a very powerful
construction in order to completely describe nonperturbative phenomena in both
matrix models and topological or minimal strings. These solutions encode the
full nonperturbative content of a given gauge or string theory, where
resurgence relates every (generalized) multi-instanton sector to each other via
large-order analysis. The Stokes phase is the adequate gauge theory phase where
an 't Hooft large N expansion exists and where resurgent transseries are most
simply constructed. This paper addresses the nonperturbative study of Stokes
phases associated to multi-cut solutions of generic matrix models, constructing
nonperturbative solutions for their free energies and exploring the asymptotic
large-order behavior around distinct multi-instanton sectors. Explicit formulae
are presented for the Z_2 symmetric two-cut set-up, addressing the cases of the
quartic matrix model in its two-cut Stokes phase; the "triple" Penner potential
which yields four-point correlation functions in the AGT framework; and the
Painleve II equation describing minimal superstrings.
