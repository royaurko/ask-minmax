RNA virus populations will undergo processes of mutation and selection
resulting in a mixed population of viral particles. High throughput sequencing
of a viral population subsequently contains a mixed signal of the underlying
clones. We would like to identify the underlying evolutionary structures. We
utilize two sources of information to attempt this; within segment linkage
information, and mutation prevalence. We demonstrate that clone haplotypes,
their prevalence, and maximum parsimony reticulate evolutionary structures can
be identified, although the solutions may not be unique, even for complete sets
of information. This is applied to a chain of influenza infection, where we
infer evolutionary structures, including reassortment, and demonstrate some of
the difficulties of interpretation that arise from deep sequencing due to
artifacts such as template switching during PCR amplification.
