We pose a monotonicity conjecture on the number of pseudo-triangulations of
any planar point set, and check it on two prominent families of point sets,
namely the so-called double circle and double chain. The latter has
asymptotically $12^n n^{\Theta(1)}$ pointed pseudo-triangulations, which lies
significantly above the maximum number of triangulations in a planar point set
known so far.
