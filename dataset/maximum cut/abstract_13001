The Cops and Robber game is played on undirected finite graphs. A number of
cops and one robber are positioned on vertices and take turns in sliding along
edges. The cops win if they can catch the robber. The minimum number of cops
needed to win on a graph is called its cop number. It is known that the cop
number of a graph embedded on a surface $X$ of genus $g$ is at most $3g/2 + 3$,
if $X$ is orientable (Schroeder 2004), and at most $2g+1$, otherwise
(Nowakowski & Schroeder 1997).
  We improve the bounds for non-orientable surfaces by reduction to the
orientable case using covering spaces.
  As corollaries, using Schroeder's results, we obtain the following: the
maximum cop number of graphs embeddable in the projective plane is 3; the cop
number of graphs embeddable in the Klein Bottle is at most 4, and an upper
bound is $3g/2 + 3/2$ for all other $g$.
