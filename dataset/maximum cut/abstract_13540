Neutron scattering measurements of the magnetic excitations in single
crystals of antiferromagnetic CaFe2As2 reveal steeply dispersive and
well-defined spin waves up to an energy of 100 meV. Magnetic excitations above
100 meV and up to the maximum energy of 200 meV are however broader in energy
and momentum than the experimental resolution. While the low energy modes can
be fit to a Heisenberg model, the total spectrum cannot be described as arising
from excitations of a local moment system. Ab-initio calculations of the
dynamic magnetic susceptibility suggest that the high energy behavior is
dominated by the damping of spin waves by particle-hole excitations.
