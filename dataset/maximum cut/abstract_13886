Data of Pierre Auger Observatory show a proton-dominated chemical composition
of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays spectrum at (1 - 3) EeV and a steadily heavier
composition with energy increasing. In order to explain this feature we assume
that (1 - 3) EeV protons are extragalactic and derive their maximum
acceleration energy, E_p^{max} \simeq 4 EeV, compatible with both the spectrum
and the composition. We also assume the rigidity-dependent acceleration
mechanism of heavier nuclei, E_A^{max} = Z x E_p^{max}. The proposed model has
rather disappointing consequences: i) no pion photo-production on CMB photons
in extragalactic space and hence ii) no high-energy cosmogenic neutrino fluxes;
iii) no GZK-cutoff in the spectrum; iv) no correlation with nearby sources due
to nuclei deflection in the galactic magnetic fields up to highest energies.
