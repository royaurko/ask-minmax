Here we present results from a maximum likelihood analysis of galaxy-galaxy
weak lensing effects as measured in a 12.5' x 12.5' field obtained at the
Nordic Optical Telescope, on La Palma, Spain. The analysis incorporates
photometric redshifts and gives circular velocities consistent with previous
weak lensing work.
