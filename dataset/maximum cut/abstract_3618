Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) have attracted a lot of attention of
late, as one the principle building blocks of deep networks. Training RBMs
remains problematic however, because of the intractibility of their partition
function. The maximum likelihood gradient requires a very robust sampler which
can accurately sample from the model despite the loss of ergodicity often
incurred during learning. While using Parallel Tempering in the negative phase
of Stochastic Maximum Likelihood (SML-PT) helps address the issue, it imposes a
trade-off between computational complexity and high ergodicity, and requires
careful hand-tuning of the temperatures. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off is unnecessary. The choice of optimal temperatures can be automated
by minimizing average return time (a concept first proposed by [Katzgraber et
al., 2006]) while chains can be spawned dynamically, as needed, thus minimizing
the computational overhead. We show on a synthetic dataset, that this results
in better likelihood scores.
