This paper analyzes the impact of statistical delay constraints on the
achievable rate of a two-hop wireless communication link, in which the
communication between a source and a destination is accomplished via an
intermediate full-duplex relay node. It is assumed that there is no direct link
between the source and the destination, and the relay forwards the information
to the destination by employing the decode-and-forward scheme. Both the queues
at the source and relay node are subject to statistical queueing constraints
imposed on the limitations of buffer violation probability. Given statistical
delay constraints specified via maximum delay and delay violation probability,
the tradeoff between the statistical delay constraints imposed to any two
concatenated queues is identified. With this characterization, the maximum
constant arrival rates that can be supported by this two-hop link are obtained
by determining the effective capacity of such links as a function of the
statistical delay constraints and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) at the source
and relay, and the fading distributions of the links. It is shown that imposing
unbalanced statistical delay constraints to the queues at the source and relay
can improve the achievable rate. Overall, the impact of statistical delay
constraints on the achievable throughput is provided.
