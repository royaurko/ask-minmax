In Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) systems, Maximum-Likelihood (ML) decoding
is equivalent to finding the closest lattice point in an N-dimensional complex
space. In general, this problem is known to be NP hard. In this paper, we
propose a quasi-maximum likelihood algorithm based on Semi-Definite Programming
(SDP). We introduce several SDP relaxation models for MIMO systems, with
increasing complexity. We use interior-point methods for solving the models and
obtain a near-ML performance with polynomial computational complexity. Lattice
basis reduction is applied to further reduce the computational complexity of
solving these models. The proposed relaxation models are also used for soft
output decoding in MIMO systems.
