In this article, we compute the topological expansion of all possible
mixed-traces in a hermitian two matrix model. In other words we give a recipe
to compute the number of discrete surfaces of given genus, carrying an Ising
model, and with all possible given boundary conditions. The method is
recursive, and amounts to recursively cutting surfaces along interfaces. The
result is best represented in a diagrammatic way, and is thus rather simple to
use.
