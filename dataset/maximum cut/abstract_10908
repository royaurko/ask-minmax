Triple-differential cross sections for neutrons from high-multiplicity La-La
collisions at 250 and 400 MeV per nucleon and Nb-Nb collisions at 400 MeV per
nucleon were measured at several polar angles as a function of the azimuthal
angle with respect to the reaction plane of the collision. The reaction plane
was determined by a transverse-velocity method with the capability of
identifying charged-particles with Z=1, Z=2, and Z > 2. The flow of neutrons
was extracted from the slope at mid-rapidity of the curve of the average
in-plane momentum vs the center-of-mass rapidity. The squeeze-out of the
participant neutrons was observed in a direction normal to the reaction plane
in the normalized momentum coordinates in the center-of-mass system.
Experimental results of the neutron squeeze-out were compared with BUU
calculations. The polar-angle dependence of the maximum azimuthal anisotropy
ratio $r(\theta)$ was found to be insensitive to the mass of the colliding
nuclei and the beam energy. Comparison of the observed polar-angle dependence
of the maximum azimuthal anisotropy ratio $r(\theta)$ with BUU calculations for
free neutrons revealed that $r(\theta)$ is insensitive also to the
incompressibility modulus in the nuclear equation of state.
