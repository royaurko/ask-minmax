The fragmentation of a light parton i to a jet containing a light energetic
hadron h, where the momentum fraction of this hadron as well as the invariant
mass of the jet is measured, is described by "fragmenting jet functions". We
calculate the one-loop matching coefficients J_{ij} that relate the fragmenting
jet functions G_i^h to the standard, unpolarized fragmentation functions D_j^h
for quark and gluon jets. We perform this calculation using various IR
regulators and show explicitly how the IR divergences cancel in the matching.
We derive the relationship between the coefficients J_{ij} and the quark and
gluon jet functions. This provides a cross-check of our results. As an
application we study the process e+ e- to X pi+ on the Upsilon(4S) resonance
where we measure the momentum fraction of the pi+ and restrict to the dijet
limit by imposing a cut on thrust T. In our analysis we sum the logarithms of
tau=1-T in the cross section to next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy
(NNLL). We find that including contributions up to NNLL (or NLO) can have a
large impact on extracting fragmentation functions from e+ e- to dijet + h.
