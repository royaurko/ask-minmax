We establish global rates of convergence for the Maximum Likelihood
Estimators (MLEs) of log-concave and $s$-concave densities on $\mathbb{R}$. The
main finding is that the rate of convergence of the MLE in the Hellinger metric
is no worse than $n^{-2/5}$ when $-1 < s < \infty$ where $s=0$ corresponds to
the log-concave case. We also show that the MLE does not exist for the classes
of $s$-concave densities with $s < - 1$.
