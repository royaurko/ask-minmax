We present a direct experimental measurement of an effective temperature in a
colloidal glass of Laponite, using a micrometric bead as a thermometer. The
nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation, in the particular form of a
modified Einstein relation, is investigated with diffusion and mobility
measurements of the bead embedded in the glass. We observe an unusual
non-monotonic behavior of the effective temperature : starting from the bath
temperature, it is found to increase up to a maximum value, and then decreases
back, as the system ages. We show that the observed deviation from the Einstein
relation is related to the relaxation times previously measured in dynamic
light scattering experiments.
