Final state radiation in the process $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ is considered for
the cuts used in the analysis of KLOE data at large angles. By means of a Monte
Carlo event generator FEVA, effects of non-pointlike behaviour of pions are
estimated in the framework of Resonance Perturbation Theory. An additional
complication related with the $\phi$ meson intermediate state is taken into
account and the corresponding contributions (the direct decay
$\phi\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ and the double resonance decay
$\phi\to\rho^\pm\pi^\mp\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$) are added to FEVA. A method to
test effects of non-pointlike behaviour of pions in a model-independent way is
proposed.
