We study a popular puzzle game known variously as Clickomania and Same Game.
Basically, a rectangular grid of blocks is initially colored with some number
of colors, and the player repeatedly removes a chosen connected monochromatic
group of at least two square blocks, and any blocks above it fall down. We show
that one-column puzzles can be solved, i.e., the maximum possible number of
blocks can be removed, in linear time for two colors, and in polynomial time
for an arbitrary number of colors. On the other hand, deciding whether a puzzle
is solvable (all blocks can be removed) is NP-complete for two columns and five
colors, or five columns and three colors.
