We prove extensions of the estimates of Aleksandrov and Bakel$'$man for
linear elliptic operators in Euclidean space $\Bbb{R}^{\it n}$ to inhomogeneous
terms in $L^q$ spaces for $q < n$. Our estimates depend on restrictions on the
ellipticity of the operators determined by certain subcones of the positive
cone. We also consider some applications to local pointwise and $L^2$
estimates.
