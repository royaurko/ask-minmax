The `theoretical' existence of traversable Lorentzian wormholes in the
classical, macroscopic world is plagued by the violation of the well--known
energy conditions of General Relativity. In this brief article we show : (i)
how the extent of violation can be quantified using certain volume integrals
(ii) whether this `amount of violation' can be minimised for some specific
cut--and--paste geometric constructions. Examples and possibilities are also
outlined.
