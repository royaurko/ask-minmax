This paper presents the algorithm for determining the Lemaitre-Tolman (LT)
model that best fits given datasets for maximum stellar ages, and SNIa
luminosities, both as functions of redshift. It then applies it to current
cosmological data. Special attention must be given to the handling of the
origin, and the region of the maximum diameter distances. As with a previous
combination of datasets (galaxy number counts and luminosity distances versus
redshift), there are relationships that must hold at the region of the maximum
diameter distance, which are unlikely to be obeyed exactly by real data. We
show how to make corrections that enable a self-consistent solution to be
found. We address the questions of the best way to approximate discrete data
with smooth functions, and how to estimate the uncertainties of the output -
the 3 free functions that determine a specific LT metric. While current data
does not permit any confidence in our results, we show that the method works
well, and reasonable LT models do fit with or without a cosmological constant.
