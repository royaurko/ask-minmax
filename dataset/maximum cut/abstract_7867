We study properties of waves of frequencies above the photospheric acoustic
cut-off of $\approx$5.3 mHz, around four active regions, through spatial maps
of their power estimated using data from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). The wavelength channels 1600 {\AA} and 1700 {\AA} from AIA are now known
to capture clear oscillation signals due to helioseismic p modes as well as
waves propagating up through to the chromosphere. Here we study in detail, in
comparison with HMI Doppler data, properties of the power maps, especially the
so called 'acoustic halos' seen around active regions, as a function of wave
frequencies, inclination and strength of magnetic field (derived from the
vector field observations by HMI) and observation height. We infer possible
signatures of (magneto-)acoustic wave refraction from the observation height
dependent changes, and hence due to changing magnetic strength and geometry, in
the dependences of power maps on the photospheric magnetic quantities. We
discuss the implications for theories of p mode absorption and mode conversions
by the magnetic field.
