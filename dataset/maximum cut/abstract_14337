The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) consists of 16 towers, each
incorporating a tracker made up of a stack of 18 pairs of orthogonal silicon
strip detectors (SSDs), interspersed with tungsten converter foils. The strip
numbers of the struck strips in each SSD plane are collected by two read
controllers (RCs), one at each end, and nine RCs are connected by one of eight
cables to a cable controller (CC).
  The tracker readout electronics limit the number of strips that can be read
out. Although each RC can store up to 64 hits, a CC can store maximum of only
128 hits. To insure that the photon shower development and backsplash in the
lower layers of the tracker don't compromise the readout of the upper layers,
we artificially limit the number of strips read out into each RC to 14, so that
no CC can ever can see more than 126 hit strips.
  In this contribution, we explore other configurations that will allow for a
more complete readout of large events, and investigate some of the consequences
of using these configurations.
