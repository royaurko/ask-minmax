A statistical-mechanical investigation is performed on Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection of a dilute classical gas starting from the Boltzmann equation. We
first present a microscopic derivation of basic hydrodynamic equations and an
expression of entropy appropriate for the convection. This includes an
alternative justification for the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation. We then
calculate entropy change through the convective transition choosing mechanical
quantities as independent variables. Above the critical Rayleigh number, the
system is found to evolve from the heat-conducting uniform state towards the
convective roll state with monotonic increase of entropy on the average. Thus,
the principle of maximum entropy proposed for nonequilibrium steady states in a
preceding paper is indeed obeyed in this prototype example. The principle also
provides a natural explanation for the enhancement of the Nusselt number in
convection.
