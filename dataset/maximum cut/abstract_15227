Determinantal point processes (DPPs) offer a powerful approach to modeling
diversity in many applications where the goal is to select a diverse subset. We
study the problem of learning the parameters (the kernel matrix) of a DPP from
labeled training data. We make two contributions. First, we show how to
reparameterize a DPP's kernel matrix with multiple kernel functions, thus
enhancing modeling flexibility. Second, we propose a novel parameter estimation
technique based on the principle of large margin separation. In contrast to the
state-of-the-art method of maximum likelihood estimation, our large-margin loss
function explicitly models errors in selecting the target subsets, and it can
be customized to trade off different types of errors (precision vs. recall).
Extensive empirical studies validate our contributions, including applications
on challenging document and video summarization, where flexibility in modeling
the kernel matrix and balancing different errors is indispensable.
