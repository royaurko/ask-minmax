We discuss confining k strings in four dimensional gauge theories using D5
branes in AdS5xS5, and D3 branes in Klebanov-Strassler and Maldacena-Nunez
backgrounds. We present two results: The first that confining k string tensions
in N=4 can be calculated using D5 branes in AdS5xS5 with a cut-off in the bulk
AdS. Using an embedding of R2 times S4 in S5, we show that the D5 brane
replicates a string of rank k in the antisymmetric representation. The second
result shows that the S-Dual calculation to hep-th/0111078 reproduces the
action in the Klebanov-Strassler and Maldacena-Nunez backgrounds exactly, while
providing a more natural manifestation of the string charge k.
