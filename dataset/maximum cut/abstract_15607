Missions to rendezvous with or capture an asteroid present significant
interest both from a geophysical and safety point of view. They are key to the
understanding of our solar system are as well stepping stones for
interplanetary human flight. In this paper, we focus on a rendezvous mission
with \RH, an asteroid classified as a Temporarily Captured Orbiter (TCO). TCOs
form a new population of near Earth objects presenting many advantages toward
that goal. Prior to the mission, we consider the spacecraft hibernating on a
Halo orbit around the Earth-Moon's $L_2$ libration point. The objective is to
design a transfer for the spacecraft from the parking orbit to rendezvous with
\RH while minimizing the fuel consumption. Our transfers use indirect methods,
based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, combined with continuation
techniques and a direct method to address the sensitivity of the
initialization. We demonstrate that a rendezvous mission with \RH can be
accomplished with low delta-v. This exploratory work can be seen as a first
step to identify good candidates for a rendezvous on a given TCO trajectory.
