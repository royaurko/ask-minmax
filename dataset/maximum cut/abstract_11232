We use fully self-consistent N-body simulations of barred galaxies to show
that dynamical friction from a dense dark matter halo dramatically slows the
rotation rate of bars. Our result supports previous theoretical predictions for
a bar rotating within a massive halo. On the other hand, low density halos,
such as those required for maximum disks, allow the bar to continue to rotate
at a high rate. There is somewhat meager observational evidence indicating that
bars in real galaxies do rotate rapidly and we use our result to argue that
dark matter halos must have a low central density in all high surface
brightness disk galaxies, including the Milky Way. Bars in galaxies that have
larger fractions of dark matter should rotate slowly, and we suggest that a
promising place to look for such candidate objects is among galaxies of
intermediate surface brightness.
