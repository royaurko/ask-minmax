The contributors study theoretically reflection on the surface of a metamaterial
with a hyperbolic dispersion. It is found that reflection is strongly dependent
on how the surface is terminated with respect to the asymptote of the
hyperbolic dispersion. For a surface terminated normally to the asymptote, zero
reflection occurs for all incident angles. It is exemplified by a metamaterial
made of a periodic metal-dielectric layered structure with its surface properly
cut through numerical simulations.
