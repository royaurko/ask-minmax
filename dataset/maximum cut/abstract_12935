Systems with long-range interactions display a short-time relaxation towards
Quasi-Stationary States (QSSs), whose lifetime increases with system size. With
reference to the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model, we here review
Lynden-Bell's theory of ``violent relaxation''. The latter results in a maximum
entropy scheme for a water-bag initial profile which predicts the presence of
out-of-equilibrium phase transitions} separating homogeneous (zero
magnetization) from inhomogeneous (non-zero magnetization) QSSs. Two different
parametric representations of the initial condition are analyzed and the
features of the phase diagram are discussed. In both representations we find a
second order and a first order line of phase transitions that merge at a
tricritical point. Particular attention is payed to the condition of existence
and stability of the homogenous phase.
