We study the performance of various analytical frequency-domain templates for
detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from spin-precessing,
quasi-circular, compact binary inspirals. We begin by assessing the extent to
which non-spinning, spin-aligned, and the new (analytical, frequency-domain,
small-spin) double-precessing frequency-domain templates can be used to detect
signals from such systems. For effective, dimensionless spin values above
$0.2$, the use of non-spinning or spin-aligned templates for detection purposes
will result in a loss of up to $30%$ of all events, while in the case of the
double-precessing model, this never exceeds $6%$. Moreover, even for signals
from systems with small spins, non-spinning and spin-aligned templates
introduce large biases in the extracted masses and spins. The use of a model
that encodes spin-induced precession effects, such as the double-precessing
model, improves the mass and spin extraction by up to an order of magnitude.
The additional information encoded in the spin-orbit interaction is invaluable
if one wishes to extract the maximum amount of information from gravitational
wave signals.
