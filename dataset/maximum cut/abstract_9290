Biosorption of Ag(I)-Spirulina platensis for different pH were investigated
using dialysis and Atomic-absorbtion analysis. It was shown, that the
biosorption constant for Ag(I) Spirulina platensis complex and the capacity
depend on the change of pH. In particular, with the increase of pH (pH=5.5. and
pH=8.6 cases), the biosorption constant increase and the capacity decreases.
The nature of interaction is also changed. In case of neutral pH, the
interaction Ag(I)-S. platensis is of cooperative character and maximum metal
biosorption by S. platensis biomass was observed at pH 7.0.
