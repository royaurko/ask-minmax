In this paper, we study the asymptotic normality of the conditional maximum
likelihood (ML) estimators for the truncated regression model and the Tobit
model. We show that under the general setting assumed in his book, the
conjectures made by Hayashi (2000) \footnote{see page 516, and page 520 of
Hayashi (2000).} about the asymptotic normality of the conditional ML
estimators for both models are true, namely, a sufficient condition is the
nonsingularity of $\mathbf{x_tx'_t}$.
