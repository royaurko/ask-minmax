We apply the model of subsonic settling accretion on to isolated neutron
stars accreting from the interstellar medium (AINS). We show that in this
regime the expected mean X-ray luminosity from AINS turns out to be 2-3 orders
of magnitude as small as the maximum possible Bondi value, i.e.
$10^{27}-10^{28}$~erg s$^{-1}$. The intrinsically unstable character of
settling accretion due to long plasma cooling time leads to regular appearance
of X-ray flares with a duration of about one hour and a maximum luminosity of
about the Bondi value, $\sim10^{31}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. This feature can be used to
distinguished AINS from other dim X-ray sources. With the sensitivity of the
forthcoming all-sky X-ray surveys the expected number of the potentially
detectable AINS can be from a few to ten.
