We studied phase transitions and thermodynamic properties of the
field-induced antiferromagnetic nuclear-spin ordered phase in bcc solid 3He by
measuring the melting pressure at temperatures down to 0.4 mK in magnetic
fields up to 15 T. The transition temperature from the paramagnetic phase is
reentrant with increasing field with a maximum at 10 T. This indicates that the
system is highly frustrated by the competing multiple-spin exchanges and
excludes other mechanisms related to the zero-point vacancies. The upper
critical field was estimated as 19.7 T, which reveals non-negligible
contributions from higher order exchanges beyond six spins. A considerable
softening of the spin waves in the ordered phase in low fields also suggests
the strong frustration.
