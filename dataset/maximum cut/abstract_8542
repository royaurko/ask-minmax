We report new inelastic Raman and neutron scattering spectra for glasses with
different degrees of fragility; the data are compared for each sample to obtain
the Raman coupling function $C(\omega)$. The study indicates a general linear
behaviour of the $C(\omega)$ near the Boson peak maximum, and evidence a
correlation between vibrational and relaxational properties, already observed
in recent publications.
