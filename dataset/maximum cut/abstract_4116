The well-known ``displace, cut, and reflect'' method used to generate cold
disks from given solutions of Einstein equations is extended to solutions of
Einstein-Maxwell equations. Four exact solutions of the these last equations
are used to construct models of hot disks with surface density, azimuthal
pressure, and azimuthal current. The solutions are closely related to Kerr,
Taub-NUT, Lynden-Bell-Pinault and to a one-soliton solution. We find that the
presence of the magnetic field can change in a nontrivial way the different
properties of the disks. In particular, the pure general relativistic
instability studied by Bicak, Lynden-Bell and Katz [Phys. Rev. D47, 4334, 1993]
can be enhanced or cured by different distributions of currents inside the
disk. These currents, outside the disk, generate a variety of axial symmetric
magnetic fields. As far as we know these are the first models of hot disks
studied in the context of general relativity.
