We consider the discrete Gaussian Free Field in a square box in $\mathbb Z^2$
of side length $N$ with zero boundary conditions and study the joint law of its
properly-centered extreme values ($h$) and their scaled spatial positions ($x$)
in the limit as $N\to\infty$. Restricting attention to extreme local maxima,
i.e., the extreme points that are maximal in an $r_N$-neighborhood thereof, we
prove that the associated process tends, whenever $r_N\to\infty$ and
$r_N/N\to0$, to a Poisson point process with intensity measure $Z(d
x)e^{-\alpha h}d h$, where $\alpha:=\sqrt{2\pi}$ and $Z(dx)$ is a random
measure on $[0,1]^2$. In particular, this yields an integral representation of
the law of the absolute maximum, similar to that found in the context of
Branching Brownian Motion. We give evidence that the random measure $Z$ is a
version of the derivative martingale associated with the continuum Gaussian
Free Field.
