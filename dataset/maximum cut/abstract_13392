Single crystals of FeSe_1-x_Te_x_ (0.5=<x=<1) have been grown by the Bridgman
method. After annealing them at 400 deg for 100 h in vacuum, single crystals of
x=0.5-0.9 have exhibited bulk superconductivity. Anisotropic properties of the
electrical resistivity and upper critical field, H_c2_, have been investigated
for the single-crystal FeSe_1-x_Te_x_ with x=0.6. It has been found that the
in-plane resistivity, Rho_ab_, shows a metallic temperature-dependence, while
the out-of-plane resistivity, Rho_c_, shows a broad maximum around 100 K. The
resistivity ratio, Rho_ab_/Rho_c_, is 44 and 70 at 290 K and just above the
superconducting transition temperature, T_c_, respectively. The anisotropic
parameter, gamma= H_c2_^para^/H_c2_^perp^ (The para and perp indicate field
directions parallel and perpendicular to the ab-plane, respectively.), is
estimated as 2.7 just below T_c_.
