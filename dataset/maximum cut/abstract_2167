Analytical formulae for triple differential distributions ${\rm
d}^3\sigma/({\rm d}\cos\theta{\rm d}s_1{\rm d}s_2)$ in the neutral current
process $e^+e^-\rightarrow f_1\bar f_1 f_2\bar f_2$ are given. They allow to
obtain angular distributions, rapidity distributions and transversal momentum
distributions of one fermion pair by only two numerical integrations. Cuts can
be applied to the integration variables.
