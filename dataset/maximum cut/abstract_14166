We consider the game-theoretic scenario of testing the performance of
Forecaster by Sceptic who gambles against the forecasts. Sceptic's current
capital is interpreted as the amount of evidence he has found against
Forecaster. Reporting the maximum of Sceptic's capital so far exaggerates the
evidence. We characterize the set of all increasing functions that remove the
exaggeration. This result can be used for insuring against loss of evidence.
