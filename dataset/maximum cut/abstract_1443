We compute spectra of symmetric random matrices describing graphs with
general modular structure and arbitrary inter- and intra-module degree
distributions, subject only to the constraint of finite mean connectivities. We
also evaluate spectra of a certain class of small-world matrices generated from
random graphs by introducing short-cuts via additional random connectivity
components. Both adjacency matrices and the associated graph Laplacians are
investigated. For the Laplacians, we find Lifshitz type singular behaviour of
the spectral density in a localised region of small $|\lambda|$ values. In the
case of modular networks, we can identify contributions local densities of
state from individual modules. For small-world networks, we find that the
introduction of short cuts can lead to the creation of satellite bands outside
the central band of extended states, exhibiting only localised states in the
band-gaps. Results for the ensemble in the thermodynamic limit are in excellent
agreement with those obtained via a cavity approach for large finite single
instances, and with direct diagonalisation results.
