Thermal conductivity \kappa is measured at very low temperatures down to 0.28
K for pure and Mg-doped CuGeO_3 single crystals. The doped samples carry larger
amount of heat than the pure sample at the lowest temperature. This is because
antiferromagnetic magnons appear in the doped samples and are responsible for
the additional heat conductivity, while \kappa of the pure sample represents
phonon conductivity at such low temperatures. The maximum energy of the magnon
is estimated to be much lower than the spin-Peierls-gap energy. The result
presents the first example that \kappa at very low temperatures probes the
magnon transport in disorder-induced antiferromagnetic phase of spin-gap
systems.
