The actions of cut applied to the elastic system cause relative displacements
tool/part, which induce a rise in the temperature in the components of the
machine tools, its environment, the system-tools-part and generate vibrations.
The experimental procedures installation, at the dynamic level, made it
possible to determine the elements necessary to a rigorous analysis of the
influence of the geometry of the tool, its displacement and evolution of the
contacts tool/part and tool/chip on surface carried out
