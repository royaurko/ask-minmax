We present studies on the modifications in temperature, number density and
phase-space density when a laser cooled atom cloud from the optical molasses is
trapped in a quadrupole magnetic trap. Theoretically it is shown that for a
given temperature and size of the cloud from the molasses, the phase-space
density in the magnetic trap first increases with magnetic field gradient and
then decreases with it, after attaining a maximum value at an optimum value of
magnetic field gradient. The experimentally measured variation in phase-space
density in the magnetic trap with the magnetic field gradient has shown the
similar trend. However, the experimentally measured values of number density
and phase-space density are much lower than their theoretically predicted
values. This is attributed to the higher experimentally observed temperature in
the magnetic trap than the theoretically predicted temperature. Nevertheless,
these studies can be useful to set a higher phase-space density in the trap by
setting the optimum value of field gradient of the quadrupole magnetic trap.
