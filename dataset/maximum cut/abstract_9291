The Modulated Wideband Converter (MWC) is a recently proposed
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on Compressive Sensing (CS) theory.
Unlike conventional ADCs, its quantization reference voltage, which is
important to the system performance, does not equal the maximum amplitude of
original analog signal. In this paper, the quantization reference voltage of
the MWC is theoretically analyzed and the conclusion demonstrates that the
reference voltage is proportional to the square root of $q$, which is a
trade-off parameter between sampling rate and number of channels. Further
discussions and simulation results show that the reference voltage is
proportional to the square root of $Nq$ when the signal consists of $N$
narrowband signals.
