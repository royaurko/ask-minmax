Product codes are widely used in data-storage, optical and wireless
applications. Their analytical performance evaluation usually relies on the
truncated union bound, which provides a low error rate approximation based on
the minimum distance term only. In fact, the complete weight enumerator of most
product codes remains unknown. In this paper, concatenated representations are
introduced and applied to compute the complete average enumerators of arbitrary
product codes over a field Fq. The split weight enumerators of some important
constituent codes (Hamming, Reed-Solomon) are studied and used in the analysis.
The average binary weight enumerators of Reed Solomon product codes are also
derived. Numerical results showing the enumerator behavior are presented. By
using the complete enumerators, Poltyrev bounds on the maximum likelihood
performance, holding at both high and low error rates, are finally shown and
compared against truncated union bounds and simulation results.
