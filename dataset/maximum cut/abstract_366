We present an alternative reduction to master integrals for one-loop
amplitudes using a unitarity cut method in arbitrary dimensions. We carry out
the reduction in two steps. The first step is a pure four-dimensional
cut-integration of tree amplitudes with a mass parameter, and the second step
is applying dimensional shift identities to master integrals. This reduction is
performed at the integrand level, so that coefficients can be read out
algebraically.
