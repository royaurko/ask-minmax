We discuss the predictability of a conservative system that drives a chaotic
system with positive maximum Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_0$, such as the erratic
motion of an asteroid in the gravitational field of two bodies of much larger
mass. We consider the case where in absence of feedback (restricted model), the
driving system is regular and completely predictable. A small feedback of
strength $\epsilon$ still allows a good forecasting in the driving system up to
a very long time $T_p \sim \epsilon^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ depends on the
details of the system. The most interesting situation happens when the Lyapunov
exponent of the total system is strongly chaotic with $\lambda_{tot} \approx
\lambda_0$ , practically independent of $\epsilon$. Therefore an exponential
amplification of a small incertitude on the initial conditions in the driving
system for any $\epsilon \neq 0$ coexists with very long predictability times.
The paradox stems from saturation effects in the evolution for the growth of
the incertitude as illustrated in a simple model of coupled maps and in a
system of three point vortices in a disk.
