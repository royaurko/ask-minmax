Hybrid normal metal - insulator - superconductor microstructures suitable for
studying an interference of electrons were fabricated. The structures consist
of a superconducting loop connected to a normal metal electrode through a
tunnel barrier . An optical interferometer with a beam splitter can be
considered as a classical analogue for this system. All measurements were
performed at temperatures well below 1 K. The interference can be observed as
periodic oscillations of the tunnel current (voltage) through the junction at
fixed bias voltage (current) as a function of a perpendicular magnetic field.
The magnitude of the oscillations depends on the bias point. It reaches a
maximum at energy $eV$ which is close to the superconducting gap and decreases
with an increase of temperature. Surprisingly, the period of the oscillations
in units of magnetic flux $\Delta \Phi$ is equal neither to $h/e$ nor to
$h/2e$, but significantly exceeds these values for larger loop circumferences.
The origin of the phenomena is not clear.
