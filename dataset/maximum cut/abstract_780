Superconductor-Ferromagnet-Superconductor (S-F-S) Josephson junctions were
fabricated by making a narrow cut through a S-F double layer using direct
writing by Focused Ion Beam (FIB). Due to a high resolution (spot size smaller
than 10 nm) of FIB, junctions with a small separation between superconducting
electrodes ($\leq$ 30 nm) can be made. Such a short distance is sufficient for
achieving a considerable proximity coupling through a diluted CuNi ferromagnet.
We have successfully fabricated and studied S-F-S (Nb-CuNi-Nb) and S-S'-S
(Nb-Nb/CuNi-Nb) junctions. Junctions exhibit clear Fraunhofer modulation of the
critical current as a function of magnetic field, indicating good uniformity of
the cut. By changing the depth of the cut, junctions with the $I_c R_n$ product
ranging from 0.5 mV to $\sim 1\mu $V were fabricated.
