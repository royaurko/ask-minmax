We describe a method for determining the limb polarization and limb darkening
of stars in eclipsing binary systems, by inverting photometric and polarimetric
light curves.
  Because of the ill-conditioning of the problem, we use the Backus-Gilbert
method to control the resolution and stability of the recovered solution, and
to make quantitative estimates of the maximum accuracy possible. Using this
method we confirm that the limb polarization can indeed be recovered, and
demonstrate this with simulated data, thus determining the level of
observational accuracy required to achieve a given accuracy of reconstruction.
This allows us to set out an optimal observational strategy, and to critcally
assess the claimed detection of limb polarization in the Algol system.
  The use of polarization in stars has been proposed as a diagnostic tool in
microlensing surveys by Simmons et al. (1995), and we discuss the extension of
this work to the case of microlensing of extended sources.
