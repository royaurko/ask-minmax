We investigate Linear and Inverse seesaw mechanisms with maximal zero
textures of the constituent matrices. We first consider the minimally
parametrized charged lepton mass matrix `$m_e$' through texture zeros that
gives rise to the non-singular determinant of $m_e$ with distinct masses.
Following we consider analogous textures of the Dirac neutrino mass matrices
`$m_D$'. In Linear seesaw mechanism, in the diagonal basis of matrix $M$ it is
seen that 5 is the maximum number of zeros that can be accommodated in `$m$' to
obtain viable effective neutrino mass matrices ($m_\nu$) and the form of the
emerged $m_\nu$ is same as one of the 7 allowed two zero textures specified in
the existing literature. In Inverse seesaw, considering diagonal structure of
`$m$' we show that 3 is the maximum number of zeros that can be inserted into
$\mu_S$ to obtain the remaining 6 viable two zero textures of $m_\nu$. Thus one
can realize all the allowed two zero textures of neutrino masses through the
methodology presented in this paper.
