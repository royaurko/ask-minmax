We study motor traffic on Bethe networks subject to hard-core exclusion for
both tightly coupled one-state machines and loosely coupled two-state machines
that perform work against a constant load. In both cases we find an
interaction-induced enhancement of the efficiency at maximum power (EMP) as
compared to non-interacting motors. The EMP enhancement occurs for a wide range
of network and single motor parameters and is due to a change in the
characteristic load-velocity relation caused by phase transitions in the
system. Using a quantitative measure of the trade-off between the EMP
enhancement and the corresponding loss in the maximum output power we identify
parameter regimes where motor traffic systems operate efficiently at maximum
power without a significant decrease in the maximum power output due to jamming
effects.
