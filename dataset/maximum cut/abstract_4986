We use the full bispectrum of spherical needlets applied to the WMAP data of
the cosmic microwave background as an estimator for the primordial
non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL. We use needlet scales up to l_max=1000 and the
KQ75 galactic cut and find f_NL=84 +/- 40 corrected for point source bias. We
also introduce a set of consistency tests to validate our results against the
possible influence of foreground residuals or systematic errors. In particular,
fluctuations in the value of f_NL obtained from different frequency channels,
different masks and different multipoles are tested against simulated maps. All
variations in f_NL estimates are found statistically consistent with
simulations.
