SBV is a deep inference system that extends the set of logical operators of
multiplicative linear logic with the non commutative operator Seq. We introduce
the logical system SBVr which extends SBV by adding a self-dual atom-renaming
operator to it. We prove that the cut elimination holds on SBVr. SBVr and its
cut free subsystem BVr are complete and sound with respect to linear lambda
calculus with explicit substitutions. Under any strategy, a sequence of
evaluation steps of any linear lambda-term M becomes a process of proof-search
in SBVr (BVr) once M is mapped into a formula of SBVr. Completeness and
soundness follow from simulating linear beta-reduction with explicit
substitutions as processes. The role of the new renaming operator of SBVr is to
rename channel-names on-demand. This simulates the substitution that occurs in
a beta-reduction. Despite SBVr is a minimal extension of SBV its proof-search
can compute all boolean functions, as linear lambda-calculus with explicit
substitutions can compute all boolean functions as well. So, proof search of
SBVr and BVr is at least ptime-complete.
