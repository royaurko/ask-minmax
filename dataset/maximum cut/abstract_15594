Given a proper total $k$-coloring $c$ of a graph $G$, we define the
\emph{value} of a vertex $v$ to be $c(v) + \sum_{uv \in E(G)} c(uv)$. The
smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ has a proper total $k$-coloring whose values
form a proper coloring is the \emph{neighbor sum distinguishing total chromatic
number} $\chi"_{\Sigma}(G)$. Pil\'sniak and Wo\'zniak (2013) conjectured that
$\chi"_{\Sigma}(G)\leq \Delta(G)+3$ for any simple graph with maximum degree
$\Delta(G)$. In this paper, we prove that this bound to be asymptotically
correct by showing that $\chi"_{\Sigma}(G)\leq \Delta(G)(1+o(1))$. The main
idea of our argument relies on Przyby{\l}o's proof (2014) for neighbor sum
distinguishing edge-coloring.
