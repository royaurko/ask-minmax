We have surveyed the inner 5' of the Orion Nebula by means of Halpha and
[NII] Fabry-Perot imaging spectroscopy to present a kinematical study of the
Herbig-Haro objects in the nebula. The objects studied in this work are HH 202,
203, 204, 529, 269 and other associated features. For HH 202 we find new
features that, because of their high velocities (up to 100 km/seg) indicate the
presence of an outflow that probably is a HH flow not catalogued previously. HH
202 could be only a part of this larger outflow. Large internal motions are
found in the fainter regions of HH 203-204, as well as evidence of transverse
density gradients that could account for the asymmetry in the brightness
distribution of HH 204. We report for the first time a high blueshifted
velocity (-118 km/seg) associated with HH 204, and show that the apex of HH 204
is indeed the zone of maximum velocity, in agreement with bow shock models. We
also studied the radial velocity field of HH 269 finding features associated
with the HH object. From our studies, we find kinematic evidence that suggests
that HH 203-204 and HH 202 are part of a big (aprox. 0.55 pc) bipolar HH
outflow.
