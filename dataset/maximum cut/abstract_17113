We present initial results from the CO survey toward high redshift galaxies
using the Nobeyama 45m telescope. Using the new wide bandwidth spectrometer
equipped with a two-beam SIS receiver, we have robust new detections of three
high redshift (z=1.6-3.4) submillimeter galaxies (SXDF 1100.001, SDP9, and
SDP17), one tentative detection (SDSS J160705+533558), and one non-detection
(COSMOS-AzTEC1). The galaxies observed during the commissioning phase are
sources with known spectroscopic redshifts from previous optical or from
wide-band submm spectroscopy. The derived molecular gas mass and line widths
from Gaussian fits are ~10^11 Msun and 430-530 km/s, which are consistent with
previous CO observations of distant submm galaxies and quasars. The
spectrometer that allows a maximum of 32 GHz instantaneous bandwidth will
provide new science capabilities at the Nobeyama 45m telescope, allowing us to
determine redshifts of bright submm selected galaxies without any prior
redshift information.
