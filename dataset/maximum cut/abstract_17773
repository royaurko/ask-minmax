We propose a constructive algorithm that decomposes an arbitrary real tensor
into a finite sum of orthonormal rank-1 outer products. The algorithm, named
TTr1SVD, works by converting the tensor into a tensor-train rank-1 (TTr1)
series via the singular value decomposition (SVD). TTr1SVD naturally
generalizes the SVD to the tensor regime with properties such as uniqueness for
a fixed order of indices, orthogonal rank-1 outer product terms, and easy
truncation error quantification. Using an outer product column table it also
allows, for the first time, a complete characterization of all tensors
orthogonal with the original tensor. Incidentally, this leads to a strikingly
simple constructive proof showing that the maximum rank of a real $2 \times 2
\times 2$ tensor over the real field is 3. We also derive a conversion of the
TTr1 decomposition into a Tucker decomposition with a sparse core tensor.
Numerical examples illustrate each of the favorable properties of the TTr1
decomposition.
