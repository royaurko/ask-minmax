We numerically find out the spectrum of the $3$ spin $1$ Dirac operators
found in~\cite{ApbPP}. We give an analytic and numerical proof that they are
unitarily inequivalent. Since these operators come paired with an anticommuting
chirality operator, we find their spectrums to resemble those of fermions with
positive and negative eigenvalues along with a number of zero modes. We give a
method to count the number of zero modes which can be extended to higher spins
on $S_F^2$. An universal relation between the energy eigenvalues of the spin 1
Dirac operator and their multiplicities is found. This helps us predict the
energy eigenvalues for an arbitrarily large cut-off $L$, a problem which is
computationally difficult to handle.
