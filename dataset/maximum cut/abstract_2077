A refined variational wave function for the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard
model is studied numerically, with the aim of approaching the difficult
crossover regime of intermediate values of U. The issue of a superconducting
ground state with d-wave symmetry is investigated for an average electron
density n=0.8125 and for U=8t. Due to finite-size effects a clear-cut answer to
this fundamental question has not yet been reached.
