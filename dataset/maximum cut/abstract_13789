This paper considers the problem of error correction for a cooperative data
exchange (CDE) system, where some clients are compromised or failed and send
false messages. Assuming each client possesses a subset of the total messages,
we analyze the error correction capability when every client is allowed to
broadcast only one linearly-coded message. Our error correction capability
bound determines the maximum number of clients that can be compromised or
failed without jeopardizing the final decoding solution at each client. We show
that deterministic, feasible linear codes exist that can achieve the derived
bound. We also evaluate random linear codes, where the coding coefficients are
drawn randomly, and then develop the probability for a client to withstand a
certain number of compromised or failed peers and successfully deduce the
complete message for any network size and any initial message distributions.
