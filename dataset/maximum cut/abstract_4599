A theoretical analysis of the $(\pi^-,\gamma\gamma)$ reaction in nuclei is
made in order to find the viability of this reaction to test modifications of
the $\sigma$ meson mass in nuclear matter. The $\pi\pi$ correlation in the
scalar-isoscalar channel in nuclear matter could, in principle, manifest itself
in this reaction since it plays an important role in the
$\pi\pi\to\gamma\gamma$ mechanism. But we conclude that this effect is hardly
visible in this reaction due to the strong background of the
pion-Bremsstrahlung terms. Only with some special cuts and for some
polarization states are the effect visible at the cost of a strong reduction in
the cross section.
