We show how generalised unitarity cuts in D = 4 - 2 epsilon dimensions can be
used to calculate efficiently complete one-loop scattering amplitudes in
non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. This approach naturally generates the
rational terms in the amplitudes, as well as the cut-constructible parts. We
test the validity of our method by re-deriving the one-loop ++++, -+++, --++,
-+-+ and +++++ gluon scattering amplitudes using generalised quadruple cuts and
triple cuts in D dimensions.
