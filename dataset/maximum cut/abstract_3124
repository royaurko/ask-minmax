Optimum projection angles for achieving maximum horizontal range in throwing
and jumping events are considerably less than 45 degrees. This unexpected
result arise because an athlete can generate a greater projection velocity at
low projection angles than at high angles. The range of a projectile is
strongly dependent on projection speed and so the optimum projection angle is
biased towards low projection angles. Here we examine the velocity-angle
relation and the optimum projection angle in selected throwing and jumping
events.
