A method for bounding the rate of bit-stuffing encoders for 2-D constraints
is presented. Instead of considering the original encoder, we consider a
related one which is quasi-stationary. We use the quasi-stationary property in
order to formulate linear requirements that must hold on the probabilities of
the constrained arrays that are generated by the encoder. These requirements
are used as part of a linear program. The minimum and maximum of the linear
program bound the rate of the encoder from below and from above, respectively.
  A lower bound on the rate of an encoder is also a lower bound on the capacity
of the corresponding constraint. For some constraints, our results lead to
tighter lower bounds than what was previously known.
