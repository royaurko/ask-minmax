We elucidate the polymer dynamics of a liquid crystal elastomer based on the
time-dependent response of the pendent liquid crystal mesogens. The molecular
tilt and switching time of mesogens are analyzed as a function of temperature
and cross-linking density upon application of an electric field. We observe an
unexpected maximum in the switching time of the liquid crystal mesogens at
intermediate field strength. Analysis of the molecular tilt over multiple time
regimes correlates the maximum response time with a transition to entangled
polymer dynamics at a critical field strength.
