Motivated by recent experiments, the effect of the interlayer exchange
interaction $J_{inter}$ on the magnetic properties of coupled Co/Cu/Ni
trilayers is studied theoretically. Here the Ni film has a lower Curie
temperature $T_{C,\rm Ni}$ than the Co film in case of decoupled layers. We
show that by taking into account magnetic fluctuations the interlayer coupling
induces a strong magnetization for $T\gtsim T_{C,\rm Ni}$ in the Ni film. For
an increasing $J_{inter}$ the resonance-like peak of the longitudinal Ni
susceptibility is shifted to larger temperatures, whereas its maximum value
decreases strongly. A decreasing Ni film thickness enhances the induced Ni
magnetization for $T\gtsim T_{C,\rm Ni}$. The measurements cannot be explained
properly by a mean field estimate, which yields a ten times smaller effect.
Thus, the observed magnetic properties indicate the strong effect of 2D
magnetic fluctuations in these layered magnetic systems. The calculations are
performed with the help of a Heisenberg Hamiltonian and a Green's function
approach.
