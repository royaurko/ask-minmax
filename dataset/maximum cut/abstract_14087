The ideal Bose gas has two major shortcomings: at zero temperature, all the
particles 'condense' at zero energy or momentum, thus violating the Heisenberg
principle; the second is that the pressure below the critical point is
independent of density resulting in zero incompressibility (or infinite
isothermal compressibility) which is unphysical. We propose a modification of
the ideal Bose gas to take into account the Heisenberg principle. This
modification results in a finite (in)compressibility at all temperatures and
densities. The main properties of the ideal Bose gas are preserved, i.e. the
relation between the critical temperature and density, but the specific heat
has a maximum at the critical temperature instead of a discontinuity. Of course
interactions are crucial for both cases in order to describe actual physical
systems.
