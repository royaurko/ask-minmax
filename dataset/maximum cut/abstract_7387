We have searched the broad-absorption-line quasar (BAL QSO) sample presented
by Reichard et al. for objects exhibiting the so-called `ghost of Lyman alpha'.
This ghost manifests as a hump near -5900kms in the troughs of the broad
absorption lines and provides strong evidence for the importance of
line-driving in powering the outflows from BAL QSOs. Of the 224 sample BAL QSOs
selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Early Data Release (EDR), 198
satisfy our redshift constraints and 58 show clear evidence of multiple-trough
(MT) structure in the CIV line. A composite spectrum constructed from this MT
sample already shows evidence for a ghost feature. Narrowing our classification
scheme further, we define a set of 36 objects that individually show evidence
of a ghost feature, and then apply further cuts to arrive at a final `best
sample' that contains our seven strongest ghost candidates. A further five
objects show evidence for a ghost feature that is almost strong enough to merit
inclusion in our best sample. Despite its limited size, our best sample more
than doubles the number of known BAL QSOs with clear ghost signatures and
should make an excellent basis for detailed follow-up studies.
