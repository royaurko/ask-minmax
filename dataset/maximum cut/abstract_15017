We illustrate a class of conditional models for the analysis of longitudinal
data suffering attrition in random effects models framework, where the
subject-specific random effects are assumed to be discrete and to follow a
time-dependent latent process. The latent process accounts for unobserved
heterogeneity and correlation between individuals in a dynamic fashion, and for
dependence between the observed process and the missing data mechanism. Of
particular interest is the case where the missing mechanism is non-ignorable.
To deal with the topic we introduce a conditional to dropout model. A shape
change in the random effects distribution is considered by directly modeling
the effect of the missing data process on the evolution of the latent
structure. To estimate the resulting model, we rely on the conditional maximum
likelihood approach and for this aim we outline an EM algorithm. The proposal
is illustrated via simulations and then applied on a dataset concerning skin
cancers. Comparisons with other well-established methods are provided as well.
