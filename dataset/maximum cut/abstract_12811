A method for identifying statistical equilibrium stages in dynamical
multifragmentation paths as provided by transport models, already successfully
tested for for the reaction ^{129}Xe+^{119}Sn at 32 MeV/u is applied here to a
higher energy reaction, ^{129}Xe+^{119}Sn at 50 MeV/u. The method evaluates
equilibrium from the point of view of the microcanonical multifragmentation
model (MMM) and reactions are simulated by means of the stochastic mean field
model (SMF). A unique solution, corresponding to the maximum population of the
system phase space, was identified suggesting that a huge part of the available
phase space is occupied even in the case of the 50 MeV/u reaction, in presence
of a considerable amount of radial collective flow. The specific equilibration
time and volume are identified and differences between the two systems are
discussed.
