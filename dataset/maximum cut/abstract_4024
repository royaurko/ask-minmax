Small-world networks are the focus of recent interest because they appear to
circumvent many of the limitations of either random networks or regular
lattices as frameworks for the study of interaction networks of complex
systems. Here, we report an empirical study of the statistical properties of a
variety of diverse real-world networks. We present evidence of the occurrence
of three classes of small-world networks: (a) scale-free networks,
characterized by a vertex connectivity distribution that decays as a power law;
(b) broad-scale networks, characterized by a connectivity distribution that has
a power-law regime followed by a sharp cut-off; (c) single-scale networks,
characterized by a connectivity distribution with a fast decaying tail.
Moreover, we note for the classes of broad-scale and single-scale networks that
there are constraints limiting the addition of new links. Our results suggest
that the nature of such constraints may be the controlling factor for the
emergence of different classes of networks.
