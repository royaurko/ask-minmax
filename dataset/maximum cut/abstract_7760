Online Social Networks (OSNs) are a cutting edge topic. Almost everybody
--users, marketers, brands, companies, and researchers-- is approaching OSNs to
better understand them and take advantage of their benefits. Maybe one of the
key concepts underlying OSNs is that of influence which is highly related,
although not entirely identical, to those of popularity and centrality.
Influence is, according to Merriam-Webster, "the capacity of causing an effect
in indirect or intangible ways". Hence, in the context of OSNs, it has been
proposed to analyze the clicks received by promoted URLs in order to check for
any positive correlation between the number of visits and different "influence"
scores. Such an evaluation methodology is used in this paper to compare a
number of those techniques with a new method firstly described here. That new
method is a simple and rather elegant solution which tackles with influence in
OSNs by applying a physical metaphor.
