Magnetic and heat capacity measurements have been carried out on the
polycrystalline sample of DyNi which crystallizes in the orthorhombic FeB
structure (space group Pnma). This compound is ferromagnetic with a Curie
temperature of 59 K. Magnetization-field isotherms at low temperatures shows a
step-like behavior characteristic of metamagnetic transitions. The
magnetocaloric effect has been measured both in terms of isothermal magnetic
entropy change and adiabatic temperature change for various applied magnetic
fields. The maximum values of the entropy change and the temperature change are
found to be 19 Jkg-1K-1 and 4.5 K, respectively, for a field of 60 kOe. The
large magnetocaloric effect is attributed to the field-induced spin-flop
metamagnetism occurring in this compound, which has a noncollinear magnetic
structure at low fields.
