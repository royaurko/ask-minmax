The local entanglement $E_v$ of the one-dimensional Hubbard model is studied
on the basis of its Bethe-ansatz solution. The relationship between the local
entanglement and the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$ is obtained. Our results
show that $E_v$ is an even analytic function of $U$ at half-filling and it
reaches a maximum at the critical point U=0. The variation of the local
entanglement with the filling factor shows that the ground state with maximal
symmetry possesses maximal entanglement. The magnetic field makes the local
entanglement to decrease and approach to zero at saturated magnetization. The
on-site Coulomb interaction always suppresses the local entanglement.
