On the basis of Friedel approach the theoretical description of the effects
of resonance scattering of conduction electrons by donor impurities in
semiconductors with allowance for the stabilization of electron concentration
in coinciding the Fermi energy with the resonance level energy has been
developed. It has been shown that such a stabilization gives rise to the
appearance of maximum in concentration dependence and to its related anomalies
of temperature dependences of electron mobility. The advantage of the
application of the approach based on the proposed theory to the interpretation
of experimental data on mercury selenide with iron impurities is discussed.
