We further develop the formalism for taking position-space cuts of eikonal
diagrams introduced in [Phys.Rev.Lett. 114 (2015), no. 18 181602,
arXiv:1410.5681]. These cuts are applied directly to the position-space
representation of any such diagram and compute its discontinuity to the leading
order in the dimensional regulator. We provide algorithms for computing the
position-space cuts and apply them to several two- and three-loop eikonal
diagrams, finding agreement with results previously obtained in the literature.
We discuss a non-trivial interplay between the cutting prescription and
non-Abelian exponentiation. We furthermore discuss the relation of the
imaginary part of the cusp anomalous dimension to the static interquark
potential.
