We analyse second moments $R_2$ of like-sign pion pairs in the
two-dimensional $(q_L,q_T)$ and three-dimensional $(q_O,q_S,q_L)$
decompositions of the three-momentum difference. Conventional fit
parametrisations such as gaussian, exponential, power-law and Edgeworth fail
miserably, while more elaborate ones such as Levy do well but fail to yield a
unique best-fit solution. A two-component model using a hard cut to separate
small- and large-scale parts appears possible but not compelling. In all cases,
the data exhibits a strong and hitherto unexplained peak at small momentum
differences which exceeds current fits.
