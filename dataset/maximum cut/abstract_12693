The response of turbulent flow to time-modulated forcing is studied by direct
numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. The large-scale forcing
is modulated via periodic energy input variations at frequency $\omega$. The
response is maximal for frequencies in the range of the inverse of the large
eddy turnover time, confirming the mean-field predictions of von der Heydt,
Grossmann and Lohse (Phys. Rev. E 67, 046308 (2003)). In accordance with the
theory the response maximum shows only a small dependence on the Reynolds
number and is also quite insensitive to the particular flow-quantity that is
monitored, e.g., kinetic energy, dissipation-rate, or Taylor-Reynolds number.
At sufficiently high frequencies the amplitude of the kinetic energy response
decreases as $1/\omega$. For frequencies beyond the range of maximal response,
a significant change in phase-shift relative to the time-modulated forcing is
observed.
