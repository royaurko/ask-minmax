We present an ansatz for all one-loop amplitudes in pure Einstein gravity for
which the n external gravitons have the same outgoing helicity. These loop
amplitudes, which are rational functions of the momenta, also arise in the
quantization of self-dual gravity in four-dimensional Minkowski space. Our
ansatz agrees with explicit computations via D-dimensional unitarity cuts for n
less than or equal to 6. It also has the expected analytic behavior, for all n,
as a graviton becomes soft, and as two momenta become collinear. The gravity
results are closely related to analogous amplitudes in (self-dual) Yang-Mills
theory.
