We use the Herschel SPIRE color-color diagram to study the spectral energy
distribution (SED) and the redshift estimation of high-z galaxies. We compiled
a sample of 57 galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts and SPIRE
detections in all three bands at $z=2.5-6.4$, and compared their average SPIRE
colors with SED templates from local and high-z libraries. We find that local
SEDs are inconsistent with high-z observations. The local calibrations of the
parameters need to be adjusted to describe the average colors of high-z
galaxies. For high-z libraries, the templates with an evolution from z=0 to 3
can well describe the average colors of the observations at high redshift.
Using these templates, we defined color cuts to divide the SPIRE color-color
diagram into different regions with different mean redshifts. We tested this
method and two other color cut methods using a large sample of 783
Herschel-selected galaxies, and find that although these methods can separate
the sample into populations with different mean redshifts, the dispersion of
redshifts in each population is considerably large. Additional information is
needed for better sampling.
