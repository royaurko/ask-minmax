The photoproduction of Drell-Yan lepton pairs at HERA is studied. We show
that in the backward rapidity region the cross section is strongly sensitive to
the small-$x$ behaviour of the quark distributions in the proton, and that with
sufficient luminosity it should be possible to distinguish singular $xq \sim
x^{-1/2}$ behaviour from standard Regge $xq \sim x^0$ behaviour. The effect on
the event rate of experimental acceptance cuts is studied with the help of a
Monte Carlo event generator.
