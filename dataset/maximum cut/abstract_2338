The paper contains a new non-perturbative representation for subleading
contribution to the free energy of multicut solution for hermitian matrix
model. This representation is a generalisation of the formula, proposed by
Klemm, Marino and Theisen for two cut solution, which was obtained by comparing
the cubic matrix model with the topological B-model on the local Calabi-Yau
geometry $\hat {II}$ and was checked perturbatively. In this paper we give a
direct proof of their formula and generalise it to the general multicut
solution.
