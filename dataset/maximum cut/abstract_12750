We propose a scheme which encodes information in both the longitudinal and
spatial transverse phases of a continuous-wave optical beam. A split
detector-based interferometric scheme is then introduced to optimally detect
both encoded phase signals. In contrast to present-day optical storage devices,
our phase coding scheme has an information storage capacity which scales with
the power of the read-out optical beam. We analyse the maximum number of
encoding possibilities at the shot noise limit. In addition, we show that using
squeezed light, the shot noise limit can be overcome and the number of encoding
possibilities increased. We discuss a possible application of our phase coding
scheme for increasing the capacities of optical storage devices.
