We describe a new B-meson full reconstruction algorithm designed for the
Belle experiment at the B-factory KEKB, an asymmetric e+e- collider that
collected a data sample of 771.6 x 10^6 BBbar pairs during its running time. To
maximize the number of reconstructed B decay channels, it utilizes a
hierarchical reconstruction procedure and probabilistic calculus instead of
classical selection cuts. The multivariate analysis package NeuroBayes was used
extensively to hold the balance between highest possible efficiency, robustness
and acceptable consumption of CPU time.
  In total, 1104 exclusive decay channels were reconstructed, employing 71
neural networks altogether. Overall, we correctly reconstruct one B+/- or B0
candidate in 0.28% or 0.18% of the BBbar events, respectively. Compared to the
cut-based classical reconstruction algorithm used at the Belle experiment, this
is an improvement in efficiency by roughly a factor of 2, depending on the
analysis considered.
  The new framework also features the ability to choose the desired purity or
efficiency of the fully reconstructed sample freely. If the same purity as for
the classical full reconstruction code is desired ~25%, the efficiency is still
larger by nearly a factor of 2. If, on the other hand, the efficiency is chosen
at a similar level as the classical full reconstruction, the purity rises from
~25% to nearly 90%.
