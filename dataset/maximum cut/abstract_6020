A novel mechanism for the generation of self-organized criticality (SOC) is
discussed in terms of the coupled-vibration model where the total system is
forced under the uniform expansion of the Hubble type. This system shows a
robust SOC behavior while the maximum size of the fluctuation, number of
correlated particles in it and the temporal size of the system evolve as a
function of time.
