We study AdS$_7$ vacua of massive type IIA string theory compactified on a
3-sphere with $H_3$ flux and anti-D6-branes. In such backgrounds, the
anti-brane backreaction is known to generate a singularity in the $H_3$ energy
density, whose interpretation has not been understood so far. We first consider
supersymmetric solutions of this setup and give an analytic proof that the flux
singularity is resolved there by a polarization of the anti-D6-branes into a
D8-brane, which wraps a finite 2-sphere inside of the compact space. To this
end, we compute the potential for a spherical probe D8-brane on top of a
background with backreacting anti-D6-branes and show that it has a local
maximum at zero radius and a local minimum at a finite radius of the 2-sphere.
The polarization is triggered by a term in the potential due to the AdS
curvature and does therefore not occur in non-compact setups where the 7d
external spacetime is Minkowski. We furthermore find numerical evidence for the
existence of non-supersymmetric solutions in our setup. This is supported by
the observation that the general solution to the equations of motion has a
continuous parameter that is suggestive of a modulus and appears to control
supersymmetry breaking. Analyzing the polarization potential for the
non-supersymmetric solutions, we find that the flux singularities are resolved
there by brane polarization as well.
