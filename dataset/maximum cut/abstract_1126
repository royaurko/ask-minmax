We discuss recent progress in understanding the effects of certain trapping
geometries on cut-off resolvent estimates, and thus on the qualititative
behavior of linear evolution equations. We focus on trapping that is unstable,
so that strong resolvent estimates hold on the real axis, and large
resonance-free regions can be shown to exist beyond it.
