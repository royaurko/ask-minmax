The phenomenon of Stochastic Resonance (SR) is observed in a completely
deterministic setting - with thermal noise being replaced by one-dimensional
chaos. The piecewise linear map investigated in the paper shows a transition
from symmetry-broken to symmetric chaos on increasing a system parameter. In
the latter state, the chaotic trajectory switches between the two formerly
disjoint attractors, driven by the map's inherent dynamics. This chaotic
switching rate is found to `resonate' with the frequency of an externally
applied periodic perturbation (multiplicative or additive). By periodically
modulating the parameter at a specific frequency $\omega$, we observe the
existence of resonance where the response of the system (in terms of the
residence-time distribution) is maximum. This is a clear indication of SR-like
behavior in a chaotic system.
