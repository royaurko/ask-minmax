Morpho-kinematic modeling allows us to disentangle the morphology and
kinematics of an object. The technique has been applied to a number of novae
where resolved imaging, or lack of, and spectroscopic line profile fitting,
show how we may retrieve important parameters of the system, such as the
maximum expansion velocity, inclination angle and the morphology of the ejected
shell. Furthermore, this technique may be used as a predictor for searches of
eclipses which will then provide us further information on the system
parameters, such as the orbital period and the white dwarf mass.
