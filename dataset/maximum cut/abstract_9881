On the basis of the 30-year ago ground-based photometry and the recent Kepler
space experiment there have been considered frequencies of occurrence and
energetics of the solar-type stellar flares. It was concluded that frequencies
of occurrence of such flares are proportional to sizes of stellar surfaces, and
estimates of maximum flare radiation from the results of the ground-based
photometry and space observations practically coincide.
