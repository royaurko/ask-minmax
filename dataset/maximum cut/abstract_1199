We examine several types of visibility graphs in which sightlines can pass
through $k$ objects. For $k \geq 1$ we bound the maximum thickness of semi-bar
$k$-visibility graphs between $\lceil \frac{2}{3} (k + 1) \rceil$ and $2k$. In
addition we show that the maximum number of edges in arc and circle
$k$-visibility graphs on $n$ vertices is at most $(k+1)(3n-k-2)$ for $n > 4k+4$
and ${n \choose 2}$ for $n \leq 4k+4$, while the maximum chromatic number is at
most $6k+6$. In semi-arc $k$-visibility graphs on $n$ vertices, we show that
the maximum number of edges is ${n \choose 2}$ for $n \leq 3k+3$ and at most
$(k+1)(2n-\frac{k+2}{2})$ for $n > 3k+3$, while the maximum chromatic number is
at most $4k+4$.
