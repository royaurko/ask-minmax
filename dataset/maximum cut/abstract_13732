The negative effective magnetic pressure instability operates on scales
encompassing many turbulent eddies and is here discussed in connection with the
formation of active regions near the surface layers of the Sun. This
instability is related to the negative contribution of turbulence to the mean
magnetic pressure that causes the formation of large-scale magnetic structures.
For an isothermal layer, direct numerical simulations and mean-field
simulations of this phenomenon are shown to agree in many details in that their
onset occurs at the same depth. This depth increases with increasing field
strength, such that the maximum growth rate of this instability is independent
of the field strength, provided the magnetic structures are fully contained
within the domain. A linear stability analysis is shown to support this
finding. The instability also leads to a redistribution of turbulent intensity
and gas pressure that could provide direct observational signatures.
