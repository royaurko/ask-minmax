We present the results of a search for pulsed TeV emission from the Crab
pulsar using the Whipple Observatory's 10m gamma-ray telescope. The direction
of the Crab pulsar was observed for a total of 73.4 hours between 1994 November
and 1997 March. Spectral analysis techniques were applied to search for the
presence of a gamma-ray signal from the Crab pulsar over the energy band 250GeV
to 4TeV. At these energies we do not see any evidence of the 33ms pulsations
present at lower energies from the Crab pulsar. The 99.9% confidence level
upper limit for pulsed emission above 250GeV is derived to be 4.8 10^-12 cm^-2
s^-1 or <3% of the steady flux from the Crab Nebula. These results imply a
sharp cut-off of the power-law spectrum seen by the EGRET instrument on the
Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. If the cut-off is exponential, it must begin at
60GeV or lower to accommodate these upper limits.
