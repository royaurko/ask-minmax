We investigate an idealized model for the size reduction and smoothing of a
polygonal rock due to repeated chipping at corners. Each chip is sufficiently
small so that only a single corner and a fraction of its two adjacent sides are
cut from the object in a single chipping event. After many chips have been cut
away, the resulting shape of the rock is generally anisotropic, with facet
lengths and corner angles distributed over a broad range. Although a
well-defined shape is quickly reached for each realization, there are large
fluctuations between realizations.
