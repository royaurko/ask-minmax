Analytic evaluation of heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix
estimates (HCCME) is difficult because of the complexity of the formulae
currently available. We obtain new analytic formulae for the bias of a class of
estimators of the covariance matrix of OLS in a standard linear regression
model. These formulae provide substantial insight into the properties and
performance characteristics of these estimators. In particular, we find a new
estimator which minimizes the maximum possible bias and improves substantially
on the standard Eicker-White estimate.
