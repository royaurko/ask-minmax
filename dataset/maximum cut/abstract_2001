We discuss processes accelerating cosmic ray electrons at boundaries of
relativistic jets. The resulting spectrum is expected to posses two
characteristic components: a power-law distribution at lower energies and a
harder high energy component preceding the high energy cut-off. An example of
high energy spectrum from such electron distribution is presented, including
the synchrotron and the inverse-Compton components. A characteristic feature of
the synchrotron spectrum of such electrons is its highest frequency part which
occurs above the power-law fitted to the low frequency spectral range.
