Dirichlet process (DP) mixture models provide a flexible Bayesian framework
for density estimation. Unfortunately, their flexibility comes at a cost:
inference in DP mixture models is computationally expensive, even when
conjugate distributions are used. In the common case when one seeks only a
maximum a posteriori assignment of data points to clusters, we show that search
algorithms provide a practical alternative to expensive MCMC and variational
techniques. When a true posterior sample is desired, the solution found by
search can serve as a good initializer for MCMC. Experimental results show that
using these techniques is it possible to apply DP mixture models to very large
data sets.
