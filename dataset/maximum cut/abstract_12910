Micro fuel cells ($\mu$-FC) represent promising power sources for portable
applications. Today, one of the technological ways to make $\mu$-FC is to have
recourse to standard microfabrication techniques used in the fabrication of
micro electromechanical systems (MEMS). This paper shows an overview on the
applications of MEMS techniques on miniature FC by presenting several solutions
developed throughout the world. It also describes the latest developments of a
new porous silicon-based miniature fuel cell. Using a silane grafted on an
inorganic porous media as the proton-exchange membrane instead of a common
ionomer such as Nafion, the fuel cell achieved a maximum power density of 58 mW
cm-2 at room temperature with hydrogen as fuel.
