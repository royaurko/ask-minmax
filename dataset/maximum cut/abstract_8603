Experimental result regarding the maximum limit of the radius of the electron
\sim 10^{-16} cm and a few of the theoretical works suggest that the
gravitational mass which is a priori a positive quantity in Newtonian mechanics
may become negative in general theory of relativity. It is argued that such a
negative gravitational mass and hence negative energy density also can be
obtained with a better physical interpretation in the framework of
Einstein-Cartan theory.
