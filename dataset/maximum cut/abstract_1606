In this paper, we consider heterogeneous distributed storage systems (DSSs)
having flexible reconstruction degree, where each node in the system has
dynamic repair bandwidth and dynamic storage capacity. In particular, a data
collector can reconstruct the file at time $t$ using some arbitrary nodes in
the system and for a node failure the system can be repaired by some set of
arbitrary nodes. Using $min$-$cut$ bound, we investigate the fundamental
tradeoff between storage and repair cost for our model of heterogeneous DSS. In
particular, the problem is formulated as bi-objective optimization linear
programing problem. For an arbitrary DSS, it is shown that the calculated
$min$-$cut$ bound is tight.
