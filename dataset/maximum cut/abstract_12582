Results on high transverse momentum charged particle emission with respect to
the reaction plane are presented for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=
200 GeV. Two- and four-particle correlations results are presented as well as a
comparison of azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions to those in $p+p$ at
the same energy. Elliptic anisotropy, $v_2$, is found to reach its maximum at
$p_t \sim 3$ GeV/c, then decrease slowly and remain significant up to
$p_t\approx 7$ -- 10 GeV/c. Stronger suppression is found in the back-to-back
high-$p_t$ particle correlations for particles emitted out-of-plane compared to
those emitted in-plane. The centrality dependence of $v_2$ at intermediate
$p_t$ is compared to simple models based on jet quenching.
