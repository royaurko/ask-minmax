The two-band model possessing metal and semiconductor properties is offered.
This model may explain the appearance of temperature maximum of the electrical
resistance at the proper relationships between the parameters of the theory.
The calculations are carried in the tight-binding approximation. The
applicability of the model to the manganites is discussed.
