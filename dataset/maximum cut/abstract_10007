We present a Bayesian technique based on a maximum entropy method to
reconstruct the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ in a non--parametric way.
This MaxEnt technique allows to incorporate relevant prior information while
adjusting the degree of smoothing of the reconstruction in response to the
structure present in the data.
  After demonstrating the method on synthetic data, we apply it to current
cosmological data, separately analysing type Ia supernovae measurement from the
HST/GOODS program and the first year Supernovae Legacy Survey (SNLS),
complemented by cosmic microwave background and baryonic acoustic oscillations
data. We find that the SNLS data are compatible with $w(z) = -1$ at all
redshifts $0 \leq z \lsim 1100$, with errorbars of order 20% for the most
constraining choice of priors. The HST/GOODS data exhibit a slight (about
$1\sigma$ significance) preference for $w>-1$ at $z\sim 0.5$ and a drift
towards $w>-1$ at larger redshifts, which however is not robust with respect to
changes in our prior specifications. We employ both a constant equation of
state prior model and a slowly varying $w(z)$ and find that our conclusions are
only mildly dependent on this choice at high redshifts.
  Our method highlights the danger of employing parametric fits for the unknown
equation of state, that can potentially miss or underestimate real structure in
the data.
