We perform an independent foreground analysis of the WMAP maps to produce a
cleaned CMB map (available online) useful for cross-correlation with, e.g.,
galaxy and X-ray maps. We use a variant of the Tegmark & Efstathiou (1996)
technique that is completely blind, making no assumptions about the CMB power
spectrum, the foregrounds, WMAP detector noise or external templates. Compared
with the foreground-cleaned internal linear combination map produced by the
WMAP team, our map has the advantage of containing less non-CMB power (from
foregrounds and detector noise) outside the Galactic plane. The difference is
most important on the the angular scale of the first acoustic peak and below,
since our cleaned map is at the highest (13') rather than lowest (49') WMAP
resolution. We also produce a Wiener filtered CMB map, representing our best
guess as to what the CMB sky actually looks like, as well as CMB-free maps at
the five WMAP frequencies useful for foreground studies.
  We argue that our CMB map is clean enough that the lowest multipoles can be
measured without any galaxy cut, and obtain a quadrupole value that is slightly
less low than that from the cut-sky WMAP team analysis. This can be understood
from a map of the CMB quadrupole, which shows much of its power falling within
the Galaxy cut region, seemingly coincidentally. Intriguingly, both the
quadrupole and the octopole are seen to have power suppressed along a
particular spatial axis, which lines up between the two, roughly towards (l,b)
\~ (-110,60) in Virgo.
