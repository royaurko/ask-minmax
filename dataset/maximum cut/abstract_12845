We present results of density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the
structural supermodulation in BSCCO-2212 structure, and show that the
supermodulation is indeed a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the nominal
crystal symmetry, rather than a phenomenon driven by interstitial O dopants.
The structure obtained is in excellent quantitative agreement with recent x-ray
studies, and reproduces several qualitative aspects of scanning tunnelling
microscopy (STM) experiments as well. The primary structural modulation
affecting the CuO_2 plane is found to be a buckling wave of tilted CuO_5
half-octahedra, with maximum tilt angle near the phase of the supermodulation
where recent STM experiments have discovered an enhancement of the
superconducting gap. We argue that the tilting of the half-octahedra and
concommitant planar buckling are directly modulating the superconducting pair
interaction.
