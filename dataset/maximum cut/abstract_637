In order to incorporate the finite range effect into effective interactions,
a modification of the Skyrme force by introducing a cut-off factor for high
momentum transfers is proposed. The parameters of the cut-off factor are
determined by fitting the microscopic in-medium cross-sections of Li and
Machleidt over a wide range of energy and nuclear density. Results for the SkM*
and SLy4 forces are presented.
