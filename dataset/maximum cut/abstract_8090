Recently the ATLAS experiment announced a 3 $\sigma$ excess at the Z-peak
consisting of 29 pairs of leptons together with two or more jets, $E_T^{\rm
miss}> 225$ GeV and $H_T \geq 600$ GeV, to be compared with $10.6 \pm 3.2$
expected lepton pairs in the Standard Model. No excess outside the Z-peak was
observed. By trying to explain this signal with SUSY we find that only
relatively light gluinos, $m_{\tilde g} \lesssim 1.2$ TeV, together with a
heavy neutralino NLSP of $m_{\tilde \chi} \gtrsim 400$ GeV decaying
predominantly to Z-boson plus a light gravitino, such that nearly every gluino
produces at least one Z-boson in its decay chain, could reproduce the excess.
We construct an explicit general gauge mediation model able to reproduce the
observed signal overcoming all the experimental cuts. Needless to say, more
sophisticated models could also reproduce the signal, however, any model would
have to exhibit the following features, light gluinos, or heavy particles with
a strong production cross-section, producing at least one Z-boson in its decay
chain. The implications of our findings for the Run II at LHC with the scaling
on the Z peak, as well as for the direct search of gluinos and other SUSY
particles, are pointed out.
