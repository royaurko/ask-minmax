In this paper, utilizing the relay buffers, we propose an opportunistic
decode-wait-and-forward relay scheme for a point-to-point communication system
with a half-duplexing relay network to better exploit the time diversity and
relay mobility. For instance, we analyze the asymptotic throughput-delay
tradeoffs in a dense relay network for two scenarios: (1) fixed relays with
\textit{microscopic fading} channels (multipath channels), and (2) mobile
relays with \textit{macroscopic fading} channels (path loss). In the first
scenario, the proposed scheme can better exploit the \textit{multi-relay
diversity} in the sense that with $K$ fixed relays and a cost of
$\mathcal{O}(K)$ average end-to-end packet delay, it could achieve the same
optimal asymptotic average throughput as the existing designs (such as regular
decode-and-forward relay schemes) with $K^2$ fixed relays. In the second
scenario, the proposed scheme achieves the maximum throughput of $\Theta(\log
K)$ at a cost of $\mathcal{O}(K/q)$ average end-to-end packet delay, where
$0<q\leq {1/2}$ measures the speed of relays' mobility. This system throughput
is unattainable for the existing designs with low relay mobility, the proposed
relay scheme can exploit the relays' mobility more efficiently.
