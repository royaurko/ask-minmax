We present a fully dynamic algorithm for the recognition of proper
circular-arc (PCA) graphs. The allowed operations on the graph involve the
insertion and removal of vertices (together with its incident edges) or edges.
Edge operations cost O(log n) time, where n is the number of vertices of the
graph, while vertex operations cost O(log n + d) time, where d is the degree of
the modified vertex. We also show incremental and decremental algorithms that
work in O(1) time per inserted or removed edge. As part of our algorithm, fully
dynamic connectivity and co-connectivity algorithms that work in O(log n) time
per operation are obtained. Also, an O(\Delta) time algorithm for determining
if a PCA representation corresponds to a co-bipartite graph is provided, where
\Delta\ is the maximum among the degrees of the vertices. When the graph is
co-bipartite, a co-bipartition of each of its co-components is obtained within
the same amount of time.
