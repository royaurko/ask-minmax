Magnetic stimulation is a standard tool in brain research and many fields of
neurology, as well as psychiatry. From a physical perspective, one key aspect
of this method is the inefficiency of available setups. Whereas the spatial
field properties have been studied rather intensively with coil designs, the
dynamics have been neglected almost completely for a long time. Instead, the
devices and their technology defined the waveform. Here, an analysis of the
waveform space is performed. Based on these data, an appropriate optimisation
approach is outlined which makes use of a modern nonlinear axon description of
a mammalian motor nerve. The approach is based on a hybrid global-local method;
different coordinate systems for describing the continuous waveforms in a
limited parameter space are defined for sufficient stability. The results of
the numeric setup suggest that there is plenty of room for waveforms with
higher efficiency than the traditional shapes. One class of such pulses is
analysed further. Although the voltage profile of these waveforms is almost
rectangular, the current shape presents distinct characteristics, such as a
first phase which precedes the main pulse and decreases the losses. The single
representatives, which differ in their maximum voltage shape, are linked by a
nonlinear transformation. The main phase, however, seems to scale in time only.
