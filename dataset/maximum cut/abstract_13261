We relate short-range correlations in ultracold atomic Fermi gases to the
entropy of the system over the entire temperature, $T$, vs. coupling strength,
$-1/k_Fa$, plane. In the low temperature limit the entropy is dominated by
phonon excitations and the correlations increase as $T^4$. In the BEC limit, we
calculate a boson model within the Bogoliubov approximation to show explicitly
how phonons enhance the fermion correlations. In the high temperature limit, we
show from the virial expansion that the correlations decrease as $1/T$. The
correlations therefore reach a maximum at a finite temperature. We infer the
general structure of the isentropes of the Fermi gas in the $T,-1/k_Fa$ plane,
and the temperature dependence of the correlations in the unitary, BEC, and BCS
limits. Our results compare well with measurements of the correlations via
photoassociation experiments at higher temperatures.
