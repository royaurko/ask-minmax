We propose a canonical definition of the Stein operator and Stein class of a
distribution. The resulting Stein identity highlights the unifying theme behind
the literature on Stein's method. Viewing the Stein operator as an operator
acting on pairs of functions, we provide an extensive toolkit for
distributional comparisons. Several abstract approximation theorems are
provided. Our approach is illustrated for comparison of several pairs of
distributions : normal vs normal, normal vs Student, maximum of random
variables vs Gumbel and exponential, and Beta-binomial vs Beta.
