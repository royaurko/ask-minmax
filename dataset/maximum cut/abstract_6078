The extended nonlinear model has been applied to construct neutron star
matter equation of state. In the case of neutron star matter with non-zero
strangeness the extension of the vector meson sector by the inclusion of
nonlinear mixed terms results in the stiffening of the equation of state and
accordingly in the higher value of the maximum neutron star mass.
