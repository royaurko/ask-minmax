Renormalization of the electronic band gap due to electron-phonon coupling in
the tetrahedral semiconductors diamond, silicon and cubic silicon carbide is
studied from first principles. There is a marked difference between the
coupling of the vibrational state to the valence band maximum and to the
conduction band minimum. The strength of phonon coupling to the valence band
maximum is similar between the three systems and is dominated by vibrations
that change the bond length. The coupling strength to the conduction band
minimum differs significantly in diamond, silicon carbide and silicon. In
diamond, the coupling is dominated by six small pockets of vibrational states
in the phonon Brillouin zone, that are ultimately responsible for the stronger
electron-phonon coupling in this material. Our results represent a first step
towards the development of an a priori understanding of electron-phonon
coupling in semiconductors and insulators, that should aid the design of
materials with tailored electron-phonon coupling properties.
