A simple model of 1D structure based on a Fibonacci sequence with variable
atomic spacings is proposed. The model allows for observation of the continuous
transition between periodic and non-periodic diffraction patterns. The
diffraction patterns are calculated analytically both using ``cut and project''
and ``average unit cell'' methods, taking advantage of the physical space
properties of the structure.
