The effect of the transverse AC magnetic field on relaxation process in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$ melt-textured superconductor was studied. A factor of 50
suppression of the relaxation rate could be achieved at the expense of some
reduction in the maximum trapped field, with the magnetic-induction gradient
being unchanged. This phenomenon is interpreted as a result of an increase of
the pinning force after the action of the transverse AC magnetic field that is
confirmed by the measurement of the trapped-induction distribution.
