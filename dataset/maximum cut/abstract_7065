Voigt wave propagation (VWP) was considered in a porous biaxial dielectric
material which was infiltrated with a material of refractive index $n_a$. The
infiltrated material was regarded as a homogenized composite material in the
long-wavelength regime and its constitutive parameters were estimated using the
extended Bruggeman homogenization formalism. In our numerical studies, the
directions which support VWP were found to vary by as much as $300^\circ$ per
RIU as the refractive index $n_a$ was varied. The sensitivities achieved were
acutely dependent upon the refractive index $n_a$ and the degrees of anisotropy
and dissipation of the porous biaxial material. The orientations, shapes and
sizes of the particles which constitute the infiltrating material and the
porous biaxial material exerted only a secondary influence on the maximum
sensitivities achieved. Also, for the parameter ranges considered, the degree
of porosity of the biaxial material had little effect on the maximum
sensitivities achieved. These numerical findings bode well for the possible
harnessing of VWP for optical sensing applications.
