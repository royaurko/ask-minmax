We have studied the relativistic beamed outflow proposed to occur in the
collapsar model of gamma-ray bursts. A jet forms as a consequence of an assumed
energy deposition of $\sim 10^{50}- 10^{51}$ erg/s within a $30^{\circ}$ cone
around the rotation axis of the progenitor star. The generated jet flow is
strongly beamed ($\la$ few degrees) and reaches the surface of the stellar
progenitor (r $\approx 3 10^{10} $cm) intact. At break-out the maximum Lorentz
factor of the jet flow is about 33. Simulations have been performed with the
GENESIS multi-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic code.
