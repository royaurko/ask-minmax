In our previous studies we have investigated the structural complexity of
time series describing stock returns on New York's and Warsaw's stock
exchanges, by employing two estimators of Shannon's entropy rate based on
Lempel-Ziv and Context Tree Weighting algorithms, which were originally used
for data compression. Such structural complexity of the time series describing
logarithmic stock returns can be used as a measure of the inherent (model-free)
predictability of the underlying price formation processes, testing the
Efficient-Market Hypothesis in practice. We have also correlated the estimated
predictability with the profitability of standard trading algorithms, and found
that these do not use the structure inherent in the stock returns to any
significant degree. To find a way to use the structural complexity of the stock
returns for the purpose of predictions we propose the Maximum Entropy
Production Principle as applied to stock returns, and test it on the two
mentioned markets, inquiring into whether it is possible to enhance prediction
of stock returns based on the structural complexity of these and the mentioned
principle.
