Within the framework of proton ordering model with taking into account the
piezoelectric interaction with the shear strain $\varepsilon_6$, a dynamic
dielectric response of KD2PO4 type ferroelectrics is considered. An expression
for the piezoelectric resonance frequencies of the rectangular thin plate of
the crystal cut in the (001) plane is obtained.
