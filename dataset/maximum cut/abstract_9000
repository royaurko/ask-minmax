Suppose a projectile collides perpendicularly with a stationary rigid rod on
a smooth horizontal table. We show that, contrary to what one naturally
expects, it is not always the case that the rod acquires maximum angular
velocity when struck at an extremity. The treatment is intended for first year
university students of Physics or Engineering, and could form the basis of a
tutorial discussion of conservation laws in rigid body dynamics.
