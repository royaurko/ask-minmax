Radiative processes lead to important corrections to (e,e'p) experiments.
While radiative corrections can be calculated exactly in QED and to a good
accuracy also including hadronic corrections, these corrections cannot be
included into data analyses to arbitrary orders exactly. Nevertheless
consideration of multi-photon bremsstrahlung above the low-energy cut-off is
important for many (e,e'p) experiments. To date, higher-order bremsstrahlung
effects concerning electron scattering experiments have been implemented
approximately by employing the soft-photon approximation (SPA). In this paper
we propose a novel approach to multi-photon emission which partially removes
the SPA from (e,e'p) experiments. In this combined approach one hard photon is
treated exactly; and additional softer bremsstrahlung photons are taken into
account resorting to the soft-photon approximation. This partial removal of the
soft-photon approximation is shown to be relevant for the missing-energy
distribution for several kinematic settings at MAMI and TJNAF energies.
