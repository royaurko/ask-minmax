An analytical solution for the out-of-equilibrium quasi-stationary states of
the paradigmatic Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model can be obtained from a
maximum entropy principle. The theory has been so far tested with reference to
a specific class of initial condition, the so called (single-level) water-bag
type. In this paper a step forward is taken by considering an arbitrary number
of overlapping water bags. The theory is benchmarked to direct microcanonical
simulations performed for the case of a two-levels water-bag. The comparison is
shown to return an excellent agreement.
