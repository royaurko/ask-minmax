Motivated by the dark matter and the baryon asymmetry problems, we analyse a
complex singlet extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a Z2 symmetry (which
provides a dark matter candidate). After a detailed two-loop calculation of the
renormalization group equations for the new scalar sector, we study the
radiative stability of the model up to a high energy scale (with the constraint
that the 126 GeV Higgs boson found at the LHC is in the spectrum) and find it
requires the existence of a new scalar state mixing with the Higgs with a mass
larger than 140 GeV. This bound is not very sensitive to the cut-off scale as
long as the latter is larger than 10^10 GeV. We then include all experimental
and observational constraints/measurements from collider data, dark matter
direct detection experiments and from the Planck satellite and in addition
force stability at least up to the GUT scale, to find that the lower bound is
raised to about 170 GeV, while the dark matter particle must be heavier than
about 50 GeV.
