Replacing traditional fossil fuel vehicles with innovative zero-emission
vehicles for the transport in ci ties is one of the major tactics to achieve
the UK government 2020 target of cutting emission. We are developing an
agent-based simulation model to study the possible impact of different
governmental interventions on the diffusion of such vehicles. Options that
could be studied with our what-if analysis to include things like car parking
charges, price of electrical car, energy awareness and word of mouth. In this
paper we present a first case study related to the introduction of a new car
park charging scheme at the University of Nottingham. We have developed an
agent based model to simulate theimpact of different car parking rates and
other incentives on the uptake of electrical cars. The goal of this case study
is to demonstrate the usefulness of agent-based modelling and simulation for
such investigations.
