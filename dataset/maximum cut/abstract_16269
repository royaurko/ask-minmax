We report the discovery of the wide L1.5+L4.5 binary 2MASS
J15200224-4422419AB, identified during spectroscopic followup of high proper
motion sources selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey. This source was
independently identified by Kendall et al. in the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey.
Resolved JHK photometry and low resolution near-infrared spectroscopy
demonstrate that this system is composed of two well-separated (1"174+/-0"016)
L dwarfs. Component classifications are derived using both spectral ratios and
comparison to near-infrared spectra of previously classified field L dwarfs.
Physical association for the pair is deduced from the large (mu = 0"73+/-0"03
/yr) common proper motion of the components and their similar
spectrophotometric distances (19+/-2 pc). The projected separation of the
binary, 22+/-2 AU, is consistent with maximum separation/total system mass
trends for very low mass binaries. The 2MASS J1520-4422 system exhibits both
large tangential (66+/-7 km/s) and radial velocities (-70+/-18 km/s), and its
motion in the local standard of rest suggests that it is an old member of the
Galactic disk population. This system joins a growing list of well-separated
(>0"5), very low mass binaries, and is an excellent target for resolved optical
spectroscopy to constrain its age as well as trace activity/rotation trends
near the hydrogen-burning limit.
