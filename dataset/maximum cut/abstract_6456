An interleaver is a critical component for the channel coding performance of
turbo codes. Algebraic constructions are of particular interest because they
admit analytical designs and simple, practical hardware implementation.
Contention-free interleavers have been recently shown to be suitable for
parallel decoding of turbo codes. In this correspondence, it is shown that
permutation polynomials generate maximum contention-free interleavers, i.e.,
every factor of the interleaver length becomes a possible degree of parallel
processing of the decoder. Further, it is shown by computer simulations that
turbo codes using these interleavers perform very well for the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) standard.
