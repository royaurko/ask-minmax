We present simulation results of $\gamma$ + Jet analysis using CMS (Compact
Muon Solenoid) Object-Oriented software at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV. The study of direct photon production
helps in validating the perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) and
providing information on the gluon distribution in the nucleons. Direct photon
processes also constitute a major background to several other Standard Model
(SM) processes and signals of new physics. Thus these processes need to be
understood precisely in the new energy regime. In this work, we have done a
detailed study of the GEANT4 simulated $\gamma$ + jet events generated with
Pythia, and the related background processes. Isolation cuts have been
optimized for direct photon which improves the signal over background ratio by
$\sim25%$ as compared to previous studies done in CMS. The inclusion of a large
$\Delta\phi$ cut between the photon and the leading jet at $40^0$ in the
analysis leads to a further increase of $\sim15%$ in S/B, thus giving an
overall gain of $\sim42%$ in S/B ratio.
