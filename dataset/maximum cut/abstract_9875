In this paper we address the regularity issues of the drift-diffusion
equation with nonlocal diffusion, where the diffusion operator is in the realm
of stable-type L\'evy operator and the velocity field is defined from the
considered quantity by some zero-order pseudo-differential operators. Through
using the method of nonlocal maximum principle in a unified way, we prove the
global well-posedness result in the slightly supercritical case, and show the
eventual regularity result in the supercritical type cases. The time after
which the solution is smoothly regular in the supercritical type cases can be
evaluated appropriately, so that we can recover a type of global result
recently obtained by \cite{CzV}.
