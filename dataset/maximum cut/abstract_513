In this paper we explore and develop a simple set of rules that apply to
cutting, pasting, and folding honeycomb lattices. We consider origami-like
structures that are extinsically flat away from zero-dimensional sources of
Gaussian curvature and one-dimensional sources of mean curvature, and our
cutting and pasting rules maintain the intrinsic bond lengths on both the
lattice and its dual lattice. We find that a small set of rules is allowed
providing a framework for exploring and building kirigami -- folding, cutting,
and pasting the edges of paper.
