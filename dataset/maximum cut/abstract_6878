By introducing a weight function to the Laplace operator, Bakry and \'Emery
defined the "drift Laplacian" to study diffusion processes. Our first main
result is that, given a Bakry-\'Emery manifold, there is a naturally associated
family of graphs whose eigenvalues converge to the eigenvalues of the drift
Laplacian as the graphs collapse to the manifold. Applications of this result
include a new relationship between Dirichlet eigenvalues of domains in $\R^n$
and Neumann eigenvalues of domains in $\R^{n+1}$ and a new maximum principle.
Using our main result and maximum principle, we are able to generalize
\emph{all the results in Riemannian geometry based on gradient estimates to
Bakry-\'Emery manifolds}.
