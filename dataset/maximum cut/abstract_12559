The Lyapunov spectrum describes the exponential growth, or decay, of
infinitesimal phase-space perturbations. The perturbation associated with the
maximum Lyapunov exponent is strongly localized in space, and only a small
fraction of all particles contributes to the perturbation growth at any instant
of time. This fraction converges to zero in the thermodynamic
large-particle-number limit. For hard-disk and hard-sphere systems the
perturbations belonging to the small positive and large negative exponents are
coherently spread out and form orthogonal periodic structures in space, the
``Lyapunov modes''. There are two types of mode polarizations, transverse and
longitudinal. The transverse modes do not propagate, but the longitudinal modes
do with a speed about one third of the sound speed. We characterize the
symmetry and the degeneracy of the modes. In the thermodynamic limit the
Lyapunov spectrum has a diverging slope near the intersection with the
abscissa. No positive lower bound exists for the positive exponents. The mode
amplitude scales with the inverse square root of the particle number as
expected from the normalization of the perturbation vectors.
