We report superconductivity, physical and structural properties of
Ir1-xRhxTe2 (0<=x<=0.3). Superconducting transition with maximum Tc~2.6 K
appears when the doping content of Rh x is in between 0.15 and 0.3. Further
increasing the content of Rh will suppress the superconductivity. On the other
hand, the high-temperature structural transition is suppressed gradually as Rh
is incorporated into the lattice, eventually vanishing at x=0.2. These results
imply competing relationship between structural transition and
superconductivity. The isovalent ionic substitution of Rh into Ir has different
effects on physical properties when compared to the isovalent anionic
substitution of Se into Te, in which the structural transition is enhanced with
Se substitution. It indicates the changes of structural parameters such as
ionic size and electronegativity of elements will also have important effects
on the evolution of physical properties in IrTe2.
