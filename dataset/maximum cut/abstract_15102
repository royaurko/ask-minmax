In the present paper we investigate self-consistently slowly rotating neutron
and strange stars in R-squared gravity. For this purpose we first derive the
equations describing the structure of the slowly rotating compact stars in
$f(R)$-gravity and then simultaneously solve the exterior and the interior
problem. The structure of the slowly rotating neutron stars is studied for two
different hadronic equations of state and a strange matter equation of state.
The moment of inertia and its dependence on the stellar mass and the
$R$-squared gravity parameter $a$ is also examined in details. We find that the
neutron star moment of inertia for large values of the parameter $a$ can be up
to $30\%$ larger compared to the corresponding general relativistic models.
This is much higher than the change in the maximum mass induced by $R$-squared
gravity and is beyond the EOS uncertainty. In this way the future observations
of the moment of inertia of compact stars could allow us to distinguish between
general relativity and $f(R)$ gravity, and more generally to test the strong
field regime of gravity.
