We provide a general method to analyze the asymptotic properties of a variety
of estimators of continuous time diffusion processes when the data are not only
discretely sampled in time but the time separating successive observations may
possibly be random. We introduce a new operator, the generalized infinitesimal
generator, to obtain Taylor expansions of the asymptotic moments of the
estimators. As a special case, our results apply to the situation where the
data are discretely sampled at a fixed nonrandom time interval. We include as
specific examples estimators based on maximum-likelihood and discrete
approximations such as the Euler scheme.
