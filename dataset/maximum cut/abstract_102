A cut system has objects, $1$-morphisms and $2$-morphisms, similar to a
bicategory. In contrast to the composition of $1$-morphisms in a bicategory,
the cut operation on $1$-morphims in a cut system produces representations of
Clifford algebras in supercategories rather than bare objects. The motivating
example of a cut system refines the bicategory of Landau-Ginzburg models, in
which the objects are hypersurface singularities and the $1$-morphisms are
matrix factorisations.
