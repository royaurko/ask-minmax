For a principal type pseudodifferential operator, we prove that condition
(psi) implies local solvability with a loss of 3/2 derivatives. We use many
elements of Dencker's paper on the proof of the Nirenberg-Treves conjecture and
we provide some improvements of the key energy estimates which allows us to cut
the loss of derivatives from 2 (Dencker's result) to 3/2 (the present paper).
It is already known that condition (psi) does not imply local solvability with
a loss of 1 derivative, so we have to content ourselves with a loss >1.
