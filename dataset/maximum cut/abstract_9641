The transition from a non-equilibrium state to an equilibrium state is
characterized not only by the disappearance of the entropy production, but
mainly by the disappearance of the organized currents, due to the gradients
present in a non-equilibrium system. Their disappearance is necessary to obtain
maximum entropy in the equilibrium state.
