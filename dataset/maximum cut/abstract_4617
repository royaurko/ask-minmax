Long-lived localized field configurations such as breathers, oscillons, or
more complex objects naturally arise in the context of a wide range of
nonlinear models in different numbers of spatial dimensions. We present a
numerical method, which we call the {\it adiabatic damping method}, designed to
study such configurations in small lattices. Using 3-dimensional oscillons in
$\phi^4$ models as an example, we show that the method accurately (to a part in
10^5 or better) reproduces results obtained with static or dynamically
expanding lattices, dramatically cutting down in integration time. We further
present new results for 2-dimensional oscillons, whose lifetimes would be
prohibitively long to study with conventional methods.
