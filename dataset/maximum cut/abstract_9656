In this fluid dynamics video we show capillary rise experiments with diethyl
ether in short tubes. The height of each short tube is less than the maximum
height the liquid can achieve, and therefore the liquid reaches the top of the
tube while still rising. Over a narrow range of heights, the ether bulges out
from the top of the tube and spreads onto the external wall.
