In this paper we consider the sequence of Kakutani's $\alpha$-refinements
corresponding to the inverse of golden ratio (which we call Kakutani-Fibonacci
sequence of partitions) and associate to it an ergodic interval exchange (which
we call Kakutani-Fibonacci transformation) using the "cutting-stacking"
technique. We prove that the orbit of the origin under this map coincides with
a low discrepancy sequence (which we call Kakutani-Fibonacci sequence of
points), which has been also considered by other contributors.
