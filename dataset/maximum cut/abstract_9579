We present analytical results for the time-dependent information entropy in
exactly solvable two-state (qubit) models. The first model describes dephasing
(decoherence) in a qubit coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators. The entropy
production for this model in the regimes of "complete" and "incomplete"
decoherence is discussed. As another example, we consider the damped
Jaynes-Cummings model describing a spontaneous decay of a two-level system into
the field vacuum. It is shown that, for all strengths of coupling, the open
system passes through the mixed state with the maximum information entropy.
