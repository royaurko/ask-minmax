We investigate the tuning behavior of a novel type of single-frequency
optical synthesizers by phase comparison of the output signals of two identical
devices. We achieve phase-stable and cycle slip free frequency tuning over 28.1
GHz with a maximum zero-to-peak phase deviation of 62 mrad. In contrast to
previous implementations of single-frequency optical synthesizers, no comb line
order switching is needed when tuned over more than one comb line spacing range
of the employed frequency comb.
