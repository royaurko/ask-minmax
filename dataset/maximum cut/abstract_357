We consider the thermodynamics of minimally coupled massive scalar field in
3+1 dimensional constant curvature black hole background. The brick wall model
of 't Hooft is used. When Scharzschild like coordinates are used it is found
that apart from the usual radial brick wall cut-off parammeter an angular
cut-off parameter is required to regularize the solution. Free energy of the
scalar field is obtained through counting of states using the WKB
approximation. It is found that the free energy and the entropy are
logarithmically divergent in both the cut-off parameters.
