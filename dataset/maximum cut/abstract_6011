Consider a symmetric aperiodic random walk in $Z^d$, $d\geq 3$. There are
points (called heavy points) where the number of visits by the random walk is
close to its maximum. We investigate the local times around these heavy points
and show that they converge to a deterministic limit as the number of steps
tends to infinity.
