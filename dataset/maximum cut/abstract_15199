We present a spherically symmetric solution of the general relativistic field
equations in isotropic coordinates for anisotropic neutral fluid, compatible
with a super dense star modeling by considering a specific choice of anisotropy
factor that includes a positive constant defined as anisotropy parameter, which
varies the relation between the radial and tangential pressure. Further, we
have constructed a super-dense star model with all degree of suitability. We
have found that the maximum mass decreases with the increase of anisotropy
parameter. The robustness of our result is that it matches with the recent
discoveries.
