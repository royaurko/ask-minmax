The flat rotation curve obtained for the outer star clusters of the Large
Magellanic Cloud is suggestive of an LMC dark matter halo. From the composite
HI and star cluster rotation curve, I estimate the parameters of an isothermal
dark matter halo added to a `maximum disk.' I then examine the possibility of
detecting high energy gamma-rays from non-baryonic dark matter annihilations in
the central region of the Large Magellanic Cloud.
