The magnetic relaxation has been investigated in type II superconductors when
the initial magnetic state is realized with entrapped and shielded flux (ESF)
contemporarily. This flux state is produced by an inversion in the magnetic
field ramp rate due to for example a magnetic field overshoot. The
investigation has been faced both numerically and by measuring the magnetic
relaxation in BSCCO tapes. Numerical computations have been performed in the
case of an infinite thick strip and of an infinite slab, showing a quickly
relaxing magnetization in the first seconds. As verified experimentally, the
effects of the overshoot cannot be neglected simply by cutting the first 10-100
seconds in the magnetic relaxation. On the other hand, at very long times, the
magnetic states relax toward those corresponding to field profiles with only
shielded flux or only entrapped flux, depending on the amplitude of the field
change with respect to the full penetration field of the considered
superconducting samples. In addition, we have performed numerical simulations
in order to reproduce the relaxation curves measured on the BSCCO(2223) tapes;
this allowed us to interpret correctly also the first seconds of the $M(t)$
curves.
