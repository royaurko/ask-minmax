In this paper, we are concerned with possibly degenerate stochastic partial
differential equations (SPDEs). An $L^2$-theory is introduced, from which we
derive the H\"ormander theorem with an analytical approach. With the method of
De Giorgi iteration, we obtain the maximum principle which states the $L^p$
($p\geq 2$) estimates for the time-space uniform norm of weak solutions.
