We present the latest and final version of the movie of the SiO masers toward
the Mira variable TX Cam. The new version consists of 112 frames (78
successfully reduced epochs) with data covering almost three complete stellar
cycles between 24 May 1997 to 25 January 2002, observed with the VLBA. In this
paper we examine the global morphology, kinematics and variability of the
masering zone. The morphology of the emission is confined in a structure that
usually resembles a ring or an ellipse, with occasional deviations due to
localised phenomena. The ring appears to be contracting and expanding, although
for the first cycle contraction is not observed. The width and outer boundary
of the masering zone follow the stellar pulsation. Our data seem to be
consistent with a shock being created once per stellar cycle at maximum that
propagates with a velocity of ~7 km/s. The difference in velocities along
different axes strongly suggests that the outflow in TX Cam is bipolar. The
contribution of projection is examined and our results are compared with the
latest theoretical model.
