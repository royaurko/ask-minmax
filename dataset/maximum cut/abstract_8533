We show that the electrical impedance of a small-capacitance Josephson
junction includes besides the capacitive term $-i/\omega C_B$ also an inductive
term $i\omega L_B$. Similar to the known Bloch capacitance $C_B(q)$, the Bloch
inductance $L_B(q)$ also depends periodically on the quasicharge $q$, and its
maximum value achieved at $q=e (\textrm{mod} 2e)$ always exceeds the value of
the Josephson inductance of this junction $L_J(\phi)$ at fixed $\phi=0$. The
effect of the Bloch inductance on the dynamics of a single junction and a
one-dimensional array is described.
