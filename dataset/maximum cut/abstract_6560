A possible relationship between sunspot number and total annual precipitation
from the Izana Observatory has been found. The annual precipitation period
ranges from 1916 to 1998, thus including nearly eight 11-year solar cycles.
  When points of total precipitation for a given year at Izana are plotted on
the ordinate axis versus the yearly sunspot number on the abcisa axis three
years back from the precipitation one, nearly all of them lie in the lower left
hand corner of the diagram. This seems to indicate a relationship between the
above mentioned variables.
  If this relationship is confirmed it would permit the prediction of a maximum
annual precipitation at Izana three years in advance.
