The MINOS experiment took data for seven years between May 2005 and April
2012. Since then it has been reborn as the new MINOS+ experiment in the
upgraded medium energy NuMI beam and started taking data in September 2013. An
update to the MINOS standard oscillations three-flavour disappearance analysis
is presented which includes 28% more atmospheric neutrino data. This combined
three-flavour analysis calculates an atmospheric parameter best-fit point of
$\Delta m_{32}^{2}=2.37^{+0.11}_{-0.07} \times 10^{-3}$~eV$^{2}$ and
$\sin^{2}\theta_{23}=0.43^{+0.19}_{-0.05}$ for the inverted hierarchy, for
which the MINOS fit shows a slight preference. A first look at the new MINOS+
beam data is presented. The new data is consistent with the combined
three-flavour analysis. Finally, new MINOS results for the search for sterile
neutrinos using neutrino disappearance are shown which cut out a significant
amount of the allowed phase space for a sterile neutrino to exist.
