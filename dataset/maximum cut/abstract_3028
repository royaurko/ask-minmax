Using the most recent realistic effective interactions for nuclear matter
with a smooth extrapolation to high densities including causality, we constrain
the equation of state and calculate maximum masses of rotating neutron stars.
First and second order phase transitions to, e.g., quark matter at high
densities are included. If neutron star masses of $\sim 2.3M_\odot$ from
quasi-periodic oscillations in low mass X-ray binaries are confirmed, a soft
equation of state as well as strong phase transitions can be excluded in
neutron star cores.
