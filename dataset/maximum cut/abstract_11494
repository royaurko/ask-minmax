The distance dependence of interstellar extinction in the direction of the
Aquila Rift is investigated using 473 stars observed in the Vilnius photometric
system. Front edge of the dark clouds in the area is found to be at 225$\pm$55
pc and the thickness of the cloud system can be about 80 pc. The maximum
extinction A_V in the clouds is close to 3.0 mag. Two stars with larger
extinction are found and discussed. Since the new distance of the clouds is
larger than the previously accepted distance, the cloud system mass should be
increased up to 2.7 10^5 M_sun which is close to the virial mass estimated from
the CO velocity dispersion. Additional arguments are given in favor of the
genetic relation between the Serpens and the Scorpio-Ophiuchus dark clouds.
