We demonstrate very high resolution photon spectroscopy with a
microwave-multiplexed two-pixel transition-edge sensor (TES) array. We measured
a $^{153}$Gd photon source and achieved an energy resolution of 63 eV
full-width-at-half-maximum at 97 keV and an equivalent readout system noise of
86 pA/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at the TES. The readout circuit consists of
superconducting microwave resonators coupled to radio-frequency
superconducting-quantum-interference-devices (SQUID) and transduces changes in
input current to changes in phase of a microwave signal. We use flux-ramp
modulation to linearize the response and evade low-frequency noise. This
demonstration establishes one path for the readout of cryogenic X-ray and
gamma-ray sensor arrays with more than $10^3$ elements and spectral resolving
powers $R=\lambda/\Delta\lambda > 10^3$.
