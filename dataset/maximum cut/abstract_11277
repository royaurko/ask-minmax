We demonstrate that for several of the gravitational lens models used to
describe galaxies, there exists a quantity we dub the magnification invariant,
equaling the sum of the signed magnifications of the images, that is a constant
when the image multiplicity is a maximum. This invariant is independent of most
of the model parameters, and is independent of the source position as long as
the source lies inside the caustic. It is not necessary to solve the lens
equations to compute this invariant. For quad lenses, it is usually easy to
assign image parities and thus one can compute the sum of the signed fluxes,
compare with the magnification invariant of different models, and infer the
model magnification factors of the images without fitting. We evaluate the
invariant for simple galaxy models, apply it to known cases of quadruple
lenses, and discuss implications for the ability of these lens models to
reproduce observed image brightnesses.
