We develop a method for investigating the relationship between the shape of a
1-particle distribution and non-linear electrostatic oscillations in a
collisionless plasma, incorporating transverse thermal motion. A general
expression is found for the maximum sustainable electric field, and is
evaluated for a particular highly anisotropic distribution.
