We review some recent results for a class of fluid mechanics equations called
active scalars, with fractional dissipation. Our main examples are the surface
quasi-geostrophic equation, the Burgers equation, and the
Cordoba-Cordoba-Fontelos model. We discuss nonlocal maximum principle methods
which allow to prove existence of global regular solutions for the critical
dissipation. We also recall what is known about the possibility of finite time
blow up in the supercritical regime.
