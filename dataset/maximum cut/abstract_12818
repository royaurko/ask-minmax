We suggest to use `fluctuation spectroscopy' as a method to detect
granularity in a disordered metal close to a superconducting transition. We
show that with lowering temperature $T$ the resistance $R(T)$ of a system of
relatively large grains initially grows due to the fluctuation suppression of
the one-electron tunneling but decreases with further lowering $T$ due to the
coherent charge transfer of the fluctuation Cooper pairs. Under certain
conditions, such a maximum in $R(T)$ turns out to be sensitive to weak magnetic
fields due to a novel Maki -- Thompson type mechanism.
