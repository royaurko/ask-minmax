Cosmologies including continuous matter creation are able to reproduce the
main properties of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, in particular in cases
where the particle and entropy production rates are equal. These specific
models, characterized by a mass density equal to the critical value, behave
like the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at early times whereas their late
evolution is similar to the steady-state cosmology. The maximum amplitude of
density fluctuations in these models depends on the adopted creation rate,
related here to the parameter $\Omega_v$ and this limitation could be a
difficulty for the formation of galaxies and large-scale structure in this
class of universe. Additional problems are related with predictions either of
the random peculiar velocities of galaxies or the present density of massive
clusters of galaxies, both being largely overestimated with respect to
observational data.
