In the presence of a minimal uncertainty in length, there exists a critical
temperature above which the thermodynamics of a gas of radiation changes
drastically.
  We find that the equilibrium temperature of a system composed of a
Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by radiation is unaffected by these
modifications. This is in agreement with works related to the robustness of the
Hawking evaporation. The only change the deformation introduces concerns the
critical volume at which the system ceases to be stable.
  On the contrary, the evolution of the very early universe is sensitive to the
new behavior. We readdress the shortcomings of the standard big bang
model(flatness, entropy and horizon problems) in this context, assuming a
minimal coupling to general relativity. Although they are not solved, some
qualitative differences set in.
