A detailed analysis is performed for the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model coupled
with constant (external) magnetic and/or electric fields in two, three, and
four dimensions. The infrared cut-off is essential for a well-defined
functional determinant by means of the proper time method. Contrary to the
previous observation, the critical coupling remains nonzero even in three
dimensions. It is also found that the asymptotic expansion has an excellent
matching with the exact value.
