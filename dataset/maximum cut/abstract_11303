The shield of the INTEGRAL spectrometer provides a large detection area with
a wide field-of-view. Calculations have been performed to check whether the
temporal analysis of the counting rate of the SPI anticoincidence allows the
detection of explosions of novae. The background rate of the shield as well as
its response to gamma-ray have been modelled with monte-carlo simulations.
Accounting for uncertainties in the rate of novae, their distribution in the
Galaxy and their light curves in hard X-ray domain, the number of nova
explosions detectable with this method during the INTEGRAL mission, is
estimated. Such observationnal mode will allow to improve our knowledge on
nuclear runaway in novae. Since the maximum of magnitude in the visible happens
later than in gamma-ray, SPI will provide alert for optical observations.
