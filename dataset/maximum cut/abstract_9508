We exhibit compelling evidence regarding how well does the MaxEnt principle
describe the rank-distribution of city-populations via an exhaustive study of
the 50 Spanish provinces (more than 8000 cities) in a time-window of 15 years
(1996-2010). We show that the dynamics that governs the population-growth is
the deciding factor that originates the observed distributions. The connection
between dynamics and distributions is unravelled via MaxEnt.
