This thesis is focused on the development of new mathematical methods for
computing multi-loop scattering amplitudes in gauge theories. In this work we
combine, for the first time, the unitarity-based construction for integrands,
and the recently introduced integrand-reduction through multivariate polynomial
division. After discussing the generic features of this novel reduction
algorithm, we will apply it to the one- and two-loop five-point amplitudes in
${\cal N}=4$ sYM. The integrands of the multiple-cuts are generated from
products of tree-level amplitudes within the super-amplitudes formalism. The
corresponding expressions will be used for the analytic reconstruction of the
polynomial residues. Their parametric form is known a priori, as derived by
means of successive polynomial divisions using the Gr\"obner basis associated
to the on-shell denominators. The integrand reduction method will be exploited
to investigate the color-kinematic duality for multi-loop ${\cal N}=4$ sYM
scattering amplitudes. Our analysis yields a suggestive, systematic way to
generate graphs which automatically satisfy the color-kinematic dualities.
Finally, we will extract the leading ultra-violet divergences of five-point
one- and two-loop amplitudes in ${\cal N}=4$ sYM, which represent a
paradigmatic example for studying the UV behavior of supersymmetric amplitudes.
