We study theoretically a bistable systems with time-delayed feedback driven
by weak periodic force. The effective potential function and the steady-state
probability density are derived. The delay time and the strength of its
feedback can change the shapes of the potential wells. In the adiabatic
approximation, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the system with a weak
periodic force is obtained. The time-delayed feedback modulates the magnitude
of SNR by changing the shape of the potential and the effective strength of
signal. The maximum of SNR decreases with increasing the feedback intensity
$\epsilon$. When $\epsilon$ is negative (or positive), the time delay can
suppress (or promote) the stochastic resonance phenomenon.
