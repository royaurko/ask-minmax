We give the distribution function of $M_n$, the maximum of a sequence of $n$
observations from an autoregressive process of order 2. Solutions are first
given in terms of repeated integrals and then for the case, where the
underlying random variables are absolutely continuous. When the correlations
are positive, P(M_n \leq x) =a_{n,x}, where a_{n,x}= \sum_{j=1}^\infty
\beta_{jx} \nu_{jx}^{n} = O (\nu_{1x}^{n}), where $\{\nu_{jx}\}$ are the
eigenvalues of a non-symmetric Fredholm kernel, and $\nu_{1x}$ is the
eigenvalue of maximum magnitude. The weights $\beta_{jx}$ depend on the $j$th
left and right eigenfunctions of the kernel.
  These results are large deviations expansions for estimates, since the
maximum need not be standardized to have a limit. In fact such a limit need not
exist.
