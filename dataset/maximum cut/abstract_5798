In this article I will review the theory behind the gravitational wave driven
r-mode instability in rapidly rotating neutron stars and discuss which
constraints can be derived from observations of spins and temperatures in Low
Mass X-ray Binaries. I will discuss how a standard, `minimal' neutron star
model is not consistent with the data, and discuss some of the additional
physical mechanisms that could reconcile theory with observations. In
particular I will focus on additional forms of damping due to exotic cores and
on strong mutual friction due to superfluid vortices cutting through
superconducting flux tubes, and examine the repercussions these effects could
have on the saturation amplitude of the mode. Finally I will also discuss the
possibility that oscillations due to r-modes may have been recently observed in
the X-ray light curves of two Low Mass X-ray Binaries.
