We show that every graph of maximum degree 3 can be represented as the
intersection graph of axis parallel boxes in three dimensions, that is, every
vertex can be mapped to an axis parallel box such that two boxes intersect if
and only if their corresponding vertices are adjacent. In fact, we construct a
representation in which any two intersecting boxes just touch at their
boundaries. Further, this construction can be realized in linear time.
