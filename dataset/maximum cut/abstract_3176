This paper proposes a novel maximum Doppler spread estimation algorithm for
OFDM systems with the comb-type pilot pattern. By tracking the drifting delay
subspace of the multipath channel, the time correlation function is measured at
a high accuracy, which accordingly improves the estimation accuracy of the
maximum Doppler spread considerably.
