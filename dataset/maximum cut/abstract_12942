The Belle Collaboration recently discovered the first manifestly exotic
meson: Z^+(4430), which decays into psi' pi^+ and therefore has quark content c
c-bar u d-bar. The proximity of its mass to the D_1 D-bar^* threshold has
motivated the interpretation of the Z^+ as a charm meson molecule whose
constituents are an S-wave superposition of D_1^+ D-bar^{*0}$ and D^{*+}
D-bar_1^0$. If this interpretation is correct, the small ratio of the binding
energy of the Z^+ to the width Gamma_1 of its constituent D_1 can be exploited
to predict properties of its line shapes. Its full width at half maximum in the
channel psi' pi^+ should be approximately sqrt{3} Gamma_1 = 35 MeV, which is
consistent with the measured width of the Z^+. The Z^+ should also decay into
D^* D-bar^* pi through decay of its constituent D_1. The peak in the line shape
for D^* D-bar^* pi should be at a higher energy than the peak in the line shape
for psi' pi^+ by about Gamma_1/sqrt{12} = 6 MeV. The line shape in D^* D-bar^*
pi should also be broader and asymmetric, with a shoulder on the high energy
side that can be attributed to a threshold enhancement in the production of D_1
D-bar^*.
