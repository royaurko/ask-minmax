The concepts of weighted reciprocal of temperature and weighted thermal flux
are proposed for a heat engine operating between two heat baths and outputting
mechanical work. With the aid of these two concepts, the generalized
thermodynamic fluxes and forces can be expressed in a consistent way within the
framework of irreversible thermodynamics. Then the efficiency at maximum power
output for a heat engine, one of key topics in finite-time thermodynamics, is
investigated on the basis of a generic model under the tight-coupling
condition. The corresponding results have the same forms as those of
low-dissipation heat engines [M. Esposito, R. Kawai, K. Lindenberg, and C. Van
den Broeck, {Phys. Rev. Lett.} \textbf{105}, 150603 (2010)]. The mappings from
two kinds of typical heat engines, such as the low-dissipation heat engine and
the Feynman ratchet, into the present generic model are constructed. The
universal efficiency at maximum power output up to the quadratic order is found
to be valid for a heat engine coupled symmetrically and tightly with two baths.
The concepts of weighted reciprocal of temperature and weighted thermal flux
are also transplanted to the optimization of refrigerators.
