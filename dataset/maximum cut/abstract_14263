The L^1-critical parabolic-elliptic Patlak-Keller-Segel system is a classical
model of chemotactic aggregation in micro-organisms well-known to have critical
mass phenomena. In this paper we study this critical mass phenomenon in the
context of Patlak-Keller-Segel models with spatially varying diffusivity and
decay rate of the chemo-attractant. The primary tool for the proof of global
existence below the critical mass is the use of pseudo-differential operators
to precisely evaluate the leading order quadratic portion of the potential
energy (interaction energy). Under the assumption of radial symmetry, blow-up
is proved above critical mass using a maximum-principle type argument based on
comparing the mass distribution of solutions to a barrier consisting of the
unique stationary solutions of the scale-invariant PKS. Although effective
where standard Virial methods do not apply, this method seems to be dependent
on the assumption of radial symmetry. For technical reasons we work in
dimensions three and higher where L^1-critical variants of the PKS have porous
media-type nonlinear diffusion on the organism density, resulting in finite
speed of propagation and simplified functional inequalities.
