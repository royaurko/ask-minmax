All p-mode parameters vary with time as a response to the changes induced by
the cyclic behavior of solar magnetic activity. After the unusual long
solar-activity minimum between cycles 23 and 24, where the p-mode parameters
have shown a different behavior than the surface magnetic proxies, we analyze
the temporal variation of low-degree p-mode parameters measured by GOLF (in
velocity) and VIRGO (in intensity) Sun-as-a-star instruments on board SoHO. We
then compared our results with other activity proxies.
