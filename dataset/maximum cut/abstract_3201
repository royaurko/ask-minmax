We have synthesized polycrystalline samples of Pt-substituted SrFe2As2 and
measured the temperature dependence of magnetization and electrical
resistivity. We have observed the superconducting transition at Tc = 17 K with
the maximum shielding volume fraction at x = 0.125 in Sr(Fe1-xPtx)2As2. It is
found that the maximum Tc depends on the substituted element, so it is
important to substitute various elements to explore new iron-based
superconductors with higher Tc.
