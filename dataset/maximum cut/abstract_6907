Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study graphene-based
torsional mechanical resonators. The quality factor is calculated by
$Q_{F}=\omega\tau/2\pi$, where the frequency $\omega$ and life time $\tau$ are
obtained from the correlation function of the normal mode coordinate. Our
simulations reveal the radius-dependence of the quality factor as
$Q_{F}=2628/(22R^{-1}+0.004R^{2})$, which yields a maximum value at some proper
radius $R$. This maximum point is due to the strong boundary effect in the
torsional resonator, as disclosed by the temperature distribution in the
resonator. Resulting from the same boundary effect, the quality factor shows a
power law temperature-dependence with power factors bellow 1.0. The theoretical
results supply some valuable information for the manipulation of the quality
factor in future experimental devices based on the torsional mechanical
resonator.
