The maximum magnetic field available to guide and focus the proton beams will
be the most important factor driving the design of the High Energy LHC. The US
LHC Accelerator Research Program (LARP) is a collaboration of US National
Laboratories aiming at demonstrating the feasibility of Nb3Sn magnet technology
for application to future colliders. While LARP is primarily focused on the
requirements of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), it is also directly relevant
to the High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC). Program results and future directions will be
discussed.
