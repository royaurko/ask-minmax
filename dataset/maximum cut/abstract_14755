The influence of film morphology induced carrier diffusion on the broadening
of the time-of-flight transient photo-current pulse was investigated using
Monte Carlo simulation in organic thin films. Assuming the Gaussian Disorder
Model for the charge transport the simulation of the time-of-flight
photo-current pulse shape was carried out for homogeneous and inhomogeneous
films by varying the overall energetic disorder of the system. In the case of
homogeneous system, the value of the tail broadening parameter (W) of the
photocurrent pulse is found to decrease upon decreasing the energetic disorder.
The observed behavior is explained by using the temporal evolution of carrier
diffusion coefficient. In case of the inhomogeneous system, upon decreasing the
overall energetic disorder of the system the value of W initially attained a
maximum before it started to decrease. This is attributed to the morphology
dependent carrier diffusion in the latter case. This study elicits the
importance of the influence of the film morphology induced carrier diffusion on
the experimentally measured shape of the time-of-flight transient photo-current
pulses, which is found to be generally ignored.
