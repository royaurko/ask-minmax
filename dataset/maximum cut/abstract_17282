We investigate the early phase of the 13 February 2009 coronal mass ejection
(CME). Observations with the twin STEREO spacecraft in quadrature allow us to
compare for the first time in one and the same event the temporal evolution of
coronal EUV dimmings, observed simultaneously on-disk and above the limb. We
find that these dimmings are synchronized and appear during the impulsive
acceleration phase of the CME, with the highest EUV intensity drop occurring a
few minutes after the maximum CME acceleration. During the propagation phase
two confined, bipolar dimming regions, appearing near the footpoints of a
pre-flare sigmoid structure, show an apparent migration away from the site of
the CME-associated flare. Additionally, they rotate around the 'center' of the
flare site, i.e., the configuration of the dimmings exhibits the same
'sheared-to-potential' evolution as the postflare loops. We conclude that the
motion pattern of the twin dimmings reflects not only the eruption of the flux
rope, but also the ensuing stretching of the overlying arcade. Finally, we find
that: (1) the global-scale dimmings, expanding from the source region of the
eruption, propagate with a speed similar to that of the leaving CME front; (2)
the mass loss occurs mainly during the period of strongest CME acceleration.
Two hours after the eruption Hinode/EIS observations show no substantial plasma
outflow, originating from the 'open' field twin dimming regions.
