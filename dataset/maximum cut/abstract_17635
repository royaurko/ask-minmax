Purpose. This study was conducted to determine the thickness map of eleven
retinal layers in normal subjects by spectral domain optical coherence
tomography (SD-OCT) and evaluate their association with sex and age. Methods.
Mean regional retinal thickness of 11 retinal layers were obtained by automatic
three-dimensional diffusion-map-based method in 112 normal eyes of 76 Iranian
subjects. Results. The thickness map of central foveal area in layer 1, 3, and
4 displayed the minimum thickness (P<0.005 for all). Maximum thickness was
observed in nasal to the fovea of layer 1 (P<0.001) and in a circular pattern
in the parafoveal retinal area of layers 2, 3 and 4 and in central foveal area
of layer 6 (P<0.001). Temporal and inferior quadrants of the total retinal
thickness and most of other quadrants of layer 1 were significantly greater in
the men than in the women. Surrounding eight sectors of total retinal thickness
and a limited number of sectors in layer 1 and 4 significantly correlated with
age. Conclusion. SD-OCT demonstrated the three-dimensional thickness
distribution of retinal layers in normal eyes. Thickness of layers varied with
sex and age and in different sectors. These variables should be considered
while evaluating macular thickness.
