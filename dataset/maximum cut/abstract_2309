The maximal acceleration corrections to the Lamb shift of one--electron atoms
are calculated starting from the Dirac equation and splitting the spinor into
large and small components. The results depend on $Z^8$ and a cut-off
$\Lambda$. Sizeable values are obtained even at Z=1 for $\Lambda\sim a_0/2$,
where $a_0$ is the Bohr radius. These values are compatible with theoretical
and experimental results.
