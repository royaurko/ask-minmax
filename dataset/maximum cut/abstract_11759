We study $B_{1g}$ Raman intensity $R(\Omega)$ and the density of states
$N(\omega)$ in isotropic 2D d-wave superconductors. For an ideal gas,
$R(\Omega)$ and $N(\omega)$ have sharp peaks at $\Omega =2\Delta$ and $\omega
=\Delta$, respectively, where $\Delta$ is the maximum value of the gap.
  We study how the peak positions are affected by the fermionic damping due to
impurity scattering.
  We show that while the damping generally shifts the peak positions to larger
frequencies, the peak in $R(\Omega)$ still occurs at almost twice the peak
position in $N(\omega)$ and therefore cannot account for the experimentally
observed downturn shift of the peak frequency in $R(\Omega)$ in underdoped
cuprates compared to twice that in $N(\omega)$. We also discuss how the
fermionic damping affects the dynamical spin susceptibility.
