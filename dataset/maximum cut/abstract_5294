We develop a systematic approach to describe the finite lifetime effects in
the threshold production of top quark-antiquark pairs. It is based on the
nonrelativistic effective field theory with an additional scale rho^(1/2) m_t
characterizing the dynamics of the top-quark decay, which involves a new
expansion parameter rho=1-m_W/m_t. Our method naturally resolves the problem of
spurious divergences in the analysis of the unstable top production. Within
this framework we compute the next-to-leading nonresonant contribution to the
total cross section of the top quark-antiquark threshold production in
electron-positron annihilation through high-order expansion in rho and confirm
the recently obtained result. We extend the analysis to the
next-to-next-to-leading O(alpha_s) nonresonant contribution which is derived in
the leading order in rho. The dominant nonresonant contribution to the
top-antitop threshold production in hadronic collisions is also obtained.
