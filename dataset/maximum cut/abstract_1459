An experimental device in turning including, in particular, a six-component
dynamometer is exploited to measure the complete torque of cutting forces in a
case of self-excited vibrations. For the tests, the tool used is type TNMA 16
04 12 carbide not covered (nuance carbide-SUMITIMO ELECTRIC), without chip
breeze. The machined material is an alloy of chrome molybdenum type 42 CrMo24.
The test-tubes are cylindrical with a diameter of 120 mm and a length of 30 mm.
The effort of analysis relates to the moments. In particular, to the tool tip
point, when feed rate increases the friction coefficient of swivelling is
increasing while that of bearing is decreasing. Innovative remarks on the
evolution of the average friction coefficient for various depths of cut and
feed rate are presented
