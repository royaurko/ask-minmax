This paper extends previous work by the contributors. We consider the local time
process of a strong Markov process, add negative drift, and reflect it \`a la
Skorokhod. The resulting process is used to model a fluid queue. We derive an
expression for the joint law of the duration of an excursion, the maximum value
of the process on it, and the time distance between successive excursions. We
work with a properly constructed stationary version of the process. Examples
are also given in the paper.
