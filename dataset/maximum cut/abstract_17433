Many people are aware of the theory of elastic fracture originated by AA
Griffith, and although Griffith used the theorem of minimum potential energy
most people seem unaware of the broader implications of this theorem. If it is
set within its classical mechanics roots, it is clear that it is a restricted
form of a Lagrangian.
  In advanced texts on fracture cracks are treated as dynamic entities, and the
role of stress waves is clearly articulated. However, in most non-advanced
texts on fracture and fatigue the role of stress waves are either not included
or not emphasised, often leading to a possible misunderstanding of the
fundamentals of fracture.
  What is done here is to extend Griffiths approach by setting it within the
concept of Stationary Action, and introducing a quasi-static stress wave
unloading model, which connects the energy release mechanism with the stress
field. This leads to a definition of a dynamic stress intensity factor, and
this model is then applied to fatigue of perfectly elastic and elastic-plastic
materials to include crack tip plasticity.
  The results for the Griffiths crack and the dynamic case are retrodiction, to
establish the validity of the methods used. The extension to fatigue gives
significant new results, which show that for elastic-plastic materials the
influence of the maximum stress in the cycle as a fraction of the yield stress,
called the yield stress ratio, has not been recognised. The new form of the
fatigue crack growth relationship derived answers many of the long standing
questions about the Paris Law.
