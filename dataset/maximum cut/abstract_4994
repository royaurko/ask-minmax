In these proceedings, a measurement of two-particle correlations with a high
transverse momentum trigger particle (pT_trig > 2.5 GeV/c) is presented for
Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV over the uniquely broad longitudinal
acceptance of the PHOBOS detector (-4 < Delta-eta < 2). As in p+p collisions,
the near-side is characterized by a peak of correlated partners at small angle
relative to the trigger. However, in central Au+Au collisions an additional
correlation extended in Delta-eta and known as the 'ridge' is found to reach at
least |Delta-eta| = 4. The ridge yield is largely independent of Delta-eta over
the measured range, and it decreases towards more peripheral collisions. For
the chosen pT_trig cut of 2.5 GeV/c, the ridge yield is consistent with zero
for events with less than roughly 100 participating nucleons.
