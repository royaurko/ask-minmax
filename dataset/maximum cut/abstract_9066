We compute the penetration depth of a light quark moving through a large
$N_c$, strongly coupled $\mathcal N = 4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma using
gauge/gravity duality and a combination of analytic and numerical techniques.
We find that the maximum distance a quark with energy $E$ can travel through a
plasma is given by $\Delta x(E) = (\mathcal C/T) (E/T \sqrt\lambda)^{{1}/{3}}$
with $\mathcal C \approx 0.5$.
