We have studied kinetics of random sequential adsorption of mixtures on a
square lattice using Monte Carlo method. Mixtures of linear short segments and
long segments were deposited with the probability $p$ and $1-p$, respectively.
For fixed lengths of each segment in the mixture, the jamming limits decrease
when $p$ increases. The jamming limits of mixtures always are greater than
those of the pure short- or long-segment deposition.
 For fixed $p$ and fixed length of the short segments, the jamming limits have
a maximum when the length of the long segment increases. We conjectured a
kinetic equation for the jamming coverage based on the data fitting.
