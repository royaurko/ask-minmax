In this work, we report a strengthened superheating effect caused by a
buffering YBa2Cu3Oy (Y123 or YBCO) layer in the Nd1+xBa2-xCu3O7-y (Nd123 or
NdBCO) thin film with MgO substrate (i.e., NdBCO/YBCO/MgO thin film). In the
cold-seeding melt-textured (MT) growth, the NdBCO/YBCO/MgO film presented an
even higher superheating level, about 20 {\deg}C higher than that of
non-buffered NdBCO film (i.e., NdBCO/MgO film). Using this NdBCO/YBCO/MgO film
as seeds and undergoing a maximum processing temperature (Tmax) up to 1120
{\deg}C, we succeeded in growing various RE1+xBa2-xCu3O7-y (REBCO, RE=rare
elements) bulk superconductors, including Gd1+xBa2-xCu3O7-y (GdBCO),
Sm1+xBa2-xCu3O7-y (SmBCO) and NdBCO that have high peritectic temperatures
(Tp). The pole figure (X-Ray \phi-scan) measurement reveals that the
NdBCO/YBCO/MgO film has better in-plane alignment than the NdBCO/MgO film,
indicating that the induced intermediate layer improves the crystallinity of
the NdBCO film, which could be the main origin of the enhanced thermal
stability. In short, possessing higher thermal stability and enduring a higher
Tmax in the MT process, the NdBCO/YBCO/MgO film is beneficial to the growth of
bulk superconductors in two aspects: (1) broad application for high-Tp REBCO
materials; (2) effective suppression against heterogeneous nucleation, which is
of great assistance in growing large and high-performance REBCO crystals.
