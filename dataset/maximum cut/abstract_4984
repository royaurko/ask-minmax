We study the role of fermionic resonances in realistic composite Higgs
models. We consider the low energy effective description of a model in which
the Higgs arises as the pseudo-Goldstone boson of an SO(5)/SO(4) global
symmetry breaking pattern. Assuming that only fermionic resonances are present
below the cut-off of our effective theory, we perform a detailed analysis of
the electroweak constraints on such a model. This includes the exact one-loop
calculation of the T parameter and the anomalous Zbb coupling for arbitrary new
fermions and couplings. Other relevant observables, like b to s gamma and Delta
B=2 processes have also been examined. We find that, while minimal models are
difficult to make compatible with electroweak precision tests, models with
several fermionic resonances, such as the ones that appear in the spectrum of
viable composite Higgs models from warped extra dimensions, are fully realistic
in a large region of parameter space. These fermionic resonances could be the
first observable signature of the model at the LHC.
