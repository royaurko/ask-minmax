Composite likelihoods are a class of alternatives to the full likelihood
which are widely used in many situations in which the likelihood itself is
intractable. A composite likelihood may be computed without the need to specify
the full distribution of the response, which means that in some situations the
resulting estimator will be more robust to model misspecification than the
maximum likelihood estimator. The purpose of this note is to show that such
increased robustness is not guaranteed. An example is given in which various
marginal composite likelihood estimators are inconsistent under model
misspecification, even though the maximum likelihood estimator is consistent.
