We present a new technique for distinguishing the hadronic decays of boosted
heavy particles from QCD backgrounds based on wavelet transforms. As an initial
exploration, we illustrate the technique in the particular case of hadronic $W$
boson decays, comparing it to the ``mass drop'' cut currently used by the LHC
experiments. We apply wavelet cuts, which make use of complementary
information, and in combination with the mass drop cut results in an
improvement of $\sim$7% in discovery reach of hadronic $W$ boson final states
over a wide range of transverse momenta.
