We prove a differential Harnack inequality for the Endangered Species
Equation, a nonlinear parabolic equation. Our derivation relies on an idea
related to the parabolic maximum principle. As an application of this
inequality, we will show that positive solutions to this equation must blowup
in finite time. We also use this inequality to partially answer a question of
Hamilton, 2011.
