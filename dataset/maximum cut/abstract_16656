We consider the electromagnetic (EM) perturbative effects produced by the
high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) in the GHz band in a special EM
resonance system, which consists of fractal membranes, a Gaussian beam (GB)
passing through a static magnetic field. It is predicted, under the
synchroresonance condition, coherence modulation of the HFGWs to the
preexisting transverse components of the GB produces the transverse
perturbative photon flux (PPF),which has three novel and important properties:
(1)The PPF has maximum at a longitudinal symmetrical surface of the GB where
the transverse background photon flux (BPF) vanishes; (2) the resonant effect
will be high sensitive to the propagating directions of the HFGWs; (3) the PPF
reflected or transmitted by the fractal membrane exhibits a very small decay
compared with very large decay of the much stronger BPF. Such properties might
provide a new way to distinguish and display the perturbative effects produced
by the HFGWs. We also discuss the high-frequency asymptotic behavior of the
relic GWs in the microwave band and the positive definite issues of their
energy-momentum pseudo-tensor.
