In the context of topflavor seesaw model, we study the production of the
heavy charged gauge boson ${W_{H}}$ associated with a top quark at the LHC.
Focusing on the searching channel $pp\rightarrow tW_H\rightarrow t\bar{t}b
\rightarrow l\nu jjbbb$, we carry out a full simulation of the signal and the
relevant standard model backgrounds. The kinematical distributions of final
states are presented. It is found that the backgrounds can be significantly
suppressed by sets of kinematic cuts, and the signal of the heavy charged boson
might be detected at the LHC with $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV. With a integrated
luminosity of $\LL= $ 100 $fb^{-1}$, a $8.3 \sigma$ signal significance can be
achieved for $m_{W_H}=1.6$ TeV.
