A general type of nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation is derived directly from a
master equation, by introducing generalized transition rates. The H-theorem is
demonstrated for systems that follow those classes of nonlinear Fokker-Planck
equations, in the presence of an external potential. For that, a relation
involving terms of Fokker-Planck equations and general entropic forms is
proposed. It is shown that, at equilibrium, this relation is equivalent to the
maximum-entropy principle. Families of Fokker-Planck equations may be related
to a single type of entropy, and so, the correspondence between well-known
entropic forms and their associated Fokker-Planck equations is explored. It is
shown that the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, apart from its connection with the
standard -- linear Fokker-Planck equation -- may be also related to a family of
nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations.
