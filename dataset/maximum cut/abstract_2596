This PhD thesis is concerned with SDP bounds for codes: upper bounds for
(non)-binary error correcting codes and lower bounds for (non)-binary covering
codes. The methods are based on the method of Schrijver that uses triple
distances in stead of pairs as in the classical Delsarte bound.
  The main topics discussed are:
  1) Block-diagonalisation of matrix *-algebras,
  2) Terwilliger-algebra of the nonbinary Hamming scheme (including an explicit
block-diagonalisation),
  3) SDP-bounds for (nonbinary) error-correcting codes and covering codes
(including computational results),
  4) Discussion on the relation with matrix-cuts,
  5) Computational results for Affine caps.
