We study the tail behavior for the maximum of discrete Gaussian free field on
a 2D box with Dirichlet boundary condition after centering by its expectation.
We show that it exhibits an exponential decay for the right tail and a double
exponential decay for the left tail. In particular, our result implies that the
variance of the maximum is of order 1, improving an $o(\log n)$ bound by
Chatterjee (2008) and confirming a folklore conjecture. An important ingredient
for our proof is a result of Bramson and Zeitouni (2010), who proved the
tightness of the centered maximum together with an evaluation of the
expectation up to an additive constant.
