We present 14 N^0 measurements from our HIRES/Keck database of damped Lya
abundances. These data are combined with measurements from the recent and past
literature to build an homogeneous, uniform set of observations. We examine
photoionization diagnostics like Fe^++ and Ar^0 in the majority of the complete
sample and assess the impact of ionization corrections on N/alpha and alpha/H
values derived from observed ionic column densities of N^0, Si^+, H^0, and S^+.
Our final sample of 19 N/alpha, alpha/H pairs appears bimodal; the majority of
systems show N/alpha values consistent with metal-poor emission regions in the
local universe but a small sub-sample exhibit significantly lower N/alpha
ratios. Contrary to previous studies of N/alpha in the damped systems, our
sample shows little scatter within each sub-sample. We consider various
scenarios to explain the presence of the low N/alpha sightlines and account for
the apparent bimodality. We favor a model where at least some galaxies undergo
an initial burst of star formation with suppressed formation of
intermediate-mass stars. We found a power-law IMF with slope 0.10 or a mass cut
of ~5-8 Msolar would successfully reproduce the observed LN-DLA values. If the
bimodal distribution is confirmed by a larger sample of measurements, this may
present the first observational evidence for a top heavy initial mass function
in some early stellar populations.
