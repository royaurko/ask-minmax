The hadronic freeze-out line is calculated in terms of the net baryon density
and the energy density instead of the usual T and mu_B. This analysis makes it
apparent that the freeze-out density exhibits a maximum as the collision energy
is decreased. This maximum freeze-out density is well within the parameters of
the proposed NICA accelerator.
