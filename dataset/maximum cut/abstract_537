The renormalisation of NN scattering in theories with zero-range interactions
is examined using a cut-off regularisation where the cut-off is taken to
infinity, dimensional regularisation (DR) with minimal subtraction, and DR with
power-divergence subtraction. In the infinite cut-off limit power counting
breaks down: terms of different orders in the potential contribute to the
scattering amplitude at the same order. Minimal subtraction does yield a
systematic expansion, but with a very limited range of validity for systems
that have unnaturally large scattering lengths. For a finite cut-off, the
behaviour of the couplings as the cut-off is lowered shows that a theory with a
natural scattering length approaches an IR fixed point. In the corresponding
effective theory, loop corrections can be treated perturbatively. In contrast,
if there is an IR fixed point for systems with an infinite scattering length it
must be a nonperturbative one, with no power counting. For such systems,
power-divergence subtraction appears to yield a systematic expansion, but with
a different power counting from Weinberg's. However the scheme omits IR
divergent terms that would otherwise lead to nonperturbative behaviour and so
the interpretation of the fixed point remains unclear.
