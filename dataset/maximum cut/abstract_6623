Veraverbeke's (1977) theorem relates the tail of the distribution of the
supremum of a random walk with negative drift to the tail of the distribution
of its increments, or equivalently, the probability that a centered random walk
with heavy-tail increments hits a moving linear boundary. We study similar
problems for more general processes. In particular, we derive an analogue of
Veraverbeke's theorem for fractional integrated ARMA models without prehistoric
influence, when the innovations have regularly varying tails. Furthermore, we
prove some limit theorems for the trajectory of the process, conditionally on a
large maximum. Those results are obtained by using a general scheme of proof
which we present in some detail and should be of value in other related
problems.
