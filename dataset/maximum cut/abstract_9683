This paper gives an overview of the model of a neutron star with non-zero
strangeness constructed within the framework of the nonlinear realization of
the chiral $SU(3)_{L}\times SU(3)_{R}$ symmetry. The emphasis is put on the
physical properties of the matter of a neutron star. The obtained solution is
particularly aimed at the problem of the construction of a theoretical model of
a neutron star matter with hyperons that will give high value of the maximum
mass.
