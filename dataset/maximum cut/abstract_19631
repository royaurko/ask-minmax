A measurement of the top-quark mass is presented using Tevatron data from
proton-antiproton collisions at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV
collected with the CDF II detector. Events are selected from a sample of
candidates for production of $t\bar t$ pairs that decay into the lepton+jets
channel. The top-quark mass is measured with an unbinned maximum likelihood
method where the event probability density functions are calculated using
signal and background matrix elements, as well as a set of parameterized
jet-to-parton transfer functions. The likelihood function is maximized with
respect to the top-quark mass, the signal fraction in the sample, and a
correction to the jet energy scale (JES) calibration of the calorimeter jets.
The simultaneous measurement of the JES correction ($\JES$) amounts to an
additional \textit{in situ} jet energy calibration based on the known mass of
the hadronically decaying $W$ boson. Using the data sample of 578 lepton+jets
candidate events, corresponding to 3.2 $fb^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, the
top-quark mass is measured to be $m_t = \rm 172.4 \pm 1.4\:(stat+\JES) \pm
1.3\:(syst) GeV/{\it c}^2$.
