Power spectrum estimation and evaluation of associated errors in the presence
of incomplete sky coverage; non-homogeneous, correlated instrumental noise; and
foreground emission is a problem of central importance for the extraction of
cosmological information from the cosmic microwave background. We develop a
 Monte Carlo approach for the maximum likelihood estimation of the power
spectrum. The method is based on an identity for the Bayesian posterior as a
marginalization over unknowns. Maximization of the posterior involves the
computation of expectation values as a sample average from maps of the cosmic
microwave background and foregrounds given some current estimate of the power
spectrum or cosmological model, and some assumed statistical characterization
of the foregrounds. Maps of the CMB are sampled by a linear transform of a
Gaussian white noise process, implemented numerically with conjugate gradient
descent. For time series data with N_{t} samples, and N pixels on the sphere,
the method has a computational expense $KO[N^{2} +- N_{t} +AFw-log N_{t}],
where K is a prefactor determined by the convergence rate of conjugate gradient
descent. Preconditioners for conjugate gradient descent are given for scans
close to great circle paths, and the method allows partial sky coverage for
these cases by numerically marginalizing over the unobserved, or removed,
region.
