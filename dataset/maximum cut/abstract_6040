In this paper, we construct a Malliavin derivative for functionals of
square-integrable L\'evy processes and derive a Clark-Ocone formula. The
Malliavin derivative is defined via chaos expansions involving stochastic
integrals with respect to Brownian motion and Poisson random measure. As an
illustration, we compute the explicit martingale representation for the maximum
of a L\'evy process.
