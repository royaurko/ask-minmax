A successful connection between Higgs boson decays and the Maximum Entropy
Principle is presented. Based on the information theory inference approach we
determine the Higgs boson mass as $M_H= 125.04\pm 0.25$ GeV, a value fully
compatible to the LHC measurement. This is straightforwardly obtained by taking
the Higgs boson branching ratios as the target probability distributions of the
inference, without any extra assumptions beyond the Standard Model. Yet, the
principle can be a powerful tool in the construction of any model affecting the
Higgs sector. We give, as an example, the case where the Higgs boson has an
extra invisible decay channel. Our findings suggest that a system of Higgs
bosons undergoing a collective decay to Standard Model particles is among the
most fundamental ones where the Maximum Entropy Principle applies.
