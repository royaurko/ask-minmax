We show that the Cooper pair wave function at the center of an Abrikosov
vortex with vorticity m has different parity with respect to frequency from
that in the bulk if m is an odd number and has the same parity if m is an even
number. As a result, in a conventional vortex with m=1, the local density of
states at the Fermi energy has a maximum (minimum) at the center of the vortex
core in even(odd)-frequency superconductor. We propose a scanning tunneling
microscope experiment using a superconducting tip to explore odd-frequency
superconductivity.
