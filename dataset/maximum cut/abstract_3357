We obtain the leading orders of the maximum and the minimum of local times
for the simple random walk on the two-dimensional torus at time proportional to
the cover time. We also estimate the number of points with large (or small)
values of the local times. These are analogues of estimates on the
two-dimensional Gaussian free fields by Bolthausen, Deuschel, and Giacomin
[Ann. Probab., 29 (2001)] and Daviaud [Ann. Probab., 34 (2006)], but we have
different exponents from the case of the Gaussian free field.
