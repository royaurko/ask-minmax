The SU(3) octet SS-PP correlator and the difference of the singlet and octet
scalar correlators are computed within Resonance Chiral Theory. The calculation
is carried on up to the one-loop level, i.e., up to next-to-leading order in
the 1/Nc expansion. Using the resonance expressions as interpolators between
long and short distances, we demand the correlators to follow the high-energy
power behavior prescribed by the operator product expansion and extract
predictions for the low-energy constants. By adding more and more complicated
operators to the hadronic action, our description is progressively improved,
producing for the SS-PP correlator the chiral coupling estimates L_8(mu) =
(1.0+- 0.4) 10^{-3} and C_{38}(mu) = (8+- 5) 10^{-6} for mu=770 MeV. Some first
results for the S1 S1 - S8 S8 correlator are shown, like, for instance, the
positivity of the spectral function for two-meson cuts, the high-energy
constraints for each separate scalar form-factor and preliminary expressions
for the L_6(mu) low-energy constant.
