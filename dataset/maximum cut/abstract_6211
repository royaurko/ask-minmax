We prove that the non-regular binary matroids with no $P_9^*$-minor have
linear growth rate and the maximum size binary matroids with no $P_9^*$-minor
are graphic. The main technique in the proof is the Strong Splitter Theorem
using which we find the precise infinite families of 3-connected binary
matroids with no $P_9^*$-minor.
