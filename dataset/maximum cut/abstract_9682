A low-complexity detector is introduced for polarization-multiplexed M-ary
phase shift keying modulation in a fiber-optical channel impaired by nonlinear
phase noise, generalizing a previous result by Lau and Kahn for
single-polarization signals. The proposed detector uses phase compensation
based on both received signal amplitudes in conjunction with simple
straight-line rather than four-dimensional maximum-likelihood decision
boundaries.
