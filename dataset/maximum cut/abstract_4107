Many implementations for decoding LDPC codes are based on the
(normalized/offset) min-sum algorithm due to its satisfactory performance and
simplicity in operations. Usually, each iteration of the min-sum algorithm
contains two scans, the horizontal scan and the vertical scan. This paper
presents a single-scan version of the min-sum algorithm to speed up the
decoding process. It can also reduce memory usage or wiring because it only
needs the addressing from check nodes to variable nodes while the original
min-sum algorithm requires that addressing plus the addressing from variable
nodes to check nodes. To cut down memory usage or wiring further, another
version of the single-scan min-sum algorithm is presented where the messages of
the algorithm are represented by single bit values instead of using fixed point
ones. The software implementation has shown that the single-scan min-sum
algorithm is more than twice as fast as the original min-sum algorithm.
