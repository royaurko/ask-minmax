We compute the B-mode polarization power spectrum of the CMB from an epoch of
inhomogeneous reionization, using a simple model in which HII regions are
represented by ionized spherical bubbles with a log normal distribution of
sizes whose clustering properties are determined by large-scale structure. Both
the global ionization fraction and the characteristic radius of HII regions are
allowed to be free functions of redshift. Models that would produce substantial
contamination to degree scale gravitational wave B-mode measurements have power
that is dominated by the shot noise of the bubbles. Rare bubbles of >100 Mpc at
z>20 can produce signals that in fact exceed the B-modes from gravitational
lensing and are comparable to the maximal allowed signal of gravitational waves
(~0.1uK) while still being consistent with global constraints on the total
optical depth. Even bubbles down to 20 Mpc at z~15, or 40 Mpc at z~10 can be
relevant (0.01uK) once the lensing signal is removed either statistically or
directly. However, currently favored theoretical models that have ionization
bubbles that only grow to such sizes at the very end of a fairly prompt and
late reionization produce signals which are at most at these levels.
