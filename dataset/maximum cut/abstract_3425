It is conjectured that a hyperbolic knot admits at most three Dehn surgeries
which yield closed three manifolds containing incompressible tori. We show that
there exist infinitely many hyperbolic knots which attain the conjectural
maximum number. Interestingly, those surgeries correspond to consecutive
integers.
