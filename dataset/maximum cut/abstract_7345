One of the most tantalizing results from the WMAP experiment is the
suggestion that the power at large scales is anomalously low when compared to
the prediction of the ``standard'' Lambda-CDM model. The same anomaly, although
with somewhat larger uncertainty, was also previously noted in the COBE data.
In this work we discuss possible alternate models that give better fits on
large scales and apply a model-comparison technique to select amongst them. We
find that models with a cut off in the power spectrum at large scales are
indeed preferred by data, but only by a factor of 3.6, at most, in the
likelihood ratio, corresponding to about ``1.5 sigma'' if interpreted in the
traditional manner. Using the same technique, we have also examined the
possibility of a systematic error in the measurement (or prediction) of the
large-scale power. Ignoring other evidence that the large-scale modes are
properly measured and predicted, we find this possibility somewhat more likely,
with roughly a 2.5 sigma evidence.
