In this paper we will see deductive systems for classical propositional and
predicate logic in the calculus of structures. Like sequent systems, they have
a cut rule which is admissible. In addition, they enjoy a top-down symmetry and
some normal forms for derivations that are not available in the sequent
calculus. Identity axiom, cut, weakening and also contraction can be reduced to
atomic form. This leads to rules that are local: they do not require the
inspection of expressions of unbounded size.
