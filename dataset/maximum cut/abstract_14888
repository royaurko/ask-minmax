This paper is concerned with the steady-state propagation of an antiplane
semi-infinite crack in couple stress elastic materials. A distributed loading
applied at the crack faces and moving with the same velocity of the crack tip
is considered, and the influence of the loading profile variations and
microstructural effects on the dynamic energy release rate is investigated. The
behaviour of both energy release rate and maximum total shear stress when the
crack tip speed approaches the critical speed (either that of the shear waves
or that of the localised surface waves) is studied. The limit case
corresponding to vanishing characteristic scale lengths is addressed both
numerically and analytically by means of a comparison with classical elasticity
results.
