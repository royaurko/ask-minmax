Urban morphology has presented significant intellectual challenges to
mathematicians and physicists ever since the eighteenth century, when Euler
first explored the famous Konigsberg bridges problem. Many important
regularities and allometries have been observed in urban studies, including
Zipf's law and Gibrat's law, rendering cities attractive systems for analysis
within statistical physics. Nevertheless, a broad consensus on how cities and
their boundaries are defined is still lacking. Applying percolation theory to
the street intersection space, we show that growth curves for the maximum
cluster size of the largest cities in the UK and in California collapse to a
single curve, namely the logistic. Subsequently, by introducing the concept of
the condensation threshold, we show that natural boundaries of cities can be
well defined in a universal way. This allows us to study and discuss
systematically some of the allometries that are present in cities, thus casting
light on the concept of ergodicity as related to urban street networks.
