We show that the usefulness of a state as an activator in teleportation
protocols is equivalent to the robustness of its entanglement to noise. The
robustness of entanglement of a bi-partite state is linked to the maximum
increase in the the fidelity of teleportation of any other state when the
former is used as an extra resource. On the one hand, this connection gives an
operational meaning to the robustness of entanglement. On the other hand, it
shows that the activation capability - which has a central role as an
operational way of quantifying bound entangled states - can be estimated
experimentally by measuring entanglement witnesses.
