We study the existence of ferromagnetism in one dimensional Hubbard Model
with on site interaction and nearest and next nearest neighbor hopping. Using
the Hubbard I approximation, a self consistent equation for $<n_\sigma>$, the
particle density with spin $\sigma$ is obtained. We find that ferromagnetism
exists over a wide range of values of the next nearest neighbor hopping
element t' when on-site interaction U is large. The phase diagram as a
function of t'/t and the electron density $<n>$ has been obtained by
numerically solving the self consistent equation. It is found that the
maximum density at which ferromagnetism can occur, peaks around $t'/t \approx
-0.53$. We show that this phenomenon is a result of the peculiar way in which
the t' term modifies the density of states.
