We describe a method for searching for a light stop squark
[M(stop)+M(LSP)<M(t)] at the Fermilab Tevatron. Traditional searches rely upon
stringent background-reducing cuts which, unfortunately, leave very few signal
events given the present data set. To avoid this difficulty, we suggest using a
milder set of cuts, combined with a ``superweight,'' whose purpose is to
discriminate between signal and background. The superweight consists of a sum
of terms (each of which are either zero or one) assigned event-by-event
depending upon the values of various observables. By construction, the
superweight ``large'' for the signal and ``small'' for the background. We apply
this method to the detection of stops coming from top decay. It is
straightforward to adapt our method to other processes.
