With nuclear targets comes a new scale into the pQCD description of hard
processes - the saturation scale. In the saturation regime, the familiar linear
k_\perp-factorization breaks down and must be replaced by a nonlinear
k_\perp-factorization, which accounts for absorptive and multiple scattering
corrections to the hard process. Predictions for partial cross sections
corresponding to a fixed number of cut Pomerons (the topological cross
sections) can be obtained in a surprisingly straightforward manner. We discuss
some applications to deep inelastic scattering.
