Strong coupling constant computed in Landau gauge and MOM renormalization
scheme from lattice two and three gluon Green Functions exhibits an unexpected
behavior in the deep IR, showing a maximum value around $1 {\rm GeV}$. We
analise this coupling below this maximum within a semiclassical approach, were
gluon degrees of freedom at very low energies are described in terms of the
classical solutions of the lagrangian, namely instantons. We provide some new
results concerning the relationship between instantons and the low energy
dynamics of QCD, by analising gluon two- and three-point Green functions
separately and with the help of a cooling procedure to eliminate short range
correlations.
