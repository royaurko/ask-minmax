The log-likelihood energy term in popular model-fitting segmentation methods,
e.g. Zhu-Yuille, Chan-Vese, GrabCut, etc., is presented as a generalized
"probabilistic" K-means energy for color space clustering. This interpretation
reveals some limitations, e.g. over-fitting. We propose an alternative approach
to color clustering using kernel K-means energy with well-known properties such
as non-linear separation and scalability to higher-dimensional feature spaces.
Similarly to log-likelihoods, our kernel energy term for color space clustering
can be combined with image grid regularization, e.g. boundary smoothness, and
minimized using (pseudo-) bound optimization and max-flow algorithm. Unlike
histogram or GMM fitting and implicit entropy minimization, our approach is
closely related to general pairwise clustering such as average association and
normalized cut. But, in contrast to previous pairwise clustering algorithms,
our approach can incorporate any standard geometric regularization in the image
domain. We analyze extreme cases for kernel bandwidth (e.g. Gini bias) and
propose adaptive strategies. Our general kernel-based approach opens the door
for many extensions/applications.
