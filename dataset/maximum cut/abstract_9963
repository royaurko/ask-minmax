We report the discovery of two new gravitationally lensed quasars, WFI
J2026-4536 and WFI J2033-4723, at respective source redshifts of z=2.23 and
z=1.66. Both systems are quadruply imaged and have similar PG1115-like image
configurations. WFI J2026-4536 has a maximum image separation of 1.4", a total
brightness of g = 16.5, and a relatively simple lensing environment, while WFI
J2033-4723 has a maximum image separation of 2.5", an estimated total
brightness of g = 17.9, and a more complicated environment of at least six
galaxies within 20". The primary lensing galaxies are detected for both systems
after PSF subtraction. Several of the broadband flux ratios for the two lenses
show a strong (0.1-0.4 mags) trend with wavelength, suggesting either
microlensing or differential extinction through the lensing galaxy. For WFI
J2026-4536, the total quasar flux has dimmed by 0.1 mag in the blue but only
half as much in the red over three months, suggestive of microlensing-induced
variations. For WFI J2033-4723, resolved spectra of some of the quasar
components reveal emission line flux ratios that agree better with the
macromodel predictions than either the broadband or continuum ratios, also
indicative of microlensing. The predicted differential time delays for WFI
J2026-4536 are short, ranging from 1-2 weeks for the long delay, but are longer
for WFI J2033-4723, ranging from 1-2 months. Both systems hold promise for
future monitoring campaigns aimed at microlensing or time delay studies.
