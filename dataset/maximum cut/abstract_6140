Based on Malliavin calculus tools and approximation results, we show how to
compute a maximum likelihood type estimator for a rather general differential
equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H>1/2.
Rates of convergence for the approximation task are provided, and numerical
experiments show that our procedure leads to good results in terms of
estimation.
