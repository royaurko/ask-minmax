We investigate a recently proposed Higgs-like model (arXiv:0811.4423
[hep-th]), in the framework of a gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables
formalism. We compute the static potential between test charges in a condensate
of scalars and fermions. In the case of charged massive scalar we recover the
screening potential. On the other hand, in the Higgs case, with a "tachyonic"
mass term and a quartic potential in the Lagrangian, unexpected features are
found. It is observed that the interaction energy is the sum of an
effective-Yukawa and a linear potential, leading to the confinement of static
charges.
