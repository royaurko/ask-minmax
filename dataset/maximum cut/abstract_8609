We present results from several simulations of equal mass black holes with
spin. The spin magnitudes are $S/m^2=0.8$ in all cases, but we vary the spin
orientations arbitrarily, in and outside the orbital plane. We find that in all
but one case the final merged black hole acquires a kick of more than 1000
km/s, indicating that kicks of this magnitude are likely to be generic and
should be expected for mergers with general spin orientations. The maximum kick
velocity we find is 2500 km/s and occurs for initial spins which are
anti-aligned in the initial orbital plane.
