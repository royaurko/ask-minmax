The magnetic field dependences of the critical-current of a granular s-wave
superconductor has been determined by considering the rectangular and circular
junction model of an array of small superconducting particles which interacting
by Josephson coupling through insulating barriers. We will show that in the
case of circular model, the maximum critical current of the Josephson current
is larger than that of rectangular model.
