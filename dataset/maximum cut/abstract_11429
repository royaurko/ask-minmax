We investigate the effects of very strong magnetic fields upon the equation
of state of dense bayonic matter in which hyperons are present. In the presence
of a magnetic field, the equation of state above nuclear density is
significantly affected both by Landau quantization and magnetic moment
interactions, but only for field strengths $B>5\times10^{18}$ G. The former
tends to soften the EOS and increase proton and lepton abundances, while the
latter produces an overall stiffening of the EOS. Each results in a supression
of hyperons relative to the field-free case. The structure of a neutron star
is, however, primarily determined by the magnetic field stress. We utilize
existing general relativistic magneto-hydrostatic calculations to demonstrate
that maximum average fields within a stable neutron are limited to values $B\le
1-3 \times10^{18}$ G. This is not large enough to significantly influence
particle compositions or the matter pressure, unless fluctuations dominate the
average field strengths in the interior or configurations with significantly
larger field gradients are considered.
