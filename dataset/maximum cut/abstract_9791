To our knowledge at the time of writing, the maximum Waring rank for the set
of all ternary forms of degree $d$ (with coefficients in an algebraically
closed field of characteristic zero) is known only for $d\le 4$. The best upper
bound that is known for $d=5$ is twelve, and in this work we lower it to ten.
