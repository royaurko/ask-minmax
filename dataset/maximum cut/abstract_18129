We study security in partial repair in wireless caching networks where parts
of the stored packets in the caching nodes are susceptible to be erased. Let us
denote a caching node that has lost parts of its stored packets as a sick
caching node and a caching node that has not lost any packet as a healthy
caching node. In partial repair, a set of caching nodes (among sick and healthy
caching nodes) broadcast information to other sick caching nodes to recover the
erased packets. The broadcast information from a caching node is assumed to be
received without any error by all other caching nodes. All the sick caching
nodes then are able to recover their erased packets, while using the broadcast
information and the nonerased packets in their storage as side information. In
this setting, if an eavesdropper overhears the broadcast channels, it might
obtain some information about the stored file. We thus study secure partial
repair in the senses of information-theoretically strong and weak security. In
both senses, we investigate the secrecy caching capacity, namely, the maximum
amount of information which can be stored in the caching network such that
there is no leakage of information during a partial repair process. We then
deduce the strong and weak secrecy caching capacities, and also derive the
sufficient finite field sizes for achieving the capacities. Finally, we propose
optimal secure codes for exact partial repair, in which the recovered packets
are exactly the same as erased packets.
