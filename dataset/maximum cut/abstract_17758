Several young supernova remnants (SNRs), including SN1006, emit synchrotron
X-rays in narrow filaments, hereafter thin rims, along their periphery. The
widths of these rims imply 50 to 100 $\mu$G fields in the region immediately
behind the shock, far larger than expected for the interstellar medium
compressed by unmodified shocks, assuming electron radiative losses limit rim
widths. However, magnetic-field damping could also produce thin rims. Here we
review the literature on rim width calculations, summarizing the case for
magnetic-field amplification. We extend these calculations to include an
arbitrary power-law dependence of the diffusion coefficient on energy, $D
\propto E^{\mu}$. Loss-limited rim widths should shrink with increasing photon
energy, while magnetic-damping models predict widths almost independent of
photon energy. We use these results to analyze Chandra observations of SN 1006,
in particular the southwest limb. We parameterize the full widths at half
maximum (FWHM) in terms of energy as FWHM $\propto E^{m_E}_{\gamma}$. Filament
widths in SN1006 decrease with energy; $m_E \sim -0.3$ to $-0.8$, implying
magnetic field amplification by factors of 10 to 50, above the factor of 4
expected in strong unmodified shocks. For SN 1006, the rapid shrinkage rules
out magnetic damping models. It also favors short mean free paths (small
diffusion coefficients) and strong dependence of $D$ on energy ($\mu \ge 1$).
