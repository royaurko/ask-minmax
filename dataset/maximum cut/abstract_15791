We present near-infrared, H-band (1.45-1.85 microns) observations of the
eclipsing dwarf nova, IP Peg, in quiescence. The light curves are composed of
ellipsoidal variations from the late-type secondary star and emission from the
accretion disk and the bright spot. The light curves have two eclipses: a
primary eclipse of the accretion disk and the bright spot by the companion
star, and a secondary eclipse of the companion star by the disk. The
ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star were modeled and subtracted from
the data. The resulting light curve shows a pronounced double-hump variation.
The double-hump profile resembles those seen in the light curves of WZ Sge and
AL Com and likely originates in the accretion disk. The primary eclipse was
modeled using maximum entropy disk mapping techniques. The accretion disk has a
flat intensity distribution and a cool brightness temperature (Tbr=3000 K) in
the near-infrared. Superimposed on the face of the disk is the bright spot
(Tbr=10,000 K); the position of the bright spot is different from the observed
range of visible bright spot positions. The near-infrared accretion disk flux
is dominated by optically thin emission. The secondary eclipse indicates the
presence of some occulting medium in the disk, but the eclipse depth is too
shallow to be caused by a fully opaque accretion disk.
