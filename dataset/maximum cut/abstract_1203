We present an alternate method of determining the progression of the solar
cycle through an analysis of the solar X-ray background. Our results are based
on the NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) X-ray
data in the 1-8 \AA$\,$band from 1986 - present, covering solar cycles 22, 23,
and 24. The X-ray background level tracks the progression of the solar cycle
through its maximum and minimum. Using the X-ray data, we can therefore make
estimates of the solar cycle progression and date of solar maximum. Based upon
our analysis, we conclude that the Sun reached its hemisphere-averaged maximum
in Solar Cycle 24 in late 2013. This is within six months of the NOAA
prediction of a maximum in Spring 2013.
