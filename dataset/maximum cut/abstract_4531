This article describes the use of symplectic cut-and-paste methods to compute
Gromov-Witten invariants. Our focus is on recent advances extending these
methods to Kahler surfaces with geometric genus p_g>0, for which the usual GW
invariants vanish for most homology classes. This involves extending the
Splitting Formula and the Symplectic Sum Formula to the family GW invariants
introduced by the first contributor. We present applications to the invariants of
elliptic surfaces and to the Yau-Zaslow Conjecture. In both cases the results
agree with the conjectures of algebraic geometers and yield a proof, to appear
in [LL1], of previously unproved cases of the Yau-Zaslow Conjecture.
