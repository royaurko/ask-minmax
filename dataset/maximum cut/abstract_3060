Inhomogeneously doped thermoelectric nanomaterials with a delta-function
electronic density of states can operate with Carnot efficiency in the absence
of phonon heat leaks. Here we self-consistently calculate the efficiency and
power from open-circuit to short-circuit of a simple model of a thermoelectric
nanomaterial with a narrow peak in the electronic density of states and finite
lattice thermal conductivity, comparing the results for inhomogeneous and
homogeneous doping. For power generation between 800K and 300K, we find that
not only does inhomogeneous doping increase the maximum efficiency by 10%, but
it also increases the maximum power by up to 60%.
