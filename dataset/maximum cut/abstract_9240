Comparison between potential possibilities and inevitable systematic errors
of one- and two-step reactions for obtaining of maximum reliable data on level
density and radiative strength functions after decay of excited levels of
complicated nuclei has been performed. It was shown that the use for this aim
of two-step reactions instead of one-step reactions provides for potential
possibility to decrease systematical errors of mentioned nuclear parameters, as
minimum, by several times.
