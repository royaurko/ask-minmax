We investigate the sensitivity of the heavy ion mode of the LHC to anomalous
Higgs boson couplings to photons, H-photon-photon, through the analysis of the
processes photon photon to b anti-b and photon photon to photon photon in
peripheral heavy ion collisions. We suggest cuts to improve the signal over
background ratio and determine the capability of LHC to impose bounds on
anomalous couplings by searching for a Higgs boson signal in these modes.
