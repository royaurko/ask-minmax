Low resolution spectra of SN 1999dn at early times are presented and compared
with synthetic spectra generated with the parameterized supernova
synthetic-spectrum code SYNOW. We find that the spectra of SN 1999dn strongly
resemble those of SN 1997X and SN 1984L, and hence we classify it as a Type Ib
event. Line-identifications are established through spectrum synthesis. Strong
evidence of both H-alpha and C II 6580 is found. We infer that H-alpha appears
first, before the time of maximum brightness, and then is blended with and
finally overwhelmed by the C II line after maximum; this favors a thin
high-velocity hydrogen skin in this Type Ib supernova.
