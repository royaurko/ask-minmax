In this paper, we present a qualitative analysis of the dissipative processes
during the failure of the interface between a viscoelastic polymer and a solid
surface. We reassess the "viscoelastic trumpet" model [P.-G. de Gennes, C. R.
Acad. Sci. Paris, 307, 1949 (1988)], and show that, for a crosslinked polymer,
the interface toughness G(V) starts from a relatively low value, G_0, due to
local processes near the fracture tip, and rises up to a maximum of order $G_0
(\mu_{\infty}/\mu_0)$ (where $\mu_0$ and $\mu_{\infty}$ stand for the elastic
modulus of the material, respectively at low and high strain frequencies). This
enhancement of fracture energy is due to far-field viscous dissipation in the
bulk material, and begins for peel-rates V much lower than previously thought.
For a polymer melt, the adhesion energy is predicted to scale as 1/V. In the
second part of this paper, we compare some of our theoretical predictions with
experimental results about the viscoelastic adhesion between a
polydimethylsiloxane polymer melt and a glass surface. In particular, the
expected dependence of the fracture energy versus separation rate is confirmed
by the experimental data, and the observed changes in the concavity of the
crack profile are in good agreement with our simple model.
