We prove that the light-cone time cut-off on the multiverse defines the same
probabilities as a causal patch with initial conditions in the longest-lived
metastable vacuum. This establishes the complete equivalence of two measures of
eternal inflation which naively appear very different (though both are
motivated by holography). The duality can be traced to an underlying geometric
relation which we identify.
