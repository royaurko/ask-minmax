We investigate Ramsey numbers of bounded degree graphs and provide an
interpolation between known results on the Ramsey numbers of general bounded
degree graphs and bounded degree graphs of small bandwidth. Our main theorem
implies that there exists a constant $c$ such that for every $\Delta$, there
exists $\beta$ such that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with maximum degree at
most $\Delta$ having a homomorphism $f$ into a graph $H$ of maximum degree at
most $d$ where $|f^{-1}(v)| \le \beta n$ for all $v \in V(H)$, then the Ramsey
number of $G$ is at most $c^{d \log d} n$. A construction of Graham, R\"odl,
and Ruci\'nski shows that the statement above holds only if $\beta \le
(c')^{\Delta}$ for some constant $c' < 1$. We further study the parameter
$\beta$ using a density-type embedding theorem for bipartite graphs of small
bandwidth. This theorem may be of independent interest.
