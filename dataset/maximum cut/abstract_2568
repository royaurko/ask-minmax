This article reviews on-shell methods for analytic computation of loop
amplitudes, emphasizing techniques based on unitarity cuts. Unitarity
techniques are formulated generally but have been especially useful for
calculating one-loop amplitudes in massless theories such as Yang-Mills theory,
QCD, and QED.
