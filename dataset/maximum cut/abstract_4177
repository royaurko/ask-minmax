We present lattice simulation results corresponding to an SU(2) pure gauge
theory defined on the orbifold space E_4 x I_1, where E_4 is the
four-dimensional Euclidean space and I_1 is an interval, with the gauge
symmetry broken to a U(1) subgroup at the two ends of the interval by
appropriate boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the U(1) gauge boson
acquires a mass from a Higgs mechanism. The mechanism is driven by two of the
extra-dimensional components of the five-dimensional gauge field which play
respectively the role of the longitudinal component of the gauge boson and a
massive real physical scalar, the Higgs particle. Despite the
non-renormalizable nature of the theory, we observe only a mild cut-off
dependence of the physical observables. We also show evidence that there is a
region in the parameter space where the system behaves in a way consistent with
dimensional reduction.
