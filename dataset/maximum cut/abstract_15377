The present paper deals with an OFDM-based uplink within a multi-user MIMO
(MU-MIMO) system where a massive MIMO approach is employed. In this context,
the linear detectors Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE), Zero Forcing (ZF) and
Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) are considered and assessed. This papers includes
Bit Error Rate (BER) results for uncoded QPSK/OFDM transmissions through a flat
Rayleigh fading channel under the assumption of perfect power control and
channel estimation. BER results are obtained through Monte Carlo simulations.
Performance results are discussed in detail and we confirm the achievable
"massive MIMO" effects, even for a reduced complexity detection technique, when
the number of receive antennas at BS is much larger than the number of transmit
antennas.
