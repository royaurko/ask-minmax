In this paper, we apply the cut and paste procedure to charged black string
for the construction of thin-shell wormhole. We consider the Darmois-Israel
formalism to determine the surface stresses of the shell. We take Chaplygin gas
to deal with the matter distribution on shell. The radial perturbation approach
(preserving the symmetry) is used to investigate the stability of static
solutions. We conclude that stable static solutions exist both for uncharged
and charged black string thin-shell wormholes for particular values of the
parameters.
