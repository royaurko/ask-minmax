We propose a new method for the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of
nonlinear mixed effects models when the variance matrix of Gaussian random
effects has a prescribed pattern of zeros (PPZ). The method consists in
coupling the recently developed Iterative Conditional Fitting (ICF) algorithm
with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. It provides positive definite
estimates for any sample size, and does not rely on any structural assumption
on the PPZ. It can be easily adapted to many versions of EM.
