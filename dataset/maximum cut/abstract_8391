We present analytic results for the polarizabilities, $\chi({\bf Q},\omega)$,
in the charge, spin, and current channels for two-dimensional s- and d-wave
superconductors for large momentum transfer. A collective mode in the charge
channel is predicted to exist for extremum vectors of the Fermi-surface with
energy below twice the maximum superconducting gap. Such modes are directly
observable through inelastic x-ray or electron scattering. Scattering of single
particle excitations by these collective modes leads to several unusual
features in the single particle spectrum in the superconducting state which are
seen in angle resolved photoemission experiments.
