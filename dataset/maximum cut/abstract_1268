We report here the measurements of the energy spectra of atmospheric muons
and of the cosmic ray primary proton and helium nuclei in a single experiment.
These were carried out using the MASS superconducting spectrometer in a balloon
flight experiment in 1991. The relevance of these results to the atmospheric
neutrino anomaly is emphasized. In particular, this approach allows
uncertainties caused by the level of solar modulation, the geomagnetic cut-off
of the primaries and possible experimental systematics to be decoupled in the
comparison of calculated fluxes of muons to measured muon fluxes. The muon
observations cover the momentum and depth ranges of 0.3-40 GeV/c and 5-886
g/cmsquared, respectively. The proton and helium primary measurements cover the
rigidity range from 3 to 100 GV, in which both the solar modulation and the
geomagnetic cut-off affect the energy spectra at low energies.
