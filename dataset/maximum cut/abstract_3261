We present a study of the DNA translocation of the bacteriophage \phi 29
packaging molecular motor. From the experimental available information we
present a model system based in an stochastic fashing potential, which
reproduces the experimental observations such as: detailed trajectories, steps
and substeps, spatial correlation, and velocity. Moreover the model allows the
evaluation of power and efficiency of this motor. We have found that the
maximum power regime does not correspond with that of the maximum efficiency.
These informations can stimulate further experiments.
