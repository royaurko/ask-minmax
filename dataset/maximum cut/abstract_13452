We study the fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges, i.e. the
baryon number, electric charge and the strangeness at finite temperature and
nonzero baryon chemical potential with an effective model. The fluctuations are
calculated up to the fourth-order and the correlations to the third-order. We
find that the second-order fluctuations and correlations have a peak or valley
structure when the chiral phase transition takes place with the increase of the
baryon chemical potential; the third-order fluctuations and correlations change
their signs during the chiral phase transition and the fourth-order
fluctuations have two maximum and one minimum. we also depict contour plots of
various fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges in the plane of
temperature and baryon chemical potential. We find that higher order
fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges are superior to the
second-order ones to be used to search for the critical point in heavy ion
collision experiments.
