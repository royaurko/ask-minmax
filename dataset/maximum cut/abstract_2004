We present spectral variations of the binary X-ray pulsar LMC X-4 observed
with the RXTE/PCA during different phases of its 30.5 day long third period.
Only out of eclipse data were used for this study. The 3-25 keV spectrum,
modeled with high energy cut-off power-law and iron line emission is found to
show strong dependence on the intensity state. Correlations between the Fe line
emission flux and different parameters of the continuum are presented here.
