This paper describes the design and simulation of an 8-bit dedicated
processor for calculating the Sine and Cosine of an Angle using CORDIC
Algorithm (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer), a simple and efficient
algorithm to calculate hyperbolic and trigonometric functions. We have proposed
a dedicated processor system, modeled by writing appropriate programs in VHDL,
for calculating the Sine and Cosine of an angle. System simulation was carried
out using ModelSim 6.3f and Xilinx ISE Design Suite 12.3. A maximum frequency
of 81.353 MHz was reached with a minimum period of 12.292 ns. 126 (3%) slices
were used. This paper attempts to survey the existing CORDIC algorithm with an
eye towards implementation in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A brief
description of the theory behind the algorithm and the derivation of the Sine
and Cosine of an angle using the CORDIC algorithm has been presented. The
system can be implemented using Spartan3 XC3S400 with Xilinx ISE 12.3 and VHDL.
