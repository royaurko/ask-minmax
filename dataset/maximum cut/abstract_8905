Entanglement or entanglement generating interactions permit to achieve the
maximum allowed speed in the dynamical evolution of a composite system, when
the energy resources are distributed among subsystems. The cases of
pre-existing entanglement and of entanglement-building interactions are
separately addressed. The role of classical correlations is also discussed.
