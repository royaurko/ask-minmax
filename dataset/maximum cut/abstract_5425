The PowHel framework allows to make predictions of total and differential
cross-sections of multiparticle hadroproduction processes at both NLO QCD
accuracy and NLO QCD matched to Parton Shower, on the basis of the interface
between the POWHEG-BOX and HELAC-NLO codes. It has already been applied to
study several processes involving a top-antitop pair in association with a
third particle or hadronic jet. Our most recent predictions concern
top-antitop-V hadroproduction (with V = W or Z), at both parton and hadron
level, by considering different decay channels (hadronic and leptonic) of the
heavy particles. In particular, we show the results of our phenomenological
analyses under the same system of cuts also recently adopted by the CMS
collaboration at LHC.
