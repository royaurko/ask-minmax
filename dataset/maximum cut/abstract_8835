We study the hadron-quark phase transition in the interior of neutron stars
(NS). For the hadronic sector, we use a microscopic equation of state (EOS)
involving nucleons and hyperons derived within the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock
approach. For the quark sector, we employ the MIT bag model, as well as the
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) and the Color Dielectric (CD) models, and find that
the NS maximum masses lie in the interval between 1.5 and 1.8 solar masses.
