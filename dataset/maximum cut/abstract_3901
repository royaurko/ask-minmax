We calculate the reflection component predicted by the anisotropic
illumination model of Henri & Petrucci 1997.
  This component appears to be more important than for isotropic models.
  The overall X/gamma spectrum is found to be strongly angle-dependent. When
the accretion disc is seen with a nearly edge-on orientation the reflection
hump is weak, while a face-on viewing angle leads to a proeminent reflection
hump with an equivalent reflection coefficient R close to 50. Such reflection
dominated Seyfert 1s galaxies are not observed. By fitting observed X/gamma
spectra, we derive inclination angles of 70 degrees for MCG 8-11 -11 and 80
degrees for IC 4329a and NGC 4151.
  Although the model succeed in reproducing individual observed spectra, it
requires all the Seyfert 1s observed in the X-ray band to be seen with large
inclination angles. Such a situation is highly improbable. On the other hand,
we show that the ionisation of a fair part of the reflecting disk could
represent an interesting improvement of the model, consistent with the data and
relaxing the constraints on the high energy cut-off in Seyfert galaxies.
