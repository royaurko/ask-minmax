Correlation Filters (CFs) are a class of classifiers which are designed for
accurate pattern localization. Traditionally CFs have been used with scalar
features only, which limits their ability to be used with vector feature
representations like Gabor filter banks, SIFT, HOG, etc. In this paper we
present a new CF named Maximum Margin Vector Correlation Filter (MMVCF) which
extends the traditional CF designs to vector features. MMVCF further combines
the generalization capability of large margin based classifiers like Support
Vector Machines (SVMs) and the localization properties of CFs for better
robustness to outliers. We demonstrate the efficacy of MMVCF for object
detection and landmark localization on a variety of databases and demonstrate
that MMVCF consistently shows improved pattern localization capability in
comparison to SVMs.
