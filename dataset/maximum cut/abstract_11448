We present a statistical system that can be used in the study of cluster
populations. The basis of our approach is the construction of synthetic cluster
color-magnitude-radius diagrams (CMRDs), which we compare with the observed
data using a maximum likelihood calculation. This approach permits a relatively
easy incorporation of incompleteness (a function of not only magnitude and
color, but also radius), photometry errors and biases, and a variety of other
complex effects into the calculation, instead of the more common procedure of
attempting to correct for those effects.
  We then apply this procedure to our NGC 3627 data from Paper I. We find that
we are able to successfully model the observed CMRD and constrain a number of
parameters of the cluster population. We measure a power law mass function
slope of alpha = -1.50 +/- 0.07, and a distribution of core radii centered at
r_c = 1.53 +/- 0.15 pc. Although the extinction distribution is less
constrained, we measured a value for the mean extinction consistent with that
determined in Paper I from the Cepheids.
