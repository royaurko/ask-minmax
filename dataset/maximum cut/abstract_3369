We say that a polygon inscribed in the circle is asymmetric if it contains no
two antipodal points being the endpoints of a diameter. Given $n$ diameters of
a circle and a positive integer $k<n$, this paper addresses the problem of
computing a maximum area asymmetric $k$-gon having as vertices $k<n$ endpoints
of the given diameters. The study of this type of polygons is motivated by
ethnomusiciological applications.
