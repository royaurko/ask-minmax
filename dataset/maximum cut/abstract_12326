We investigate the pseudo specific heat of SU(2) gauge theory near the
crossover point on $4^4$ to $16^4$ lattices. Several different methods are used
to determine the specific heat. The curious finite size dependence of the peak
maximum is explained from the interplay of the crossover phenomenon with the
deconfinement transition occurring due to the finite extension of the lattice.
We find, that for lattices of size $8^4$ and larger the crossover peak is
independent of lattice size at $\beta_{co}=2.23(2)$ and has a peak height of
$C_{V,co}=1.685(10)$. We conclude therefore that the crossover peak is not the
result of an ordinary phase transition. Further, the contributions to $C_V$
from different plaquette correlations are calculated. We find, that at the peak
and far outside the peak the ratio of contributions from orthogonal and
parallel plaquette correlations is different. To estimate the finite
temperature influence on symmetric lattices far off the deconfinement
transition point we calculate the modulus of the lattice average of the
Polyakov loop on these lattices and compare it to predictions from a random
walk model.
