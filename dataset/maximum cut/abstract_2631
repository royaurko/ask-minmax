The unitary transformation that leads from the minimal-coupling description
to the electric-dipole one is analysed in detail. The momentum cut-off function
f(k), which is understood in the definition of such a transformation, is
obtained explicitly by use of the variational method. We give an expression for
f(k) in terms of the electron-density and of the mean-squared value of the
electric-dipole moment of the atom in its ground state. A relevant consequence
concerns the van der Waals interaction, whose long-distance behaviour turns out
to be proportional to R^{-8} .
