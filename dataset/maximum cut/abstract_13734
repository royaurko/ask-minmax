In the present paper, we would like to draw attention to a possible
generalized Fisher information that fits well in the formalism of nonextensive
thermostatistics. This generalized Fisher information is defined for densities
on $\mathbb{R}^{n}.$ Just as the maximum R\'enyi or Tsallis entropy subject to
an elliptic moment constraint is a generalized q-Gaussian, we show that the
minimization of the generalized Fisher information also leads a generalized
q-Gaussian. This yields a generalized Cram\'er-Rao inequality. In addition, we
show that the generalized Fisher information naturally pops up in a simple
inequality that links the generalized entropies, the generalized Fisher
information and an elliptic moment. Finally, we give an extended Stam
inequality. In this series of results, the extremal functions are the
generalized q-Gaussians. Thus, these results complement the classical
characterization of the generalized q-Gaussian and introduce a generalized
Fisher information as a new information measure in nonextensive
thermostatistics.
