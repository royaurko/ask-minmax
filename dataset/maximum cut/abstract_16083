Recent results from the KASCADE experiment on measurements of cosmic rays in
the energy range of the knee are presented. Emphasis is placed on energy
spectra of individual mass groups as obtained from sophisticated unfolding
procedures applied to the reconstructed electron and truncated muon numbers of
EAS. The data show a knee-like structure in the energy spectra of light
primaries (p, He, C) and an increasing dominance of heavy ones (A>20) towards
higher energies. This basic result is robust against uncertainties of the
applied interaction models QGSJET and SIBYLL. Slight differences observed
between experimental data and EAS simulations provide important clues for
improvements of the interaction models. The data are complemented by new limits
on global anisotropies in the arrival directions of CRs and by upper limits on
point sources. Astrophysical implications for discriminating models of maximum
acceleration energy vs galactic diffusion/drift models of the knee are
discussed based on this data. To improve the reconstruction quality and
statistics around 10^17 eV, KASCADE has recently been extended by a factor 10
in area. The status and expected performance of the new experiment
KASCADE-Grande is presented.
