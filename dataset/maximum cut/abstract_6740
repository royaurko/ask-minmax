We consider the wireless Rayleigh fading relay channel with finite complex
input constellations. Assuming global knowledge of the channel state
information and perfect synchronization, upper and lower bounds on the
achievable rate, for the full-duplex relay, as well as the more practical
half-duplex relay (in which the relay cannot transmit and receive
simultaneously), are studied. Assuming the power constraint at the source node
and the relay node to be equal, the gain in rate offered by the use of relay
over the direct transmission (without the relay) is investigated. It is shown
that for the case of finite complex input constellations, the relay gain
attains the maximum at a particular SNR and at higher SNRs the relay gain tends
to become zero. Since practical schemes always use finite complex input
constellation, the above result means that the relay offers maximum advantage
over the direct transmission when we operate at a particular SNR and offers no
advantage at very high SNRs. This is contrary to the results already known for
the relay channel with Gaussian input alphabet.
