In order to express a polyhedron as the (Minkowski) sum of a polytope and a
polyhedral cone, Motzkin (1936) made a transition from the polyhedron to a
polyhedral cone. Based on his excellent idea, we represent a set by a
characteristic cone. By using this representation, we then reach four main
results: (i) expressing a closed convex set containing no line as the direct
sum of the convex hull of its extreme points and conical hull of its extreme
directions, (ii) establishing a convex programming (CP) based framework for
determining a maximal element-an element with the maximum number of positive
components-of a convex set, (iii) developing a linear programming problem for
finding a relative interior point of a polyhedron, and (iv) proposing two
procedures for the identification of a strictly complementary solution in
linear programming.
