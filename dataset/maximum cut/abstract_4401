We examine non-thermal dark matter production from a late-decaying scalar
field, with a particular attention on non-renormalizable operators of D=5
through which the scalar field decays into the standard model particles and
their superpartners. We show that almost the same number of superparticles as
that of particles are generally produced from the decay. To avoid the gravitino
overproduction problem, the decay is favored to proceed via interactions with
an intermediate cut-off scale M << M_P. This should be contrasted to the
conventional scenario using the modulus decay. The bosonic supersymmetry
partner of the axion, i.e., saxion, is proposed as a natural candidate for such
late-decaying scalar fields. We find that a right amount of the wino/higgsino
dark matter with a mass of O(100) GeV is obtained for the saxion mass around
the weak scale and axion decay constant, F_A = O(10^{9-12}) GeV.
