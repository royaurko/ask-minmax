We discuss relationship between inflation and various models of production of
density inhomogeneities due to strings, global monopoles, textures and other
topological and non-topological defects. Neither of these models leads to a
consistent cosmological theory without the help of inflation. However, each of
these models can be incorporated into inflationary cosmology. We propose a
model of inflationary phase transitions, which, in addition to topological and
non-topological defects, may provide adiabatic density perturbations with a
sharp maximum between the galaxy scale $l_g$ and the horizon scale $l_H$.
