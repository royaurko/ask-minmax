The unitarity method for calculating one-loop amplitudes provides algorithms
of polynomial complexity. This is primarily beneficial for the computation of
multi-leg one loop amplitudes and it is therefore of great interest to develop
a numerical implementation of the unitarity method. We describe a
recently-developed, efficient, semi-numerical unitarity method for the
computation of the cut-constructible part of one-loop amplitudes.
