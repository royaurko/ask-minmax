We study the prospects for detecting gamma-rays from Dark Matter (DM)
annihilations in enhancements of the DM density (mini-spikes) around
intermediate-mass black holes with masses in the range $10^2 \lsim M / \msun
\lsim 10^6$. Focusing on two different IMBH formation scenarios, we show that,
for typical values of mass and cross section of common DM candidates,
mini-spikes, produced by the adiabatic growth of DM around pregalactic IMBHs,
would be bright sources of gamma-rays, which could be easily detected with
large field-of-view gamma-ray experiments such as GLAST, and further studied
with smaller field-of-view, larger-area experiments like Air Cherenkov
Telescopes CANGAROO, HESS, MAGIC and VERITAS. The detection of many gamma-ray
sources not associated with a luminous component of the Local Group, and with
identical cut-offs in their energy spectra at the mass of the DM particle,
would provide a potential smoking-gun signature of DM annihilations and shed
new light on the nature of intermediate and supermassive Black Holes.
