Ground level enhancements (GLEs) are relativistic sol particles measured at
ground level by a worldwide network of cosmic ray detectors. These sporadic
events are associated with solar flares and are assumed to be of a quasi-random
nature. Their study gives us information about their source and propagation
processes, about the maximum capacity of the sun as a particle accelerator
engine, about the magnetic structure of the medium traversed, etc. Space
vehicles may be damaged by this kind of radiation, as well as electric
transformers and gas pipes at high latitudes. As a result, their prediction has
turned out to be very important, but because of their random occurrence, up to
now few efforts to this end have been made. The results of these efforts have
been limited to possible warnings in real time, just before GLE occurrence, but
no specific dates have been predicted well enough in advance to prevent
possible hazards. In this study we show that, in spite of the quasi-stochastic
nature of GLEs, it is possible to predict them with relative precision, even
for future solar cycles. We reproduce previous GLE events and present results
for future events.
