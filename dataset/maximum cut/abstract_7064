Very recently the effect of equisized charged hard sphere solutes in a
mixture with core-softened fluid model on the structural and thermodynamic
anomalies of the system has been explored in detail by using Monte Carlo
simulations and integral equations theory [J. Chem. Phys., 2012, 137, 244502].
Our objective of the present short work is to complement this study by
considering univalent ions of unequal diameters in a mixture with the same
soft-core fluid model. Specifically, we are interested in the analysis of
changes of the temperature of maximum density (TMD) lines with ion
concentration for three model salt solutes, namely sodium chloride, potassium
chloride and rubidium chloride models. We resort to Monte Carlo simulations for
this purpose. Our discussion also involves the dependences of the pair
contribution to excess entropy and of constant volume heat capacity on the
temperature of maximum density line. Some examples of the microscopic structure
of mixtures in question in terms of pair distribution functions are given in
addition.
