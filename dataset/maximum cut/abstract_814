We extend the notion of star unfolding to be based on a quasigeodesic loop Q
rather than on a point. This gives a new general method to unfold the surface
of any convex polyhedron P to a simple (non-overlapping), planar polygon: cut
along one shortest path from each vertex of P to Q, and cut all but one segment
of Q.
