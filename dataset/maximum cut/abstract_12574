The density of accessible levels at low spin in the (^3He,\alpha \gamma)
reaction has been extracted for the ^{161,162}Dy and ^{171,172}Yb nuclei. The
entropy of the even-odd and even-even nuclei has been deduced as a function of
excitation energy, and found to reach a maximum of 15 k_B before neutron
evaporation. The entropy of one quasi-particle outside an even-even core is
found to be 1.70(15) k_B. This quasi-particle picture of hot nuclei is well
accounted for within a simple pairing model. The onset of two, four and six
quasi-particle excitations in the ^{162}Dy and ^{172}Yb nuclei is discussed and
compared to theory. The number of quasi-particles excited per excitation energy
is a measure for the ratio of the level energy spacing and the pairing
strength.
