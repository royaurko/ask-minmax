Taking into account the $SU(3)_f$ breaking effects, the strong coupling
constants of the $\pi$, $K$ and $\eta$ mesons with decuplet baryons are
calculated within light cone QCD sum rules method. It is shown that all
coupling constants, even in the case of $SU(3)_f$ breaking, are described in
terms of only one universal function. It is shown that for $\Xi^{\ast 0} \to
\Xi^{\ast 0} \eta $ transition violation of $SU(3)_f$ symmetry is very large
and for other channels when $SU(3)_f$ symmetry is violated, its maximum value
constitutes $10%\div15%$.
