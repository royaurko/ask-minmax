The dynamics of the jamming transition in a three-dimensional granular system
under vertical vibration is studied using diffusing-wave spectroscopy. When the
maximum acceleration of the external vibration is large, the granular system
behaves like a fluid, with the dynamic correlation function G(t) relaxing
rapidly. As the acceleration of vibration approaches the gravitational
acceleration g, the relaxation of G(t) slows down dramatically, and eventually
stops. Thus the system undergoes a phase transition and behaves like a solid.
Near the transition point, we find that the structural relaxation shows a
stretched exponential behavior. This behavior is analogous to the behavior of
supercooled liquids close to the glass transition.
