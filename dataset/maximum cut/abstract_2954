At lowest order in perturbation theory, the scattering matrix element for
Higgs boson production in association with dijets displays a strong correlation
in the azimuthal angle between the dijets, induced by the CP-properties of the
Higgs Boson coupling. However, the phase space cuts necessary for a clean
extraction of the CP-properties simultaneously induce large corrections from
emissions of hard radiation and thus formation of extra jets. The current study
concerns the generalization of CP-studies using the azimuthal angle between
dijets beyond tree-level and to events with more than just two jets. By
analyzing the High Energy Limit of hard scattering matrix elements we arrive at
a set of cuts optimized to enhance the correlation, while maintaining a large
cross section, and an observable, which is very stable against higher order
corrections. We contrast the description of Higgs boson production in
association with jets at different levels: for tree-level hjj and hjjj matrix
elements, for hjj matrix elements plus parton shower, and in a recent all-order
framework, which converges to the full, all-order perturbative result in the
limit of large invariant mass between all produced particles.
