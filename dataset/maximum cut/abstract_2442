In this paper a new saturation model is presented. This model is based on the
theoretical solution for the generating functional, and it is quite different
and not more complicated than the Glauber-like approach used before. The model
describes the structure function F_{2} of the proton, as well as the
diffractive structure function F_{2}^{D}. We show the difference between our
model, and the eikonal approach by calculating the multiplicity distribution,
using the AGK cutting rules strategy.
