We measure the angular 2-point correlation functions of galaxies in a volume
limited, photometrically selected galaxy sample from the fifth data release of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We split the sample both by luminosity and galaxy
type and use a halo-model analysis to find halo-occupation distributions that
can simultaneously model the clustering of all, early-, and late-type galaxies
in a given sample. Our results for the full galaxy sample are generally
consistent with previous results using the SDSS spectroscopic sample, taking
the differences between the median redshifts of the photometric and
spectroscopic samples into account. We find that our early- and late- type
measurements cannot be fit by a model that allows early- and late-type galaxies
to be well-mixed within halos. Instead, we introduce a new model that
segregates early- and late-type galaxies into separate halos to the maximum
allowed extent. We determine that, in all cases, it provides a good fit to our
data and thus provides a new statistical description of the manner in which
early- and late-type galaxies occupy halos.
