We have conducted extensive investigations on the magnetization and its
dynamical relaxation on a Ba$_{0.66}$K$_{0.32}$BiO$_{3+\delta}$ single crystal.
It is found that the magnetization relaxation rate is rather weak compared with
that in the cuprate superconductors, indicating a higher collective vortex
pinning potential (or activation energy), although the intrinsic pinning
potential $U_\mathrm{c}$ is weaker. Detailed analysis leads to the following
discoveries: (1) A second-peak effect on the magnetization-hysteresis-loop was
observed in a very wide temperature region, ranging from 2K to 24K. Its general
behavior looks like that in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$; (2) Associated with the second
peak effect, the magnetization relaxation rate is inversely related to the
transient superconducting current density $J_\mathrm{s}$ revealing a quite
general and similar mechanism for the second peak effect in many high
temperature superconductors; (3) A detailed analysis based on the collective
creep model reveals a large glassy exponent $\mu$ and a small intrinsic pinning
potential $U_\mathrm{c}$; (4) Investigation on the volume pinning force density
shows that the data can be scaled to the formula $F_{p}\propto b^p(1-b)^q$ with
$p=2.79$ and $q=3.14$, here $b$ is the reduced magnetic field to the
irreversible magnetic field. The maximum normalized pinning force density
appears near $b\approx0.47$. Finally, a vortex phase diagram is drawn for
showing the phase transitions or crossovers between different vortex phases.
