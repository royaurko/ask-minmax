An integer $n$ is called practical if every $m\le n$ can be written as a sum
of distinct divisors of $n$. We show that the number of practical numbers below
$x$ is asymptotic to $c x/\log x$, as conjectured by Margenstern. We also give
an asymptotic estimate for the number of integers below $x$ whose maximum ratio
of consecutive divisors is at most $t$, valid uniformly for $t\ge 2$.
