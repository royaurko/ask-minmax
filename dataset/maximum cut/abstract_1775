In this paper, we recast a special case of Mahler'c conjecture by the maximum
value of box splines. This is the case of polytopes with at most $2n+2$ facets.
An asymptotic formula for univariate box splines is given. Based on the
formula, Mahler's conjecture is proved in this case provided $n$ is big enough.
