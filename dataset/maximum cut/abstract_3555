There are $n$ queues, each with a single server. Customers arrive in a
Poisson process at rate $\lambda n$, where $0<\lambda<1$. Upon arrival each
customer selects $d\geq2$ servers uniformly at random, and joins the queue at a
least-loaded server among those chosen. Service times are independent
exponentially distributed random variables with mean 1. We show that the system
is rapidly mixing, and then investigate the maximum length of a queue in the
equilibrium distribution. We prove that with probability tending to 1 as
$n\to\infty$ the maximum queue length takes at most two values, which are
$\ln\ln n/\ln d+O(1)$.
