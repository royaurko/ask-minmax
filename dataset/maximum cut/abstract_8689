We study the upper mass bound of the lightest neutral Higgs scalar in the
NMSSM using the RGE analysis. We require the successful occurence of the
electroweak radiative symmetry breaking to restrict the parameter space. As a
result the upper mass bound $m_{h^0}$ is largely restricted compared with the
one estimated without imposing this condition. We point out some features of
$m_{h^0}$ related to the initial value of $h_t$ and discuss why the models with
more extra matters ${\bf 5}+\bar{\bf 5}$ of SU(5) could bring the larger
maximum value of $m_{h^0}$.
