We present results from an empirical study of the Mg II h & k emission lines
of selected Mira variable stars, using spectra from the International
Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE). The stars all exhibit similar Mg II behavior during
the course of their pulsation cycles. The Mg II flux always peaks after optical
maximum near pulsation phase 0.2-0.5, although the Mg II flux can vary greatly
from one cycle to the next. The lines are highly blueshifted, with the
magnitude of the blueshift decreasing with phase. The widths of the Mg II lines
are also phase-dependent, decreasing from about 70 km/s to 40 km/s between
phase 0.2 and 0.6. We also study other UV emission lines apparent in the IUE
spectra, most of them Fe II lines. These lines are much narrower and not nearly
as blueshifted as the Mg II lines. They exhibit the same phase-dependent flux
behavior as Mg II, but they do not show similar velocity or width variations.
