The thermodynamic and dynamical behavior of a gas of hard disks in a narrow
channel is studied theoretically and numerically. Using a virial expansion we
find that the pressure and collision frequency curves exhibit a singularity at
a channel width corresponding to twice the disk diameter. As expected, the
maximum Lyapunov exponent is also found to display a similar behavior. At high
density these curves are dominated by solid-like configurations which are
different from the bulk ones, due to the channel boundary conditions.
