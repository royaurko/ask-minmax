With the implementation of many ambitious observation projects, including
LAMOST, FAST, and Antarctic observatory at Doom A, observational astronomy in
China is stepping into a brand new era with emerging data avalanche. In the era
of e-Science, both these cutting-edge projects and traditional astronomy
research need much more powerful data management, sharing and interoperability.
Based on data-grid concept, taking advantages of the IVOA interoperability
technologies, China-VO is developing a VO-driven astronomical data grid
environment to enable multi-wavelength science and large database science. In
the paper, latest progress and data flow of the LAMOST, architecture of the
data grid, and its supports to the VO are discussed.
