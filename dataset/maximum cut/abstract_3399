The feasibility of observing the C18O (3-2) spectral line in cold clouds with
the APEX telescope has been tested. As the line at 329.330 GHz lies in the wing
of a strong atmospheric H2O absorption it can be observed only at high altitude
observatories. Using the three lowest rotational levels instead of only two
helps to narrow down the physical properties of dark clouds and globules. The
centres of two C18O maxima in the high latitude low mass star forming region CG
12 were mapped in C18O (3-2) and the data were analyzed together with spectral
line data from the SEST. The T_MB(3-2)/T_MB(2-1) ratio in the northern C18O
maximum, CG 12 N, is 0.8, and in the southern maximum, CG 12 S, ~2. CG 12 N is
modelled as a 120'' diameter (0.4pc) cold core with a mass of 27 Msun. A small
size maximum with a narrow, 0.8 kms-1, C18O (3-2) spectral line with a peak
temperature of T_MB ~11 K was detected in CG 12 S. This maximum is modelled as
a 60'' to 80'' diameter (~0.2pc) hot (80 K < Tex < 200 K) ~1.6 Msun clump. The
source lies on the axis of a highly collimated bipolar molecular outflow near
its driving source. This is the first detection of such a compact, warm object
in a low mass star forming region.
