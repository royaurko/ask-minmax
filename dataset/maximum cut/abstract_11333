We use all COMPTEL data from the beginning of the CGRO mission (April '91) up
to the end of CGRO Cycle 6 (November '97) to carry out all-sky point source
analyses in the four standard COMPTEL energy bands for different time periods.
We apply our standard maximum-likelihood method to generate all-sky
significance and flux maps for point sources by subtracting off the diffuse
emission components via model fitting. In addition, fluxes of known sources
have been determined for individual CGRO Phases/Cycles to generate lightcurves
with a time resolution of the order of one year. The goal of the analysis is to
derive quantitative results -- significances, fluxes, light curves -- of our
brightest and most significant sources such as 3C 273, and to search for
additional new COMPTEL sources, showing up in time-averaged maps only.
