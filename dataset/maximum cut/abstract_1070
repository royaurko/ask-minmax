In this paper, using the gluing formula of Gromov-Witten invariants under
symplectic cutting, due to Li and Ruan, we studied the Gromov-Witten invariants
of blow-ups at a smooth point or along a smooth curve. We established some
relations between Gromov-Witten invariants of M and its blow-ups at a smooth
point or along a smooth curve.
