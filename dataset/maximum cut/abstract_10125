From first principles calculations we unravel surprisingly strong
interactions between arsenic ions in iron-pnictides, the strength of which is
controlled by the Fe-spin state. Reducing the Fe-magnetic moment, weakens the
Fe-As bonding, and in turn, increases As-As interactions, causing giant
reduction in the c-axis. For CaFe$_2$As$_2$ system, this reduction is as large
as 1.4 \AA. Since the large c-reduction has been recently observed only under
high-pressure\cite{cTphase}, our results suggest that the iron magnetic moment
should be present in Fe-pnictides at all times at ambient pressure. Finally,
the conventional electron-phonon coupling in the collapsed phase of
CaFe$_2$As$_2$ gives a maximum $T_c$ of 0.6 K and can not explain the $\sim12$
K superconductivity observed in some experiments. Implications of these
findings on the mechanism of superconductivity in iron-pnictides are discussed.
