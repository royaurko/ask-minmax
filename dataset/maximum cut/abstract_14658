We study AGN emission line profiles combining an improved version of the
accretion disc-wind model of Murray & Chiang with the magneto-hydrodynamic
model of Emmering et al. We show how the shape, broadening and shift of the C
IV line depend not only on the viewing angle to the object but also on the wind
launching angle, especially for small launching angles. We have compared the
dispersions in our model C IV linewidth distributions to observational upper
limit on that dispersion, considering both smooth and clumpy torus models. As
the torus half-opening angle (measured from the polar axis) increases above
about 18? degrees, increasingly larger wind launching angles are required to
match the observational constraints. Above a half-opening angle of about 47?
degrees, no wind launch angle (within the maximum allowed by the MHD solutions)
can match the observations. Considering a model that replaces the torus by a
warped disc yields the same constraints obtained with the two other models.
