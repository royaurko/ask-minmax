Josephson current between two d-wave superconductors is calculated by using a
lattice model. Here we consider two types of junctions, $i.e.$, the parallel
junction and the mirror-type junction. The maximum Josephson current $(J_{c})$
shows a wide variety of temperature ($T$) dependence depending on the
misorientation angles and the types of junctions. When the misorientation
angles are not zero, the Josephson current shows the low-temperature anomaly
because of a zero energy state (ZES) at the interfaces. In the case of
mirror-type junctions, $J_c$ has a non monotonic temperature dependence. These
results are consistent with the previous results based on the quasiclassical
theory. [Y. Tanaka and S. Kashiwaya: Phys. Rev. B \textbf{56} (1997) 892.] On
the other hand, we find that the ZES disappears in several junctions because of
the Freidel oscillations of the wave function, which is peculiar to the lattice
model. In such junctions, the temperature dependence of $J_{c}$ is close to the
Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation.
