We introduce an approximate search algorithm for fast maximum a posteriori
probability estimation in probabilistic programs, which we call Bayesian ascent
Monte Carlo (BaMC). Probabilistic programs represent probabilistic models with
varying number of mutually dependent finite, countable, and continuous random
variables. BaMC is an anytime MAP search algorithm applicable to any
combination of random variables and dependencies. We compare BaMC to other MAP
estimation algorithms and show that BaMC is faster and more robust on a range
of probabilistic models.
