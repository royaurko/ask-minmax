To further study the "pygmy" resonance phenomena in the photon strength
function, we reanalyzed the two-step cascade data for the target nucleus
$^{197}$Au using the Dubna group approach.
  The range of obtained values allows for meaningful conclusions: the level
density at low excitation energy shows a step-like behavior; the electric
dipole photon strength function has a broad maximum around $E_{\gamma}=5$ MeV
and is not typical of a "pygmy" resonance; the level density below $B_{n}$ also
demonstrates step-like behavior.
