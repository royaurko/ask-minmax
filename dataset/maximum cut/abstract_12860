I show that fractional exclusion statistics (FES) is manifested in general
interacting systems and I calculate the exclusion statistics parameters. Most
importantly, I show that the mutual exclusion statistics parameters--when the
presence of particles in one Hilbert space influences the dimension of another
Hilbert space--are proportional to the dimension of the Hilbert space on which
they act. This result, although surprising and different from the usual way of
understanding the FES, renders this statistics consistent and valid in the
thermodynamic limit, in accordance with the conjucture introduced in J. Phys.
