The data of inelastic 16O+16O scattering to the lowest 2+ and 3- excited
states of 16O have been measured at Elab = 250, 350, 480, 704 and 1120 MeV and
analyzed consistently in the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA), using
the semi- microscopic optical potentials and inelastic form factors given by
the folding model, to reveal possible refractive structure of the nuclear
rainbow that was identified earlier in the elastic 16O+16O scattering channel
at the same energies. Given the known transition strengths of the 2+ and 3-
states of 16O well determined from the (e,e') data, the DWBA description of the
inelastic data over the whole angular range was possible only if the absorption
in the exit channels is significantly increased (especially, for the
16O+16O(2+) exit channel). Although the refractive pattern of the inelastic
16O+16O scattering was found to be less pronounced compared to that observed in
the elastic scattering channel, a clear remnant of the main rainbow maximum
could still be seen in the inelastic cross section at Elab = 350 - 704 MeV.
