We explicitly demonstrate that the known solutions for expanding impulsive
spherical gravitational waves that have been obtained by a "cut and paste"
method may be considered to be impulsive limits of the Robinson-Trautman vacuum
type N solutions. We extend these results to all the generically distinct
subclasses of these solutions in Minkowski, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter
backgrounds. For these we express the solutions in terms of a continuous
metric. Finally, we also extend the class of spherical shock gravitational
waves to include a non-zero cosmological constant.
