A new linac using superconducting quarter-wave resonators (QWR) is under
construction at CERN in the framework of the HIE-ISOLDE project. The QWRs are
made of niobium sputtered on a bulk copper substrate. The working frequency at
4.5 K is 101.28 MHz and they will provide 6 MV/m accelerating gradient on the
beam axis with a total maximum power dissipation of 10 W on cavity walls. A
tuning system is required in order to both minimize the forward power variation
in beam operation and to compensate the unavoidable uncertainties in the
frequency shift during the cool-down process. The tuning system has to fulfil a
complex combination of RF, structural and thermal requirements. The paper
presents the functional specifications and details the tuning system RF and
mechanical design and simulations. The results of the tests performed on a
prototype system are discussed and the industrialization strategy is presented
in view of final production.
