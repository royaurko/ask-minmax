We investigated the magnetotransport properties of high-mobility InAs/GaSb
antidot lattices. In addition to the usual commensurability features at low
magnetic field we found a broad maximum of classical origin around 2.5 T. The
latter can be ascribed to a class of rosetta type orbits encircling a single
antidot. This is shown by both a simple transport calculation based on a
classical Kubo formula and an analysis of the Poincare surface of section at
different magnetic field values. At low temperatures we observe weak
1/B-periodic oscillations superimposed on the classical maximum.
