Kernel-based estimators are often evaluated at multiple bandwidths as a form
of sensitivity analysis. However, if in the reported results, a researcher
selects the bandwidth based on this analysis, the associated confidence
intervals may not have correct coverage, even if the estimator is unbiased.
This paper proposes a simple adjustment that gives correct coverage in such
situations: replace the Normal quantile with a critical value that depends only
on the kernel and ratio of the maximum and minimum bandwidths the researcher
has entertained. We tabulate these critical values and quantify the loss in
coverage for conventional confidence intervals. For a range of relevant cases,
a conventional 95% confidence interval has coverage between 70% and 90%, and
our adjustment amounts to replacing the conventional critical value 1.96 with a
number between 2.2 and 2.8. A Monte Carlo study confirms that our approach
gives accurate coverage in finite samples. We illustrate our approach with two
empirical applications.
