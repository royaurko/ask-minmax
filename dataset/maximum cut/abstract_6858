Simultaneous high pressure x-ray diffraction and electrical resistance
measurements have been carried out on a PbO type {\alpha}-FeSe0.92 compound to
a pressure of 44 GPa and temperatures down to 4 K using designer diamond anvils
at synchrotron source. At ambient temperature, a structural phase transition
from a tetragonal (P4/nmm) phase to an orthorhombic (Pbnm) phase is observed at
11 GPa and the Pbnm phase persists up to 74 GPa. The superconducting transition
temperature (TC) increases rapidly with pressure reaching a maximum of ~28 K at
~ 6 GPa and decreases at higher pressures, disappearing completely at 14.6 GPa.
Simultaneous pressure-dependent x-ray diffraction and resistance measurements
at low temperatures show superconductivity only in a low pressure orthorhombic
(Cmma) phase of the {\alpha}-FeSe0.92. Upon increasing pressure at 10 K near
TC, crystalline phases change from a mixture of orthorhombic (Cmma) and
hexagonal (P63/mmc) to a high pressure orthorhombic (Pbnm) phase near 6.4 GPa
where TC is maximum.
