The ability to predict the future behavior of solar activity has become of
extreme importance due to its effect on the near Earth environment. Predictions
of both the amplitude and timing of the next solar cycle will assist in
estimating the various consequences of Space Weather. The level of solar
activity is usually expressed by international sunspot number ($R_z$). Several
prediction techniques have been applied and have achieved varying degrees of
success in the domain of solar activity prediction. In this paper, we predict a
solar index ($R_z$) in solar cycle 24 by using the neural network method. The
neural network technique is used to analyze the time series of solar activity.
According to our predictions of yearly sunspot number, the maximum of cycle 24
will occur in the year 2013 and will have an annual mean sunspot number of 65.
Finally, we discuss our results in order to compare it with other suggested
predictions.
