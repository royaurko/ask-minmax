I give a brief review of how X-rays from nearby galaxies are used as direct
tracers of recent star formation. This leads to the conclusion that it is the
most luminous point-like sources that are associated with star formation and
that the majority of these are high-mass X-ray binaries.I then discuss a recent
study that shows that ULXs are preferentially found in regions as young as or
younger than typical HII regions in their host galaxies. Finally, I describe a
new study that attempts to determine the maximum luminosity of ULXs in the
local universe by searching for them in interacting galaxies where the star
formation rate is high.
