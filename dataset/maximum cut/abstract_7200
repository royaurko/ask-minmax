Urban systems present hierarchical structures at many different scales. These
are observed as administrative regional delimitations, which are the outcome of
geographical, political and historical constraints. Using percolation theory on
the street intersections and on the road network of Britain, we obtain
hierarchies at different scales that are independent of administrative
arrangements. Natural boundaries, such as islands and National Parks,
consistently emerge at the largest/regional scales. Cities are devised through
recursive percolations on each of the emerging clusters, but the system does
not undergo a phase transition at the distance threshold at which cities can be
defined. This specific distance is obtained by computing the fractal dimension
of the clusters extracted at each distance threshold. We observe that the
fractal dimension presents a maximum over all the different distance
thresholds. The clusters obtained at this maximum are in very good
correspondence to the morphological definition of cities given by satellite
images, and by other methods previously developed by the contributors (Arcaute et
al. 2015).
