We address the long-standing unresolved problem concerning the V-parameter in
a photonic crystal fiber (PCF). Formulate the parameter appropriate for a
core-defect in a periodic structure we argue that the multi-mode cut-off occurs
at a wavelength lambda* which satisfies V_PCF(lambda*)=pi. Comparing to
numerics and recent cut-off calculations we confirm this result.
