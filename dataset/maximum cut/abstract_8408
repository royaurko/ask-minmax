Self-consistent calculation of spin (charge) density wave order (SDW/CDW)
parameters have been performed for bilayered cuprates on the basis of a singlet
correlated band model. Evolution of the Fermi surface in the strongly
underdoped regime is described by using a two-band approach. The smooth
development of the pseudogap formation temperature is explained from underdoped
to overdoped states and the Fourier amplitudes <s_q> (spin) and <e_q> (charge)
modulations have been calculated. We have found a maximum of the
incommensurability for doping 0.09-0.11 holes per copper site.
