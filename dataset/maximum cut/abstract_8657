In order to enhance our understanding of spectral functions in lattice QCD
obtained with the help of the Maximum Entropy Method, we study meson spectral
functions for lattice fermions with chiral symmetry. In particular we analyse
lattice artefacts for standard overlap, overlap hypercube and domain wall
fermions in the free field limit. We also present first results for
pseudoscalar spectral functions in dynamical QCD with 2+1 flavours of domain
wall fermions, using data generated by the UKQCD and RBC collaborations on
QCDOC machines.
