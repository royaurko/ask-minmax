The radiative and jet efficiencies of thin magnetized accretion disks around
black holes (BHs) are affected by BH spin and the presence of a magnetic field
that, when strong, could lead to large deviations from Novikov-Thorne (NT) thin
disk theory. To seek the maximum deviations, we perform general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of radiatively efficient thin
(half-height $H$ to radius $R$ of $H/R\approx 0.10$) disks around moderately
rotating BHs with $a/M=0.5$. First, our simulations, evolved for $108,000r_g/c$
(gravitational radius $r_g$ and speed of light $c$), show that large-scale
magnetic field readily accretes inward even through our thin disk and builds-up
to the magnetically-arrested disk (MAD) state. Second, our simulations of thin
MADs show the disk achieves a radiative efficiency of $\eta_{\rm r}\approx
15\%$ (after estimating photon capture), which is about twice the NT value of
$\eta_{\rm r}\sim 8\%$ for $a/M=0.5$ and gives the same luminosity as a NT disk
with $a/M\approx 0.9$. Compared to prior simulations with $\lesssim 10\%$
deviations, our result of an $\approx 80\%$ deviation sets a new benchmark.
This is important as our scaling laws suggest that observed jet quenching in
the high-soft state in BH X-ray binaries is consistent with an ever-present MAD
state.
