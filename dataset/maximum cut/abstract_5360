We investigate the scope of the LHC in probing the parameter space of a
4-site model supplemented by one composite Higgs state, assuming all past,
current and future energy and luminosity stages of the CERN machine. We
concentrate on the yield of charged di-boson production giving two
opposite-charge different-flavour leptons and missing (transverse) energy,
i.e., events induced via the subprocess $q\bar q\to e^+\nu_e \mu^-\bar\nu_\mu$
+ ${\rm{c.c.}}$, which enables the production in the intermediate step of all
additional neutral and charged gauge bosons belonging to the spectrum of this
model, some of which in resonant topologies. We find this channel accessible
over the background at all LHC configurations after a dedicated cut-based
analysis. We finally compare the yield of the di-boson mode to that of
Drell-Yan processes and establish that they have complementary strengths, one
covering regions of parameter space precluded to the others and vice versa.
