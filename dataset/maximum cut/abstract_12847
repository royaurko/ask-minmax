The laser-driven acceleration of high quality proton beams from a
double-layer target, comprised of a high-Z ion layer and a thin disk of
hydrogen, is investigated with three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations
in the case of oblique incidence of a laser pulse. It is shown that the proton
beam energy reaches its maximum at a certain incidence angle of the laser
pulse, where it can be much greater than the energy at normal incidence. The
proton beam propagates at some angle with respect to the target surface normal,
as determined by the proton energy and the incidence angle.
