In this paper, results are presented on studies which have been performed to
investigate the impact of the cut-off elevation angle (CEA) and
elevation-dependent weighting (EDW) on the EOP estimates and baseline length
repeatability. For this test, CONT05 observations were processed with different
CEA and EDW, keeping all other options the same as used during the routine
processing. Uncertainties and biases, as well as correlations between estimated
parameters have been investigated. It has been shown that small CEA, up to
about 8--10 degrees does not have large impact on the results, and applying EDW
allows us to get better result (smaller errors). However, this result has been
proven with standard geodetic VLBI observations, where rather few observations
were made at low elevations. Perhaps, special R&D sessions with more uniform
distribution of observations over elevation may be useful for more detailed
study on the subject.
