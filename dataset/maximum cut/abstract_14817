Dramatic increases in the size and dimensionality of many recent data sets
make crucial the need for sophisticated methods that can exploit inherent
structure and handle missing values. In this article we derive an
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for the matrix normal distribution, a
distribution well-suited for naturally structured data such as spatio-temporal
data. We review previously established maximum likelihood matrix normal
estimates, and then consider the situation involving missing data. We apply our
EM method in a simulation study exploring errors across different dimensions
and proportions of missing data. We compare these errors and computational
running times to those from two alternative methods. Finally, we implement the
proposed EM method on a satellite image dataset to investigate land-cover
classification separability.
