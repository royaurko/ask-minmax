We study theoretically the equilibrium structure, as well as the response
under external load, of characteristic carbon-based materials. The materials
considered include diamond, amorphous carbon (a-C), ``amorphous diamond'' and
nanocomposite amorphous carbon (na-C). A universal bulk-modulus versus density
curve is obeyed by all structures we consider. We calculate the dependence of
elastic constants on the density. The strength of a-C was found to increase in
roughly a linear manner, with increasing concentration of four-fold atoms, with
the maximum stress of the strongest a-C sample being about half that of
diamond. The response of na-C to external load is essentially identical to the
response of the embedding a-C matrix.
