We have obtained daily high resolution Echelle spectroscopy of Nova Oph 2015
during its initial evolution. It reveals the presence of pre-existing
circumstellar material around the nova, which is best interpreted as the wind
of an evolved companion. On earliest observations, the emission line profiles
of Nova Oph 2015 displayed a very narrow emission component (FWHM~60 km/s),
recombining over a time scale of 5 days and showing constant low velocity
(RV_sun= -4.5 km/s), that we interpret as coming from the wind of the secondary
recombining after the ionization from the initial UV-flash of the nova. The
underlying broad component underwent a marked reduction in both FWHM and width
at zero intensity (the latter declining from 4000 to 2000 km/s in ten days)
while increasing by 6 times in flux, that we believe is the result of the high
velocity ejecta of the nova being slowed down while trying to expand within the
surrounding wind of the companion. Novae with evolved secondaries are very rare
in the Galaxy, amounting 3% of the total according to recent estimates. Among
them Nova Oph 2015 is perhaps unique in having displayed a long rise to maximum
brightness and a slow decline from it, a FeII-type classification (contrary to
prevailing He/N) and a probable sub-giant luminosity class for the secondary
(instead of the giant (e.g. RS Oph) or supergiant (e.g. V407 Cyg) class for the
others).
