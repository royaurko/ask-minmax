Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a communication paradigm that emphasizes
content distribution. Named-Data Networking (NDN) is an instantiation of CCN, a
candidate Future Internet Architecture. NDN supports human-readable content
naming and router-based content caching which lends itself to efficient,
secure, and scalable content distribution. Because of NDN's fundamental
requirement that each content object must be signed by its producer,
fragmentation has been considered incompatible with NDN since it precludes
authentication of individual content fragments by routers. The alternative is
to perform hop-by-hop reassembly, which incurs prohibitive delays. In this
paper, we show that secure and efficient content fragmentation is both possible
and even advantageous in NDN and similar content-centric network architectures
that involve signed content. We design a concrete technique that facilitates
efficient and secure content fragmentation in NDN, discuss its security
guarantees and assess performance. We also describe a prototype implementation
and compare performance of cut-through with hop-by-hop fragmentation and
reassembly.
