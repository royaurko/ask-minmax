Recent progress in the theoretical description of inclusive B to X_u l nu
decays in the shape-function region is reported. Finite moments of the shape
function are related to HQET parameters. Event fractions for several
experimental cuts are presented, with a particular emphasis on the hadronic
variable P+. The aim of this talk is to introduce the P+ spectrum, to compare
it to the hadronic invariant mass spectrum and the charged-lepton energy
spectrum, and to study the prospect of evaluating |Vub| in the presence of a
large background from B to X_c decays.
