A new formulation of special relativity is described. It is based on a
postulate that the universe is a vast Cellular Automata (CA). We show that any
CA model automatically leads to a maximum speed limit for the transfer of
information from place to place in CA space, and hence leads to strict physical
locality of all physical interactions. Furthermore, we show that the Lorentz
transformation follows mathematically from CA theory, where photon propagation
is postulated to be the simply shifting of the photon information pattern from
cell to adjacent cell in every CA 'clock cycle' (which incidently is simplest
possible CA 'motion'). Minkowski 4D flat space-time of special relativity can
be seen as the direct consequence of the low level universal CA processes, seen
by inertial observers with ordinary measuring instruments, and who are not
aware of, and cannot measure with the true absolute units of CA space and time.
