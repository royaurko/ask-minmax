Motivated by the recent suggestion of anisotropic effective exchange
interactions between Mn spins in Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$As (arising as a result of
spin-orbit coupling), we study their effects in diluted Heisenberg spin
systems. We perform Monte Carlo simulations on several phenomenological model
spin Hamiltonians, and investigate the extent to which frustration induced by
anisotropic exchanges can reduce the low temperature magnetization in these
models and the interplay of this effect with disorder in the exchange. In a
model with low coordination number and purely ferromagnetic (FM) exchanges, we
find that the low temperature magnetization is gradually reduced as exchange
anisotropy is turned on. However, as the connectivity of the model is
increased, the effect of small-to-moderate anisotropy is suppressed, and the
magnetization regains its maximum saturation value at low temperatures unless
the distribution of exchanges is very wide. To obtain significant suppression
of the low temperature magnetization in a model with high connectivity, as is
found for long-range interactions, we find it necessary to have both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchanges (e.g. as in the RKKY
interaction). This implies that disorder in the sign of the exchange
interaction is much more effective in suppressing magnetization at low
temperatures than exchange anisotropy.
