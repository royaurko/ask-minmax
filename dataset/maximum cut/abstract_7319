Absorption or emission against the cosmic microwave background radiation
(CMB) may be observed in the redshifted 21cm line if the spin temperature of
the neutral intergalactic medium prior to reionization differs from the CMB
temperature. This so-called 21cm tomography should reveal important information
on the physical state of the intergalactic medium at high redshifts. The
fluctuations in the redshifted 21 cm, due to gas density inhomogeneities at
early times, should be observed at meter wavelengths by the next generation
radio telescopes such as the proposed {\it Square Kilometer Array (SKA)}. Here
we show that the extra-galactic radio sources provide a serious contamination
to the brightness temperature fluctuations expected in the redshifted 21 cm
emission from the IGM at high redshifts. Unless the radio source population
cuts off at flux levels above the planned sensitivity of SKA, its clustering
noise component will dominate the angular fluctuations in the 21 cm signal. The
integrated foreground signal is smooth in frequency space and it should
nonetheless be possible to identify the sharp spectral feature arising from the
non-uniformities in the neutral hydrogen density during the epoch when the
first UV sources reionize the intergalactic medium.
