We prove tail estimates for variables $\sum_i f(X_i)$, where $(X_i)_i$ is the
trajectory of a random walk on an undirected graph (or, equivalently, a
reversible Markov chain). The estimates are in terms of the maximum of the
function $f$, its variance, and the spectrum of the graph. Our proofs are more
elementary than other proofs in the literature, and our results are sharper. We
obtain Bernstein and Bennett-type inequalities, as well as an inequality for
subgaussian variables.
