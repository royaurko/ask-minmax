We review recent NLO QCD results for W,Z + 3-jet production at hadron
colliders, computed using BlackHat and SHERPA. We also include some new results
for Z + 3-jet production at the LHC at 7 TeV. We report new progress towards
the NLO cross section for W + 4-jet production. In particular, we show that the
virtual matrix elements produced by BlackHat are numerically stable. We also
show that with an improved integrator and tree-level matrix elements from
BlackHat, SHERPA produces well-behaved real-emission contributions. As an
illustration, we present the real-emission contributions -- including
dipole-subtraction terms -- to the p_T distribution of the fourth jet, for a
single subprocess with the maximum number of gluons.
