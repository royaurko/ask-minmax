The electrostatics of 2D system with complicated inner boundary is studied.
The object which we call "monster" is built by an iterative process of multiple
conformal mapping of the circle exterior. The procedure leads to the figures
built from circle with branching curved cuts (i), to the multiple tangential
near-round circles (ii) and the Mandelbrot map (iii). The polarizability of a
monster in the homogeneous external field is found. The light scattering
cross-section was expressed through the polarizability of a monster.
