Among the important issues in identifying the progenitor system of Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia), we focus mostly on circumstellar interaction in SN 2002ic,
and give brief discussion on the controversial issues of the effects of
rotation in merging double degenerates and steady hydrogen shell burning in
accreting white dwarfs.
  SN 2002ic is a unique supernova which shows the typical spectral features of
SNe Ia near maximum light, but also apparent hydrogen features that have been
absent in SNe Ia. Based on the hydrodynamical models of circumstellar
interaction in SN Ia, we suggest that circumstellar medium is aspherical (or
highly clumpy) and contains ~1.3 Msun. Possible progenitor systems of SN 2002ic
are discussed.
