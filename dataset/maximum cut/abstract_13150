We investigate a two-species Fermi gas with a large mass ratio interacting by
an interspecies short-range interaction. Using the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation, we determine the interaction energy of two heavy fermions
immersed in the Fermi sea of light fermions as a function of the s-wave
scattering length. In the BCS limit, we recover the perturbative calculation of
the effective interaction between heavy fermions. The p-wave projection of the
effective interaction is attractive in the BCS limit while it turns out to be
repulsive near the unitarity limit. We find that the p-wave attraction reaches
its maximum between the BCS and unitarity limits, where the maximal p-wave
pairing of heavy minority fermions is expected. We also investigate the case
where the heavy fermions are confined in two dimensions and the p-wave
attraction between them is found to be stronger than that in three dimensions.
