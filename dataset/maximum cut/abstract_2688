We present results for the QCD production of Z/{\gamma} + 2 jets matched with
parton showers using the POWHEG method. Some technicalities relevant for the
merging of NLO corrections for this process with parton showers are discussed,
and results for typical distributions are shown, in presence of different sets
of cuts. A comparison with ATLAS data is also presented, and good agreement is
found.
