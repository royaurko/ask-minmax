Measurements of the longitudinal spin cross section asymmetry for deep
inelastic muon-nucleon interactions with two high transverse momentum hadrons
($p_T >$ 0.7 GeV) in the final state are presented for SMC data for polarized
proton and deuteron and for data on polarized deuteron from COMPASS taken in
2002 and 2003. The muon asymmetries determined with a cut on $Q^2>$ 1 GeV$^2$
in SMC are: $A_p = 0.03 \pm 0.057\pm 0.01$ and $A_d = 0.070 \pm 0.076 \pm
0.010$, respectively. From these values a gluon polarization $\Delta G /G =
-0.20\pm 0.28\pm 0.10$ was obtained at an average fraction of nucleon momentum
carried by gluons $\eta = 0.07$. The measured asymmetry (with cut on $Q^2>$ 1
GeV$^2$) in COMPASS is $(A_d/D) = -0.015 \pm 0.08 \pm 0.013$ where D is
depolarization factor and the gluon polarization $\Delta G /G = 0.06\pm 0.31\pm
