Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has become a powerful tool in the
study of the electronic structure of condensed matter. Although the linewidths
of many RIXS features are narrow, the experimental broadening can often hamper
the identification of spectral features. Here, we show that the Maximum Entropy
technique can successfully be applied in the deconvolution of RIXS spectra,
improving the interpretation of the loss features without a severe increase in
the noise ratio.
