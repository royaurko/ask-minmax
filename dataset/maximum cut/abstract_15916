Data of the 1996 outburst of the single-known accreting millisecond pulsar
SAX J1808.4-3658, taken with the Wide Field Cameras (WFCs) on BeppoSAX, are
revisited with more complete data coverage and more comprehensive analysis
techniques than in a previous report. An additional type-I X-ray burst was
identified which occurred at a time when the persistent emission is below the
detection limit, roughly 30 days after outburst maximum. This burst is three
times longer than the first two bursts, and 50% brighter. It is the brightest
burst within the ~1700 type-I bursts detected so far with the WFCs. A spectral
analysis of the data reveals a distance to SAX J1808.4-3658 of ~2.5 kpc. This
is an update from a previously reported value of 4 kpc. We present the evidence
that we have for the presence of oscillations at the pulsar frequency during
part of the newly found burst. Such an oscillation would lend support to the
idea that the frequency of millisecond burst oscillations in other objects is
very close to the neutron star rotation frequency.
