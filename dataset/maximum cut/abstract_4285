In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s} >$ 20 (120)
A$\cdot$GeV a copious production of charm (bottom) production sets in which,
via correlated semileptonic $D \bar D$ ($B \bar B$) decays, gives rise to a
dilepton yield at invariant mass $M \approx$ 2 -- 3 GeV in excess of the
Drell-Yan yield and the thermal dilepton signal from deconfined matter as well.
We show that appropriate single-electron transverse momentum cuts (suitable for
ALICE at LHC) cause a threshold like behavior of the dilepton spectra from
heavy-quark meson decays and the Drell-Yan process and can allow to observe a
thermal dilepton signal from hot deconfined matter.
