The dependence of the number of extensive air showers (EAS) on the zenith
angle is obtained in groups with a constant solid-angle step with different
election types at separations between stations of 500 and 1000 m by using the
Yakutsk EAS array data. A bend point is formed at the zenith angle
approximately of 50 deg. This point shifts with the increasing energy in the
direction corresponding to the shift of the cascade-curve maximum depth with
the variation of energy. The boundaries of change of these dependences obtained
separately at the distances between stations of 500 and 1000 m are different
that may be caused by the uncertainty of the lateral distribution function
(LDF) used. Thereby, energies of showers detected by the stations with a
different separation are not joined.
