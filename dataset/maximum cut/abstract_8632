We present a measurement of the branching fraction and time-dependent CP
asymmetry of B^0 to rho^0 K^0. The results are obtained from a data sample of
227 10^6 Y4S to BB_ decays collected with the BaBar detector at the PEP2
asymmetric-energy B Factory at SLAC. From a time-dependent maximum likelihood
fit yielding 111+/-19 signal events we find B(B^0 to rho^0
K^0)=(4.9+/-0.8+/-0.9) 10^-6, where the first error is statistical and the
second systematic. We report the measurement of the CP parameters
S=0.20+/-0.52+/-0.24 and C=0.64+/-0.41+/-0.20.
