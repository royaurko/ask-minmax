A set $X$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is called a {\em clique cut} of $G$ if
the subgraph of $G$ induced by $X$ is a complete graph and the number of
connected components of $G-X$ is greater than that of $G$. A clique cut $X$ of
$G$ is called a {\em chordal cut} of $G$ if there exists a union $U$ of
connected components of $G-X$ such that $G[U \cup X]$ is a chordal graph.
  In this paper, we consider the following problem: Given a graph $G$, does the
graph have a chordal cut? We show that $K_{2,2,2}$-free hole-edge-disjoint
graphs have chordal cuts if they satisfy a certain condition.
