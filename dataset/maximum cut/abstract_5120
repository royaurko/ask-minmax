A novel bipolar transistor structure, namely, a SiC emitter lateral NPM
Schottky collector bipolar transistor (SCBT) with a silicon-on-insulator (SOI)
substrate is explored using two-dimensional (2-D) simulation. A comprehensive
comparison of the proposed structure with its equivalent Si lateral NPN BJT and
an SiC emitter lateral NPN HBT is presented. Based on simulation results, the
contributors demonstrate for the first time that the proposed SiC emitter lateral
NPM transistor shows superior performance in terms of high current gain and
cut-off frequency, reduced collector resistance, negligible reverse recovery
time and suppressed Kirk effect over its equivalent Si lateral NPN BJT and SiC
emitter lateral NPN HBT. A simple fabrication process compatible with BiCMOS
technology is also discussed.
