A bijection is given between fixed point free involutions of $\{1,2,...,2N\}$
with maximum decreasing subsequence size $2p$ and two classes of vicious
(non-intersecting) random walker configurations confined to the half line
lattice points $l \ge 1$. In one class of walker configurations the maximum
displacement of the right most walker is $p$. Because the scaled distribution
of the maximum decreasing subsequence size is known to be in the soft edge GOE
(random real symmetric matrices) universality class, the same holds true for
the scaled distribution of the maximum displacement of the right most walker.
