Using a combination of Keck spectroscopy and near-infrared imaging, we
investigate the K-band and stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation for 101 disk
galaxies at 0.2 < z < 1.2, with the goal of placing the first observational
constraints on the assembly history of halo and stellar mass. Our main result
is a lack of evolution in either the K-band or stellar mass Tully-Fisher
relation from z = 0 - 1.2. Furthermore, although our sample is not
statistically complete, we consider it suitable for an initial investigation of
how the fraction of total mass that has condensed into stars is distributed
with both redshift and total halo mass. We calculate stellar masses from
optical and near-infrared photometry and total masses from maximum rotational
velocities and disk scale lengths, utilizing a range of model relationships
derived analytically and from simulations. We find that the stellar/total mass
distribution and stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation for z > 0.7 disks is
similar to that at lower redshift, suggesting that baryonic mass is accreted by
disks along with dark matter at z < 1, and that disk galaxy formation at z < 1
is hierarchical in nature. We briefly discuss the evolutionary trends expected
in conventional structure formation models and the implications of extending
such a study to much larger samples.
