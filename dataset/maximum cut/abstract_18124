The jamming and percolation for two generalized models of random sequential
adsorption (RSA) of linear $k$-mers (particles occupying $k$ adjacent sites) on
a square lattice are studied by means of Monte Carlo simulation. The classical
random sequential adsorption (RSA) model assumes the absence of overlapping of
the new incoming particle with the previously deposited ones. The first model
LK$_d$ is a generalized variant of the RSA model for both $k$-mers and a
lattice with defects. Some of the occupying $k$ adjacent sites are considered
as insulating and some of the lattice sites are occupied by defects
(impurities). For this model even a small concentration of defects can inhibit
percolation for relatively long $k$-mers. The second model is the cooperative
sequential adsorption (CSA) one, where, for each new $k$-mer, only a restricted
number of lateral contacts $z$ with previously deposited $k$-mers is allowed.
Deposition occurs in the case when $z\leq (1-d)z_m$ where $z_m=2(k+1)$ is the
maximum numbers of the contacts of $k$-mer, and $d$ is the fraction of
forbidden NN contacts. Percolation is observed only at some interval
$k_{min}\leq k\leq k_{max}$ where the values $k_{min}$ and $k_{max}$ depend
upon the fraction of forbidden contacts $d$. The value $k_{max}$ decreases as
$d$ increases. A logarithmic dependence of the type $\log(k_{max})=a+bd$, where
$a=-4.03 \pm 0.22$, $b=4.93 \pm 0.57 $, is obtained.
