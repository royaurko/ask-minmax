In this article we prove a conjecture of Bezdek, Brass, and Harborth
concerning the maximum volume of the convex hull of any facet-to-facet
connected system of n unit hypercubes in the d-dimensional Euclidean space. For
d=2 we enumerate the extremal polyominoes and determine the set of possible
areas of the convex hull for each n.
