We propose a gamma5 scheme in dimensional regularization by analytically
continuing the dimension after all the gamma5 matrices have been moved to the
rightmost position. All Feynman amplitudes corresponding to diagrams with no
fermion loops regulated in this manner automatically satisfy the Ward-Takahashi
identities. This is in contrast to the scheme of Breitenlohner and Maison, in
which finite counter-terms are needed to restore gauge invariance. This
rightmost gamma5 scheme also has an advantage over the naive dimensional
regularization scheme which does not have a definitive prescription consistent
with gauge symmetry. Diagrams with fermion loops can be handled by selecting a
proper cut point on each fermion loop to play the role of the point of the
rightmost position.
