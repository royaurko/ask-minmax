We describe the closed cone of moving curves of smooth Fano three- and
fourfolds by giving finitely many equations that cut out the cone. The
equations are induced by the exceptional divisors of divisorial contractions
and by nef divisors on birational models obtained by sequences of flips.The
results presented here are part of the contributor's Ph.D. thesis, written under the
supervision of Stefan Kebekus.
