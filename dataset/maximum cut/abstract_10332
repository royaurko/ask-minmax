We study the communication complexity and streaming complexity of
approximating unweighted semi-matchings. A semi-matching in a bipartite graph G
= (A, B, E), with n = |A|, is a subset of edges S that matches all A vertices
to B vertices with the goal usually being to do this as fairly as possible.
While the term 'semi-matching' was coined in 2003 by Harvey et al. [WADS 2003],
the problem had already previously been studied in the scheduling literature
under different names.
  We present a deterministic one-pass streaming algorithm that for any 0 <=
\epsilon <= 1 uses space O(n^{1+\epsilon}) and computes an
O(n^{(1-\epsilon)/2})-approximation to the semi-matching problem. Furthermore,
with O(log n) passes it is possible to compute an O(log n)-approximation with
space O(n).
  In the one-way two-party communication setting, we show that for every
\epsilon > 0, deterministic communication protocols for computing an
O(n^{1/((1+\epsilon)c + 1)})-approximation require a message of size more than
cn bits. We present two deterministic protocols communicating n and 2n edges
that compute an O(sqrt(n)) and an O(n^{1/3})-approximation respectively.
  Finally, we improve on results of Harvey et al. [Journal of Algorithms 2006]
and prove new links between semi-matchings and matchings. While it was known
that an optimal semi-matching contains a maximum matching, we show that there
is a hierarchical decomposition of an optimal semi-matching into maximum
matchings. A similar result holds for semi-matchings that do not admit
length-two degree-minimizing paths.
