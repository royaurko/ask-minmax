The production rate of ionizing photons in young < 8 Myr, unresolved stellar
clusters in the nearby irregular galaxy NGC 4214 is probed using
multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 data. We normalize the ionizing
photon rate by the cluster mass to investigate the upper end of the stellar
initial mass function (IMF). We have found that within the uncertainties the
upper end of the stellar IMF appears to be universal in this galaxy, and that
deviations from a universal IMF can be attributed to stochastic sampling of
stars in clusters with masses < 10^3 M_sun. Furthermore, we have found that
there does not seem to be a dependence of the maximum stellar mass on the
cluster mass. We have also found that for massive clusters, feedback may cause
an underrepresentation in Ha luminosities, which needs to be taken into account
when conducting this type of analysis.
