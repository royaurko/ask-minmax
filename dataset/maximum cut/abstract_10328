This work is concerned with the ill-posed inverse problem of estimating
turbulent flows from the observation of an image sequence. From a Bayesian
perspective, a divergence-free isotropic fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is
chosen as a prior model for instantaneous turbulent velocity fields. This
self-similar prior characterizes accurately second-order statistics of velocity
fields in incompressible isotropic turbulence. Nevertheless, the associated
maximum a posteriori involves a fractional Laplacian operator which is delicate
to implement in practice. To deal with this issue, we propose to decompose the
divergent-free fBm on well-chosen wavelet bases. As a first alternative, we
propose to design wavelets as whitening filters. We show that these filters are
fractional Laplacian wavelets composed with the Leray projector. As a second
alternative, we use a divergence-free wavelet basis, which takes implicitly
into account the incompressibility constraint arising from physics. Although
the latter decomposition involves correlated wavelet coefficients, we are able
to handle this dependence in practice. Based on these two wavelet
decompositions, we finally provide effective and efficient algorithms to
approach the maximum a posteriori. An intensive numerical evaluation proves the
relevance of the proposed wavelet-based self-similar priors.
