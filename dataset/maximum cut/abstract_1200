The efficiency at maximum power (EMP) of heat engines operating as generators
is one corner stone of finite-time thermodynamics, the Curzon-Ahlborn
efficiency $\eta_{\rm CA}$ being considered as a universal upper bound. Yet, no
valid counterpart to $\eta_{\rm CA}$ has been derived for the efficiency at
maximum cooling power (EMCP) for heat engines operating as refrigerators. In
this Letter we analyse the reasons of the failure to obtain such a bound and we
demonstrate that, despite the introduction of several optimisation criteria,
the maximum cooling power condition should be considered as the genuine
equivalent of maximum power condition in the finite-time thermodynamics frame.
We then propose and discuss an analytic expression for the EMCP in the specific
case of exoreversible refrigerators.
