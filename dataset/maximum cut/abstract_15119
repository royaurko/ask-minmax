We deducted the Hubble law and the age of the Universe, through the
introduction of the Inverse Yukawa Field (IYF), as a non-local additive
complement of the Newtonian gravitation (Modified Newtonian Dynamics). As
result we connected the dynamics of astronomical objects at great scale with
the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker ($\Lambda$FRW) model. From the corresponding
formalism, the Hubble law can be expressed as v = (4 $\pi$ [G]/c)r, which was
derivated by evaluating the IYF force at distances much greater than 50Mpc,
giving a maximum value for the expansion rate of the universe of $H_0=86,31$,
consistent with the observational data of 392 astronomical objects from
NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED). This additional field (IYF) provides a
simple interpretation of dark energy as the action a large scale of baryonic
matter. Additionally, we calculated the age of the universe as 11Gyr, in
agreement with recent measurements of the age of the white dwarfs in the solar
neighborhood.
