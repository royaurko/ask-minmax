The AlPdMn quasicrystal approximants xi, xi', and xi'_n of the 1.6 nm
decagonal phase and R, T, and T_n of the 1.2 nm decagonal phase can be viewed
as arrangements of cluster columns on two-dimensional tilings. We substitute
the tiles by Penrose rhombs and show, that alternative tilings can be
constructed by a simple cut and projection formalism in three dimensional
hyperspace. It follows that in the approximants there is a phasonic degree of
freedom, whose excitation results in the reshuffling of the clusters. We apply
the tiling model for metadislocations, which are special textures of partial
dislocations.
