The Maximum Entropy Method is applied to dynamical fermion simulations of the
(2+1)-dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. This model is particularly
interesting because at T=0 it has a broken phase with a rich spectrum of
mesonic bound states and a symmetric phase where there are resonances, and
hence the simple pole assumption of traditional fitting procedures breaks down.
We present results extracted from simulations on large lattices for the
spectral functions of the elementary fermion, the pion, the sigma, the massive
pseudoscalar meson and the symmetric phase resonances.
