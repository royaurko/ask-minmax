Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and $R$ be a set of pairs of
vertices in $V$ called \emph{requests}. A \emph{multicut} is a subset $F$ of
$E$ such that every request $xy$ of $R$ is cut by $F$, \i.e. every $xy$-path of
$G$ intersects $F$. We show that there exists an $O(f(k)n^c)$ algorithm which
decides if there exists a multicut of size at most $k$. In other words, the
\M{} problem parameterized by the solution size $k$ is Fixed-Parameter
Tractable. The proof extends to vertex multicuts.
