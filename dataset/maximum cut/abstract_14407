The spin-down mechanism of accreting neutron stars is discussed with an
application to one of the best studied X-ray pulsars GX 301-2. We show that the
maximum possible spin-down torque applied to a neutron star from the accretion
flow can be evaluated as $K_{\rm sd}^{\rm (t)} = \mu^2/(r_{\rm m} r_{\rm
cor})^{3/2}$. The spin-down rate of the neutron star in GX 301-2 can be
explained provided the magnetospheric radius of the neutron star is smaller
than its canonical value. We calculate the magnetospheric radius considering
the mass-transfer in the binary system in the frame of the magnetic accretion
scenario suggested by V.F. Shvartsman. The spin-down rate of the neutron star
expected within this approach is in a good agreement with that derived from
observations of GX 301-2.
