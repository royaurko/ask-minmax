In this paper, the correlation between the gamma-ray and the radio bands is
investigated. The results show that there is a closer correlation between the
gamma-ray emission and the high frequency (1.3mm, 230GHz) radio emission for
maximum data than between the gamma-ray and the lower frequency (5GHz) radio
emissions, which means that the gamma-ray is associated with the radio emission
from the jet.
