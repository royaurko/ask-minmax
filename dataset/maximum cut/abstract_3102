We study s(k,n), the maximum size of A+A where A is a k-subset of [n]. A few
known functions from additive number theory can be expressed via s(k,n). For
example, our estimates of s(k,n) imply new bounds on the maximum size of
quasi-Sidon sets, a problem posed by Erdos and Freud [J. Number Th.38 (1991)
196-205]. Also, applications to so-called edge-magic labellings of graphs are
given.
