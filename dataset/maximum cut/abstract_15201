Standard statistical analysis of the magnetic properties of the quiet Sun
rely on simple histograms of quantities inferred from maximum-likelihood
estimations. Because of the inherent degeneracies, either intrinsic or induced
by the noise, this approach is not optimal and can lead to highly biased
results. We carry out a meta-analysis of the magnetism of the quiet Sun from
Hinode observations using a hierarchical probabilistic method. This model
allows us to infer the statistical properties of the magnetic field vector over
the observed field-of-view consistently taking into account the uncertainties
in each pixel due to noise and degeneracies. Our results point out that the
magnetic fields are very weak, below 275 G with 95% credibility, with a slight
preference for horizontal fields, although the distribution is not far from a
quasi-isotropic distribution.
