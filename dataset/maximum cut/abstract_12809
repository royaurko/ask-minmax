We analyze the effect of a colored non Gaussian noise on a model of a random
walker moving along a ratchet potential. Such a model was motivated by the
transport properties of motor proteins, like kinesin and myosin. Previous
studies have been realized assuming white noises. However, for real situations,
in general we could expect that those noises be correlated and non Gaussian.
Among other aspects, in addition to a maximum in the current as the noise
intensity is varied, we have also found another optimal value of the current
when departing from Gaussian behavior. We show the relevant effects that arise
when departing from Gaussian behavior, particularly related to current's
enhancement, and discuss its relevance for both biological and technological
situations.
