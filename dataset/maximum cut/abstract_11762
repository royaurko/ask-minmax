We present results of a set of experiments to investigate the effect of
dissipative external electromagnetic environment on tunneling in linear arrays
of junctions in the weak tunneling regime. The influence of this resistance
decreases as the number of junctions in the chain increases and ultimately
becomes negligible. Further, there is a value of external impedance, typically
\~5 k$\Omega$, at which the half-width of the zero-voltage dip in the
conductance curve shows a maximum. Some new analytical formulae, based on the
phase-correlation theory, along with numerical results will be presented.
