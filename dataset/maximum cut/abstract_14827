We study the 1.28 million short cadence {\it Kepler} data points (Q5-Q14) for
RR Lyrae covering 24 cycles of the Blazhko variation, and more than one half of
the 4-year modulation of the Blazhko variation. This very rich data set clearly
shows variability of the 0.5667 day pulsation period (from 0.5655 to 0.5685
day) with each Blazhko cycle, as well as a variation of the Blazhko period
itself (from 39.2 days at amplitude maximum to 38.4 days at amplitude minimum)
during the 4 year modulation, as well as a rapid increase in Blazhko period as
the new cycle commences.
