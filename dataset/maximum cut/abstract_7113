We define the separability and entanglement notion for particle with spin
$s=1$. We consider two cases. In the first the particle is composed of two
fermions with $s_1=1/2$ and $s_2=1/2$. In the second case the state is the
qutrit state which is not composed system. The notion of negativity and
concurrence is defined for the qutrit state. The concurrence and negativity of
entangled and separable qutrit states determined by the parameters of the
density matrix are explicitly calculated. The maximum entanglement of the
qutrit state is observed for maximum values of non diagonal matrix elements of
the density matrix. New entropic inequalities for the density matrix of the
qutrit state are obtained.
