Silver paint has been tested as a soldering agent for DyBaCuO single-domain
welding. Junctions have been manufactured on Dy-Ba-Cu-O single-domains cut
either along planes parallel to the c-axis or along the ab-planes.
Microstructural and superconducting characterisations of the samples have been
performed. For both types of junctions, the microstructure in the joined area
is very clean: no secondary phase or Ag particles segregation has been
observed. Electrical and magnetic measurements for all configurations of
interest are reported $\rho(T)$ curves, and Hall probe mapping). The narrow
resistive superconducting transition reported for all configurations shows that
the artificial junction does not affect significantly the measured
superconducting properties of the material.
