The yrast line of the N=Z nucleus 48Cr is studied up to high spins by means
of the cranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method including the T=0 and T=1 isospin
pairing channels. A Skyrme force is used in the mean-field channel together
with a zero-range density-dependent interaction in the pairing channels. The
extensions of the method needed to incorporate the neutron-proton pairing are
summarized. The T=0 pairing correlations are found to play a decisive role for
deformation properties and excitation energies above 16hbar which is the
maximum spin that can be obtained in the f7/2 subshell.
