In the present work, we first briefly sketch construction of the
nonrelativistic Lee model on Riemannian manifolds, introduced in our previous
works. In this approach, the renormalized resolvent of the system is expressed
in terms of a well-defined operator, called the principal operator, so as to
obtain a finite formulation. Then, we show that the ground state of the
nonrelativistic Lee model on a compact Riemannian manifolds is nondegenerate
using the explicit expression of the principal operator that we obtained. This
is achieved by combining heat kernel methods with positivity improving
semi-group approach and then applying these tools directly to the principal
operator, rather than the Hamiltonian, without using cut-offs.
