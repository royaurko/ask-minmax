We define a new 4-dimensional symplectic cut and paste operation which is
analogous to Fintushel and Stern's rational blow-down. We use this operation to
produce multiple constructions of symplectic smoothly exotic complex projective
space blown-up eight times, seven times, and six times. We also show how this
operation can be used in conjunction with knot surgery to construct an infinite
family of minimal exotic smooth structures on the complex projective space
blown-up seven times.
