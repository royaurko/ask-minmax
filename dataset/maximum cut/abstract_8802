Many statistical models are algebraic in that they are defined by polynomial
constraints or by parameterizations that are polynomial or rational maps. This
opens the door for tools from computational algebraic geometry. These tools can
be employed to solve equation systems arising in maximum likelihood estimation
and parameter identification, but they also permit to study model singularities
at which standard asymptotic approximations to the distribution of estimators
and test statistics may no longer be valid. This paper demonstrates such
applications of algebraic geometry in selected examples of Gaussian models,
thereby complementing the existing literature on models for discrete variables.
