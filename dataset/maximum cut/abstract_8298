The eigen frequencies of radial pulsations of neutron stars are calculated in
a strong magnetic field. At low densities we use the magnetic BPS equation of
state(EOS) similar to that obtained by Lai and Shapiro while at high densities
the EOS obtained from the relativistic nuclear mean field theory is taken and
extended to include strong magnetic field. It is found that magnetised neutron
stars support higher maximum mass where as the effect of magnetic field on
radial stability for observed neutron star masses is minimal.
