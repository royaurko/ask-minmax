A new approach is introduced to study QCD amplitudes at high energy and
comparatively small momentum transfer. Novel cut diagrams, representing
resummation of Feynman diagrams, are used to simplify calculation and to avoid
delicate cancellations encountered in the usual approach. Explicit calculation
to the 6th order is carried out to demonstrate the advantage of cut diagrams
over Feynman diagrams.
