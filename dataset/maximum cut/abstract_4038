We report the first investigation of the photo-response of the conductivity
of a new class of organic semiconductors based on functionalized pentacene.
These materials form high quality single crystals that exhibit a thermally
activated resistivity. Unlike pure pentacene, the functionalized derivatives
are readily soluble in acetone, and can be evaporated or spin-cast as thin
films for potential device applications. The electrical conductivity of the
single crystal materials is noticeably sensitive to ambient light changes. The
purpose, therefore, of the present study, is to determine the nature of the
photo-response in terms of carrier activation vs. heating effects, and also to
measure the dependence of the photo-response on photon energy. We describe a
new method, involving the temperature dependent photo-response, which allows an
unambiguous identification of the signature of heating effects in materials
with a thermally activated conductivity. We find strong evidence that the
photo-response in the materials investigated is predominantly a highly
localized heating mechanism. Wavelength dependent studies of the photo-response
reveal resonant features and cut-offs that indicate the photon energy
absorption is related to the electronic structure of the material.
