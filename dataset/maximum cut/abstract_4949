Pionful nuclear effective field theory (NEFT) in the two-nucleon sector is
examined from the Wilsonian renormalization group point of view. The pion
exchange is cut off at the floating cutoff scale, $\Lambda$, with the
short-distance part being represented as contact interactions in accordance
with the general principle of renormalization. We derive the nonperturbative
renormalization group equations in the leading order of the nonrelativistic
approximation in the operator space including up to $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ and find
the nontrivial fixed points in the $^1S_0$ and $^3S_1$--$^3D_1$ channels which
are identified with those in the pionless NEFT. The scaling dimensions, which
determine the power counting, of the contact interactions at the nontrivial
fixed points are also identified with those in the pionless NEFT. We emphasize
the importance of the separation of the pion exchange into the short-distance
and the long-distance parts, since a part of the former is nonperturbative
while the latter is perturbative.
