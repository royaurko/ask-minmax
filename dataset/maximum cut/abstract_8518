Time-resolved optical techniques are used to explore electron spin dynamics
in bulk and epilayer samples of n-type ZnO as a function of temperature and
magnetic field. The bulk sample yields a spin coherence time T2* of 20 ns at T
= 30 K. Epilayer samples, grown by pulsed laser deposition, show a maximum T2*
of 2 ns at T = 10 K, with spin precession persisting up to T = 280 K.
