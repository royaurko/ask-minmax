Let a measurement consist of a linear combination of damped complex
exponential modes, plus noise. The problem is to estimate the parameters of
these modes, as in line spectrum estimation, vibration analysis, speech
processing, system identification, and direction of arrival estimation. Our
results differ from standard results of modal analysis to the extent that we
consider sparse and co-prime samplings in space, or equivalently sparse and
co-prime samplings in time. Our main result is a characterization of the
orthogonal subspace. This is the subspace that is orthogonal to the signal
subspace spanned by the columns of the generalized Vandermonde matrix of modes
in sparse or co-prime arrays. This characterization is derived in a form that
allows us to adapt modern methods of linear prediction and approximate least
squares, such as iterative quadratic maximum likelihood (IQML), for estimating
mode parameters. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the
validity of the proposed modal estimation methods, and to compare the fidelity
of modal estimation with sparse and co-prime arrays, versus SNR. Our
calculations of Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds allow us to analyze the loss in
performance sustained by sparse and co-prime arrays that are compressions of
uniform linear arrays.
