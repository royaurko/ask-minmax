Mesoscopic thermoelectric heat engine is much anticipated as a new device
which allows us to utilize wasted heat inaccessible by the conventional heat
engine with high efficiency. Most theoretical studies so far, however, have
been limited to the linear-response regime; its thermodynamics beyond the
regime still remains unclear. In this Letter, we give a clear-cut definition of
the heat current of the engine beyond the linear-response regime. It resolves
the confusion in the definition of the heat current in the linear-response
regime. After verifying its thermodynamic consistency, we find the following
two interesting results: the efficiency of the mesoscopic thermoelectric engine
reaches the Carnot efficiency if and only if the transmission function is a
delta function at a specific energy; the unitarity of the scattering matrix
guarantees the second law of thermodynamics, invalidating Benenti et al.'s
argument in the linear-response regime that one could obtain a finite power
with the Carnot efficiency under broken time-reversal symmetry.
