The self-consistent determination of the damping rate of a fast moving
fermion in a hot QED plasma is reexamined. We argue how a detailed
investigation of the analytic properties of the retarded fermion Green's
function motivated by the cutting rules at finite temperature may resolve
ambiguities related to the proper definition of the mass-shell condition.
