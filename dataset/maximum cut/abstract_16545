A new experimental technique for investigating characteristics of plasma
generated with plasmotrons in electrophysical installations was proposed. The
technique involves a simultaneous registration of both radiation spectra and
images of plasma and consequent analysis of the registered data [1]. The
experimental technique proposed permits to acquire much more information about
plasma characteristics compared to common techniques of separate registration
of spectra and images and reveal possible correlation between spectral
parameters and image features of plasma [2]. The technique proposed was
experimentally realized using complex of apparatus fulfilling simultaneous
registration of both radiation spectra and images of plasma generated in
electrophysical installations designed for destruction of hazardous and harmful
substances [3]. Analysis of the data acquired using the proposed technique
permits to find both optimum operating conditions of existing plasmochemical
reactors and the optimum number and spatial arrangement of plasmotrons in
reactors being designed. Optimization here means attaining maximum
effectiveness of destruction of the substances, increasing destruction speed,
reducing consumption of electric power and consumable chemicals, and a whole
number of the other positive results. It is also possible to use output signals
of the registering apparatus to control plasmotrons'operating conditions in
real time i.e. to build plasmochemical reactor with feedback.
