For three-partition triple Hodge integrals related to the topological vertex,
we derive Eynard-Orantin type recursion relations from the cut-and-join
equation. This establishes a version of local mirror symmetry for the local
$C^3$ geometry with three D-branes, as proposed by Marino and
Bouchard-Klemm-Marino-Pasquetti.
