The Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) is a five-year survey being carried out
at the Las Campanas Observatory to obtain high-quality light curves of ~100
low-redshift Type Ia supernovae in a well-defined photometric system. Here we
present the first release of photometric data that contains the optical light
curves of 35 Type Ia supernovae, and near-infrared light curves for a subset of
25 events. The data comprise 5559 optical (ugriBV) and 1043 near-infrared
(YJHKs) data points in the natural system of the Swope telescope. Twenty-eight
supernovae have pre-maximum data, and for 15 of these, the observations begin
at least 5 days before B maximum. This is one of the most accurate datasets of
low-redshift Type Ia supernovae published to date. When completed, the CSP
dataset will constitute a fundamental reference for precise determinations of
cosmological parameters, and serve as a rich resource for comparison with
models of Type Ia supernovae.
