The structure and mechanical properties of a simple two-dimensional model of
a cohesive powder are investigated by molecular dynamics simulations.
Micromechanical ingredients involve elasticity, friction, a short range
attraction and, possibly, rolling resistance (RR) in contacts. The
microstructure of the cohesive packing varies according to the assembling
procedure, from rather densely packed if isolated particles are directly
compressed to much looser if the formation of large aggregates is allowed prior
to compression. A crucial parameter is the ratio P*= Pa/F0 of applied pressure
P, acting on grains of diameter $a$, to maximum tensile contact force F0. At
low P* the final structure depends on the level of velocity fluctuations at the
early stages of cluster aggregation. With RR the coordination number approaches
2 in the limit of low initial velocities or large rolling friction. The force
network generally comprises small hyperstatic clusters with forces of the order
of F0, joined by nearly unstressed, barely rigid arms. As P* grows, it quickly
rearranges into force chain-like patterns. Density correlations witness a
fractal structure, with dimension Df, up to some density-dependent blob size.
WIth RR Df coincides with the ballistic aggregation result, despite a possibly
different connectivity. Possible effects of some parameters on material
strength are evoked.
