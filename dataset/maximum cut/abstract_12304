We report a measurement of the top quark mass using six candidate events for
the process pbarp->ttbar->l^+ nu l^- nubar b bbar + X, observed in the D0
experiment at the Fermilab ppbar collider. Using maximum likelihood fits to the
dynamics of the decays, we measure a mass for the top quark of m(top) = 168.4
+- 12.3 (stat) +- 3.6 (syst) GeV/c^2. We combine this result with our previous
measurement in the ttbar->l+jets channel to obtain m(top) = 172.1 +- 7.1
GeV/c^2 as the best value of the mass of the top quark measured by D0.
