Divisibility of trinomials by given polynomials over finite fields has been
studied and used to construct orthogonal arrays in recent literature. Dewar et
al.\ (Des.\ Codes Cryptogr.\ 45:1-17, 2007) studied the division of trinomials
by a given pentanomial over $\F_2$ to obtain the orthogonal arrays of strength
at least 3, and finalized their paper with some open questions. One of these
questions is concerned with generalizations to the polynomials with more than
five terms. In this paper, we consider the divisibility of trinomials by a
given maximum weight polynomial over $\F_2$ and apply the result to the
construction of the orthogonal arrays of strength at least 3.
