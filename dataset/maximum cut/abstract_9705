We determine the maximum number of edges of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with the
property that none of its $r$-cliques intersects a fixed set $M\subset V(G)$.
For $(r-1)|M|\ge n$, the $(r-1)$-partite Turan graph turns out to be the unique
extremal graph. For $(r-1)|M|<n$, there is a whole family of extremal graphs,
which we describe explicitly. In addition we provide corresponding stability
results.
