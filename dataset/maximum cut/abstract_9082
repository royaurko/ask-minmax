Photoionization of the I$^+$ ion in the energy range of the 4d giant
resonance has been studied using our recently developed random-phase
approximation with exchange (RPAE) method. Photoionization cross sections for
the I$^+$ $4d-\epsilon f, \epsilon p$, $5s-\epsilon p$, $5p-\epsilon s
,\epsilon d$ have been obtained for each term of the ground state. Calculations
include all the intra-shell and inter-shell coupling among the 4d, $5s$, and
$5p$ subshells. Our maximum cross section for the I$^+$ 4d giant resonance,
23.12 MB at 90.24 eV agrees excellently with the recent measurement, 23(3) at
90 eV.
