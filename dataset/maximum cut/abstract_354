Extended mode coupling theories for dense fluids predict that nonlinear
current-density couplings cut off the singular `ideal glass transition',
present in the standard mode coupling theory where such couplings are ignored.
We suggest here that, rather than allowing for activated processes as sometimes
supposed, contributions from current-density couplings are always negligible
close to a glass transition. We discuss in schematic terms how activated
processes can nonetheless cut off the transition, by causing the memory
function to become linear in correlators at late times.
