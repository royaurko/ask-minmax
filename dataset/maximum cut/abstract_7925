During therapeutic treatment with heavier ions like carbon, the beam
undergoes nuclear fragmentation and secondary light charged particles, in
particular protons and alpha particles, are produced. To estimate the dose
deposited into the tumors and the surrounding healthy tissues, the accuracy
must be higher than ($\pm$3% and$\pm$1 mm). Therefore, measurements are
performed to determine the double differential cross section for different
reactions. In this paper, the analysis of data from 12C +12C reactions at 95
MeV/u are presented. The emitted particles are detected with
\DeltaEthin-\DeltaEthick-E telescopes made of a stack of two silicon detectors
and a CsI crystal. Two different methods are used to identify the particles.
One is based on graphical cuts onto the \DeltaE-E maps, the second is based on
the so-called KaliVeda method using a functional description of \DeltaE versus
E. The results of the two methods will be presented in this paper as well as
the comparison between both.
