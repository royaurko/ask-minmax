We present Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice gas with nearest-neighbor
exclusion and Kawasaki (hopping) dynamics, under the influence of a nonuniform
drive, on the square lattice. The drive, which favors motion along the +$x$ and
inhibits motion in the opposite direction, varies linearly with $y$, mimicking
the velocity profile of laminar flow between parallel plates with distinct
velocities. We study two drive configurations and associated boundary
conditions: (1) a linear drive profile, with rigid walls at the layers with
zero and maximum bias, and (2) a symmetric (piecewise linear) profile with
periodic boundaries. The transition to a sublattice-ordered phase occurs at a
density of about 0.298, lower than in equilibrium ($\rho_c \simeq 0.37$), but
somewhat higher than in the uniformly driven case at maximal bias ($\rho_c
\simeq 0.272$). For smaller global densities ($\rho \leq 0.33$), particles tend
to accumulate in the low-drive region. Above this density we observe a
surprising reversal in the density profile, with particles migrating to the
high-drive region and forming structures similar to force chains in granular
systems.
