In this paper we study radial oscillations of rotating strange stars in
strong magnetic fields in the Density Dependent Quark Mass (DDQM) model. We see
that increase of frequency i.e. difference in frequency of rotating and
non-rotating stars is more for higher magnetic fields. The change is small for
low mass stars but it increases with the mass of the star. This change of
frequency is significant for maximum mass whereas it is marginal for a 1.4
solar mass star.
