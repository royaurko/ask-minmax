We calculate the two-pion exchange potential between a heavy meson and a
heavy baryon. We find this potential is as strong as the one-pion exchange
potential between two heavy mesons and is enough to bind $\Lambda_b-\bar B$.
Though our result is sensitive to the cut-off, the value of the cut-off is in
the reasonable region.
