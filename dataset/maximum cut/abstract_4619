Influence of pulsed electric field (PEF) simultaneous to pressure treatment
on moisture expression from fine-cut cellular raw material has been
investigated. Dependencies of specific conductivity $\sigma$, liquid yield $Y$,
instantaneous flow rate $v$ and qualitative juice characteristics at different
modes of PEF treatment are discussed. Three main consolidation phases were
observed in a case of mechanical expression. A unified approach is proposed for
liquid yield data analysis allowing to reduce the data scattering caused by
differences in the quality of samples. Simultaneous application of pressure and
PEF treatment allows to reveal a passive form of electrical damage. Pressure
provokes the damage of defected cells, enhances diffusion migration of moisture
in porous cellular material and depresses the cell resealing processes. PEF
application at a moment when a sample specific electrical conductivity reaches
minimum and pressure achieves its constant value seemed to be the most optimal.
