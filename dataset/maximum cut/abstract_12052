The spin current in the Josephson junction as a weak link (interface) between
misorientated triplet superconductors is investigated theoretically for the
models of the order parameter in $UPt_{3}$. Green functions of the system are
obtained from the quasiclassical Eilenberger equations. The analytical results
for the charge and spin currents are illustrated by numerical calculations for
the certain misorientation angles of gap vector of superconductors. As the main
result of this paper, it is found that, at some values of the phase difference,
at which the charge current is exactly zero, the spin current has its maximum
value. Furthermore, it is shown that the origin of spin current is the
misorientation between gap vectors of triplet superconductors.
