Lorentz Transformation is reinterpreted. It is shown that by admitting the
existence of a frame of reference with synchronized clocks, we conclude that
any other frame of reference that moves related to the first has desynchronized
clocks. From this conclusion we will arrive at a new expression to relate the
time of different frames of reference. We also arrive at a new expression to
relate the contraction of different frames. We will show that if the maximum
speed on a frame with synchronized clocks is the speed of light, then the speed
of light varies accordingly to the velocity of the frame of reference. The new
interpretation of Lorentz Transformation explains and solves Relativity's
paradoxes.
