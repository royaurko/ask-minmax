The search for a theory of the origin of cosmic rays that may be considered
as a standard, agreeable model is still ongoing. On one hand, much
circumstantial evidence exists of the fact that supernovae in our Galaxy play a
crucial role in producing the bulk of cosmic rays observed on Earth. On the
other hand, important questions about their ability to accelerate particles up
to the knee remain unanswered. The common interpretation of the knee as a
feature coinciding with the maximum energy of the light component of cosmic
rays and a transition to a gradually heavier mass composition is mainly based
on KASCADE results. Some recent data appear to question this finding: YAC1 -
Tibet Array and ARGO-YBJ find a flux reduction in the light component at $\sim
700$ TeV, appreciably below the knee. Whether the maximum energy of light
nuclei is as high as $3000$ TeV or rather as low as a few hundred TeV has very
important consequences on the supernova remnant paradigm for the origin of
cosmic rays, as well on the crucial issue of the transition from Galactic to
extragalactic cosmic rays. In such a complex phenomenological situation, it is
important to have a clear picture of what is really known and what is not. Here
I will discuss some solid and less solid aspects of the theory (or theories)
for the origin of cosmic rays and the implications for future searches in this
field.
