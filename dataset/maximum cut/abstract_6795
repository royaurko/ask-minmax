Numerical simulations of convection in a layer filled with ideal gas are
presented. The control parameters are chosen such that there is a significant
variation of density of the gas in going from the bottom to the top of the
layer. The relations between the Rayleigh, Peclet and Nusselt numbers depend on
the density stratification. It is proposed to use a data reduction which
accounts for the variable density by introducing into the scaling laws an
effective density. The relevant density is the geometric mean of the maximum
and minimum densities in the layer. A good fit to the data is then obtained
with power laws with the same exponent as for fluids in the Boussinesq limit.
Two relations connect the top and bottom boundary layers: The kinetic energy
densities computed from free fall velocities are equal at the top and bottom,
and the products of free fall velocities and maximum horizontal velocities are
equal for both boundaries.
