We report on the observation of ultrafast photo-enhanced ferromagnetism in
GaMnAs. It is manifested as a transient magnetization increase on a 100-ps time
scale, after an initial sub-ps demagnetization. The dynamic magnetization
enhancement exhibits a maximum below the Curie temperature Tc and dominates the
demagnetization component when approaching Tc. We attribute the observed
ultrafast collective ordering to the p-d exchange interaction between
photoexcited holes and Mn spins, leading to a correlation-induced peak around
20K and a transient increase in Tc.
