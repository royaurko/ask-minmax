A large number of models of the species abundance distribution (SAD) have
been proposed, many of which are generically similar to the log-normal
distribution, from which they are often indistinguishable when describing a
given data set. Ecological data sets are necessarily incomplete samples of an
ecosystem, subject to statistical noise, and cannot readily be combined to
yield a closer approximation to the underlying distribution. In this paper we
use empirical data obtained from an ecosystem model to study the predicted SAD
in detail, resolving features which can distinguish between models but which
are poorly seen in field data. We find that the power-law normal distribution
is superior to both the log-normal and logit-normal distributions, and that the
data can improve on even this at the high-population cut-off.
