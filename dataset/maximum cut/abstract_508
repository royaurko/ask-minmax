We show that if a theory R defined by a rewrite system is super-consistent,
the classical sequent calculus modulo R enjoys the cut elimination property,
which was an open question. For such theories it was already known that proofs
strongly normalize in natural deduction modulo R, and that cut elimination
holds in the intuitionistic sequent calculus modulo R. We first define a
syntactic and a semantic version of Friedman's A-translation, showing that it
preserves the structure of pseudo-Heyting algebra, our semantic framework. Then
we relate the interpretation of a theory in the A-translated algebra and its
A-translation in the original algebra. This allows to show the stability of the
super-consistency criterion and the cut elimination theorem.
