In order to understand the performance of a code under maximum-likelihood
(ML) decoding, it is crucial to know the minimal codewords. In the context of
linear programming (LP) decoding, it turns out to be necessary to know the
minimal pseudo-codewords. This paper studies the minimal codewords and minimal
pseudo-codewords of some families of codes derived from projective and
Euclidean planes. Although our numerical results are only for codes of very
modest length, they suggest that these code families exhibit an interesting
property. Namely, all minimal pseudo-codewords that are not multiples of a
minimal codeword have an AWGNC pseudo-weight that is strictly larger than the
minimum Hamming weight of the code. This observation has positive consequences
not only for LP decoding but also for iterative decoding.
