This paper present high precision halfwave rectifier circuit in dual phase
output mode by 0.5 micrometer CMOS technology, plus or minus 1.5 V low voltage,
it has received input signal and sent output current signal, respond in high
frequency. The main structure compound with CMOS inverter circuit, common
source circuit, and current mirror circuit. Simulation and confirmation quality
of working by PSpice program, then it able to operating at maximum frequency
about 100 MHz, maximum input current range about 400 \mu Ap p, high precision
output signal, low power dissipation, and uses a little transistor.
