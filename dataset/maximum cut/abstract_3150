We study a class of cyclic Brownian heat engines in the framework of
finite-time thermodynamics. For infinitely long cycle times, the engine works
at the Carnot efficiency limit producing, however, zero power. For the
efficiency at maximum power, we find a universal expression, different from the
endoreversible Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. Our results are illustrated with a
simple one-dimensional engine working in and with a time-dependent harmonic
potential.
