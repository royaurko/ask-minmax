The GRANITE III camera of the Whipple Cherenkov Telescope at the Fred
Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins, Arizona (2300 m a.s.l.) has the
highest angular resolution of all cameras used on this telescope so far. The
central region of the camera has 379 pixels with an individual angular diameter
of 0.12 degrees. This makes the instrument especially suitable for observations
of gamma-induced air-showers at large zenith angles since the increase in
average distance to the shower maximum leads to smaller shower images in the
focal plane of the telescope. We examine the performance of the telescope for
observations of gamma-induced air-showers at zenith angles up to 63 degrees
based on observations of Mkn 421 and using Monte Carlo Simulations. An
improvement to the standard data analysis is suggested.
