We report ARPES and a set of in situ STM measurements on a
narrow-terrace-width vicinal Cu(111) crystal surface, Cu(775), whose vicinal
cut lies close to the transition between terrace and step modulation. These
measurements show sharp zone-folding (or Umklapp) features with a periodicity
in k||, indicating that the predominant reference plane is that of Cu(775),
i.e. that the surface is predominately step-modulated. Our measurements also
show variation in Umklapp intensity with photon energy, which is consistent
with prior ARPES experiments on other vicinal Cu(111) surfaces and in agreement
with our designation of the state as being step modulated. The measurements
also show a weak terrace-modulated state, which, based on several
characteristics, we attribute to the presence of terrace widths larger than the
ideal terrace width. By measuring the intensity ratio of the two distinct
surface-state modulations from PE and the terrace-width distribution from STM,
we derive a value for the terrace width, at which the surface-state switches
between the two modulations.
