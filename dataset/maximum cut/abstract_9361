An equilibrium phase diagram for the shape of compressively strained
free-hanging films is developed by total strain energy minimization. For small
strain gradients {\Delta}{\epsilon}, the film wrinkles, while for sufficiently
large {\Delta}{\epsilon}, a phase transition from wrinkling to bending occurs.
We consider competing relaxation mechanisms for free-hanging films, which have
rolled up into tube structures, and we provide an upper limit for the maximum
achievable number of tube rotations.
