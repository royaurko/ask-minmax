We consider the single particle spectral function for a two-dimensional clean
superconductor in a regime of strong critical thermal phase fluctuations. In
the limit where the maximum of the superconducting gap is much smaller than the
Fermi energy we obtain an exact expression for the spectral function integrated
over the momentum component perpendicular to the Fermi surface.
