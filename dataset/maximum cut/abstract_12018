To examine the so-called small pseudogap and the superconducting (SC)
condensation energy U(0), the electronic specific heat Cel was measured on
La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} up to ~120K. In samples with doping level p (=x) less
than ~0.2, small pseudogap behavior appears in the \gamma (=Cel/T) vs. T curve
around the mean-field critical temperature for a d-wave superconductor Tco
(=2*\Delta_{0}/(4~5)k_B), where \Delta_{0} is the maximum gap at T<<Tc. The
condensation energy U(0) is largely reduced in the pseudogap regime (p< ~0.2).
The reduction of U(0) can be well reproduced by introducing an effective SC
energy scale \Delta_{eff}=\beta*p*\Delta_{0} (\beta=4.5) instead of \Delta_{0}.
The effective SC energy scale is discussed in relation to the coherent pairing
gap formed over the nodal Fermi arc.
