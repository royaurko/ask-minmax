We discuss the properties of subhalos in cluster-size halos, using a
high-resolution statistical sample: the Rhapsody simulations introduced in Wu
et al. (2012). We demonstrate that the criteria applied to select subhalos have
significant impact on the inferred properties of the sample, including the
scatter in the number of subhalos, the correlation between the subhalo number
and formation time, and the shape of subhalos' spatial distribution and
velocity structure. We find that the number of subhalos, when selected using
the peak maximum circular velocity in their histories (a property expected to
be closely related to the galaxy luminosity), is uncorrelated with the
formation time of the main halo. This is in contrast to the previously reported
correlation from studies where subhalos are selected by the current maximum
circular velocity; we show that this difference is a result of the tidal
stripping of the subhalos. We also find that the dominance of the main halo and
the subhalo mass fraction are strongly correlated with halo concentration and
formation history. These correlations are important to take into account when
interpreting results from cluster samples selected with different criteria. Our
sample also includes a fossil cluster, which is presented separately and placed
in the context of the rest of the sample.
