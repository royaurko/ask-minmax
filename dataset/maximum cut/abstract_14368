In heavy-ion collisions at very high energy the density of produced jets can
be so high that the possibility of hadrons produced by recombination of shower
partons in overlapping minijets may become important. We study such
multi-minijet contribution to the hadron spectra and to dihadron correlation in
Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV at LHC. We adjust the parameter controlling the
momentum degradation of semihard partons by fitting the charged-particle
distribution up to $p_T\sim 16$ GeV/c. The relative magnitudes of different
identified hadrons and of various partonic components are fixed by the
recombination formalism. We find that the coalescence of shower patons from
adjacent miniijets can be as much as from single jets for meson production, and
even more so for proton, but never dominant over other components. In
3-shower-parton recombination the ratio of 2-jet to 1-jet contributions
increases with collision energy; its maximum can exceed 2 at 5.5 TeV.
Two-hadron correlation exhibits a broad peak on transverse rapidities,
confirming that minijets play a central role at low $p_T$.
