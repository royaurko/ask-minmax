In electroweak-boson production processes with a jet veto, higher-order
corrections are enhanced by logarithms of the veto scale over the invariant
mass of the boson system. In this paper, we resum these Sudakov logarithms at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy and match our predictions
to next-to-leading order (NLO) fixed-order results. We perform the calculation
in an automated way, for arbitrary electroweak final states and in the presence
of kinematic cuts on the leptons produced in the decays of the electroweak
bosons. The resummation is based on a factorization theorem for the cross
sections into hard functions, which encode the virtual corrections to the boson
production process, and beam functions, which describe the low-p_T emissions
collinear to the beams. The one-loop hard functions for arbitrary processes are
calculated using the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework, while the beam functions are
process independent. We perform the resummation for a variety of processes, in
particular for W+W- pair production followed by leptonic decays of the W
bosons.
