We studied three-particle Fock state contributions to heavy-to-light form
factors in the context of soft-collinear effective theory and found that they
enter at leading power. These contributions are non-factorizable due to the
appearance of endpoint singularities, however they do not violate spin-symmetry
relations at leading power. In this talk I present their numerical estimation
in a crude model in which the "soft overlap" contribution is cut off and find
that they might lower the standard values for the form factors at maximum
recoil significantly. Furthermore I briefly discuss the role of soft-collinear
messenger modes in the region of soft overlap.
