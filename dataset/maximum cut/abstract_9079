We have investigated theoretically the effects of the charging energy to the
normal metal--insulator--superconductor (NIS) tunnel junction used as a
thermometer. We demonstrate by numerical calculations how the charging effects
modify NIS thermometry, and how the voltage--to--temperature response and the
responsivity $|dV/dT|$ of a current biased thermometer are affected. In
addition, we show that the responsivity of the thermometer can be modulated
with an additional gate electrode. The maximum responsivity is achieved when
the Coulomb blockade is maximal, i.e. with a closed gate.
