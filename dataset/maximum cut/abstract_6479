Employing the maximum entropy method we extract the spectral functions from
meson correlators at four lattice spacings in quenched QCD with the Wilson
quark action. We confirm that the masses and decay constants, obtained from the
position and the area of peaks, agree well with the results from the
conventional exponential fit. For the first excited state, we obtain $m_{\pi_1}
= 660(590)$ MeV, $m_{\rho_1} = 1540(570)$ MeV, and $f_{\rho_1} = 0.085(36)$ in
the continuum limit.
