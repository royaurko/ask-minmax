We present a first-principles analysis of the strain renormalization of the
cation diffusivity on the GaAs(001) surface. For the example of
In/GaAs(001)-c(4x4) it is shown that the binding of In is increased when the
substrate lattice is expanded. The diffusion barrier \Delta E(e) has a
non-monotonic strain dependence with a maximum at compressive strain values (e
< 0), while being a decreasing function for any tensile strain (e > 0) studied.
We discuss the consequences of spatial variations of both the binding energy
and the diffusion barrier of an adatom caused by the strain field around a
heteroepitaxial island. For a simplified geometry, we evaluate the speed of
growth of two coherently strained islands on the GaAs(001) surface and identify
a growth regime where island sizes tend to equalize during growth due to the
strain dependence of surface diffusion.
