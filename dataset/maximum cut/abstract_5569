Cross-sectional imaging of human organ serves as a critical tool to provide
diagnostic results of many diseases. Based on a unique body coordinate system,
we present a method that we use to reconstruct any cross-sectional imaging of
organ regardless of its original section going along which scanning or cutting
axis. In clinical medicine, this method enables a patient to undergo only one
scanning, and then the doctor can observe the structure of lesion sections
along any axis, and it can help find changes of lesions at the same section
from different scanning results and thus quantify diagnosis by cross-sectional
imaging. Significant progress has thus been made towards quantitative diagnosis
cross-sectional imaging.
