Assuming that there is no GZK (Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin) cut-off and that
super-GZK cosmic rays correlate with AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) at
cosmological distances, it is speculated that a relic superheavy particle (X)
has its lifetime enhanced by sequestration in an extra dimension. This
sequestration is assumed to be partially liberated by proximity of merging
supermassive black holes in an AGN, temporarily but drastically reducing the
lifetime, thus stimulating an X burst. Based on sequestration of the decay
products of X, a speculative explanation of the observed $\gamma/N$ ratio is
proposed.
