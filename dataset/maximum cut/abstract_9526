On any spacelike surface in a lightcone of four dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski
space a distinguished smooth function is considered. It is shown how both
extrinsic and intrinsic geometry of such a surface is codified by this
function. The existence of a local maximum is assumed to decide when the
spacelike surface must be totally umbilical, deriving a Liebmann type result.
Two remarkable families of examples of spacelike surfaces in a lightcone are
explicitly constructed. Finally, several results which involve the first
eigenvalue of the Laplace operator of a compact spacelike surface in a
lightcone are obtained.
