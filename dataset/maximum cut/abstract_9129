We show that the secondary electrons ejected from the ionization of heavy
ions can be injected into the acceleration process that occurs at supernova
remnant shocks. This electron injection mechanism works since ions are ionized
during the acceleration when they move already with relativistic speed, just
like ejected electrons do. Using the abundances of heavy nuclei measured in
cosmic rays at Earth, we estimate the electron/proton ratio at the source to be
~10^-4, big enough to account for the nonthermal synchrotron emission observed
in young SNRs. We also show that the ionization process can limit the maximum
energy that heavy ions can reach.
