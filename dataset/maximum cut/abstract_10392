Winking (oscillating) filaments have been observed for many years. However,
observations of successive winking filaments in one event have not been
reported yet. In this paper, we present the observations of a chain of winking
filaments and a subsequent jet that are observed right after the X2.1 are in
AR11283. The event also produced an Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave that has two
components: upward dome-like wave (850 km/s) and lateral surface wave (554
km/s) which was very weak (or invisible) in imaging observations. By analyzing
the temporal and spatial relationships between the oscillating filaments and
the EUV waves, we propose that all the winking filaments and the jet were
triggered by the weak (or invisible) lateral surface EUV wave. The oscillation
of the filaments last for two or three cycles, and their periods, Doppler
velocity amplitudes, and damping times are 11 - 22 minutes, 6 - 14 km/s, and 25
- 60 minutes, respectively. We further estimate the radial component magnetic
field and the maximum kinetic energy of the filaments, and they are 5 - 10
Gauss and ~ 10^19 J, respectively. The estimated maximum kinetic energy is
comparable to the minimum energy of ordinary EUV waves, suggesting that EUV
waves can efficiently launch filament oscillations on their path. Based on our
analysis results, we conclude that the EUV wave is a good agent for triggering
and connecting successive but separated solar activities in the solar
atmosphere, and it is also important for producing solar sympathetic eruptions.
