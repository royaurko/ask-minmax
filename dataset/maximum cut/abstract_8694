We show that the ratio of different structure functions have a maximum which
depends on energy. We argue, using Golec-Biernat and Wusthoff model, that these
maxima are the certain functions of the saturation scale. The analysis of
leading and higher twist contributions for different observables is given with
the aim of determining the kinematic region where high parton density effects
could be seen experimentally.
