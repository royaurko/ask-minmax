Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have been widely acclaimed in
order to provide high data rates. Recently Lattice Reduction (LR) aided
detectors have been proposed to achieve near Maximum Likelihood (ML)
performance with low complexity. In this paper, we develop the fixed point
design of an iterative soft decision based LR-aided K-best decoder, which
reduces the complexity of existing sphere decoder. A simulation based
word-length optimization is presented for physical implementation of the K-best
decoder. Simulations show that the fixed point result of 16 bit precision can
keep bit error rate (BER) degradation within 0.3 dB for 8x8 MIMO systems with
different modulation schemes.
