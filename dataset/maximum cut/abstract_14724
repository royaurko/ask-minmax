Multilayer graphene (MLG) thin films are deposited on silicon oxide
substrates by mechanical exfoliation (or 'scotch-tape method') from Kish
graphite. The thickness and number of layers are determined from both Atomic
Force Microscopy (AFM) and Raman Spectroscopy. Electrical terminals are
deposited on MLGs in a four-probe configuration by electron-beam lithography,
gold/titanium thermal evaporation, and lift-off. The electrical resistance is
measured from room temperature down to 2 K. The electrical resistance of the
MLGs shows an increase with decreasing temperature, and then decreases after
reaching a maximum value. These results are compared with recent experimental
and theoretical data from the literature.
