We propose an accelerated version of the holonomic gradient descent and apply
it to calculating the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the Fisher-Bingham
distribution on a $d$-dimensional sphere. We derive a Pfaffian system (an
integrable connection) and a series expansion associated with the normalizing
constant with an error estimation. These enable us to solve some MLE problems
up to dimension $d=7$ with a specified accuracy.
