Let $X$ be an abstract not necessarily compact orientable CR manifold of
dimension $2n-1$, $n\geqslant2$, and let $L^k$ be the $k$-th tensor power of a
CR complex line bundle $L$ over $X$. Given $q\in\set{0,1,\ldots,n-1}$, let
$\Box^{(q)}_{b,k}$ be the Gaffney extension of Kohn Laplacian for $(0,q)$ forms
with values in $L^k$. For $\lambda\geq0$, let
$\Pi^{(q)}_{k,\leq\lambda}:=E((-\infty,\lambda])$, where $E$ denotes the
spectral measure of $\Box^{(q)}_{b,k}$. In this work, we prove that
$\Pi^{(q)}_{k,\leq k^{-N_0}}F^*_k$, $F_k\Pi^{(q)}_{k,\leq k^{-N_0}}F^*_k$,
$N_0\geq1$, admit asymptotic expansions on the non-degenerate part of the
characteristic manifold of $\Box^{(q)}_{b,k}$, where $F_k$ is some kind of
microlocal cut-off function. Moreover, we show that
$F_k\Pi^{(q)}_{k,\leq0}F^*_k$ admits a full asymptotic expansion if
$\Box^{(q)}_{b,k}$ has small spectral gap property with respect to $F_k$ and
$\Pi^{(q)}_{k,\leq0}$ is $k$-negligible away the diagonal with respect to
$F_k$. By using these asymptotics, we establish almost Kodaira embedding
theorems on CR manifolds and Kodaira embedding theorems on CR manifolds with
transversal CR $S^1$ actions.
