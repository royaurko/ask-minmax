Significantly different normal state Lorenz numbers have been found in two
independent direct measurements based on the Righi-Leduc effect, one about 6
times smaller and the other one about 2 times larger than the Sommerfeld value
in single cuprate crystals of the same chemical composition. The controversy is
resolved in the model where charge carriers are mobile lattice bipolarons and
thermally activated nondegenerate polarons. The model numerically fits several
longitudinal and transverse kinetic coefficients providing a unique explanation
of a sharp maximum in the temperature dependence of the normal state Hall
number in underdoped cuprates.
