We generalize stochastic thermodynamics to include information reservoirs.
Such information reservoirs, which can be modeled as a sequence of bits, modify
the second law. For example, work extraction from a system in contact with a
single heat bath becomes possible if the system also interacts with an
information reservoir. We obtain an inequality, and the corresponding
fluctuation theorem, generalizing the standard entropy production of stochastic
thermodynamics. From this inequality we can derive an information processing
entropy production, which gives the second law in the presence of information
reservoirs. We also develop a systematic linear response theory for information
processing machines. For a unicyclic machine powered by an information
reservoir, the efficiency at maximum power can deviate from the standard value
of 1/2. For the case where energy is consumed to erase the tape, the efficiency
at maximum erasure rate is found to be 1/2.
