The equilibrium state of a relativistic gas has been calculated based on the
maximum entropy principle. Though the relativistic equilibrium state was long
believed to be the Juttner distribution, a number of papers have been published
in recent years proposing alternative equilibrium states. However, some of
these papers do not pay enough attention to the covariance of distribution
functions, resulting confusion in equilibrium states. Starting from a fully
covariant expression to avoid this confusion, it has been shown in the present
paper that the Juttner distribution is the maximum entropy state if we assume
the Lorentz symmetry.
