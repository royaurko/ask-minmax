The one-loop effective potential calculated for a generic model that
originates from 5-dimensional theory reduced down to 4 dimensions is
considered. The cut-off and dimensional regularization schemes are discussed
and compared. It is demonstrated that the prescriptions are consistent with
each other and lead to the same physical consequences. Stability of the ground
state is discussed for a U(1) model that is supposed to mimic the Standard
Model extended to 5 dimensions. It has been shown that fermionic Kaluza-Klein
modes can dramatically influence the shape of the effective potential shifting
the instability scale even by several orders of magnitude.
