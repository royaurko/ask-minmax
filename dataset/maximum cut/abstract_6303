The evidence for positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$ from Type Ia
supernovae is reexamined.
  Both high redshift supernova teams are found to underestimate the effects of
host galaxy extinction. The evidence for an absolute magnitude- decay time
relation is much weakened if supernovae not observed before maximum light are
excluded. Inclusion of such objects artificially supresses the scatter about
the mean relation.
  With a consistent treatment of host galaxy extinction and elimination of
supernovae not observed before maximum, the evidence for a positive lambda is
not very significant (3-4 $\sigma$). A factor which may contribute to apparent
faintness of high z supernovae is evolution of the host galaxy extinction with
z.
  The Hubble diagram using all high z distance estimates, including SZ clusters
and gravitational lens time-delay estimates, does not appear inconsistent with
an $\Omega_o$ = 1 model.
  Although a positive $\Lambda$ can provide an, albeit physically unmotivated,
resolution of the low curvature implied by CMB experiments and evidence that
$\Omega_o <$ 1 from large-scale structure, the direct evidence from Type Ia
supernovae seems at present to be inconclusive.
