It is shown that if BMM (= Bounded Martin's Maximum) holds then each set is
contained in an inner model with a strong cardinal. This answers a question
that has been asked by various people. It follows that BMM has a much larger
consistency strength than BSPFA (= the Bounded Semi-proper Forcing Axiom).
