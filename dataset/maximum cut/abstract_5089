We present the discoveries of three faint companions to young stars in the
Scorpius-Centaurus region, imaged with the NICI instrument on Gemini South. We
have confirmed all three companions through common proper motion tests.
Follow-up spectroscopy has confirmed two of them, HIP 65423 B and HIP 65517 B,
to be brown dwarfs, while the third, HIP 72099 B, is more likely a very
low-mass star just above the hydrogen burning limit. The detection of wide
companions in the mass range of ~40--100 Mjup complements previous work in the
same region, reporting detections of similarly wide companions with lower
masses, in the range of ~10--30 Mjup. Such low masses near the deuterium
burning limit have raised the question of whether those objects formed like
planets or stars. The existence of intermediate objects as reported here could
represent a bridge between lower-mass companions and stellar companions, but in
any case demonstrate that mass alone may not provide a clear-cut distinction
for the formation of low-mass companions to stars.
