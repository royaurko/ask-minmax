RR Lyr is one of the most studied variable stars. Its light curve has been
regularly monitored since the discovery of the periodic variability in 1899.
Analysis of all observed maxima allows us to identify two primary pulsation
states defined as pulsation over a long (P0 longer than 0.56684 d) and a short
(P0 shorter than 0.56682 d) primary pulsation period. These states alternate
with intervals of 13-16 yr, and are well defined after 1943. The 40.8 d
periodical modulations of the amplitude and the period (i.e. Blazhko effect)
were noticed in 1916. We provide homogeneous determinations of the Blazhko
period in the different primary pulsation states. The Blazhko period does not
follow the variations of P0 and suddenly diminished from 40.8 d to around 39.0
d in 1975. The monitoring of these periodicities deserved and deserves a
continuous and intensive observational effort. For this purpose we have built
dedicated, transportable and autonomous small instruments, Very Tiny Telescopes
(VTTs), to observe the times of maximum brightness of RR Lyr. As immediate
results the VTTs recorded the last change of P0 state in mid-2009 and extended
the time coverage of the Kepler observations, thus recording a maximum O-C
amplitude of the Blazhko effect at the end of 2008, followed by the
historically smallest O-C amplitude in late 2013. This decrease is still
ongoing and VTT instruments are ready to monitor the expected increase in the
next few years.
