We examine a possibility to discover a Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation of gluon
in a warped extra dimension model at the Large Hadron Collider focusing on a
decay channel of the KK gluon into a $b$-quark pair. It is known that, in a
certain extension of the warped extra dimension model, the third generation
quarks could strongly couple to the KK gluon owing to appropriate bulk fermion
mass parameters. Taking account of kinematical cuts to reduce background
events, we show the model parameter space which leads to a significance larger
than 5$\sigma$ with the integrated luminosity of 10 (100) ${\rm fb}^{-1}$.
