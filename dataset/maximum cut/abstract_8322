We have extended our published set of low mass AGB stellar models to lower
metallicity. Different mass loss rates have been explored. Interpolation
formulae for luminosity, effective temperature, core mass, mass of dredge up
material and maximum temperature in the convective zone generated by thermal
pulses are provided. Finally, we discuss the modifications of these quantities
as obtained when an appropriate treatment of the inward propagation of the
convective instability, caused by the steep rise of the radiative opacity
occurring when the convective envelope penetrates the H-depleted region, is
taken into account.
