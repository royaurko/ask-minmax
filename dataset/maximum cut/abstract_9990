We present a new empirical method for fitting multicolor light curves of Type
Ia supernovae. Our method combines elements from two widely used techniques in
the literature: the delta_m15 template fitting method and the Multicolor
Light-Curve Shape method. An advantage of our technique is the ease of adding
new colors, templates, or parameters to the fitting procedure. We use a large
sample of published light curves to calibrate the relations between the
absolute magnitudes at maximum and delta_m15 in BVRI filters. We find that
individual subsamples from a given survey or publication have significantly
tighter relationships between light curve shape and luminosity than the
relationship derived from the sum of all the samples, pointing to uncorrected
systematic errors in the photometry, mainly in BV filters. Using our method, we
calculate luminosity distances and host galaxy reddening to 89 SNe in the
Hubble flow and construct a low-z Hubble diagram. The dispersion of the SNe in
the Hubble diagram is 0.20 mag, or an error of ~9% in distance to a single SN.
Our technique produces similar or smaller dispersion in the low-z Hubble
diagram than other techniques in the literature.
