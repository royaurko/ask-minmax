Debye temperature, $\Theta_D$, of Fe-rich Fe$_{100-x}$Cr$_x$ disordered
alloys with $0\le x \le 22.3$ was determined from the temperature dependence of
the central shift of M\"ossbauer spectra recorded in the temperature range of
60 -- 300 K. Its compositional dependence shows a maximum at $x \approx 5$ with
a relative increase of $\sim 30$% compared to a pure iron. The composition at
which the effect occurs correlates well with that at which several other
quantities, e. g. the Curie temperature and the spin-wave stiffness
coefficient, $D_0$, show their maxima, but the enhancement of $\Theta_D$ is
significantly greater and comparable with the enhancement of the hyperfine
field (spin-density of itinerant $s$-like electrons) in the studied system. The
results suggest that the electron-phonon interaction is important in this alloy
system.
