Color intensity projections (CIPs) have been shown to improve the
visualisation of greyscale angiography images by combining greyscale images
into a single color image. A key property of the combined CIPs image is the
encoding of the arrival time information from greyscale images into the hue of
the color in the CIPs image. A few minor improvements to the calculation of the
CIPs image are introduced that substantially improve the quality of the
visualisation. One improvement is interpolating of the greyscale images in time
before calculation of the CIPs image. A second is the use of hue cycling -
where the hue of the color is cycled through more than once in an image. The
hue cycling allows the variation of the hue to be concentrated in structures of
interest. An angiogram of a brain is used to demonstrate the substantial
improvements hue cycling brings to CIPs images. A third improvement is the use
of maximum intensity projection for 2D rendering of a 3D CIPs image volume.
Other potential applications of CIPs are also mentioned.
