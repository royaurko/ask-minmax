Recently, the study of the CoRoT target, HD49933, showed evidence of
variability of its magnetic activity. This was the first time that a stellar
activity was detected using asteroseismic data. For the Sun and HD49933, we
observe an increase of the p-mode frequencies and a decrease of the maximum
amplitude per radial mode when the activity level is higher. Moreover, we have
been able to determine the variation of the frequency shift as a function of
frequency, a premier in a star different from the Sun, showing pretty
interesting similarities with the behavior already seen in the Sun. Beside,
surface activity is now confirmed by the continuous monitoring done in Ca H&K
during 6 months last fall. The peak-to-peak activity level seems to be bigger
than 20% (close to the solar level, which is around 25%). We studied some other
CoRoT solar-like targets as well for which modes have been detected and well
identified, e.g. HD181420 and HD52265 (which is hosting a planet). Although
HD52265 rotates much slower than HD49933 meaning much longer activity cycle
(compared to the CoRoT observations), we do indeed see a hint of an increase in
the activity level of that star...
