We study a spatially explicit harvesting model in periodic or bounded
environments. The model is governed by a parabolic equation with a spatially
dependent nonlinearity of Kolmogorov--Petrovsky--Piskunov type, and a negative
external forcing term $-\delta$. Using sub- and supersolution methods and the
characterization of the first eigenvalue of some linear elliptic operators, we
obtain existence and nonexistence results as well as results on the number of
stationary solutions. We also characterize the asymptotic behavior of the
evolution equation as a function of the forcing term amplitude.
  In particular, we define two critical values $\delta^*$ and $\delta_2$ such
that, if $\delta$ is smaller than $\delta^*$, the population density converges
to a "significant" state, which is everywhere above a certain small threshold,
whereas if $\delta$ is larger than $\delta_2$, the population density converges
to a "remnant" state, everywhere below this small threshold. Our results are
shown to be useful for studying the relationships between environmental
fragmentation and maximum sustainable yield from populations. We present
numerical results in the case of stochastic environments.
