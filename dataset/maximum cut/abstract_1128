We present results for the next-to-leading order calculation of single-top
Wt-channel production interfaced to Shower Monte Carlo programs, implemented
according to the POWHEG method. A comparison with MC@NLO is carried out.
Results obtained using the PYTHIA shower are also shown and the effect of
typical cuts is briefly discussed.
