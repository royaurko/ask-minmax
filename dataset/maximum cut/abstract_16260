We present the results of a spectral analysis of 5 Swift XRT and UVOT
observations of the BL Lac object PKS 0548-322 carried out over the period
April-June 2005. The X-ray flux of this high energy peaked BL Lac (HBL) source
was found to be approximately constant at a level of F(2-10 keV) ~ 4x10^-11 erg
cm^-2 s^-1, a factor of 2 brighter than when observed by BeppoSAX in 1999 and
close to the maximum intensity reported in the Einstein Slew Survey. The very
good statistics obtained in the 0.3-10 keV Swift X-ray spectrum allowed us to
detect highly significant deviations from a simple power law spectral
distribution. A log-parabolic model describes well the X-ray data and gives a
best fit curvature parameter of 0.18 and peak energy in the Spectral Energy
Distribution of about 2 keV. The UV spectral data from Swift UVOT join well
with a power law extrapolation of the soft X-ray data points suggesting that
the same component is responsible for the observed emission in the two bands.
The combination of synchrotron peak in the X-ray band and high intensity state
confirms PKS 0548-322 as a prime target for TeV observations. X-ray monitoring
and coordinated TeV campaigns are highly advisable.
