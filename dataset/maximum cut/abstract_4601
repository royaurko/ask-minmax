We present a simple and physically compelling boundary condition
regularization scheme in the framework of effective field theory as applied to
nucleon-nucleon interaction. It is free of off-shell ambiguities and
ultraviolet divergences and provides finite results at any step of the
calculation. Low energy constants and their non-perturbative evolution can
directly be obtained from experimental threshold parameters in a completely
unique and model independent way when the long range explicit pion effects are
removed. This allows to compute scattering phase shifts which are, by
construction consistent with effective range expansion to a given order in the
CM momentum and are free from finite cut-off artifacts. We illustrate how the
method works in the $^1S_0$ channel for the One Pion Exchange potential.
