We use 89Y NMR in $YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+y}$ in order to evaluate with high
sensitivity the distribution of hole content p in the CuO2 planes. For y=1 and
y=0.6, this hole doping distribution is found narrow with a full width at half
maximum smaller than Delta p=0.025. This rules out any large static phase
separation between underdoped and optimally doped regions in contrast with the
one observed by STM in Bi2212 and by NQR in LaSrCuO. This establishes that
static electronic phase separation is not a generic feature of the cuprates.
