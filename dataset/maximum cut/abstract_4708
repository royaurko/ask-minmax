We show that the Grassmannian independence of the super Lagrangian density,
expressed in terms of the superfields defined on a (4, 2)-dimensional
supermanifold, is a clear-cut proof for the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST)
and anti-BRST invariance of the corresoponding four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D)
Lagrangian density that describes the interaction between the U(1) gauge field
and the charged complex scalar fields. The above 4D field theoretical model is
considered on a (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold parametrized by the ordinary
four spacetime variables x^\mu (with \mu = 0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of
Grassmannian variables \theta and \bar\theta (with \theta^2 = \bar\theta^2 = 0,
\theta \bar\theta + \bar\theta \theta = 0). Geometrically, the (anti-)BRST
invariance is encoded in the translation of the super Lagrangian density along
the Grassmannian directions of the above supermanifold such that the outcome of
this shift operation is zero.
