Using data from the HEGRA air shower array, taken in the period from April
1998 to March 2000, upper limits on the ratio I_gamma /I_CR of the diffuse
photon flux I_gamma to the hadronic cosmic ray flux I_CR are determined for the
energy region 20 TeV to 100 TeV. The analysis uses a gamma-hadron
discrimination which is based on differences in the development of photon- and
hadron-induced air showers after the shower maximum. A method which is
sensitive only to the non-isotropic component of the diffuse photon flux yields
an upper limit of I_gamma /I_CR (at 54 TeV) < 2.0*10^-3 (at the 90% confidence
level) for a sky region near the inner galaxy (20 degrees < galactic longitude
<60 degrees and |galactic latitude|<5 degrees). A method which is sensitive to
both the isotropic and the non-isotropic component yields global upper limits
of I_gamma /I_CR (at 31 TeV) <1.2*10^-2 and I_gamma /I_CR (at 53 TeV) <
1.4*10^-2 (at the 90% confidence level).
