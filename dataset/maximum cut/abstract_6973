We study neutrino spin oscillations in gravitational fields in
non-commutative spaces. For the Schwarzschild metric the maximum frequency
decreases with increasing the noncommutativity parameter. In the case of
Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) metric, the maximum frequency of oscillation is a
monotonically increasing function of the noncommutativity parameter .In both
cases, the frequency of spin oscillations decreases as the distance from the
gravitational source grows. We present a phenomenological application of our
results. It is also shown that the noncommutativity parameter is bounded as 0.1
l_p.
