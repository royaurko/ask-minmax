High resolution data in the region of the line Halpha have been obtained at
the time of the light maximum and after it of the 2006 optical outburst of the
symbiotic binary Z And. A blue-shifted absorption component indicating outflow
velocity of about 1400 km/s as well as additional emission components with
similar velocities, situated on the two sides of the main peak of the line were
observed during that time. It is suggested that all of them are spectral
signature of bipolar outflow, observed for the first time in the optical
spectrum of this binary. The emission measure and the mass of the nebular part
of the streams were estimated approximately.
