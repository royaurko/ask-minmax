The growth rate of the partial maximum of a stationary stable process was
first studied in the works of Samorodnitsky (2004a,b), where it was
established, based on the seminal works of Rosi\'nski (1995,2000), that the
growth rate is connected to the ergodic theoretic properties of the flow that
generates the process. The results were generalized to the case of stable
random fields indexed by Z^d in Roy and Samorodnitsky (2008), where properties
of the group of nonsingular transformations generating the stable process were
studied as an attempt to understand the growth rate of the partial maximum
process. This work generalizes this connection between stable random fields and
group theory to the continuous parameter case, that is, to the fields indexed
by R^d.
