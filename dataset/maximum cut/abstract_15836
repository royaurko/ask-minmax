The optical/UV light curves of SN 1987A are analyzed with the multi-energy
group radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. The calculated monochromatic and
bolometric light curves are compared with observations shortly after shock
breakout, during the early plateau, through the broad second maximum, and
during the earliest phase of the radioactive tail. We have concentrated on a
progenitor model calculated by Nomoto & Hashimoto and Saio, Nomoto, & Kato,
which assumes that 14 solar masses of the stellar mass is ejected. Using this
model, we have updated constraints on the explosion energy and the extent of
mixing in the ejecta. In particular, we determine the most likely range of E/M
(explosion energy over ejecta mass) and R_0 (radius of the progenitor). In
general, our best models have energies in the range E = (1.1 +/- 0.3) x 10^{51}
ergs, and the agreement is better than in earlier, flux-limited diffusion
calculations for the same explosion energy. Our modeled B and V fluxes compare
well with observations, while the flux in U undershoots after about 10 days by
a factor of a few, presumably due to NLTE and line transfer effects. We also
compare our results with IUE observations, and a very good quantitative
agreement is found for the first days, and for one IUE band (2500-3000 A) as
long as for 3 months. We point out that the V flux estimated by McNaught &
Zoltowski should probably be revised to a lower value.
