The magnetic behaviour of SmN has been investigated in stoichiometric
polycrystalline films. All samples show ferromagnetic order with Curie
temperature (T_c) of 27 +/- 3 K, evidenced by the occurrence of hysteresis
below T_c. The ferromagnetic state is characterised by a very small moment and
a large coercive field, exceeding even the maximum applied field of 6 T below
about 15 K. The residual magnetisation at 2 K, measured after cooling in the
maximum field, is 0.035 mu_B per Sm. Such a remarkably small moment results
from a near cancellation of the spin and orbital contributions for Sm3+ in SmN.
Coupling to an applied field is therefore weak, explaining the huge coercive
field . The susceptibility in the paramagnetic phase shows
temperature-independent Van Vleck and Curie-Weiss contributions. The Van Vleck
contribution is in quantitative agreement with the field-induced admixture of
the J=7/2 excited state and the 5/2 ground state. The Curie-Weiss contribution
returns a Curie temperature that agrees with the onset of ferromagnetic
hysteresis, and a conventional paramagnetic moment with an effective moment of
0.4 mu_B per Sm ion, in agreement with expectations for the crystal-field
modified effective moment on the Sm3+ ions.
