We consider the estimation problem of an unknown drift parameter within
classes of non-degenerate diffusion processes. The Maximum Likelihood Estimator
(MLE) is analyzed with regard to its pathwise stability properties and
robustness towards misspecification in volatility and even the very nature of
noise. We construct a version of the estimator based on rough integrals (in the
sense of T. Lyons) and present strong evidence that this construction resolves
a number of stability issues inherent to the standard MLEs.
