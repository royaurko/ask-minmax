Simulated color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are used to investigate the recent
star formation history in NGC 5128. The comparison of the simulations with the
observed UV CMD for a field in the NE shell, where recent star formation is
present, constrains the initial mass function (IMF) and the duration of the
star formation episode. The star formation burst is still on-going or at most
has stopped some 2 Myr ago. The look-back time on the main sequence is set by
the incompleteness of the U-band observations at V~26, and is of the order of
50 Myr. The post main sequence phases have a look-back time up to 100 Myr,
setting the maximum observable time for the star formation in this field. The
comparison of the observed and simulated luminosity functions and the number of
post main sequence vs. total number of stars favours models with active star
formation in the last 100 Myr. The data are best fitted by an IMF with Salpeter
slope (\alpha=2.35), and are also consistent with slopes in the range of
2<~\alpha<~2.6. They exclude steeper IMF slopes. The mean star formation rate
for a Salpeter IMF in the range of masses 0.6<~M<~100 M_sun within the last 100
Myr is 1.6x10^-4 M_sun yr^-1 kpc^-2.
