We introduce a formalism for handling general spaces of hierarchical tilings,
a category that includes substitution tilings, Bratteli-Vershik systems, S-adic
transformations, and multi-dimensional cut-and-stack transformations. We
explore ergodic, spectral and topological properties of these spaces. We show
that familiar properties of substitution tilings carry over under appropriate
assumptions, and give counter-examples where these assumptions are not met. For
instance, we exhibit a minimal tiling space that is not uniquely ergodic, with
one ergodic measure having pure point spectrum and another ergodic measure
having mixed spectrum. We also exhibit a 2-dimensional tiling space that has
pure point measure-theoretic spectrum but is topologically weakly mixing.
