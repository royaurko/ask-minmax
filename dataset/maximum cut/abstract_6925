The Carnot-like heat engines are classified into three types (normal-, sub-
and super-dissipative) according to relations between the minimum irreversible
entropy production in the "isothermal" processes and the time for completing
those processes. The efficiencies at maximum power of normal-, sub- and
super-dissipative Carnot-like heat engines are proved to be bounded between
$\eta_C/2$ and $\eta_C/(2-\eta_C)$, $\eta_C /2$ and $\eta_C$, 0 and
$\eta_C/(2-\eta_C)$, respectively. These bounds are also shared by linear, sub-
and super-linear irreversible Carnot-like engines [Tu and Wang, Europhys. Lett.

are inequivalent to each other.
