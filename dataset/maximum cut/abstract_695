A well known generalization of Alon's "splitting nacklace theorem" by
Longueville and Zivaljevic states that every k-colored n-dimensional cube can
be fairly split using only k cuts in each dimension. Here we prove that for
every t there exist a finite coloring (with at least (t+4)^d - (t+3)^d +
(t+2)^d - 2^d + d(t+2) +3 different colors) of R^n such that no n-dimensional
cube can be fairly split using at most t cuts in each dimension. In particular
there is a finite coloring of R^n such that no two disjoint n-dimensional cubes
have the same measure of each color.
