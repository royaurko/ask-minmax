We have calculated the decay $\tau \rightarrow \nu \pi(K) \gamma$. We present
the photon energy spectrum, the meson-photon invariant mass spectrum and the
integrated rate as a function of a photon energy cut or an invariant mass cut.
Both the internal bremsstrahlung and the structure dependent radiation have
been taken into account. To this aim we have parametrized the form factors
$F_V$ and $F_A$, which determine the structure dependent radiation. Observables
especially suited for the measurement of the structure dependent form factors
are found and implications on the width of the $a_1$ discussed.
