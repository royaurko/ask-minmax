We show that the Jaynes principle is indeed a proper inference scheme when
applied to compound systems and will correctly produce the entangled maximum
entropy states compatible with appropriate data. This is accomplished by
including the dispersion of the entanglement along with its mean value as
constraints and an application of the uncertainty principle. We also construct
a "thermodynamic-like" description of the entanglement arising out of the
maximum entropy principle.
