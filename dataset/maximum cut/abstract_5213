The scattering of an incident plane wave on two Aharonov-Bohm vortices with
opposite fluxes is considered in detail. The presence of the vortices imposes
non-trivial boundary conditions for the partial waves on a cut joining the two
vortices. These conditions result in an infinite system of equations for
scattering amplitudes between incoming and outgoing partial waves, which can be
solved numerically. The main focus of the paper is the analytic determination
of the scattering amplitude in two limits, the small flux limit and the limit
of small vortex separation. In the latter limit the dominant contribution comes
from the S-wave amplitude. Calculating it, however, still requires solving an
infinite system of equations, which is achieved by the Riemann-Hilbert method.
The results agree well with the numerical calculations.
