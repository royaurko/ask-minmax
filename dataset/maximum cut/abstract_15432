I analyze a linear instrumental variables model with a single endogenous
regressor in which the number of instruments is large. I construct a new
minimum distance objective function that is motivated by an invarianceproperty
of the model, and I use it to derive three main results. First, I show that,
with respect to a particular weight matrix, the minimum distance estimator is
equivalent to the random effects estimator of Chamberlain and Imbens (2004),
and that the estimator of the coefficient on the endogenous regressor coincides
with the limited information maximum likelihood (liml) estimator. Second, I
show that this weight matrix is inefficient unless the errors are Normal, and I
construct a new estimator based on the optimal weight matrix that is more
efficient than liml under many instrument asymptotics. Finally, I consider
minimum distance estimation when the reduced-form coefficients may not satisfy
a proportionality restriction. I show that the resulting estimator corresponds
to a version of the bias-corrected two-stage least squares estimator. I use the
minimum distance objective function to construct confidence intervals that
remain valid when the proportionality restriction is violated.
