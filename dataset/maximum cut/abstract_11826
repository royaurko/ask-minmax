Thin films of Nd$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$MnO$_{3}$ manganites with colossal
magnetoresistance (CMR) properties have been synthesized by the Pulsed Laser
Deposition technique on (100)-SrTiO$_{3}$. The lattice parameters of these
manganites and correlatively their CMR properties can be controlled by the
substrate temperature $T_{S}$. The maximum CMR effect at 75K, calculated as the
ratio $\rho (H=0T)/\rho (H=7T)$ is 10$^4$ for a deposition temperature of
$T_{S}=680$ degC. Structural studies show that the
Nd$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$MnO$_{3}$ film is single phase, [010]-oriented and has a
pseudocubic symmetry of the perovskite subcell with a=3.77$\AA$ at room
temperature. We suggest that correlation between lattice parameters, CMR and
substrate temperature $T_{S}$ result mainly from substrate-induced strains
which can weaken the charge-ordered state at low temperature.
