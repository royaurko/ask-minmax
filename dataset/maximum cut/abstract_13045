This paper proposes an autopilot system that can be used to control the small
scale rotorcraft during the flight test for linear-frequency-domain system
identification. The input frequency swept is generated automatically as part of
the autopilot control command. Therefore the bandwidth coverage and consistency
of the frequency swept is guaranteed to produce high quality data for system
identification. Beside that we can set the safety parameter during the flight
test (maximum roll or pitch value, minimum altitude, etc) so the safety of the
whole flight test is guaranteed. This autopilot for automated flight test will
be tested using hardware in the loop simulator for hover flight condition.
