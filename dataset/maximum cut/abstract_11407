The empirical relation between the X-ray luminosity (in the 2-10 keV band)
and the rate of spin-down energy loss of a sample of 37 pulsars is re-examined
considering recent data from ASCA, RXTE, BeppoSAX, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. The
data show a significant scatter around an average correlation computed
including statistical and systematic errors. All the X-ray luminosities are
found to lie below a critical line corresponding to a maximum efficiency of
conversion of rotational energy into X-rays varying between 0.1 and 80%. The
large dispersion of the X-ray luminosity below the critical line indicates that
other physical parameters uncorrelated with the period and period derivative
need to be included to account for the observed emission at X-ray energies. We
indicate a few possibilities that all conspire to lower the luminosity.
