We discuss the possibility that CPT violation may appear as a consequence of
microscopic decoherence due to quantum-gravity effects, that we describe using
a density-matrix formalism motivated by our studies of non-critical string
theory. The maximum possible order of magnitude of such decohering
CPT-violating effects is not far from the sensitivity of present experiments on
the neutral kaon system, and we review a simple parametrization for them. We
also review a recent data analysis carried out together with the CPLEAR
collaboration, which bounds any such decohering CPT-violating parameters to be
$\lappeq 10^{-19}$ GeV.
