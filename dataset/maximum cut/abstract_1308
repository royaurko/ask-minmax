In this paper we determine the contribution of a light stabilized radion to
the weak isospin violating $\rho$ parameter by using an ultraviolet momentum
cut off as the regulator. The LEP1 bound on $\rho^{new}$ is then used to derive
constraints on the radion mass $\mphi$ and its vev $\vphi$. Finally by using
the beta function of the higgs self coupling we have determined a lower bound
on the higgs mass from the rho parameter constraints on $\mphi$ and $\vphi$.
Our results show that for $\mphi <$ 600 GeV the rho parameter bound on $m_h$ is
stronger than the present direct bound from LEPII.
