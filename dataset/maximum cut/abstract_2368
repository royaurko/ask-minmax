We give a parametrization of the possible Serre invariants $(N,k,\nu)$ of
modular mod $\ell$ Galois representations of the exceptional types $A_4$,
$S_4$, $A_5$, in terms of local data attached to the fields cut out by the
associated projective representations. We show how this result combined with
certain global considerations leads to an effective procedure that will
determine for a given eigenform $f$ and prime $\ell$ whether a mod $\ell$
representation attached to $f$ is exceptional. We illustrate with numerical
examples.
