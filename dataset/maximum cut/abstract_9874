We prove that complete submanifolds, on which the Omori-Yau weak maximum
principle for the Hessian holds, with low codimension and bounded by cylinders
of small radius must have points rich in large positive extrinsic curvature.
The lower the codimension is, the richer such points are. The smaller the
radius is, the larger such curvatures are. This work unifies and generalizes
several previous results on submanifolds with nonpositive extrinsic curvature.
