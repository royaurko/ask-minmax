We study the cosmic peculiar velocity field as traced by a sample of 1184
spiral, elliptical and S0 galaxies, grouped in 704 objects. We carry out a
statistical analysis, by calculating bulk flows and velocity correlation
functions for this sample and for mock catalogs which we extract from N--body
simulations. For the simulations we consider tilted (i.e. with spectral index
$n\leq 1$) CDM models with different values of the linear bias parameter $b$.
By mean of a maximum likelihood analysis we estimate the ability of the models
in fitting the observations as measured by the above statistics and in
reproducing the Local Group properties.
