The effect of the charge ordering on the spin-Peierls (SP) state has been
examined by using a Peierls-Hubbard model at quarter-filling with dimerization,
on-site and nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions. By taking account of the
presence of dimerization, a bond distortion is calculated variationally with
the renormalization group method based on bosonization. When the charge
ordering appears at V=V_c with increasing the nearest-neighbor interaction (V),
the distortion exhibits a maximum due to competition between the dimerization
and the charge ordering. It is shown that the second-order phase transition
occurs from the SP state with the bond alternation to a mixed state with an
additional component of the site alternationat V = V_c.
