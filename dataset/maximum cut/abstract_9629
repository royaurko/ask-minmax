A transformation group approach to the prior for the parameters of the beta
distribution is suggested. The relationship between the beta distribution and
the Poisson and gamma distributions in the continuum is derived. Comparison to
the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters from an empirical
distribution of network links is performed. The effect of the prior on the
analysis of some well known examples from statistical genetics also is
examined. Use of the beta distribution in the classification problem is
discussed.
