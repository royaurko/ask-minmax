We discuss the link between uncorrelated noise and Hurst exponent for one and
two-dimensional interfaces. We show that long range correlations cannot be
observed using one-dimensional cuts through two-dimensional self-affine
surfaces whose height distributions are characterized by a Hurst exponent lower
than -1/2. In this domain, fractional and white noise are not distinguishable.
A method analysing the correlations in two dimensions is necessary. For Hurst
exponents larger than -1/2, a crossover regime leads to a systematic over
estimate of the Hurst exponent.
