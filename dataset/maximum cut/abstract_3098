A connection is made between the random turns model of vicious walkers and
random permutations indexed by their increasing subsequences. Consequently the
scaled distribution of the maximum displacements in a particular asymmeteric
version of the model can be determined to be the same as the scaled
distribution of the eigenvalues at the soft edge of the GUE. The scaling of the
distribution gives the maximum mean displacement $\mu$ after $t$ time steps as
$\mu = (2t)^{1/2}$ with standard deviation proportional to $\mu^{1/3}$. The
exponent 1/3 is typical of a large class of two-dimensional growth problems.
