The information entropy of a nuclear density distribution is calculated for a
number of nuclei. Various phenomenological models for the density distribution
using different geometry are employed. Nuclear densities calculated within
various microscopic mean field approaches are also employed. It turns out that
the entropy increases on going from crude phenomenological models to more
sophisticated (microscopic) ones. It is concluded that the larger the
information entropy, the better the quality of the nuclear density
distribution. An alternative approach is also examined: the net information
content i.e. the sum of information entropies in position and momentum space
$S_{r}+S_{k}$. It is indicated that $S_{r}+S_{k}$ is a maximum, when the best
fit to experimental data of the density and momentum distributions is attained.
