We compute the interference between the resonant process $pp\to H(\rightarrow
\gamma\gamma)+2 \text{ jets}$ and the corresponding continuum background at
leading order in QCD. For the Higgs signal, we include gluon fusion (GF) and
vector boson fusion (VBF) production channels, while for the background we
consider all tree-level contributions, including pure EW effects (${\cal
O}(\alpha_{QED}^4)$) and QCD contributions (${\cal O}(\alpha_{QED}^2
\alpha_{s}^2)$), plus the loop-induced gluon-initiated process. After
convolution with the experimental mass resolution, the main effect of the
interference is to shift the position of the mass peak, as in the inclusive GF
case studied previously. The apparent mass shift is small in magnitude but
strongly dependent on the Higgs width, potentially allowing for a measurement
of, or bound on, the width itself. In the $H(\rightarrow \gamma\gamma)+2 \text{
jets}$ channel, the VBF and GF contributions generate shifts of opposite signs
which largely cancel, depending on the sets of cuts used, to as little as 5 MeV
(toward a lower Higgs mass). The small magnitude of the shift makes this
channel a good reference mass for measuring the inclusive mass shift of around
60 MeV in the Standard Model.
