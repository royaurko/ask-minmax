A system H with a Hagedorn-like mass spectrum imparts its unique temperature
TH to any other system coupled to it. An H system radiates particles in
preexisting physical and chemical equilibrium. These particles form a saturated
vapor at temperature TH. This coexistence describes a first order phase
transition. An H system is nearly indifferent to fragmentation into smaller H
systems. A lower mass cut-off in the spectrum does not significantly alter the
general picture
