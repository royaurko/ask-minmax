A study of the dynamical fluctuation property of jets is carried out using
Monte Carlo method. The results suggest that, unlike the average properties of
the hadronic system inside jets, the anisotropy of dynamical fluctuations in
these systems changes abruptly with the variation of the cut parameter $\yct$.
A transition point exists, where the dynamical fluctuations in the hadronic
system inside jet behave like those in soft hadronic collisions, i.e. being
circular in the transverse plan with repect to dynamical fluctuations. This
finding obtained from Jetset and Herwig Monte Carlo is encouraged to be checked
by experiments.
