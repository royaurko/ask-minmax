Measurements of the ttbar production cross-section at \sqrt{s} = 1.96TeV in
proton-antiproton collisions were performed by the CDF and Dzero collaborations
using ttbar final states where both W's decay hadronically. Each experiment
uses luminosity of about 160pb^-1 of data collected during Run II of the
Fermilab Tevatron collider. Beside kinematical observables both experiments
take advantage of identifying b-jets based on lifetime tagging. While CDF
counts the number of b-tags over background after a cut based analysis, Dzero
counts the excess of events after a neural network based kinematical selection
and requiring a b-tagged jet.
  CDF obtains $\sigma_{ttbar}=7.8+-2.5{stat}^{+4.7}_{-2.3}{syst}; Dzero
$\sigma_{ttbar}=7.7^{+3.4}_{-3.3}{stat}^{+4.7}_{-3.8}{syst}+-0.5{lumi}.
