We develop an analytical approach to scalar field theory on the fuzzy sphere
based on considering a perturbative expansion of the kinetic term. This
expansion allows us to integrate out the angular degrees of freedom in the
hermitian matrices encoding the scalar field. The remaining model depends only
on the eigenvalues of the matrices and corresponds to a multitrace hermitian
matrix model. Such a model can be solved by standard techniques as e.g. the
saddle-point approximation. We evaluate the perturbative expansion up to second
order and present the one-cut solution of the saddle-point approximation in the
large N limit. We apply our approach to a model which has been proposed as an
appropriate regularization of scalar field theory on the plane within the
framework of fuzzy geometry.
