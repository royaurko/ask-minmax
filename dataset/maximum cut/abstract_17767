Within the confined isospin- and density-dependent mass model, we study the
properties of strange quark matter (SQM) and quark stars (QSs) under strong
magnetic fields. The equation of state of SQM under a constant magnetic field
is obtained self-consistently and the pressure perpendicular to the magnetic
field is shown to be larger than that parallel to the magnetic field, implying
that the properties of magnetized QSs generally depend on both the strength and
the orientation of the magnetic fields distributed inside the stars. Using a
density-dependent magnetic field profile which is introduced to mimic the
magnetic field strength distribution in a star, we study the properties of
static spherical QSs by assuming two extreme cases for the magnetic field
orientation in the stars, i.e., the radial orientation in which the local
magnetic fields are along the radial direction and the transverse orientation
in which the local magnetic fields are randomly oriented but perpendicular to
the radial direction. Our results indicate that including the magnetic fields
with radial (transverse) orientation can significantly decrease (increase) the
maximum mass of QSs, demonstrating the importance of the magnetic field
orientation inside the magnetized compact stars.
