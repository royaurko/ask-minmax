We investigate whether coagulation models of planet formation can explain the
observed size distributions of transneptunian objects (TNOs). Analyzing
published and new calculations, we demonstrate robust relations between the
size of the largest object and the slope of the size distribution for sizes 0.1
km and larger. These relations yield clear, testable predictions for TNOs and
other icy objects throughout the solar system. Applying our results to existing
observations, we show that a broad range of initial disk masses, planetesimal
sizes, and fragmentation parameters can explain the data. Adding dynamical
constraints on the initial semimajor axis of `hot' KBOs along with probable TNO
formation times of 10-700 Myr restricts the viable models to those with a
massive disk composed of relatively small (1-10 km) planetesimals.
