We study the co-evolution of network structure and node states in a model of
multiple state interacting agents. The system displays two transitions, network
recombination and fragmentation, governed by time scales that emerge from the
dynamics. The recombination transition separates a frozen configuration,
composed by disconnected network components whose agents share the same state,
from an active configuration, with a fraction of links that are continuously
being rewired. The nature of this transition is explained analytically as the
maximum of a characteristic time. The fragmentation transition, that appears
between two absorbing frozen phases, is an anomalous order-disorder transition,
governed by a crossover between the time scales that control the structure and
state dynamics.
