We show that the centered maximum of a sequence of log-correlated Gaussian
fields in any dimension converges in distribution, under the assumption that
the covariances of the fields converge in a suitable sense. We identify the
limit as a randomly shifted Gumbel distribution, and characterize the random
shift as the limit in distribution of a sequence of random variables,
reminiscent of the derivative martingale in the theory of Branching Random Walk
and Gaussian Chaos. We also discuss applications of the main convergence
theorem and discuss examples that show that for logarithmically correlated
fields, some additional structural assumptions of the type we make are needed
for convergence of the centered maximum.
