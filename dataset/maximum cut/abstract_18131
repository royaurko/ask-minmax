Nowadays the number of models aimed at explaining the Type Ia supernova
phenomenon is high and discriminating between them is a must-do. In this work
we explore the influence of rotation in the evolution of the nuclear flame
which drives the explosion in the so called gravitational confined detonation
models. Assuming that the flame starts in a point-like region slightly above
the center of the white dwarf (WD) and adding a moderate amount of angular
velocity to the star we follow the evolution of the deflagration using a
smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. We find that the results are very
dependent on the angle between the rotational axis and the line connecting the
initial bubble of burned material with the center of the white dwarf at the
moment of the ignition. The impact of rotation is larger for angles close to
90{\deg} because the Coriolis force on a floating element of fluid is maximum,
and its principal effect is to break the symmetry of the deflagration. Such
symmetry breaking weakens the convergence of the nuclear flame at the antipodes
of the initial ignition volume, changing the environmental conditions around
the convergence region with respect to non-rotating models. These changes seem
to disfavor the emergence of a detonation in the compressed volume at the
antipodes, thus compromising the viability of the so called gravitational
confined detonation mechanism.
