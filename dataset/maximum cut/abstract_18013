We present the statistics of the ratio, ${\cal R}$, between the prompt and
afterglow "plateau" fluxes of GRB. This we define as the ratio between the mean
prompt energy flux in {\em Swift} BAT and the {\em Swift} XRT one, immediately
following the steep transition between these two states and the beginning of
the afterglow stage referred to as the "plateau". Like the distribution of many
other GRB observables, the histogram of ${\cal R}$~ is log-normal with maximum
at a value ${\cal R}_m \simeq 2,000$, FWHM of about 2 decades and with the
entire distribution spanning about 5 decades in the value of ${\cal R}$. We
note that the peak of the distribution is close to the proton-to-electron mass
ratio $({\cal R}_m \simeq m_p/m_e = 1836)$, as proposed to be the case in an
earlier publication, on the basis of a specific model of the GRB dissipation
process. It therefore appears that, in addition to the values of the energy of
peak luminosity ${E_{\rm pk}\sim m_{e} c^2}$, GRB present us with one more
quantity with an apparent characteristic value. The fact that the values of
both these quantities (\Ep~and \R) are consistent with the same specific model
invoked to account for the efficient conversion of their relativistic proton
energies to electrons, argues favorably for its underlying assumptions.
