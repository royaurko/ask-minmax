In this paper we present a method to obtain resolutions of symplectic
orbifolds arising from symplectic reduction of a Hamiltonian S^1-manifold at a
regular value. As an application, we show that all isolated cyclic
singularities of a symplectic orbifold admit a resolution and that
pre-quantisations of symplectic orbifolds are symplectically fillable by a
smooth manifold.
