We study the transport properties of a superconducting Nb film with a square
lattice of artificial pinning centers (APCs) as a function of dc current, at a
temperature close to the superconducting transition temperature of the film. We
find that, at low dc currents, the differential resistance of the film shows
the standard matching field anomaly, that is, the differential resistance has a
local minimum at magnetic fields corresponding to an integer number of flux
lines per APC. However, at higher dc currents, the differential resistance at
each matching field turns to a local maximum, which is exactly opposite to the
low current behavior. This novel effect might indicate that the flux lines in
the APC system change their flow mode as the dc current is increased.
