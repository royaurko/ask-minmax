We discuss a minimal extension to the standard model in which there are two
Higgs bosons and, in addition to the usual fermion content, two fermion
doublets and one fermion singlet. The little hierachy problem is solved by the
vanishing of the one-loop corrections to the quadratic terms of the scalar
potential. The electro-weak ground state is therefore stable for values of the
cut off up to 10 TeV. The Higgs boson mass can take values significantly larger
than the current LEP bounds and still be consistent with electro-weak precision
measurements.
