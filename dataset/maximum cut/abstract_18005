In this paper, we consider a point to point full duplex (FD) MIMO
communication system. We assume that each node is equipped with an arbitrary
number of antennas which can be used for transmission or reception. With FD
radios, bidirectional information exchange between two nodes can be achieved at
the same time. In this paper we design bidirectional link selection schemes by
selecting a pair of transmit and receive antenna at both ends for
communications in each direction to maximize the weighted sum rate or minimize
the weighted sum symbol error rate (SER). The optimal selection schemes require
exhaustive search, so they are highly complex. To tackle this problem, we
propose a Serial-Max selection algorithm, which approaches the exhaustive
search methods with much lower complexity. In the Serial-Max method, the
antenna pairs with maximum "obtainable SINR" at both ends are selected in a
two-step serial way. The performance of the proposed Serial-Max method is
analyzed, and the closed-form expressions of the average weighted sum rate and
the weighted sum SER are derived. The analysis is validated by simulations.
Both analytical and simulation results show that as the number of antennas
increases, the Serial-Max method approaches the performance of the
exhaustive-search schemes in terms of sum rate and sum SER.
