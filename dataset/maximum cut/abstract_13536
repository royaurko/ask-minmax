The degrees-of-freedom of a K-user Gaussian interference channel (GIFC) has
been defined to be the multiple of (1/2)log_2(P) at which the maximum sum of
achievable rates grows with increasing P. In this paper, we establish that the
degrees-of-freedom of three or more user, real, scalar GIFCs, viewed as a
function of the channel coefficients, is discontinuous at points where all of
the coefficients are non-zero rational numbers. More specifically, for all K>2,
we find a class of K-user GIFCs that is dense in the GIFC parameter space for
which K/2 degrees-of-freedom are exactly achievable, and we show that the
degrees-of-freedom for any GIFC with non-zero rational coefficients is strictly
smaller than K/2. These results are proved using new connections with number
theory and additive combinatorics.
