We studied the crystal and magnetic structure of the
La$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ compound for $(0.11\leq x\leq 0.175)$ using
stoichiometric samples. For $x<0.13$ the system's ground state is insulating
canted antiferromagnetic. For $0.13\le x \le 0.175$ e below the Jahn Teller
transition temperature ($T_{\rm JT}$) the crystal structure undergoes a
monoclinic distortion. The crystal structure can be described with $P 2_1/c$
space group which permits two Mn sites. The unit cell strain parameter
$s=2(a-c)/(a+c)$ increases for $T<T_{\rm JT}$, taking the maximum value at the
Curie point, and then decreases. Below $T_{\rm M^/M^{//}}\approx 60 $ K $s$
abruptly changes slope and finally approaches T=0 K with nearly zero slope. The
change of $s$ at $T_{\rm M^/M^{//}}$ is connected to a characteristic feature
in the magnetic measurements. As $x$ increases towards the ferromagnetic
metallic boundary, although $s$ is reduced appreciably, the monoclinic
structure is preserved. The monoclinic structure is discussed with relation to
the orbital ordering, which can produce the ferromagnetic insulating ground
state. We also studied samples that were prepared in air atmosphere. This
category of samples shows ferromagnetic insulating behavior without following
the particular variation of the $s$ parameter. The crystal structure of these
samples is related to the so-called O$^{*}$ ($c>a>b/\sqrt{2}$) structure.
