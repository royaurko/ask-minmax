The performance of the Fingerprint recognition system will be more accurate
with respect of enhancement for the fingerprint images. In this paper we
develop a novel method for Fingerprint image contrast enhancement technique
based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and singular value decomposition
(SVD) has been proposed. This technique is compared with conventional image
equalization techniques such as standard general histogram equalization and
local histogram equalization. An automatic histogram threshold approach based
on a fuzziness measure is presented. Then, using an index of fuzziness, a
similarity process is started to find the threshold point. A significant
contrast between ridges and valleys of the best, medium and poor finger image
features to extract from finger images and get maximum recognition rate using
fuzzy measures. The experimental results show the recognition of superiority of
the proposed method to get maximum performance up gradation to the
implementation of this approach.
