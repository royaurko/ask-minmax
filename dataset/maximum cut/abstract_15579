We propose a new non-contact AFM scanning method allowing to retrieve
on-the-fly, the parameters that define the potential energy curve between the
tip and the sample. The underlining theory and methodology are introduced using
the Morse potential as a case study. The method involves feedback control that
maintains tip sample distance close to the maximum of the force gradient, and
measurement of the harmonics of the frequency shift of the cantilever. Both
analytical and numerical solutions are shown, with the latter capable of
accommodating finite amplitude of drive of the cantilever and a finite range of
position modulation of the tip-sample distance. The measurement of the Morse
potential was successfully demonstrated on a Si (111) surface. Assigning the
Morse parameters to color channels, such as RGB, one would obtain a color image
expressing differences in the local potential landscape and/or the species of
the atoms.
