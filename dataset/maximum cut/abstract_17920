In this paper, we revisit Janssen's (2003) formulation for the dynamic excess
kurtosis of weakly nonlinear gravity waves at deep water. For narrowband
directional spectra, the formulation is given by a sixfold integral that
depends upon the Benjamin-Feir index and the parameter
$R=\sigma_{\theta}^{2}/2\nu^{2}$, a measure of short-crestedness for the
dominant waves with $\nu$ and $\sigma_{\theta}$} denoting spectral bandwidth
and angular spreading. Our refinement leads to a new analytical solution for
the dynamic kurtosis of narrowband directional waves described with a Gaussian
type spectrum. For multidirectional or short-crested seas initially homogenous
and Gaussian, in a focusing (defocusing) regime dynamic kurtosis grows
initially, attaining a positive maximum (negative minimum) at the intrinsic
time scale \[
\tau_{c}=\nu^{2}\omega_{0}t_{c}=1/\sqrt{3R},\qquad\mathrm{or}\qquad
t_{c}/T_{0}\approx0.13/\nu\sigma_{\theta}, \] where $\omega_{0}=2\pi/T_{0}$
denotes the dominant angular frequency. Eventually the dynamic excess kurtosis
tends monotonically to zero as the wave field reaches a quasi-equilibrium state
characterized with nonlinearities mainly due to bound harmonics. Quasi-resonant
interactions are dominant only in unidirectional or long-crested seas where the
longer-time dynamic kurtosis can be larger than that induced by bound
harmonics, especially as the Benjamin-Feir index increases. Finally, we discuss
the implication of these results on the prediction of rogue waves.
