Multi-wavelength analysis of the young massive cluster VVV CL077 is presented
for the first time. Our Chandra survey of this region enabled the detection of
three X-ray emitting stellar members of the cluster, as well as a possible
diffuse X-ray component that extends a few arcseconds from the cluster core
with an intrinsic flux of (9+/-3)x10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.5-10 keV band.
Infrared spectra we obtained for two of these X-ray point sources show
absorption lines typical of the atmospheres of massive O stars. The X-ray
spectrum from the visible extent of VVV CL077 i.e., a 15"-radius around the
cluster, can be modeled with an absorbed power law with nH = (6+/-4)x10^22
cm^-2 and gamma = 2+/-1. In addition, the X-ray core of VVV CL077 coincides
with diffuse emission seen in the infrared band and with a local maximum in the
radio continuum map. A possible association with a neighboring H II region
would place VVV CL077 at a distance of around 11 kpc; on the far side of the
Norma Arm. At this distance, the cluster is 0.8 pc wide with a mass density of
(1-4)x10^3 Msol pc^-3.
