We study the dimensionally regularized fermion propagator Dyson-Schwinger
equation in quenched nonperturbative QED. We work in arbitrary covariant gauge
and perform nonperturbative renormalization numerically. The nonperturbative
fermion propagator is solved in D = 4 - 2 * epsilon dimensional Euclidean space
for a large number of values of epsilon. Results for D=4 dimensions are then
obtained by extrapolation to epsilon = 0. Here we present results using the
Curtis-Penningon fermion-photon proper vertex for two values of the coupling,
namely alpha=0.6 and alpha=1.5, and compare these to previous studies employing
a modified ultraviolet cut-off regularization. The results using the two
different regularizations are found to agree to within the numerical precision
of the present calculations.
