We show that quadratic divergences in top-quark condensation are cancelled
when the tadpoles cancel. This latter cancellation is naturally implemented as
the cancellation among the top-quark, Goldstone and Higgs contributions. We
also calculate the bosonic correction terms to Gribov's mass formula for the
Higgs boson. These reduce the prediction for M_H from 167 GeV to 132 GeV. The
tadpole cancellation condition by itself is an independent condition on the
mass of the Higgs boson which, in Gribov's U(1)_Y scenario, yields M_H \approx
117 GeV with large theoretical uncertainty. More generally, we are able to
obtain all three masses, M_W, m_t and M_H, in 100 MeV to 10 TeV energy range as
a function of the cut-off scale and the gauge couplings only.
