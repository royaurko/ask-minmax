Orthographic similarities across languages provide a strong signal for
probabilistic decipherment, especially for closely related language pairs. The
existing decipherment models, however, are not well-suited for exploiting these
orthographic similarities. We propose a log-linear model with latent variables
that incorporates orthographic similarity features. Maximum likelihood training
is computationally expensive for the proposed log-linear model. To address this
challenge, we perform approximate inference via MCMC sampling and contrastive
divergence. Our results show that the proposed log-linear model with
contrastive divergence scales to large vocabularies and outperforms the
existing generative decipherment models by exploiting the orthographic
features.
