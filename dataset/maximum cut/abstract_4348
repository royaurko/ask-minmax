We propose a sensitive way to test the anomalous HVV couplings (V=W^\pm, Z^0)
of the Higgs boson (H), which can arise from either the dimension-3 effective
operator in a nonlinearly realized Higgs sector or the dimension-6 effective
operators in a linearly realized Higgs sector, via studying the VV scattering
processes at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We show that, with an
integrated luminosity of 300 fb^{-1} and sufficient kinematical cuts for
suppressing the backgrounds, studying the process pp \to W^+ W^+ j j \to \l^+
\nu \l^+ \nu j j can probe the anomalous HWW couplings at a few tens of percent
level for the nonlinearly realized Higgs sector, and at the level of 0.01-0.08
TeV^{-1} for the linearly realized effective Lagrangian.
