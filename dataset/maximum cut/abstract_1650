We study the physical features of a class of exact solutions for cold compact
anisotropic stars. The effect of pressure anisotropy on the maximum mass and
surface redshift is analysed in the Vaidya-Tikekar model. It is shown that
maximum compactness, redshift and mass increase in the presence of anisotropic
pressures; numerical values are generated which are in agreement with
observation.
