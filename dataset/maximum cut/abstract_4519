The Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity r of a complex, projective variety V is an
upper bound for the degrees of the hypersurfaces necessary to cut out V. In
this note we give a bound for r when V is left invariant by a vector field on
the ambient projective space. More precisely, assume V is arithmetically
Cohen-Macaulay, for instance, a complete intersection. Assume as well that V
projects to a normal-crossings hypersurface, which is the case when V is a
curve with at most ordinary nodes. Then we show that r<m+s+2, where s is the
dimension of V and m is the degree of the vector field. Our method consists of
using first central projections to reduce the problem to when V is a
hypersurface, and then bounds given by Brunella and Mendes.
