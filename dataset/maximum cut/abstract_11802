We present a simple one-dimensional trapping model prompted by the problem of
ion current across biological membranes. The trap is modeled mimicking the
ionic channel membrane behaviour. Such voltage-sensitive channels are open or
closed depending on the value taken by a potential. Here we have assumed that
the external potential has two contributions: a determinist periodic and a
stochastic one. Our model shows a resonant-like maximum when we plot the
amplitude of the oscillations in the absorption current vs. noise intensity.
The model was solved both numerically and using an analytic approximation and
was found to be in good accord with numerical simulations.
