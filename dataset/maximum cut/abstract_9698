We report on the magnetic entropy change and the critical exponents in the
double perovskite manganite Y2NiMnO6 with a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic
transition TC=85K. For a magnetic field change of 80kOe, a maximum magnetic
entropy change -6.57 J /kg K is recorded around TC. The corresponding relative
cooling power (134 J / kg) is appreciable towards potential application as a
magnetic refrigerant. The critical exponents, beta and gamma satisfy well to
values derived for a 3D Heisenberg ferromagnet.
