We analyse observations, spanning 15 years, dedicated to the extreme
emission-line object Hen3-209. Our photometric data indicate that the
luminosity of the star undergoes marked variations with a peak-to-peak
amplitude of 0.65mag. These variations are recurrent, with a period of
16.093+-0.005d. The spectrum of Hen3-209 is peculiar with many different lines
(HI, HeI, FeII,...) showing P Cygni profiles. The line profiles are apparently
changing in harmony with the photometry. The spectrum also contains [OIII]
lines that display a saddle profile topped by three peaks, with a maximum
separation of about 600km/s. Hen3-209 is most likely an evolved luminous object
suffering from mass ejection events and maybe belonging to a binary system.
