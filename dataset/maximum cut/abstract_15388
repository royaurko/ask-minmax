We introduce an exactly-solvable model of random walk in random environment
that we call the Beta RWRE. This is a random walk in $\mathbb{Z}$ which
performs nearest neighbour jumps with transition probabilities drawn according
to the Beta distribution. We also describe a related directed polymer model,
which is a limit of the $q$-Hahn interacting particle system. Using a Fredholm
determinant representation for the quenched probability distribution function
of the walker's position, we are able to prove second order cube-root scale
corrections to the large deviation principle satisfied by the walker's
position, with convergence to the Tracy-Widom distribution. We also show that
this limit theorem can be interpreted in terms of the maximum of strongly
correlated random variables: the positions of independent walkers in the same
environment. The zero-temperature counterpart of the Beta RWRE can be studied
in a parallel way. We also prove a Tracy-Widom limit theorem for this model.
