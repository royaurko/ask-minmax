For continuous-variable systems, we introduce a measure of entanglement, the
continuous variable tangle ({\em contangle}), with the purpose of quantifying
the distributed (shared) entanglement in multimode, multipartite Gaussian
states. This is achieved by a proper convex roof extension of the squared
logarithmic negativity. We prove that the contangle satisfies the
Coffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy inequality in all three--mode Gaussian states,
and in all fully symmetric $N$--mode Gaussian states, for arbitrary $N$. For
three--mode pure states we prove that the residual entanglement is a genuine
tripartite entanglement monotone under Gaussian local operations and classical
communication. We show that pure, symmetric three--mode Gaussian states allow a
promiscuous entanglement sharing, having both maximum tripartite residual
entanglement and maximum couplewise entanglement between any pair of modes.
These states are thus simultaneous continuous-variable analogs of both the GHZ
and the $W$ states of three qubits: in continuous-variable systems monogamy
does not prevent promiscuity, and the inequivalence between different classes
of maximally entangled states, holding for systems of three or more qubits, is
removed.
