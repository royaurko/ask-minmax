Monte Carlo simulation performed on a lattice system of biaxial molecules
possessing $D_{2h}$ symmetry and interacting with a second rank anisotropic
dispersion potential yields three distinct macroscopic phases depending on the
biaxiality of the constituent molecules. The phase diagram of such a system as
a function of molecular biaxiality is greatly modified when a transverse dipole
is considered to be associated with each molecule so that the symmetry is
reduced to $C_{2v}$. Our results indicate the splitting of the Landau point
i.e. the point in the phase diagram where a direct transition from the
isotropic phase to the biaxial nematic phase occurs, into a Landau line for a
system of biaxial molecules with strong transverse dipoles. The width of the
Landau line becomes maximum for an optimal value of the relative dipolar
strength. The presence of transverse dipoles leads to the stabilization of the
thermotropic biaxial nematic phase at higher temperature and for a range of
values of molecular biaxiality. The structural properties in the uniaxial and
biaxial phases are investigated by evaluating the first rank and second rank
orientational correlation functions. The dipole induced long range order of the
anti-ferroelectric structure in the biaxial nematic phase, is revealed.
