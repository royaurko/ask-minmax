In this second part of our investigation of the analytic structure of the
$2\to5$ scattering amplitude in the planar limit of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM in
multi-Regge kinematics we compute, in all kinematic regions, the Regge cut
contributions in leading order. The results are infrared finite and conformally
invariant.
