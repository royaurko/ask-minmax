We present a novel method for combining the analog and photon-counting
measurements of lidar transient recorders into reconstructed photon returns.
The method takes into account the statistical properties of the two measurement
modes and estimates the most likely number of arriving photons and the most
likely values of acquisition parameters describing the two measurement modes.
It extends and improves the standard combining ("gluing") methods and does not
rely on any ad hoc definitions of the overlap region nor on any ackground
subtraction methods.
