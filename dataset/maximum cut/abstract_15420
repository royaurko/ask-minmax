We have investigated temperature trends of the microscopic structure of the
SPC/E and TIP4P-Ew water models in terms of the pair distribution functions,
coordination numbers, the average number of hydrogen bonds, the distribution of
bonding states of a single molecule as well as the angular distribution of
molecules by using the constant pressure molecular dynamics simulations. The
evolution of the structure is put in correspondence with the dependence of
water density on high temperatures down to the region of temperatures where the
system becomes supercooled. It is shown that the fraction of molecules with
three and four bonds determine the maximum density for both models. Moreover,
the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant is obtained and analyzed.
