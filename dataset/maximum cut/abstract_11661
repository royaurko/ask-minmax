Surveys provide a wealth of data to the astronomical community that are used
well after their completion. In this paper, we propose a project that would
take the maximum benefit of Dome C in Antarctica by performing two surveys, in
the wavelength range from 1-5 micron, complementary to SNAP space surveys. The
first one over 1000 sq. deg. (1 KdF) for 4 years and the second one over 15 sq.
deg (SNAP-IR) for the next 4 years at the same time as SNAP 0.35-1.7 microns
survey. By using a Ground-Layer Adaptive Optics system, we would be able to
recover, at the ice level and over at least half a degree in radius, the 300
mas angular resolution available above the 30-m high turbulent layer. Such a
survey, combining a high angular resolution with high sensitivities in the NIR
and MIR, should also play the role of a pre-survey for JWST and ALMA.
