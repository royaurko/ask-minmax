We investigate the model dependence of no-helicity flip generalized parton
distribution of the pion upon different approaches for the quark-hadron and
quark-photon vertexes, in the spacelike region. In order to obtain information
on contributions from both the valence and non-valence regions, we compare
results for spacelike momentum transfers obtained from i) an analytic covariant
model with a bare quark-photon vertex, ii) a Light-front approach with a
quark-photon vertex dressed through a microscopic vector-meson model and iii) a
Light-front approach based on the Relativistic Hamiltonian Dynamics. Our
comparisons lead to infer the same dynamical mechanism, the one-gluon-exchange
dominance at short distances, as a source of both the electromagnetic form
factor at large momentum transfer and the parton distribution close to the
end-points. The expected collinear behavior of the generalized parton
distributions at high momentum transfer, i.e. a maximum for $x\sim 1$, is also
illustrated, independently of the different approaches. Finally a comparison
with recent Lattice calculations of the gravitational form factors is
presented.
