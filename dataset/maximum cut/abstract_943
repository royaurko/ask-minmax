Spatial-temporal linear model and the corresponding likelihood-based
statistical inference are important tools for the analysis of spatial-temporal
lattice data. In this paper, we study the asymptotic properties of maximum
likelihood estimates under a general asymptotic framework for spatial-temporal
linear models. We propose mild regularity conditions on the spatial-temporal
weight matrices and derive the asymptotic properties (consistency and
asymptotic normality) of maximum likelihood estimates. A simulation study is
conducted to examine the finite-sample properties of the maximum likelihood
estimates.
