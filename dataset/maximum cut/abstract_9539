In this paper a new lifetime distribution which is obtained by compounding
Lindley and geometric distributions, named Lindley-geometric (LG) distribution,
is introduced. Several properties of the new distribution such as density,
failure rate, mean lifetime, moments, and order statistics are derived.
Furthermore, estimation by maximum likelihood and inference for large sample
are discussed. The paper is motivated by two applications to real data sets and
we hope that this model be able to attract wider applicability in survival and
reliability.
