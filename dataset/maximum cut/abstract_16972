In this paper we study the dynamics of toroidal flux tubes emerging from the
solar interior, through the photosphere and into the corona. Many previous
theoretical studies of flux emergence use a twisted cylindrical tube in the
solar interior as the initial condition. Important insights can be gained from
this model, however, it does have shortcomings. The axis of the tube never
fully emerges as dense plasma becomes trapped in magnetic dips and restrains
its ascent. Also, since the entire tube is buoyant, the main photospheric
footpoints (sunspots) continually drift apart. These problems make it difficult
to produce a convincing sunspot pair. We aim to address these problems by
considering a different initial condition, namely a toroidal flux tube. We
perform numerical experiments and solve the 3D MHD equations. The dynamics are
investigated through a range of initial field strengths and twists. The
experiments demonstrate that the emergence of toroidal flux tubes is highly
dynamic and exhibits a rich variety of behaviour. In answer to the aims,
however, if the initial field strength is strong enough, the axis of the tube
can fully emerge. Also, the sunspot pair does not continually drift apart.
Instead, its maximum separation is the diameter of the original toroidal tube.
