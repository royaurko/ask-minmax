Let $G=(V,E)$ be a multigraph (it has multiple edges, but no loops). We call
$G$ maximally edge-connected if $\lambda(G)=\delta(G)$, and $G$ super
edge-connected if every minimum edge-cut is a set of edges incident with some
vertex. The restricted edge-connectivity $\lambda'(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum
number of edges whose removal disconnects $G$ into non-trivial components. If
$\lambda'(G)$ achieves the upper bound of restricted edge-connectivity, then
$G$ is said to be $\lambda'$-optimal. A bipartite multigraph is said to be
half-transitive if its automorphism group is transitive on the sets of its
bipartition. In this paper, we will characterize maximally edge-connected
half-transitive multigraphs, super edge-connected half-transitive multigraphs,
and $\lambda'$-optimal half-transitive multigraphs.
