Hard X-ray emissions from a Herbig Be star MWC297 were discovered in three
separate observations spanning 5 days in April 1994 with the Advanced Satellite
for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA). An X-ray flare was found at the
beginning of the second observation with a maximum luminosity of 4.9E32 ergs/s,
which is five times larger than that of the quiescent phase (the first
observation). It then declined with an e-folding time of ~5.6E4 sec to the
pre-flare level in the third observation. The X-ray spectra are explained by
absorbed thin-thermal plasma models. The temperature in the quiescent phase of
about 2.7 keV is significantly higher than that of main-sequence OB stars and
similar to low mass young stellar objects (YSOs) and other Herbig Ae/Be stars
observed with ASCA. The temperature increased in the flare phase to about 6.7
keV at the flux maximum, then decreased to 3.2 keV in the decay phase.
  These facts strongly suggest that X-rays from Herbig Ae/Be stars, at least
for MWC297, are attributable to magnetic activity similar to low mass YSOs.
Since no theory predicts surface convection zone in massive stars like MWC297,
our results may require a mechanism other than the conventional stellar dynamo
theory. Possible magnetic activity could be either the stellar interior shear
or the inherited magnetic field from the parent molecular cloud.
