We describe the general geometrical framework of brane world constructions in
orientifolds of type IIA string theory with D6-branes wrapping 3-cycles in a
Calabi-Yau 3-fold, and point out their immediate phenomenological relevance.
These branes generically intersect in points, and the patterns of intersections
govern the chiral fermion spectra and issues of gauge and supersymmetry
breaking in the low energy effective gauge theory on their world volume. In
particular, we provide an example of an intersecting brane world scenario on
the quintic Calabi-Yau with the gauge group and the chiral spectrum of the
Standard Model and discuss its properties in some detail. Additionally we
explain related technical advancements in the construction of supersymmetric
orientifold vacua with intersecting D-branes. Six-dimensional orientifolds of
this type generalize the rather limited set of formerly known orbifolds of type
I, and the presented techniques provide a short-cut to obtain their spectra.
Finally, we comment on lifting configurations of intersecting D6-branes to
M-theory on non-compact G_2 manifolds.
