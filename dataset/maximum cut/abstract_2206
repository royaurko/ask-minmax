The minimal dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking through top condensation
in the presence of compact large extra dimensions is studed. It is shown that
thanks to the power-low evolution of gauge and Yukawa couplings the original
BHL predictions for the top quark mass are significantly lowered and even for
small cut-off scale $\Lambda \sim few$ TeV one can obtain experimentally
allowed values.
