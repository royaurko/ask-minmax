For $n\in\nats$ and $3\leq k\leq n$ we compute the exact value of $E_k(n)$,
the maximum number of edges of a simple planar graph on $n$ vertices where each
vertex bounds an $\ell$-gon where $\ell\geq k$. The lower bound of $E_k(n)$ is
obtained by explicit construction, and the matching upper bound is obtained by
using Integer Programming (IP.) We then use this result to conjecture the
maximum number of edges of a non-flowerable coin graph on $n$ vertices. A {\em
flower} is a coin graph representation of the wheel graph. A collection of
coins or discs in the Euclidean plane is {\em non-flowerable} if no flower can
be formed by coins from the collection.
