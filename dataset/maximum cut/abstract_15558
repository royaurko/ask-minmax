The weak Bruhat order on $ { \mathcal S }_n $ is the partial order $\prec$ so
that $\sigma \prec \tau$ whenever the set of inversions of $\sigma$ is a subset
of the set of inversions of $\tau$. We investigate the time complexity of
computing the size of intervals with respect to $\prec$. Using relationships
between two-dimensional posets and the weak Bruhat order, we show that the size
of the interval $ [ \sigma_1, \sigma_2 ]$ can be computed in polynomial time
whenever $\sigma_1^{-1} \sigma_2$ has bounded width (length of its longest
decreasing subsequence) or bounded intrinsic width (maximum width of any
non-monotone permutation in its block decomposition). Since permutations of
intrinsic width $1$ are precisely the separable permutations, this greatly
extends a result of Wei. Additionally, we show that, for large $n$, all but a
vanishing fraction of permutations $ \sigma$ in $ { \mathcal S }_n$ give rise
to intervals $ [ id , \sigma ]$ whose sizes can be computed with a
sub-exponential time algorithm. The general question of the difficulty of
computing the size of arbitrary intervals remains open.
