The properties of the gauge invariant two-point quark Green's function are
studied in the large-Nc limit of two-dimensional QCD. The analysis is done by
means of an exact integrodifferential equation. The Green's function is found
infrared finite, with singularities in the momentum squared variable
represented by an infinite number of threshold type branch points with a power
-3/2, starting at positive mass squared values, with cuts lying on the positive
real axis. The expression of the Green's function is analytically determined.
