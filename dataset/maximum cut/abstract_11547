We discuss the expansion velocities of different elements in the ejecta of
the intermediate-z SNe Ia discovered as a part of the International Time
Programme (ITP) project ``Omega and Lambda from Supernovae and the Physics of
 Supernova Explosions'' at the European Northern Observatory (ENO). The
expansion velocities measured for each normal SNIa are found to be within the
typical velocity dispersion for their epoch. Meanwhile, the subluminous SN
2002lk SiII expansion velocity is significantly higher than that of SN 1991bg
shortly after maximum. The observed phase was younger in SN2002lk than in the
local subluminous SNIa SN1991bg.
