We present a comprehensive catalog of ultraviolet HST/STIS and FUSE absorbers
in the low-redshift IGM at z<0.4. The catalog draws from the extensive
literature on IGM absorption, and it reconciles discrepancies among previous
catalogs through a critical evaluation of all reported absorption features in
light of new HST/COS data. We report on 746 HI absorbers down to a rest-frame
equivalent width of 12 milliAngstroms over a maximum redshift path length
Deltaz=5.38. We also confirm 111 OVI absorbers, 29 CIV absorbers, and numerous
absorption features due to other metal ions. We characterize the distribution
of absorber line frequency as a function of column density as a power law,
dN/dz \propto N^{-beta}, where beta=2.08+-0.12 for OVI and beta=1.68+-0.03 for
HI. Utilizing a more sophisticated accounting technique than past work, the
catalog accounts for ~43% of the baryons: 24+-2% in the photoionized Ly-alpha
forest and 19+-2% in the WHIM as traced by OVI. We discuss the large systematic
effects of various assumed metallicities and ionization states on these
calculations, and we implement recent simulation results in our estimates.
