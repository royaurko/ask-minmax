In this paper, we propose a novel approach for texture analysis based on
artificial crawler model. Our method assumes that each agent can interact with
the environment and each other. The evolution process converges to an
equilibrium state according to the set of rules. For each textured image, the
feature vector is composed by signatures of the live agents curve at each time.
Experimental results revealed that combining the minimum and maximum signatures
into one increase the classification rate. In addition, we pioneer the use of
autonomous agents for characterizing silk fibroin scaffolds. The results
strongly suggest that our approach can be successfully employed for texture
analysis.
