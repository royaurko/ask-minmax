It is suggested that recent superluminal neutrinos from the OPERA
collaboration might indicate that there are other ultimate speeds than usual
speed of light in our universe. The leptonic sector of the standard model (SM)
is reformulated incorporating with new ultimate speeds. In minimal cases where
there is another maximum speed $c'$ which equals to the speed of the OPERA
neutrinos, new effects would appear at the level of ${\cal O}(10^{-5})$.
Improved precisions for the electroweak observables would check the validity of
this scenario.
