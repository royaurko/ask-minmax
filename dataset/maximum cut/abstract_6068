In this article we describe the semi-classical spectrum of a Schrodinger
operator on $\mathbb{R}$ with a double well potential. We study the shape of
spectrum around the local maximum of the potential. In the classification of
singularities of integrable systems, the double wells is the model of
non-degenerate hyperbolic singularity.
