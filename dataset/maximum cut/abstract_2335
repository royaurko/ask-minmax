The emergence of conformal states is established for any problem involving a
domain of scales where the long-range, SO(2,1) conformally invariant
interaction is applicable. Whenever a clear-cut separation of ultraviolet and
infrared cutoffs is in place, this renormalization mechanism produces binding
in the strong-coupling regime. A realization of this phenomenon, in the form of
dipole-bound anions, is discussed.
