We present several results on the mixing time of the Glauber dynamics for
sampling from the Gibbs distribution in the ferromagnetic Potts model. At a
fixed temperature and interaction strength, we study the interplay between the
maximum degree ($\Delta$) of the underlying graph and the number of colours or
spins ($q$) in determining whether the dynamics mixes rapidly or not. We find a
lower bound $L$ on the number of colours such that Glauber dynamics is rapidly
mixing if at least $L$ colours are used. We give a closely-matching upper bound
$U$ on the number of colours such that with probability that tends to 1, the
Glauber dynamics mixes slowly on random $\Delta$-regular graphs when at most
$U$ colours are used. We show that our bounds can be improved if we restrict
attention to certain types of graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, e.g. toroidal
grids for $\Delta = 4$.
