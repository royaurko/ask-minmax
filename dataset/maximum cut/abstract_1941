We report the timing and broad-band spectral properties of the Be transient
high mass X-ray binary pulsar GRO J1008-57 using a Suzaku observation in the
declining phase of its 2007 November-December outburst. Pulsations with a
period of 93.737 s were clearly detected in the light curves of the pulsar up
to the 80-100 keV energy band. The pulse profile was found to be strongly
energy dependent, a double peaked profile at soft X-ray energy bands (< 8 keV)
and a single peaked smooth profile at hard X-rays. The broad-band energy
spectrum of the pulsar, reported for the first instance in this paper, is well
described with three different continuum models viz. (i) a high energy cut-off
power-law, (ii) a Negative and Positive power-law with EXponential cut-off
(NPEX), and (iii) a partial covering power-law with high energy cut-off.
Inspite of large value of absorption column density in the direction of the
pulsar, a blackbody component of temperature ~0.17 keV for the soft excess was
required for the first two continuum models. A narrow iron K_\alpha emission
line was detected in the pulsar spectrum. The partial covering model, however,
is found to explain the phase averaged and phase resolved spectra well. The dip
like feature in the pulse profile can be explained by the presence of an
additional absorption component with high column density and covering fraction
at the same pulse phase. The details of the results are described in the paper.
