Time-dependent resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations are carried out to
study a flux rope eruption caused by magnetic reconnection with implication in
coexistent flare-CME (coronal mass ejection) events. An early result obtained
in a recent analysis of double catastrophe of a flux rope system is used as the
initial condition, in which an isolated flux rope coexists with two current
sheets: a vertical one below and a transverse one above the flux rope. The flux
rope erupts when reconnection takes place in the current sheets, and the flux
rope dynamics depends on the reconnection sequence in the two current sheets.
Three cases are discussed: reconnection occurs (1) simultaneously in the two
current sheets, (2) first in the transverse one and then in the vertical, and
(3) in an order opposite to case 2. Such a two-current-sheet reconnection
exhibits characteristics of both magnetic breakout for CME initiation and
standard flare model. We argue that both breakout-like and tether-cutting
reconnections may be important for CME eruptions and associated surface
activities.
