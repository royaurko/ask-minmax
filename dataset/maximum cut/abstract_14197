We have measured the low temperature electrical resistivity of Ag : Mn
mesoscopic spin glasses prepared by ion implantation with a concentration of
700 ppm. As expected, we observe a clear maximum in the resistivity (T ) at a
temperature in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Moreover, we
observe remanence effects at very weak magnetic fields for the resistivity
below the freezing temperature Tsg: upon Field Cooling (fc), we observe clear
deviations of (T ) as compared with the Zero Field Cooling (zfc); such
deviations appear even for very small magnetic fields, typically in the Gauss
range. This onset of remanence for very weak magnetic fields is reminiscent of
the typical signature on magnetic susceptibility measurements of the spin glass
transition for this generic glassy system.
