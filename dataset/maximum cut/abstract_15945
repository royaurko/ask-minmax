Cooling of neutron stars (NSs) with the cores composed of neutrons, protons,
and electrons is simulated assuming $^1$S$_0$ pairing of neutrons in the NS
crust, and also $^1$S$_0$ pairing of protons and weak $^3$P$_2$ pairing of
neutrons in the NS core, and using realistic density profiles of the superfluid
critical temperatures $T_{\rm c}(\rho)$. The theoretical cooling models of
isolated middle-aged NSs can be divided into three main types. (I) {\it
Low-mass}, {\it slowly cooling} NSs where the direct Urca process of neutrino
emission is either forbidden or almost fully suppressed by the proton
superfluidity. (II) {\it Medium-mass} NSs which show {\it moderate} cooling via
the direct Urca process suppressed by the proton superfluidity. (III) {\it
Massive} NSs which show {\it fast} cooling via the direct Urca process weakly
suppressed by superfluidity. Confronting the theory with observations we treat
RX J0822--43, PSR 1055--52 and RX J1856--3754 as slowly cooling NSs. To explain
these sufficiently warm sources we need a density profile $T_{\rm c}(\rho)$ in
the crust with a rather high and flat maximum and sharp wings. We treat 1E
1207--52, RX J0002+62, PSR 0656+14, Vela, and Geminga as moderately cooling
NSs. We can determine their masses for a given model of proton superfluidity,
$T_{\rm cp}(\rho)$, and the equation of state in the NS core. No rapidly
cooling NS has been observed so far.
