We discuss theoretical predictions for W-pair production and decay at LEP2
and higher energies in a form suitable for comparison with raw data. We present
a practical framework for calculating uncertainties of predictions given by the
KORALW and grc4f Monte Carlo programs. As an example we use observables in the
$s\bar s c\bar c$ decay channel: the total four-quark (four-jet) cross section
and two-quark/jet invariant-mass distribution and cross section, in the case
when the other two may escape detection. Effects of QED bremsstrahlung,
effective couplings, running W and Z widths, Coulomb interaction and the
complete tree level set of diagrams are discussed. We also revisit the question
of technical precision of the new version 1.21 of the KORALW Monte Carlo code
as well as of version 1.2(26) of the grc4f one.
  Finally we find predictions of the two programs to have an overall physical
uncertainty of 2%.
  As a side result we show, on the example of an $s\bar s$ invariant mass
distribution, the strong interplay of spin correlations and detector cut-offs
in the case of four-fermion final states.
