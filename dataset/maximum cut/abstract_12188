In elemental Bismuth, 10$^5$ atoms share a single itinerant electron.
Therefore, a moderate magnetic field can confine electrons to the lowest Landau
level. We report on the first study of metallic thermoelectricity in this
regime. The main thermoelectric response is off-diagonal with an oscillating
component several times larger than the non-oscillating background. When the
first Landau level attains the Fermi Energy, both the Nernst and the
Ettingshausen coefficients sharply peak, and the latter attains a
temperature-independent maximum. A qualitative agreement with a theory invoking
current-carrying edge excitations is observed.
