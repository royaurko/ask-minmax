A feasibility study is presented for the search of the lightest bottom squark
(sbottom) in a compressed scenario, where its mass difference from the lightest
neutralino is 5 GeV. Two separate studies are performed: $(1)$ final state
containing two VBF-like tagging jets, missing transverse energy, and zero or
one $b$-tagged jet; and $(2)$ final state consisting of initial state radiation
(ISR) jet, missing transverse energy, and at least one $b$-tagged jet. An
analysis of the shape of the missing transverse energy distribution for signal
and background is performed in each case, leading to significant improvement
over a cut and count analysis, especially after incorporating the consideration
of systematics and pileup. The shape analysis in the VBF-like tagging jet study
leads to a $3\sigma$ exclusion potential of sbottoms with mass up to $530 \,
(462)$ GeV for an integrated luminosity of $300$ fb$^{-1}$ at 14 TeV, with
$5\%$ systematics and PU $= 0 \, (50)$.
