Objective determination of a star formation history from a colour-magnitude
diagram, independently of assumed parametric descriptions, is necessary to
determine the evolutionary history of a galaxy. We introduce a new method for
solving maximum likelihood problems through variational calculus, and apply it
to the case of recovering an unknown star formation history, SFR(t), from a
colour-magnitude diagram. This method provides a non-parametric solution with
the advantage of requiring no initial assumptions on the SFR(t). As a full
maximum likelihood statistical model is used, one may exploit all the
information available in the photometric data which can be explained by
available isochrones. Extensive tests of the method show it to be reliable
under noise conditions comparable to those appropriate for real observations.
Implications for future surveys, such as the GAIA mission are significant:
accurate determination of the evolutionary history of the Milky Way is limited
only by adequate spectroscopy and/or photometry to provide a determination of
stellar metallicity and temperature for a sufficient sample of stars of
luminosities at and above an old main-sequence turnoff.
