An index for the characterisation of the Perovskite type Superconductors is
introduced. The index, denominated as Structural Parameter of High Tc
Superconductivity (PESATc from its name in Spanish), is calculated using a
Moebius Orbital defined as the length of an Octahedral Moebius Strip overlaying
the octahedra created by the CuO planes and the apical Oxygen atoms, O(4).
Results for structures of YBCO:123 type compounds are presented; their atomic
positions were measured by neutron diffraction and x-ray diffraction techniques
as reported in the literature. It has been found that critical temperature
depends on the value of the measured structural parameter; furthermore, for a
set of RBCO compounds there is a lineal response between Tc and PESATc. In the
former case, a specific range for the superconducting behaviour is established
by PESATc values, and a well-defined point for the maximum Tc is found. In the
latter one, a slope of 4.515 with correlation coefficient of 0.9402 was found
when seven Rare Earth compounds were considered. The only compound that goes
out from this trend, is the La based compound.
