We analytically calculate the intrinsic spin-Hall conductivity (ISHC)
($\sigma^z_{xy}$ and $\sigma^z_{yx}$) in a clean, two-dimensional system with
generic k-linear spin-orbit interaction. The coefficients of the product of the
momentum and spin components form a spin-orbit matrix $\widetilde{\beta}$. We
find that the determinant of the spin-orbit matrix $\detbeta$ describes the
effective coupling of the spin $s_z$ and orbital motion $L_z$. The decoupling
of spin and orbital motion results in a sign change of the ISHC and the
band-overlapping phenomenon. Furthermore, we show that the ISHC is in general
unsymmetrical ($\sigma^z_{xy}\neq-\sigma^z_{yx}$), and it is governed by the
asymmetric response function $\Deltabeta$, which is the difference in
band-splitting along two directions: those of the applied electric field and
the spin-Hall current. The obtained non-vanishing asymmetric response function
also implies that the ISHC can be larger than $e/8\pi$, but has an upper bound
value of $e/4\pi$. We will that the unsymmetrical properties of the ISHC can
also be deduced from the manifestation of the Berry curvature at the nearly
degenerate area. On the other hand, by investigating the equilibrium spin
current, we find that $\detbeta$ determines the field strength of the SU(2)
non-Abelian gauge field.
