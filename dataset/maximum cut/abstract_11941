We present the results of an experimental study of superconducting,
disordered, thin-films of amorphous Indium Oxide. These films can be driven
from the superconducting phase to a reentrant insulating state by the
application of a perpendicular magnetic field ($B$). We find that the high-$B$
insulator exhibits activated transport with a characteristic temperature,
$T_I$. $T_I$ has a maximum value ($T_{I}^p$) that is close to the
superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) at $B$ = 0, suggesting a
possible relation between the conduction mechanisms in the superconducting and
insulating phases. $T_{I}^p$ and $T_c$ display opposite dependences on the
disorder strength.
