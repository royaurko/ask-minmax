We analyze the effect of atmospheric Kolmogorov turbulence on entangled
orbital angular momentum states generated by parametric down-conversion. We
calculate joint and signal photon detection probabilities and obtain
numerically their dependence on the mode-width-to-Fried-parameter ratio. We
demonstrate that entangled photons are less robust to the effects of Kolmogorov
turbulence compared to single photons. In contrast, signal photons are more
robust than single photons in the lowest-order mode. We also obtain numerically
a scaling relation between the value of the mode-width-to-Fried-parameter ratio
for which the joint detection probabilities is a maximum and the momentum
mismatch between signal and idler photons after propagation through the medium.
