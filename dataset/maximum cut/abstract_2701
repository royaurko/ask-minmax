Our goal is to improve the acceptance and angular resolution of VERITAS by
implementing a camera image-fitting algorithm. Elliptical image parameters are
extracted from 2D Gaussian distribution fits using a (chi)^2 minimization
instead of the standard technique based on the principle moments of an island
of pixels above threshold. We optimize the analysis cuts and then characterize
the improvements using simulations. We find an improvement of 20% less
observing time to reach 5-sigma for weak point sources.
