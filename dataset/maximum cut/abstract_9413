The \emph{stationary set splitting game} is a game of perfect information of
length $\omega_{1}$ between two players, \unspls and \spl, in which \unspls
chooses stationarily many countable ordinals and \spls tries to continuously
divide them into two stationary pieces. We show that it is possible in ZFC to
force a winning strategy for either player, or for neither. This gives a new
counterexample to $\Sigma^{2}_{2}$ maximality with a predicate for the
nonstationary ideal on $\omega_{1}$, and an example of a consistently
undetermined game of length $\omega_{1}$ with payoff definable in the
second-order monadic logic of order. We also show that the determinacy of the
game is consistent with Martin's Axiom but not Martin's Maximum.
