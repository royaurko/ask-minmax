In this work, we investigate the holographic dark energy model with new
infrared cut-off (new HDE model) proposed by Granda and Oliveros. Using this
new definition for infrared cut-off, we establish the correspondence between
new HDE model and standard Chaplygin gas (SCG), generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG)
and modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) scalar field models in non-flat universe. The
potential and dynamics for these scalar field models, which describe the
accelerated expansion of the universe are reconstructed. According to the
evolutionary behavior of new HDE model, we derive the same form of dynamics and
potential for different SCG, GCG and MCG models. We also calculate the squared
sound speed of new HDE model as well as for SCG, GCG and MCG models and
investigate the new HDE Chaplygin gas models from the viewpoint of linear
perturbation theory. All results in non-flat universe are also discussed in the
limiting case of flat universe, i.e. $k=0$.
