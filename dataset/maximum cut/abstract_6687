The equations of state for neutron matter, strange and non-strange hadronic
matter in a chiral SU(3) quark mean field model are applied in the study of
slowly rotating neutron stars and hadronic stars. The radius, mass, moment of
inertia, and other physical quantities are carefully examined. The effect of
nucleon crust for the strange hadronic star is exhibited. Our results show the
rotation can increase the maximum mass of compact stars significantly. For big
enough mass of pulsar which can not be explained as strange hadronic star, the
theoretical approaches to increase the maximum mass are addressed.
