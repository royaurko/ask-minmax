An image restoration approach based on a Bayesian maximum entropy method
(MEM) has been applied to a radiological image deconvolution problem, that of
reduction of geometric blurring in magnification mammography. The aim of the
work is to demonstrate an improvement in image spatial resolution in realistic
noisy radiological images with no associated penalty in terms of reduction in
the signal-to-noise ratio perceived by the observer. Images of the TORMAM
mammographic image quality phantom were recorded using the standard
magnification settings of 1.8 magnification/fine focus and also at 1.8
magnification/broad focus and 3.0 magnification/fine focus; the latter two
arrangements would normally give rise to unacceptable geometric blurring.
Measured point-spread functions were used in conjunction with the MEM image
processing to de-blur these images. The results are presented as comparative
images of phantom test features and as observer scores for the raw and
processed images. Visualization of high resolution features and the total image
scores for the test phantom were improved by the application of the MEM
processing. It is argued that this successful demonstration of image
de-blurring in noisy radiological images offers the possibility of weakening
the link between focal spot size and geometric blurring in radiology, thus
opening up new approaches to system optimization.
