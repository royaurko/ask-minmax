The class of orthogonal relay channels, in which the orthogonal channels
connecting the source terminal to the relay and the destination depend on a
state sequence, is considered. It is assumed that the state sequence is fully
known at the destination while it is not known at the source or the relay. The
capacity of this class of relay channels is characterized, and shown to be
achieved by the partial decode-compress-and-forward (pDCF) scheme. Then the
capacity of certain binary and Gaussian state-dependent orthogonal relay
channels are studied in detail, and it is shown that the compress-and-forward
(CF) and partial-decode-and-forward (pDF) schemes are suboptimal in general. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first single relay channel model for
which the capacity is achieved by pDCF, while pDF and CF schemes are both
suboptimal. Furthermore, it is shown that the capacity of the considered
orthogonal state-dependent relay channels is in general below the cut-set
bound. The conditions under which pDF or CF suffices to meet the cut-set bound,
and hence, achieve the capacity, are also derived.
