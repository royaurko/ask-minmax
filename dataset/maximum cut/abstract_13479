In this article we present examples of a wider study of space-time
correlation of electron precipitation event of the Van Allen belts with the
position and time of occurrence of strong (M>6.5) earthquakes. The study is
based on the analysis of observations of electron bursts (EBs) with energies 70
- 2350 keV at middle geographic latitudes, which were detected by DEMETER
satellite (at an altitude of ~700 km). The EBs show a relative
peak-to-background increase usually < 100, they have a time duration ~0.5 - 3
min, energy spectrum with peaks moving in higher energies as the satellite
moves towards the equator, and highest energy limit <~500 keV. The EBs are
observed in the presence of VLF waves. The flux-time profile of the EBs varies
in East Asia and Mediterranean Sea at the similar geographic latitudes, due to
the differentiation of the magnitude of the earth's magnetic field. The most
important result of our study is the characteristic temporal variation of
electron precipitation variation which begins with incremental rate several
days / a few weeks before major earthquakes, then presents a maximum, and
finally become weaker, with a minimun or a pause of the electron precipitation
some hours before the onset of the earthquake.
