The Pad\'e table of $\phantom{}_2F_1(a,1;c;z)$ is normal for $c>a>0$ (cf.
\cite{3}). For $m \geq n-1$ and $c \notin {\zz}^{\phantom{}^-}$, the
denominator polynomial $Q_{mn}(z)$ in the $[m/n]$ Pad\'e approximant
$P_{mn}(z)/Q_{mn}(z)$ for $\phantom{}_2F_1(a,1;c;z)$ and the remainder term
$Q_{mn}(z)\phantom{}_2F_1(a,1;c;z)-P_{mn}(z)$ were explicitly evaluated by
Pad\'e (cf. \cite{2}, \cite{5} or \cite{7}). We show that for $c>a>0$ and
$m\geq n-1$, the poles of $P_{mn}(z)/Q_{mn}(z)$ lie on the cut $(1,\infty)$. We
deduce that the sequence of approximants $P_{mn}(z)/Q_{mn}(z)$ converges to
$\phantom{}_2F_1(a,1;c;z)$ as $m \to \infty$, $ n/m \to \rho$ with $0<\rho \leq
1$, uniformly on compact subsets of the unit disc $|z|<1$ for $c>a>0$
