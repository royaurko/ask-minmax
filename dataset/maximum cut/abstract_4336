Generation of T-odd single spin asymmetries (SSA) by the various ingredients
of QCD factorization is discussed. The possible use of SSA in studies of
Generalized Parton Distribution (GPD) at HERA with the polarized lepton beam is
suggested. The role of GPD in the investigation of orbital angular momenta of
partons is discussed. The generalization of Equivalence principle, leading to
the equipartition of momenta and total angular momenta, violated in
perturbation theory, but possibly restored due to confinement and chiral
symmetry breaking, is proposed. The T-odd fragmentation and fracture function
are considered. The T-odd distribution (Sivers) function may be only effective,
due to the imaginary cuts in the SIDIS and Drell-Yan process, while the
existence of such universal functions should lead, after the integration over
transverse momentum, to the strong T violation in polarized DIS.
