The total lowest-order electromagnetic radiative corrections to the
observables in Moller scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons have
been calculated. The final expressions obtained by the covariant method for the
infrared divergency cancellation are free from any unphysical cut-off
parameters. Since the calculation is carried out within the ultrarelativistic
approximation our result has a compact form that is convenient for computing.
Basing on these expressions the FORTRAN code MERA has been developed. Using
this code the detailed numerical analysis performed under SLAC (E-158) and JLab
kinematic conditions has shown that the radiative corrections are significant
and rather sensitive to the value of the missing mass (inelasticity) cuts.
