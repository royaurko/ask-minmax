Weaving knots are alternating knots with the same projection as torus knots,
and were conjectured by X.-S. Lin to be among the maximum volume knots for
fixed crossing number. We provide the first asymptotically correct volume
bounds for weaving knots, and we prove that the infinite weave is their
geometric limit.
