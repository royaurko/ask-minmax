We give a survey of the entropy theory of interval maps as it can be analyzed
using ergodic theory, especially measures of maximum entropy and periodic
points. The main tools are (i) a version of Hofbauer's Markov diagram, (ii) the
shadowing property and the implied entropy bound and weak rank one property,
(iii) strongly positively recurrent countable state Markov shifts. Proofs are
given for selected results. This article is based on the lectures given at the
Ecole thematique de theorie ergodique at the C.I.R.M., Marseilles, in April
2006.
