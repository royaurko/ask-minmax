The mathematical properties of a family of generalized beta distribution,
including beta-normal, skewed-t, log-F, beta-exponential, beta-Weibull
distributions have recently been studied in several publications. This paper
applies these distributions to the modeling of the size distribution of income
and computes the maximum likelihood estimation estimates of parameters. Their
performances are compared to the widely used generalized beta distributions of
the first and second types in terms of measures of goodness of fit.
