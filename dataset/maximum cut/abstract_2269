The 2^{n} different n-point functions that occur in real-time thermal field
theory are Fourier transformed to real energies. Because of branch cuts in
various energy variables, none of these functions can be extended analytically
to complex energies. The known linear combinations that form the fully retarded
and advanced functions can be extended analytically. It is proven that no other
linear combinations have an analytic extension to complex energies.
