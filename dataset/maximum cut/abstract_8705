A pole model for the form factors describing heavy to light meson transitions
is constructed, and the results compared with the predictions of the heavy
quark effective theory (HQET). While most of the HQET-predicted relationships
among form factors hold at the maximum value of $q^2$, many are violated,
suggesting that the simplest version of the pole model of meson form factors
should be used with caution, especially when combined with HQET.
