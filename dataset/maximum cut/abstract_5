Trevisan [SICOMP 2012] presented an algorithm for Max-Cut based on spectral
partitioning techniques. This is the first algorithm for Max-Cut with an
approximation guarantee strictly larger than 1/2 that is not based on
semidefinite programming. Trevisan showed that its approximation ratio is of at
least 0.531. In this paper we improve this bound up to 0.614247. We also define
and extend this result for the more general Maximum Colored Cut problem.
