Author of Ref. [1], M.R. Setare (JCAP 01, 023, 2007, arXiv:hep-th/0701242),
by redefining the event horizon measured from the sphere of the horizon as the
system's IR cut-off for an interacting holographic dark energy model in a
non-flat universe, showed that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is
satisfied for the special range of the deceleration parameter. His paper
includes an erroneous calculation of the entropy of the cold dark matter. Also
there are some missing terms and some misprints in the equations of his paper.
Here we present that his conclusion is not true and the generalized second law
is violated for the present time independently of the deceleration parameter.
