Observations from multiple spacecraft show that there are energy spectral
"breaks" at 1-10MeV in some large CME-driven shocks. However, numerical models
can hardly simulate this property due to high computational expense. The
present paper focuses on analyzing these energy spectral "breaks" by Monte
Carlo particle simulations of an isolated CME-driven shock. Taking the Dec 14
2006 CME-driven shock as an example, we investigate the formation of this
energy spectral property. For this purpose, we apply different values for the
scattering time in our isolated shock model to obtain the highest energy
"tails", which can potentially exceed the "break" energy range. However, we
have not found the highest energy "tails" beyond the "break" energy range, but
instead find that the highest energy "tails" reach saturation near the range of
energy at 5MeV. So, we believe that there exists an energy spectral "cut off"
in an isolated shock. If there is no interaction with another shock, there
would not be formation of the energy spectral "break" property.
