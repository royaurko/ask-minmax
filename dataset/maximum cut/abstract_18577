We present limits on $\nu_\mu(\bar{\nu}_\mu)\to\nu_\tau(\bar{\nu}_\tau)$ and
$\nu_\mu(\bar{\nu}_\mu)\to\nu_e(\bar{\nu}_e)$ oscillations based on a study of
inclusive $\nu N$ interactions performed using the CCFR massive coarse grained
detector in the FNAL Tevatron Quadrupole Triplet neutrino beam. The sensitivity
to oscillations is from the difference in the longitudinal energy deposition
pattern of $\nu_\mu N$ versus $\nu_\tau N$ or $\nu_e N$ charged current
interactions. The $\nu_\mu$ energies ranged from 30 to 500 GeV with a mean of
140 GeV. The minimum and maximum $\nu_\mu$ flight lengths are 0.9 km and 1.4 km
respectively. For $\nu_\mu\to\nu_\tau$ oscillations, the lowest 90% confidence
upper limit in $\sin^22\alpha$ of $2.7\times 10^{-3}$ is obtained at $\Delta
m^2\sim50$~eV$^2$. This result is the most stringent limit to date for
$25<\Delta m^2<90$ eV$^2$. For $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e$ oscillations, the lowest 90%
confidence upper limit in $\sin^22\alpha$ of $1.9\times 10^{-3}$ is obtained at
$\Delta m^2\sim350$~eV$^2$. This result is the most stringent limit to date for
$250<\Delta m^2<450$ eV$^2$, and also excludes at 90% confidence much of the
high $\Delta m^2$ region favored by the recent LSND observation.
