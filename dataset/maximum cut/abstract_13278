In this work the theoretical and experimental investigations of Co2TiZ (Z =
Si, Ge, or Sn) compounds are reported. Half-metallic ferromagnetism is
predicted for all three compounds with only two bands crossing the Fermi energy
in the majority channel. The magnetic moments fulfill the Slater-Pauling rule
and the Curie temperatures are well above room temperature. All compounds show
a metallic like resistivity for low temperatures up to their Curie temperature,
above the resistivity changes to semiconducting like behavior. A large negative
magnetoresistance of 55% is observed for Co2TiSn at room temperature in an
applied magnetic field of 4T which is comparable to the large negative
magnetoresistances of the manganites. The Seebeck coefficients are negative for
all three compounds and reach their maximum values at their respective Curie
temperatures and stay almost constant up to 950 K. The highest value achieved
is -52muV/K m for Co2TiSn which is large for a metal. The combination of
half-metallicity and the constant large Seebeck coefficient over a wide
temperature range makes these compounds interesting materials for
thermoelectric applications and further spincaloric investigations.
