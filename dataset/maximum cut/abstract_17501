In this paper, Sphere Decoding (SD) algorithms for Spatial Modulation (SM)
are developed to reduce the computational complexity of Maximum-Likelihood (ML)
detectors. Two SDs specifically designed for SM are proposed and analysed in
terms of Bit Error Ratio (BER) and computational complexity.
  Using Monte Carlo simulations and mathematical analysis, it is shown that by
carefully choosing the initial radius the proposed sphere decoder algorithms
offer the same BER as ML detection, with a significant reduction in the
computational complexity.
  A tight closed form expression for the BER performance of SM-SD is derived in
the paper, along with an algorithm for choosing the initial radius which
provides near to optimum performance. Also, it is shown that none of the
proposed SDs are always superior to the others, but the best SD to use depends
on the target spectral efficiency. The computational complexity trade-off
offered by the proposed solutions is studied via analysis and simulation, and
is shown to validate our findings. Finally, the performance of SM-SDs are
compared to Spatial Multiplexing (SMX) applying ML decoder and applying SD.
  It is shown that for the same spectral efficiency, SM-SD offers up to 84%
reduction in complexity compared to SMX-SD, with up to 1 dB better BER
performance than SMX-ML decoder.
