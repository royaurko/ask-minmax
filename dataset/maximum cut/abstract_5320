We study a flavour-violating four-fermion interaction in the Lifshitz
context, in 3+1 dimensions and with a critical exponent z=3. This model is
renormalizable, and features dynamical mass generation, as well as asymptotic
freedom. At one-loop, it is only logarithmically divergent, but the superficial
degree of divergence of the two-point functions is 3. We calculate the two-loop
corrections to the propagators, and show that, at this order, the
Lorentz-violating corrections to the IR dispersion relation are quadratic in
the cut off. Furthermore, these corrections are too important to represent a
physical effect. As a consequence, the predictive power of the model in terms
of Lorentz-violating effects in the propagation of particles is limited.
