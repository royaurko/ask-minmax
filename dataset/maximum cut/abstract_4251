We predict the rate of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) events containing an
identified forward $\pi^0$ that is expected in the experiments at the HERA
electron-proton collider, in order to see if this process can be used as an
indicator of the underlying small $x$ dynamics. We determine the background due
to deep inelastic events containing forward photons which are fragments of the
forward jet. We compare the DIS + $\pi^0$ cross section with that of the DIS +
parent jet process.
