Observations of the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 2206+54 with the Swift Burst
Alert Telescope (BAT) do not show modulation at the previously reported period
of 9.6 days found from observations made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) All-Sky Monitor (ASM). Instead, the strongest peak in the power spectrum
of the BAT light curve occurs at a period of 19.25 +/- 0.08 days, twice the
period found with the RXTE ASM. The maximum of the folded BAT light curve is
also delayed compared to the maximum of the folded ASM light curve. The most
recent ASM data folded on twice the 9.6 day period show similar morphology to
the folded BAT light curve. This suggests that the apparent period doubling is
a recent secular change rather than an energy-dependent effect. The 9.6 day
period is thus not a permanent strong feature of the light curve. We suggest
that the orbital period of 4U 2206+54 may be twice the previously proposed
value.
