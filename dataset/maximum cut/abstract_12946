In the standard setting of one-way ANOVA with normal errors, a new algorithm,
called the Step Down Maximum Mean Selection Algorithm (SDMMSA), is proposed to
estimate the treatment means under an assumption that the treatment mean is
nondecreasing in the factor level. We prove that i) the SDMMSA and the Pooled
Adjacent Violator Algorithm (PAVA), a widely used algorithm in many problems,
generate the same estimators for normal means, ii) the estimators are the
mle's, and iii) the distribution of each of the estimators is stochastically
nondecreasing in each of the treatment means. As an application of this
stochastic ordering, a sequence of null hypotheses to identify the minimum
effective dose (MED) is formulated under the assumption of monotone
treatment(dose) means. A step-up testing procedure, which controls the
experimentwise error rate in the strong sense, is constructed. When the MED=1,
the proposed test is uniformly more powerful than Hsu and Berger's (1999).
