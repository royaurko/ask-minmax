Data from the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) Collimated Sensors
for Epithermal Neutrons (CSETN) are used in conjunction with a model based on
results from the Lunar Prospector mission to quantify the extent of the
background in the LEND CSETN. A simple likelihood analysis implies that at
least 90% of the lunar component of the LEND CSETN flux results from high
energy epithermal neutrons passing through the walls of the collimator. Thus,
the effective full-width at half-maximum of the LEND CSETN is comparable with
that of the omni-directional Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer. The
resulting map of high energy epithermal neutrons offers the opportunity to
probe the hydrogen abundance at low latitudes, and provide constraints on the
distribution of lunar water.
