It is shown that Onsager's principle of the least dissipation of energy is
equivalent to the maximum entropy production principle. It is known that
solutions of the linearized Boltzmann equation make extrema of entropy
production. It is argued, in the case of stationary processes, that this
extremum is a maximum rather than a minimum.
