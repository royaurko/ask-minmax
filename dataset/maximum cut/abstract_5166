The minimum skew rank $mr^{-}(\mathbb{F},G)$ of a graph $G$ over a field
$\mathbb{F}$ is the smallest possible rank among all skew symmetric matrices
over $\mathbb{F}$, whose ($i$,$j$)-entry (for $i\neq j$) is nonzero whenever
$ij$ is an edge in $G$ and is zero otherwise. We give some new properties of
the minimum skew rank of a graph, including a characterization of the graphs
$G$ with cut vertices over the infinite field $\mathbb{F}$ such that
$mr^{-}(\mathbb{F},G)=4$, determination of the minimum skew rank of $k$-paths
over a field $\mathbb{F}$, and an extending of an existing result to show that
$mr^{-}(\mathbb{F},G)=2match(G)=MR^{-}(\mathbb{F},G)$ for a connected graph $G$
with no even cycles and a field $\mathbb{F}$, where $match(G)$ is the matching
number of $G$, and $MR^{-}(\mathbb{F},G)$ is the largest possible rank among
all skew symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{F}$.
