An induced forest of a graph G is an acyclic induced subgraph of G. The
present paper is devoted to the analysis of a simple randomised algorithm that
grows an induced forest in a regular graph. The expected size of the forest it
outputs provides a lower bound on the maximum number of vertices in an induced
forest of G. When the girth is large and the degree is at least 4, our bound
coincides with the best bound known to hold asymptotically almost surely for
random regular graphs. This results in an alternative proof for the random
case.
