We propose a novel experiment to identify the symmetry of superconductivity
on the basis of theoretical results for differential conductance of a normal
metal connected to a superconductor. The proximity effect from the
superconductor modifies the conductance of the remote current depending
remarkably on the pairing symmetry: spin-singlet or spin-triplet. The clear-cut
difference in the conductance is explained by symmetry of Cooper pairs in a
normal metal with respect to frequency. In the spin-triplet case, the anomalous
transport is realized due to an odd-frequency symmetry of Cooper pairs.
