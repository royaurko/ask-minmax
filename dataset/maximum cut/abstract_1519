The availability of a reliable bound on an integral involving the square of
the modulus of a form factor on the unitarity cut allows one to constrain the
form factor at points inside the analyticity domain and its shape parameters,
and also to isolate domains on the real axis and in the complex energy plane
where zeros are excluded. In this lecture note, we review the mathematical
techniques of this formalism in its standard form, known as the method of
unitarity bounds, and recent developments which allow us to include information
on the phase and modulus along a part of the unitarity cut. We also provide a
brief summary of some results that we have obtained in the recent past, which
demonstrate the usefulness of the method for precision predictions on the form
factors.
