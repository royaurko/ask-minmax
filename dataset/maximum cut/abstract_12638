We have calculated spectral functions associated with hadronic current
correlation functions for vector currents at finite temperature. We made use of
a model with chiral symmetry, temperature-dependent coupling constants and
temperature-dependent momentum cutoff parameters. Our model has two parameters
which are used to fix the magnitude and position of the large peak seen in the
spectral functions. In our earlier work, good fits were obtained for the
spectral functions that were extracted from lattice data by means of the
maximum entropy method (MEM). In the present work we extend our calculations
and provide values for the three-momentum dependence of the vector correlation
function at T=1.5T_c. These results are used to obtain the correlation function
in coordinate space, which is usually parametrized in terms of a screening
mass. Our results for the three-momentum dependence of the spectral functions
are similar to those found in a recent lattice QCD calculation for charmonium
[S. Datta, F. Karsch, P. Petreczky and I. Wetzorke, hep-lat/0312037]. For a
limited range we find the exponential behavior in coordinate space that is
usually obtained for the spectral function for T>T_c and which allows for the
definition of a screening mass.
