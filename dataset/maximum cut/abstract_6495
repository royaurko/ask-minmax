The curvature radiation produced by particles accelerating near the event
horizon of a spinning supermassive black hole, threaded by externally supported
magnetic field lines is considered. It is shown that light nuclei suffer
catastrophic curvature losses that limit the maximum energy they can attain to
values well below that imposed by the maximum potential difference induced by
the black hole dynamo, unless the curvature radius of magnetic field lines
largely exceeds the gravitational radius. It is further shown that the dominant
fraction of the rotational energy extracted from the black hole is radiated in
the TeV band. Given the observed flux of ultra-high energy cosmic rays, and the
estimated number of nearby supermassive black holes, it is expected that if
dormant AGNs are the sources of UHECRs, as proposed recently by Boldt & Ghosh,
then they should also be detectable at TeV energies by present TeV experiments.
