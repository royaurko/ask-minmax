We present results from a search for gravitational microlensing of stars in
the Large Magellanic Cloud by low mass objects in the Galactic Halo. The search
uses the CCD light curves of about 82,000 stars with up to 46 measurements per
night over a period of 10 months. No light curve exhibits a form that is
consistent with a microlensing event of maximum amplification greater than 1.2.
This null result makes it unlikely that the Halo is dominated by objects in the
mass range $5 10^{-8}M_{\odot} < M <5 10^{-4}M_{\odot} $. keywords{Galaxy :
