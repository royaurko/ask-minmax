We present a numerical algorithm for finding real non-negative solutions to
polynomial equations. Our methods are based on the expectation maximization and
iterative proportional fitting algorithms, which are used in statistics to find
maximum likelihood parameters for certain classes of statistical models. Since
our algorithm works by iteratively improving an approximate solution, we find
approximate solutions in the cases when there are no exact solutions, such as
overconstrained systems.
