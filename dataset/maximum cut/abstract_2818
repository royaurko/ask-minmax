Designing concurrent data structures should follow some basic rules. By
separating the algorithms into two phases, we present guidelines for scalable
data structures, with a analysis model based on the Amadal's law. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to formalize a practical model for measuring
concurrent structures' speedup. We also build some edge-cutting BSTs following
our principles, testing them under different workloads. The result provides
compelling evidence to back the our guidelines, and shows that our theory is
useful for reasoning the varied speedup.
