Whether the 3D incompressible Euler equations can develop a singularity in
finite time from smooth initial data is one of the most challenging problems in
mathematical fluid dynamics. This work attempts to provide an affirmative
answer to this long-standing open question from a numerical point of view, by
presenting a class of potentially singular solutions to the Euler equations
computed in axisymmetric geometries. The solutions satisfy a periodic boundary
condition along the axial direction and no-flow boundary condition on the solid
wall. The equations are discretized in space using a hybrid 6th-order Galerkin
and 6th-order finite difference method, on specially designed adaptive (moving)
meshes that are dynamically adjusted to the evolving solutions. With a maximum
effective resolution of over $(3 \times 10^{12})^{2}$ near the point of the
singularity, we are able to advance the solution up to $\tau_{2} = 0.003505$
and predict a singularity time of $t_{s} \approx 0.0035056$, while achieving a
\emph{pointwise} relative error of $O(10^{-4})$ in the vorticity vector
$\omega$ and observing a $(3 \times 10^{8})$-fold increase in the maximum
vorticity $\|\omega\|_{\infty}$. The numerical data are checked against all
major blowup (non-blowup) criteria, including Beale-Kato-Majda,
Constantin-Fefferman-Majda, and Deng-Hou-Yu, to confirm the validity of the
singularity. A local analysis near the point of the singularity also suggests
the existence of a self-similar blowup in the meridian plane.
