Talks given at the V Taller de Particulas y Campos (V-TPyC) and V Taller
Latinoam. de Fenomenologia de las Interac. Fundam. (V-TLFIF), Puebla, Mexico,
10/30 - 11/3 1995. These lectures are devoted to elementary particle physicists
and assume the reader has very little or no knowledge of cosmology and
astrophysics. After a brief historical introduction to the development of
modern cosmology and astro-particles in which the Hot Big Bang model is
defined, the Robertson-Walker metric and the dynamics of the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology are discussed in section 2. In section 3
the main observational features of the Universe are reviewed, including a
description of our neighbourhood, homogeneity and isotropy, the cosmic
background radiation, the expansion, the age and the matter content of the
Universe. A brief account of the thermal history of the Universe follows in
section 4, and relic abundances are discussed in section 5. Section 6 is
devoted to primordial nucleosynthesis, section 7 to structure formation in the
Universe and section 8 to the possibility of detection of the dark matter in
the halo of our galaxy.
