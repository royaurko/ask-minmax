Ground-based Atmospheric Air Cherenkov Telescopes (ACTs) are successfully
used to observe very high energy (VHE) gamma rays from celestial objects. The
light of the night sky (LONS) is a strong background for these telescopes. The
gamma ray pulses being very short, an ultra-fast read-out of an ACT can
minimize the influence of the LONS. This allows one to lower the so-called tail
cuts of the shower image and the analysis energy threshold. It could also help
to suppress other unwanted backgrounds.
  Fast 'flash' analog-to-digital converters (FADCs) with GSamples/s are
available commercially; they are, however, very expensive and power consuming.
Here we present a novel technique of Fiber-Optic Multiplexing which uses a
single 2 GSamples/s FADC to digitize 16 read-out channels consecutively. The
analog signals are delayed by using optical fibers. The multiplexed (MUX) FADC
read-out reduces the cost by about 85% compared to using one ultra-fast FADC
per read-out channel.
  Two prototype multiplexers, each digitizing data from 16 channels, were built
and tested. The ultra-fast read-out system will be described and the test
results will be reported. The new system will be implemented for the read-out
of the 17m diameter MAGIC telescope camera.
