Exact Max-SAT solvers, compared with SAT solvers, apply little inference at
each node of the proof tree. Commonly used SAT inference rules like unit
propagation produce a simplified formula that preserves satisfiability but,
unfortunately, solving the Max-SAT problem for the simplified formula is not
equivalent to solving it for the original formula. In this paper, we define a
number of original inference rules that, besides being applied efficiently,
transform Max-SAT instances into equivalent Max-SAT instances which are easier
to solve. The soundness of the rules, that can be seen as refinements of unit
resolution adapted to Max-SAT, are proved in a novel and simple way via an
integer programming transformation. With the aim of finding out how powerful
the inference rules are in practice, we have developed a new Max-SAT solver,
called MaxSatz, which incorporates those rules, and performed an experimental
investigation. The results provide empirical evidence that MaxSatz is very
competitive, at least, on random Max-2SAT, random Max-3SAT, Max-Cut, and Graph
3-coloring instances, as well as on the benchmarks from the Max-SAT Evaluation
2006.
