Motivated by anomalously large conductivity anisotropy in layered materials,
we propose a simple model of randomly spaced potential barriers (mimicking
stacking faults) with isotropic impurities in between the barriers. We solve
this model both numerically and analytically, by utilizing an exact solution
for the conductivity of a one-dimensional (1D) disordered system. In the
absence of bulk disorder, electron motion in the out-of-plane direction is
localized. Bulk disorder destroys 1D localization. As a result, the
out-of-plane conductivity is finite and scales linearly with the scattering
rate by bulk impurities until planar and bulk disorder become comparable. The
\emph{ac} out-of-plane conductivity is of a manifestly non-Drude form, with a
maximum at the frequency corresponding to the scattering rate by potential
barriers.
