We present a general formalism for deriving bounds on the shape parameters of
the weak and electromagnetic form factors using as input correlators calculated
from perturbative QCD, and exploiting analyticity and unitarity. The values
resulting from the symmetries of QCD at low energies or from lattice
calculations at special points inside the analyticity domain can beincluded in
an exact way. We write down the general solution of the corresponding Meiman
problem for an arbitrary number of interior constraints and the integral
equations that allow one to include the phase of the form factor along a part
of the unitarity cut. A formalism that includes the phase and some information
on the modulus along a part of the cut is also given. For illustration we
present constraints on the slope and curvature of the K_l3 scalar form factor
and discuss our findings in some detail. The techniques are useful for checking
the consistency of various inputs and for controlling the parameterizations of
the form factors entering precision predictions in flavor physics.
