We present UBVRI photometry of the supernova 2014J in M82, obtained in the
period from January 24 until March 3, 2014, as well as two spectra, taken on
February 4 and March 5. We derive dates and magnitudes of maximum light in the
UBVRI bands, the light curve parameters Delta m(15) and expansion velocities of
the prominent absorption lines. We discuss colour evolution, extinction and
maximum luminosity of SN 2014J.
