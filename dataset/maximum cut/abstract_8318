We discuss the problem of cosmic ray mass composition variation in wide
energy region 10^{14}-10^{20} eV. The mass composition predicted in the
framework of recently developed anomalous diffusion model is tested using the
results of CORSIKA calculations and experimental data on the depth of maximum
of extensive air showers. We show that the model predictions for the mass
composition are consistent with observations of different experiments.
