We analyse the kinematics of the entire spectroscopic sample of 99 recently
discovered high proper-motion white dwarfs by Oppenheimer et al. using a
maximum-likelihood analysis, and discuss the claim that the high-velocity white
dwarfs are members of a halo population with a local density at least ten times
greater than traditionally assumed. We argue that the observations, as
reported, are consistent with the presence of an almost undetected thin disc
plus a thick disc, with densities as conventionally assumed. In addition, there
is a kinematically distinct, flattened, halo population at the more than 99%
confidence level. Surprisingly, the thick disc and halo populations are
indistinguishable in terms of luminosity, color and apparent age (1-10 Gyr).
Adopting a bimodal, Schwarzschild model for the local velocity ellipsoid, with
the ratios sigma_U:sigma_V:sigma_W=1:2/3:1/2, we infer radial velocity
dispersions of sigma_U=62(+8/-10) km/s and 150(+80/-40) km/s (90% C.L.) for the
local thick disc and halo populations, respectively. The thick disc result
agrees with the empirical relation between asymmetric drift and radial velocity
dispersion, inferred from local stellar populations. The local thick-disc plus
halo density of white dwarfs is n^{td+h}=(1.9+-0.5)x10^-3 pc^-3 (90% C.L.), of
which n^{h}=1.1(+2.1/-0.7)x10^-4 pc^-3 (90% C.L.) belongs to the halo, a
density about five times higher than previously thought. (Abridged)
