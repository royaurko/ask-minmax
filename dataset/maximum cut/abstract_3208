We consider Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) Lagrangian supplemented by double
Liouville potentials to enrich our system and investigate the resulting
dynamics. The general solution provides us alternative structures induced on
the 3-dimensional domain wall (DW) moving in the 4-dimensional bulk. In
particular, the local maximum in the potential suggests a maximum bounce (or
onset for a contraction phase) of the 3-dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) universe on the DW. Depending on the choice of parameters we plot various
cases of physical interest.
