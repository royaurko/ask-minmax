All codes with minimum distance 8 and codimension up to 14 and all codes with
minimum distance 10 and codimension up to 18 are classified. Nonexistence of
codes with parameters [33,18,8] and [33,14,10] is proved. This leads to 8 new
exact bounds for binary linear codes. Primarily two algorithms considering the
dual codes are used, namely extension of dual codes with a proper coordinate,
and a fast algorithm for finding a maximum clique in a graph, which is modified
to find a maximum set of vectors with the right dependency structure.
