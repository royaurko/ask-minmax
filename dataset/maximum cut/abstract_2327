We demonstrate how a five dimensional Godel universe appears as the core of
resolved two-charge and three-charge over-rotating BMPV black holes. A smeared
generalized supertube acts as a domain wall and removes regions of closed
timelike curves by cutting off both the inside and outside solution before
causality violations appear, effectively allowing the Godel universe and the
over-rotating black hole to solve each other's causality problems. This
mechanism suggests a novel form of holography between the compact Godel region
and the diverse vacua and excitations of the bound state of a finite number of
D0 and D4-branes with fundamental strings.
