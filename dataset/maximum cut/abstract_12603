The dd -> alpha X reaction is studied in a model where each pair of nucleons
in the projectile and target deuterons undergoes pion production through the NN
-> d pi reaction. The condition that the two deuterons fuse to form an
alpha-particle then leads to peaks at small missing masses, the well-known ABC
enhancement, but also a broad structure around the maximum missing mass. With a
simplified input amplitude the model gives a quantitative description of both
the alpha-particle momentum and angular distributions for a deuteron beam
energy of 1250 MeV.
