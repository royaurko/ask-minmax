The degree-diameter problem seeks to find the maximum possible order of a
graph with a given (maximum) degree and diameter. It is known that graphs
attaining the maximum possible value (the Moore bound) are extremely rare, but
much activity is focussed on finding new examples of graphs or families of
graph with orders approaching the bound as closely as possible.
  There has been recent interest in this problem as it applies to mixed or
partially directed graphs, in which we allow some of the edges to be undirected
and some directed. A 2008 paper of Nguyen and Miller derived an upper bound on
the possible number of vertices of such graphs. We show that for diameters
larger than three, this bound can be reduced and we present a revised Moore
bound for mixed graphs valid for all diameters and for all combinations of
undirected and directed degrees.
