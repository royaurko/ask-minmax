Charmonium productions in $p-p$ and $A-B$ collisions have been estimated
within the ambit of colour evaporation model (CEM). The model parameters have
been fixed by fitting the theoretical results with CDF data. The method is then
applied to RHIC and LHC energies to obtain the transverse momentum
distributions of $J/\psi$, $\psi^{\prime}$ and $\chi_c$. Suppression due to
Debye screening in a quark gluon plasma (QGP) is estimated at various
centrality cuts. The final $p_T$ distributions of various resonances are then
predicted convoluting with the survival probability.
