The Hill estimator is often used to infer the power behavior in tails of
experimental distribution functions. This estimator is known to produce bad
results in certain situations which have lead to the so-called Hill horror
plots. In this brief note, we propose an improved estimator which is simple and
coherent and often provides an efficient remedy in the bad situations,
especially when the distribution is decreasing slowly, when the data is
restricted by external cuts to lie within a finite domain, or even when the
distribution is increasing.
