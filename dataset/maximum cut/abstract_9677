ANTARES is the largest high-energy neutrino telescope in the Northern
Hemisphere. A search for neutrinos in coincidence with gamma-ray bursts using
ANTARES data from late 2007 to 2011 is presented here. An extended maximum
likelihood ratio search was employed to optimise the discovery potential for a
neutrino signal as predicted by the numerical NeuCosmA model. No significant
excess was found, so 90% confidence upper limits on the fluxes as expected from
analytically approximated neutrino-emission models as well as on up-to-date
numerical predictions were placed.
