In the very early stages of LHC running, uncertainties in detector
performance will lead to large ambiguities in jet, electron and photon energy
measurements, along with inferred missing transverse energy. However, muon
detection should be quite straightforward, with the added benefit that muons
can be reliably detected down to transverse energies of order 5 GeV.
Supersymmetry discovery through multimuon channels has been extensively
explored in the literature, but always relying on hard ET^miss cuts. Here, we
quantify signal and background rates for same-sign (SS) dimuon and multimuon
production at the LHC without any ET^miss cuts. The LHC, operating at
\sqrt{s}=10 TeV, should be able to discover a signal over expected background
consistent with gluino pair production for m_{\tg}\alt 450 (550) GeV in the SS
dimuon plus \ge 4 jets state with just 0.1 (0.2) fb^{-1} of integrated
luminosity.
