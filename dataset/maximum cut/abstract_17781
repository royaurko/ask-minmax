Let $y(t)$ be a smooth sigmoidal curve, $y^{(n)}(t)$ be its $n$th derivative,
$\{t_{m,i}\}$ and $\{t_{a,i}\}$, $i=1,2,\dots$ be the set of points where
respectively the derivatives of odd and even order reach their extreme values.
The "critical point of the sigmoidal curve" is defined to be the common limit
of the sequences $\{t_{m,i}\}$ and $\{t_{a,i}\}$, provided that the limit
exists. We prove that if $f(t)=\frac{dy}{dt}$ is an even function such that the
magnitude of the analytic representation $|f_A(t)|=|f(t)+if_h(t)|$, where
$f_h(t)$ is the Hilbert transform of $f(t)$, is monotone on $(0,\infty)$, then
the point $t=0$ is the critical point in the sense above. For the general case,
where $f(t)=\frac{dy}{dx}$ is not even, we prove that if $|f_A(t)|$ monotone on
$(0,\infty)$ and if the phase of its Fourier transform $F(\omega)$ has a limit
as $\omega\to \pm\infty$, then $t=0$ is still the critical point but as opposed
to the previous case, the maximum of $f(t)$ is located away from $t=0$. We
compute the Fourier transform of the generalized logistic growth functions and
illustrate the notions above on these examples.
