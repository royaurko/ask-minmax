Removed to be revised. Diagonalization for a larger cut-off M shows that the
definite size effects are M-dependent. Scaling with M shows that in the
thermodynamic limit the skyrmion wave-function tends to the translationally
invariant hard core wave function. Finite M breaks translational invariance and
at the same time it exponentially suppresses the tail of the wave-function.
Details will be published.
