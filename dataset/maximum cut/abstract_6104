In this paper non-asymptotic exact rearrangement invariant norm estimates are
derived for the maximum distribution of the family elements of some
rearrangement invariant (r.i.) space over unbounded measure in the entropy
terms and in the terms of generic chaining.
  We consider some applications in the martingale theory and in the theory of
Fourier series.
