We investigate the clumping of cold dark matter (CDM) at small scales. If the
CDM particle is the neutralino, we find that collisional damping during its
kinetic decoupling from the radiation fluid and free streaming introduce a
small-scale cut-off in the primordial power spectrum of CDM. This cut-off sets
the scale for the very first CDM objects in the Universe, which we expect to
have a mass of $\sim 10^{-12} M_\odot$. For non-thermal CDM candidates, such as
axions, wimpzillas, or primordial black holes, the cosmological QCD transition
might induce features in the primordial spectrum at similar mass scales.
