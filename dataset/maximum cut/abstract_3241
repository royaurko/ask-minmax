We study the structure of protoneutron stars within the finite-temperature
Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone theoretical approach, paying particular attention to
how it is joined to a low-density nuclear equation of state (EOS). We find a
slight sensitivity of the minimum value of the protoneutron star mass on the
low-density equation of state, whereas the maximum mass is hardly affected.
