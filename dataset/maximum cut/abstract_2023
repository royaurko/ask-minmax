This paper presents a way of reducing the complexity of parsing free
coordination. It lives on the Coordinative Count Invariant, a property of
derivable sequences in occurrence-sensitive categorial grammar. This invariant
can be exploited to cut down deterministically the search space for coordinated
sentences to minimal fractions. The invariant is based on inequalities, which
is shown to be the best one can get in the presence of coordination without
proper parsing. It is implemented in a categorial parser for Dutch. Some
results of applying the invariant to the parsing of coordination in this parser
are presented.
