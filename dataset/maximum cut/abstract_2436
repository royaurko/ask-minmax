We report the exact entanglement cost of a class of multiqubit bound
entangled states, computed in the context of a universal model for multipartite
state preparation. The exact amount of entanglement needed to prepare such
states are determined by first obtaining lower bounds using a cut-set approach,
and then providing explicit local protocols achieving the lower bound.
