We have investigated the role of hyperon resonances in the kaon
photoproduction process, $\gamma p\to K^+\Lambda$, by using a covariant isobar
model. To this end, new experimental data are used in the fitting process,
whereas the old SAPHIR 1998 data are also used for comparison. The result
indicates that the $\Lambda(1600)P_{01}$ and $\Lambda(1810)P_{01}$ hyperon
resonances can significantly reduce the $\chi^2$ and, simultaneously, can
increase the hadronic form factor cut-off in the background terms. This finding
is different from the result of the previous studies, which showed that the
$\Lambda(1800)S_{01}$ was important for this purpose, instead of the
$\Lambda(1600)P_{01}$.
