Solar flares occur in complex sunspot groups, but it remains unclear how the
probability of producing a flare of a given magnitude relates to the
characteristics of the sunspot group. Here, we use Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite X-ray flares and McIntosh group classifications from
solar cycles 21 and 22 to calculate average flare rates for each McIntosh class
and use these to determine Poisson probabilities for different flare
magnitudes. Forecast verification measures are studied to find optimum
thresholds to convert Poisson flare probabilities into yes/no predictions of
cycle 23 flares. A case is presented to adopt the true skill statistic (TSS) as
a standard for forecast comparison over the commonly used Heidke skill score
(HSS). In predicting flares over 24 hr, the maximum values of TSS achieved are
0.44 (C-class), 0.53 (M-class), 0.74 (X-class), 0.54 (>=M1.0), and 0.46
(>=C1.0). The maximum values of HSS are 0.38 (C-class), 0.27 (M-class), 0.14
(X-class), 0.28 (>=M1.0), and 0.41 (>=C1.0). These show that Poisson
probabilities perform comparably to some more complex prediction systems, but
the overall inaccuracy highlights the problem with using average values to
represent flaring rate distributions.
