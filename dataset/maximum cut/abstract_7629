Our world is strongly driven by technological developments that continuously
create new markets and shape individual taste and choice. The scale of
dissemination of the most recent technological breakthroughs and the capability
of creating them is what divides wealthy societies from poor ones. The
increasing sophistication of these developments make it harder and harder for
developing countries to actively contribute to these breakthroughs as well as
to acquire the right to benefit from them through the exchange of products
obtained through low-tech agriculture, industry and services.
  Thus, as new technological developments rely often on discoveries in
fundamental science and technology that have their origins, in some instances,
many decades ago, it is only through fostering the acquisition of the skills
necessary for innovation in basic science and technology that economical and
social progress can be insured on a long term basis. In this perspective,
funding of research is an investment for the future and clearly, just buying
technology is no short cut to create sustainable wealth.
  Furthermore, Society should fund fundamental research for cultural and
training reasons. Indeed, as a representative of a country or of a culture in a
given historical period, activities assertive of cultural and national
identities should be funded. These involve necessarily scientific developments
too. Moreover, experience shows that the best training for innovation is
acquired from individuals and institutions that have an active interest in
basic science and on its application to technology.
