We show how strong steady-state entanglement can be achieved in a three-mode
optomechanical system (or other parametrically-coupled bosonic system) by using
one of the modes as a cold reservoir to effectively laser-cool a delocalized
Bogoliubov mode. This approach allows one to surpass the bound on the maximum
stationary intracavity entanglement possible with a coherent two-mode squeezing
interaction. Unlike typical dissipative entanglement schemes, the entangling
dynamics here are most effective in a regime where the effects of the
engineered reservoir cannot be described by a Markovian Lindblad master
equation.
