Measuring the photon energy spectrum in radiative B decays provides essential
help for gaining theoretical control over semileptonic B transitions. The
hadronic recoil mass distribution in B -> X_u \ell\nu promises the best
environment for determining |V_ub|. The theoretical uncertainties are largest
in the domain of low values of the lepton pair mass q^2. Universality relations
allow to describe this domain reliably in terms of the photon spectrum in B ->
X_s + \gamma. A method is proposed to incorporate 1/m_b corrections into this
relation. The low-E_\gamma tail in radiative decays is important in the context
of extracting |V_ub|. We argue that CLEO's recent fit to the spectrum
underestimates the fraction of the photon spectrum below 2 GeV. Potentially
significant uncertainties enter in the theoretical evaluation of the integrated
end-point lepton spectrum or the B -> X_u \ell\nu width with a too high value
of the lower cut on q^2 in alternative approaches to |V_ub|.
