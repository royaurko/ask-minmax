No proven method is currently available for the reliable short time
prediction of earthquakes (minutes to months). However, it is possible to make
probabilistic hazard assessments for earthquake risk. These are primarily based
on the association of small earthquakes with future large earthquakes. In this
paper we discuss a new approach to earthquake forecasting. This approach is
based on a pattern informatics (PI) method which quantifies temporal variations
in seismicity. The output is a map of areas in a seismogenic region
(``hotspots'') where earthquakes are forecast to occur in a future 10-year time
span. This approach has been successfully applied to California, to Japan, and
on a worldwide basis. These forecasts are binary--an earthquake is forecast
either to occur or to not occur. The standard approach to the evaluation of a
binary forecast is the use of the relative operating characteristic (ROC)
diagram, which is a more restrictive test and less subject to bias than maximum
likelihood tests. To test our PI method, we made two types of retrospective
forecasts for California. The first is the PI method and the second is a
relative intensity (RI) forecast based on the hypothesis that future
earthquakes will occur where earthquakes have occurred in the recent past.
While both retrospective forecasts are for the ten year period 1 January 2000
to 31 December 2009, we performed an interim analysis 5 years into the
forecast. The PI method out performs the RI method under most circumstances.
