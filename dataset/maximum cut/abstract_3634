Following the L_nu/E_nu analysis in the preceding paper of the Fully
Contained Muon Events resulting from the quasi-elastic scattering obtained from
our numerical computer experiment. In the present paper, we carry out the
analyses of L_nu/E_mu, L_mu/E_nu and L_mu/E_mu among four possible combinations
of L and E. As the result of it, we show that we can not find the
characteristis of maximum oscillation for neutrino oscillation among two of
three, L_mu/E_mu and L_mu/E_nu. Only the L_nu/E_mu distribution can show
something like maximum oscillation, however it cannot be detected owing to the
neutral character of L_nu. It is concluded that the Super-Kamiokande Experiment
could not have found the existence of the maximum oscillation for neutrino
oscillation.
