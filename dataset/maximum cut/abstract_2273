We present analytic expressions to evaluate at O(alpha) the effects of
soft-photon emission, and the related virtual corrections, in non-leptonic
decays of the type B,D -> P1 P2, where P1 and P2 are scalar or pseudoscalar
particles. The phenomenological implications of these results are briefly
discussed. For B decays into charged pions the effects of soft-photon emission
are quite large: the corrections to the rates can easily exceed the 5% level if
tight cuts on the photon energy are applied.
