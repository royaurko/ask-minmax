By performing heat capacity, magnetocaloric effect, torque magnetometry and
force magnetometry measurements up to 33 T, we have mapped out the T-H phase
diagram of the S = 1/2 spin dimer compound Ba3Cr2O8. We found evidence for
field-induced magnetic order between Hc1 = 12.52(2) T and Hc2 = 23.65(5) T,
with the maximum transition temperature Tc = 2.7 K at H = 18 T. The lower
transition can likely be described by Bose-Einstein condensation of triplons
theory, and this is consistent with the absence of any magnetization plateaus
in our magnetic torque and force measurements. In contrast, the nature of the
upper phase transition appears to be quite different as our measurements
suggest that this transition is actually first order.
