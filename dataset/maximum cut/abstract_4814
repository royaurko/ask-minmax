We discuss the signatures of a representative Higgsless model with ideal
fermion delocalization in vector-boson fusion processes, focusing on the gold-
and silver-plated decay modes of the gauge bosons at the CERN-Large Hadron
Collider. For this purpose, we have developed a fully-flexible parton-level
Monte-Carlo program, which allows for the calculation of cross sections and
kinematic distributions within experimentally feasible selection cuts at
NLO-QCD accuracy. We find that Kaluza-Klein resonances give rise to very
distinctive distributions of the decay leptons. Similar to the Standard Model
case, within the Higgsless scenario the perturbative treatment of the
vector-boson scattering processes is under excellent control.
