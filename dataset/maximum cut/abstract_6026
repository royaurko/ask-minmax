It is widely believed that one signal can carry maximum one bit of
information, and minimum KTlog2 energy is required to transmit or to erase a
bit. Here it is shown four bits of information can be transmitted by one signal
in four dimensional space-time. It implies space-time cannot be ignored to
determine the minimal energy cost of information processing.
