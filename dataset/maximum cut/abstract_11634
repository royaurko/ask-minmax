LIINUS/SERPIL is a design study to augment LBTs interferometric beam combiner
camera LINC-NIRVANA with imaging spectroscopy. The FWHM of the interferometric
main beam at 1.5 micron will be about 10 mas, offering unique imaging and
spectroscopic capabilities well beyond the angular resolution of current 8-10m
telescopes. At 10 mas angular scale, e.g., one resolution element at the
distance of the Galactic Center corresponds to the average diameter of the
Pluto orbit (79 AU), hence the size of the solar system. Taking advantage of
the LBT interferometric beam with an equivalent maximum diameter of 23 m,
LIINUS/SERPIL is an ideal precursor instrument for (imaging) spectrographs at
extremely large full aperture telescopes. LIINUS/SERPIL will be built upon the
LINC-NIRVANA hardware and LIINUS/SERPIL could potentially be developed on a
rather short timescale. The study investigates several concepts for the optical
as well as for the mechanical design. We present the scientific promises of
such an instrument together with the current status of the design study.
