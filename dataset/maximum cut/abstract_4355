We consider a hard jet production tagged by a muon pair in ultrarelativistic
heavy ion collisions. The process cross section is calculated by the CompHEP
Monte-Carlo generator taking into account full gamma*/Z interference pattern at
LHC energies. We have found that reasonable statistics, ~1000 events per 1
month of LHC run with lead beams, can be expected for realistic geometrical
acceptance and kinematic cuts. The transverse momentum imbalance due to
interactions of jet partons in the medium is evaluated for mu+mu-pair+jet
correlation, as well as for the correlation between mu+mu- pair and a leading
particle in a jet. Theoretical and experimental uncertainties of these
observables are discussed.
