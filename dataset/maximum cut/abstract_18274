We present wide-band radio observations spanning from 1.4 GHz to 350 GHz of
the afterglow of GRB 991216, taken from 1 to 80 days after the burst. The
optical and X-ray afterglow of this burst were fairly typical and are explained
by a jet fireball. In contrast, the radio light curve is unusual in two
respects: (a) the radio light curve does not show the usual rise to maximum
flux on timescales of weeks and instead appears to be declining already on day
1 and (b) the power law indices show significant steepening from the radio
through the X-ray bands. We show that the standard fireball model, in which the
afterglow is from a forward shock, is unable to account for (b) and we conclude
that the bulk of the radio emission must arise from a different source. We
consider two models, neither of which can be ruled out with the existing data.
In the first (conventional) model, the early radio emission is attributed to
emission from the reverse shock as in the case of GRB 990123. We predict that
the prompt optical emission would have been as bright (or brighter) than 8th
magnitude. In the second (exotic) model, the radio emission originates from the
forward shock of an isotropically energetic fireball (10^54 erg) expanding into
a tenuous medium (10^-4 cm^-3). The resulting fireball would remain
relativistic for months and is potentially resolvable with VLBI techniques.
Finally, we note that the near-IR bump of the afterglow is similar to that seen
in GRB 971214 and no fireball model can explain this bump.
