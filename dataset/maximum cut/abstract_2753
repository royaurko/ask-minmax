The purpose of this paper is to construct spherical thin-shell wormhole
solutions through cut and paste technique and investigate the stability of
these solutions in the vicinity of modified Chaplygin gas. The Darmois-Israel
formalism is used to formulate the stresses of the surface concentrating the
exotic matter. We explore the stability of the wormhole solutions by using the
standard potential method. We conclude that there exist more stable as well as
unstable solutions than the previous study with generalized Chaplygin gas
\cite{15}.
