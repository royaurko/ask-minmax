I put forward the stringy representation of the 1/N strong coupling (SC)
expansion for the regularized Wilson's loop-averages in the continuous D>=3
Yang-Mills theory (YM_{D}) with a sufficiently large bare coupling constant
\lambda>\lambda_{cr} and a fixed ultraviolet cut off \Lambda. The proposed
representation is proved to provide with the confining solution of the
Dyson-Schwinger chain of the judiciously regularized U(N) Loop equations.
Building on the results obtained, we suggest the stringy pattern of the
low-energy theory associated to the D=4 U(\infty)=SU(\infty) gauge theory in
the standard \lambda=>0 phase with the asymptotic freedom in the UV domain. A
nontrivial test, to clarify whether the AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture may
be indeed applicable to the large N pure YM_{4} theory in the \lambda=>\infty
limit, is also discussed.
