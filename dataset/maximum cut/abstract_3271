Several methods to extract an asymmetry parameter in an event distribution
function are discussed and compared in terms of statistical precision and
applicability. These methods are: simple counting rate asymmetries, event
weighting procedures and the unbinned extended maximum likelihood method. It is
known that weighting methods reach the same figure of merit (FOM) as the
likelihood method in the limit of vanishing asymmetries. This article presents
an improved weighting procedure reaching the FOM of the likelihood method for
arbitrary asymmetries. Cases where the maximum likelihood method is not
applicable are also discussed.
