We present an investigation of the propagation of Ultra High Energy Cosmic
Rays (UHECRs) in extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF). We use the IRAS PSCz
catalogue in order to reconstruct EGMF taking into account power-law dependence
between the magnetic field and the infrared luminosity density. Contrary to the
previous works [11] the normalization parameters have been estimated according
to the observable values of magnetic field of the galaxy clusters (B_GC = 0.3 -
2 microG) and assessed values of field in the voids of the Local Universe
(B_Void = 1 pG - 100 pG). We construct the full-sky maps of expected deflection
angles of UHE protons with the arrival energies E = 100 EeV and E = 40 EeV in
the reconstructed EGMF for two boundary cases of "strong" (B_GC=2 microG,
B_Void = 100 pG) and "weak" (B_GC=0.3 microG, B_Void = 1 pG) magnetic fields.
It is found that average deflections of protons with observable energies above
40 EeV and maximum energy in sources E_max = 10 ZeV are unimportant (comparable
with the errors of modern detectors) only in the case of "weak" EGMF model.
