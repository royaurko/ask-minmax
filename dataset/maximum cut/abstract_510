The Large Area Telescope on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has a point
spread function with large tails, consisting of events affected by tracker
ineffiencies, inactive volumes, and hard scattering; these tails can make
source confusion a limiting factor. The parameter CTBCORE, available in the
publicly available Extended Fermi LAT data, estimates the quality of each
event's direction reconstruction; by implementing a cut in this parameter, the
tails of the point spread function can be suppressed at the cost of losing
effective area. We implement cuts on CTBCORE and present updated instrument
response functions derived from the Fermi LAT data itself, along with all-sky
maps generated with these cuts. Having shown the effectiveness of these cuts,
especially at low energies, we encourage their use in analyses where angular
resolution is more important than Poisson noise.
