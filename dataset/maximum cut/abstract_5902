In this study, an analytical solution is presented for thermo-electro-elastic
analysis of piezoelectric semi-infinite bodies. For this purpose, governing
equations are derived for a transversely isotropic piezoelectric material under
axisymmetric thermo-electro-mechanical loading condition. A general closed form
analytical solution is presented for the complementary and particular parts of
the components of displacement vector and also electric potential function.
Then, boundary conditions are imposed and in that case an explicit solution is
obtained for piezoelectric semi-infinite bodies. Results show that when a
piezoelectric half-space is subjected to constant/ramp surface thermal loading
the maximum absolute value of radial stress occurs at the surface of the body.
Whereas, the maximum absolute value of stress in normal direction of the
half-space surface occurs not on the surface but somewhere near the surface of
the body. Moreover, the peak values for these stress curves in the case of
combined loadings are closest to the half space surface and the farthest in the
case of ramp decaying thermal loading. In contrast to the constant/ramp surface
thermal loading no clear maximum point for electric field distribution for the
case of combined loadings can be seen in the normal direction to the half-space
boundary.
