The mutual information between a set of stimuli and the elicited neural
responses is compared to the corresponding decoded information. The decoding
procedure is presented as an artificial distortion of the joint probabilities
between stimuli and responses. The information loss is quantified. Whenever the
probabilities are only slightly distorted, the information loss is shown to be
quadratic in the distortion
