We present spectra of twelve Type Ia supernovae obtained in 1999 at the
William Herschel Telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope during a search for
Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) at intermediate redshift. The spectra range from
z=0.178 to z=0.493, including five high signal-to-noise ratio SN Ia spectra in
the still largely unexplored range 0.15 < z < 0.3. Most of the spectra were
obtained before or around restframe B-band maximum light. None of them shows
the peculiar spectral features found in low-redshift over- or under-luminous SN
Ia. Expansion velocities of characteristic spectral absorption features such as
SiII at 6355 angs., SII at 5640 angs. and CaII at 3945 angs. are found
consistent with their low-z SN Ia counterparts.
