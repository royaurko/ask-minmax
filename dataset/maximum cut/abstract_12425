In addition to the double-dimensional reduction procedure that employs
world-volume Killing symmetries of $p$-brane supergravity solutions and acts
diagonally on a plot of $p$ versus spacetime dimension $D$, there exists a
second procedure of ``vertical'' reduction. This reduces the transverse-space
dimension via an integral that superposes solutions to the underlying Laplace
equation. We show that vertical reduction is also closely related to the
recently-introduced notion of intersecting $p$-branes. We illustrate this with
examples, and also construct a new $D=11$ solution describing four intersecting
membranes, which preserves $1/16$ of the supersymmetry. Given the two reduction
schemes plus duality transformations at special points of the scalar modulus
space, one may relate most of the $p$-brane solutions of relevance to
superstring theory. We argue that the maximum classifying duality symmetry for
this purpose is the Weyl group of the corresponding Cremmer-Julia supergravity
symmetry $E_{r(+r)}$. We also discuss a separate class of duality-invariant
$p$-branes with $p=D-3$.
