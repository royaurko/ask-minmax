We study the dimensionally regularized fermion propagator Dyson-Schwinger
equation in quenched nonperturbative QED in an arbitrary covariant gauge using
the Curtis-Pennington vertex and perform nonperturbative renormalization
numerically. The nonperturbative fermion propagator is solved in D=4-2*epsilon
< 4 dimensional Euclidean space for a large number of values of epsilon for two
values of the coupling, alpha=0.6 and alpha=1.5. Results for D=4 are then
obtained by extrapolation to epsilon=0. We compare these results against
previous studies employing a modified ultraviolet cut-off regularization and
find agreement to within the numerical precision of the present calculations.
