A Roman dominating function on a graph $G$ is a labeling $f : V(G)
\rightarrow \{0, 1, 2\}$ such that every vertex with label $0$ has a neighbor
with label $2$. The Roman domination number, $\gamma_R(G)$, of $G$ is the
minimum of $\Sigma_{v\in V (G)} f(v)$ over such functions. The Roman bondage
number $b_R(G)$ is the cardinality of a smallest set of edges whose removal
from $G$ results in a graph with Roman domination number not equal to
$\gamma_R(G)$. In this paper we obtain upper bounds on $b_{R}(G)$ in terms of
(a) the average degree and maximum degree, and (b) Euler characteristic, girth
and maximum degree. We also show that the Roman bondage number of every graph
which admits a $2$-cell embedding on a surface with non negative Euler
characteristic does not exceed $15$.
