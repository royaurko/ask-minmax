The linear extension diameter of a finite poset P is the maximum distance
between a pair of linear extensions of P, where the distance between two linear
extensions is the number of pairs of elements of P appearing in different
orders in the two linear extensions. We prove a formula for the linear
extension diameter of the Boolean Lattice and characterize the diametral pairs
of linear extensions. For the more general case of a downset lattice D_P of a
2-dimensional poset P, we characterize the diametral pairs of linear extensions
of D_P and show how to compute the linear extension diameter of D_P in time
polynomial in |P|.
