Neutrino masses can be generated by fermion triplets with TeV-scale mass,
that would manifest at LHC as production of two leptons together with two heavy
SM vectors or higgs, giving rise to final states such as 2 leptons + 4 jets
(that can violate lepton number and/or lepton flavor) or 1 lepton +4 jets
+missing transverse energy. We devise cuts to suppress the SM backgrounds to
these signatures. Furthermore, for most of the mass range suggested by neutrino
data, triplet decays are detectably displaced from the production point,
allowing to infer the neutrino mass parameters. We compare with LHC signals of
type-I and type-II see-saw.
