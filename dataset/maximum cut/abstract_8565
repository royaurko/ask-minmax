We report on the geometry and mechanics of knotted stiff strings. We discuss
both closed and open knots. Our two main results are: (i) Their equilibrium
energy as well as the equilibrium tension for open knots depend on the type of
knot as the square of the bridge number; (ii) Braid localization is found to be
a general feature of stiff strings entanglements, while angles and knot
localization are forbidden. Moreover, we identify a family of knots for which
the equilibrium shape is a circular braid. Two other equilibrium shapes are
found from Monte Carlo simulations. These three shapes are confirmed by
rudimentary experiments. Our approach is also extended to the problem of the
minimization of the length of a knotted string with a maximum allowed
curvature.
