A complete sample of spiral galaxies in the Ursa Major cluster is imaged at
various optical wavelengths and in the Near-Infrared K'-band. HI rotation
curves were obtained for all gas rich systems. The Near-Infrared surface
brightness distribution of disk galaxies turns out to be bimodal; galaxies
avoid a domain around a face-on disk central surface brightness of 18.5
mag/arcsec^2. This bimodality is particularly striking when only the more
isolated, non-interacting systems are considered. The Luminosity Function of
the HSB family of galaxies is truncated well above the completion limit while
the Luminosity Function of the LSB family is still sharply rising at our
limiting magnitude. Near-Infrared mass-to-light ratios suggest that HSB
galaxies are close to a kinematic maximum-disk situation while LSB galaxies are
dark matter dominated at all radii. Assuming equal Near-Infrared mass-to-light
ratios for both HSB and LSB systems, we find that the gap in the surface
brightness distribution corresponds to a situation in which the baryonic mass
is marginally self-gravitating. We finally conclude that the luminosity-line
width relation is a fundamental correlation between the amount and distribution
of dark matter mass and the total luminosity, regardless of how the luminous
mass is distributed within the dark mater halo.
