We derive analytic solution for pulsed frequency conversion based on
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) or maximum coherence in resonant
atomic vapors. In particular drive-field and coherence depletion are taken into
account. The solutions are obtained with the help of an Hamiltonian approach
which in the adiabatic limit allows to reduce the full set of Maxwell-Bloch
equations to simple canonical equations of Hamiltonian mechanics for the field
variables. Adiabatic integrals of motion can be obtained and general
expressions for the spatio-temporal evolution of field intensities derived.
Optimum conditions for maximum conversion efficiency are identified and the
physical mechanism of nonlinear conversion in the limit of drive-field and
coherence depletion discussed.
