A quadric in $\R P^3$ cuts a curve of degree 6 on a cubic surface in $\R
P^3$. The papers classifies the nonsingular curves cut in this way on
non-singular cubic surfaces up to homeomorphism.
  Two issues new in the study related to the first part of the 16th Hilbert
problem appear in this classification. One is the distribution of the
components of the curve between the components of the non-connected cubic
surface which turns out to depend on the patterns of arrangements (see Theorem
1). The other is presence of positive genus among the components of the
complement and genus-related restrictions (see Theorems 3 and 4).
