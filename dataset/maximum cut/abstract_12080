The paper deals with a simple three sites model for charge transfer phenomena
in an one-dimensional donor (D) - bridge (B) - acceptor (A) system coupled with
vibrational dynamics of the B site. It is found that in a certain range of
parameters the vibrational coupling leads to an enhancement of the effective
donor - acceptor electronic coupling as a result of the formation of the
polaron on the B site. This enhancement of the charge transfer efficiency is
maximum at the resonance, where the effective energy of the fluctuating B site
coincides with the donor (acceptor) energy.
