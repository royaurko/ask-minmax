We present a method for the computation of hepta-cuts of two loop scattering
amplitudes. Four dimensional unitarity cuts are used to factorise the integrand
onto the product of six tree-level amplitudes evaluated at complex momentum
values. Using Gram matrix constraints we derive a general parameterisation of
the integrand which can be computed using polynomial fitting techniques. The
resulting expression is further reduced to master integrals using conventional
integration by parts methods. We consider both planar and non-planar topologies
for 2 to 2 scattering processes and apply the method to compute hepta-cut
contributions to gluon-gluon scattering in Yang-Mills theory with adjoint
fermions and scalars.
