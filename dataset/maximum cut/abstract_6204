We show that the maximum number of prime implicants over 2-CNF formulas on
$n$ variables is between $3^{n/3}$ and $(1 + o(1))3^{n/3}$. For large $k$ we
show that this number is at least $3^{(1 - O(\log k / k))n}$, and any $k$-CNF
formula in which each variable appears in a constant number of clauses has at
most $3^{(1 - \Omega(1/k))n}$ prime implicants.
