Gaussian process (GP) regression is a powerful tool for building predictive
models for spatial systems. However, it does not scale efficiently for large
datasets. Particularly, for high-dimensional spatial datasets, i.e., spatial
datasets that contain exogenous variables, the performance of GP regression
further deteriorates. This paper presents the Sparse Pseudo-input Local Kriging
(SPLK) which approximates the full GP for spatial datasets with exogenous
variables. SPLK employs orthogonal cuts which decompose the domain into smaller
subdomains and then applies a sparse approximation of the full GP in each
subdomain. We obtain the continuity of the global predictor by imposing
continuity constraints on the boundaries of the neighboring subdomains. The
domain decomposition scheme applies independent covariance structures in each
region, and as a result, SPLK captures heterogeneous covariance structures.
SPLK achieves computational efficiency by utilizing sparse approximation in
each subdomain which enables SPLK to accommodate large subdomains that contain
many data points and possess a homogenous covariance structure. We Apply the
proposed method to real and simulated datasets. We conclude that the
combination of orthogonal cuts and sparse approximation makes the proposed
method an efficient algorithm for high-dimensional large spatial datasets.
