A scheme is presented for entangling two separated nanomechanical oscillators
by injecting broad band squeezed vacuum light and laser light into the ring
cavity. We work in the resolved sideband regime. We find that in order to
obtain the maximum entanglement of the two oscillators, the squeezing parameter
of the input light should be about 1. We report significant entanglement over a
very wide range of power levels of the pump and temperatures of the
environment.
