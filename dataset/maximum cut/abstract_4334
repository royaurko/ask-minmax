The nonlocal version of the SU(2)xSU(2) symmetric four-quark interaction of
the NJL type is considered. Each of the quark lines contains the form factors.
These form factors remove the ultraviolet divergences in quark loops. The
additional condition on quark mass function m(p) ensures the absence of the
poles in the quark propagator(quark confinement). The constituent quark mass
m(0) is expressed thought the cut-off parameter Lambda, m(0)=Lambda=340 MeV in
the chiral limit. These parameters are fixed by the experimental value of the
weak pion decay and allow us to describe the mass of the light scalar meson,
strong decay rho -> pi pi and D/S ratio in the decay a_1 -> rho pi in
satisfactory agreement with experimental data.
