We investigate the universal low-energy dynamics of the simplest Higgs phase
for gravity, `ghost condensation.' We show that the nonlinear dynamics of the
`ghostone' field dominate for all interesting gravitational sources. Away from
caustic singularities, the dynamics is equivalent to the irrotational flow of a
perfect fluid with equation of state p \propto \rho^2, where the fluid
particles can have negative mass. We argue that this theory is free from
catastrophic instabilities due to growing modes, even though the null energy
condition is violated. Numerical simulations show that solutions generally have
singularities in which negative energy regions shrink to zero size. We exhibit
partial UV completions of the theory in which these singularities are smoothly
resolved, so this does not signal any inconsistency in the effective theory. We
also consider the bounds on the symmetry breaking scale M in this theory. We
argue that the nonlinear dynamics cuts off the Jeans instability of the linear
theory, and allows M \lsim 100MeV.
