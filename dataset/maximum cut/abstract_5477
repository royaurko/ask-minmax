We present results for the low mass Drell-Yan (DY) production in
proton-proton collisions at the LHC in the color dipole formalism. The DY
differential cross sections at 7 TeV as a function of dilepton rapidity,
transverse momentum and invariant mass are discussed. We have imposed
kinematical cuts related to the low mass DY production investigated by ATLAS
and LHCb collaborations.
