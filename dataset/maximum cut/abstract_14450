The nonlinear rheology of a soft glassy material is captured by its
constitutive relation, shear stress vs shear rate, which is most generally
obtained by sweeping up or down the shear rate over a finite temporal window.
For a huge amount of complex fluids, the up and down sweeps do not superimpose
and define a rheological hysteresis loop. By means of extensive rheometry
coupled to time-resolved velocimetry, we unravel the local scenario involved in
rheological hysteresis for various types of well-studied soft materials. We
introduce two observables that quantify the hysteresis in macroscopic rheology
and local velocimetry respectively, as a function of the sweep rate \delta
t^{-1}. Strikingly, both observables present a robust maximum with \delta t,
which defines a single material-dependent timescale that grows continuously
from vanishingly small values in simple yield stress fluids to large values for
strongly time-dependent materials. In line with recent theoretical arguments,
these experimental results hint at a universal timescale-based framework for
soft glassy materials, where inhomogeneous flows characterized by shear bands
and/or pluglike flow play a central role.
