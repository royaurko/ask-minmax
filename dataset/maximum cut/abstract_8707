I summarize recent lattice results on QCD at finite temperatures and
densities. Studies on the nature of the QCD transition at the physical point,
continuum extra polations of thermodynamic quantities, and new calculations of
hadronic spectral functions applying the maximum entropy method are discussed.
Recent advances in finite density QCD are also reviewed.
