Electric pulse induced resistance (EPIR) switching hysteresis loops for
Pr0.7Ca0.7MnO3 (PCMO) perovskite oxide films were found to exhibit an
additional sharp "shuttle peak" around the negative pulse maximum for films
deposited in an oxygen deficient ambient. The device resistance hysteresis loop
consists of stable high resistance and low resistance states, and transition
regions between them. The resistance relaxation of the "shuttle peak" and its
temperature behavior as well as the resistance relaxation in the transition
regions were studied, and indicate that the resistance switching relates to
oxygen diffusion with activation energy about 0.4eV. An oxygen diffusion model
with the oxygen ions (vacancies) as the active agent is proposed for the
non-volatile resistance switching effect in PCMO.
