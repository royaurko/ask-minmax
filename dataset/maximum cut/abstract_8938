It has been recently demonstrated that the orbital velocity profile around
Kerr black holes in the equatorial plane as observed in the locally
non-rotating frame exhibits a non-monotonic radial behaviour. We show here that
this unexpected minimum-maximum feature of the orbital velocity remains if the
Kerr vacuum is generalized to the Kerr-de Sitter or Kerr-anti-de Sitter metric.
This is a new general relativity effect in Kerr spacetimes with non-vanishing
cosmological constant. Assuming that the profile of the orbital velocity is
known, this effect constrains the spacetime parameters.
