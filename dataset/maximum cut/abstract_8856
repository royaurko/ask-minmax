Self-focusing, spatially stable, electron beams arising from heating up to
160 degrees C and cooling to room temperature pyroelectric LiNbO3 crystals in
dilute gases have been observed for the first time. The current (up to
nanoamperes) and energies (up to 170 keV) of these electron beams attained
maximum values and then decreased during the cooling phase of the thermal
cycle. Cylindrical crystals produced spatially stable beams with typical focal
lengths of 22 mm and 1mm spot sizes. Here we present photographic as well as
electronic proof of their existence.
