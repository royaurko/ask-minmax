The field of extrasolar planets has rapidly expanded to include the detection
of planets with masses smaller than that of Uranus. Many of these are expected
to have little or no hydrogen and helium gas and we might find Earth analogs
among them. In this paper we describe our detailed interior models for a rich
variety of such massive terrestrial and ocean planets in the 1-to-10 earth-mass
range (super-Earths). The grid presented here allows the characterization of
the bulk composition of super-Earths detected in transit and with a measured
mass. We show that, on average, planet radius measurements to better than 5%,
combined with mass measurements to better than 10% would permit us to
distinguish between an icy or rocky composition. This is due to the fact that
there is a maximum radius a rocky terrestrial planet may achieve for a given
mass. Any value of the radius above this maximum terrestrial radius implies
that the planet contains a large (> 10%) amount of water (ocean planet).
