A microcanonical multifragmentation model (MMM) is used for investigating
whether equilibration really occurs in the dynamical evolution of two heavy ion
collisions simulated via a stochastic mean field approach (SMF). The standard
deviation function between the dynamically obtained freeze-out fragment
distributions corresponding to the reaction $^{129}$Xe+$^{119}$Sn at 32 MeV/u
and the MMM ones corresponding to a wide range of mass, excitation energy,
freeze-out volume and nuclear level density cut-off parameter shows a unique
minimum. A distinct statistically equilibrated stage is identified in the
dynamical evolution of the system.
