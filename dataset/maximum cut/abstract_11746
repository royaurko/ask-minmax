The c-axis tunneling properties of both pristine Bi2212 and its HgBr$_2$
intercalate have been measured in the temperature range 4.2 - 250 K.
Lithographically patterned 7-10 unit-cell heigh mesa structures on the surfaces
of these single crystals were investigated. Clear SIS-like tunneling curves for
current applied in the $\it c$-axis direction have been observed. The dynamic
conductance d$I/$d$V(V)$ shows both sharp peaks corresponding to a
superconducting gap edge and a dip feature beyond the gap, followed by a wide
maximum, which persists up to a room temperature. Shape of the temperature
dependence of the {\it c}-axis resistance does not change after the
intercalation suggesting that a coupling between $\rm CuO_2$-bilayers has
little effect on the pseudogap.
