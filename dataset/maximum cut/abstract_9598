We report on some statistical regularity properties of greatest common
divisors: for large random samples of integers, the number of coprime pairs and
the average of the gcd's of those pairs are approximately normal, while the
maximum of those gcd's (appropriately normalized) follows approximately a
Fr\'echet distribution approximately. We also consider $r$-tuples instead of
pairs, and moments other than the average.
