This paper presents the results of our extensive search for the bright
variable stars in approximately 30000 square degrees of the south sky in the
I-band data collected by 9 deg x 9 deg camera of the All Sky Automated Survey
between 2002 and 2009. Lists of over 27000 variable stars brighter than 9 mag
at maximum light, with amplitudes ranging from 0.02 mag to 7 mag and
variability time-scales from hours to years, as well as corresponding light
curves are provided. Automated classification algorithm based on stellar
properties (period, Fourier coefficients, 2MASS J, H, K, colors, ASAS V-band
data) was used to roughly classify objects. Despite low spatial resolution of
the ASAS data (~15 arcs) we cross-identified all objects with other available
data sources. Coordinates of the most probable 2MASS counterparts are provided.
27705 stars brighter than I=9 mag were found to be variable, of which 7842
objects were detected to be variable for the first time. Brief statistics and
discussion of the presented data is provided. All the photometric data is
available over the Internet at
