We present a formal proof of a time-triggered hardware interface. The design
implements the bit-clock synchronization mechanism specified by the FlexRay
standard for automotive embedded systems. The design is described at the
gate-level. It can be translated to Verilog and synthesized on FPGA. The proof
is based on a general model of asynchronous communications and combines
interactive theorem proving in Isabelle/HOL and automatic model-checking using
NuSMV together with a model-reduction procedure, IHaVeIt. Our general model of
asynchronous communications defines a clear separation between analog and
digital concerns. This separation enables the combination of theorem proving
and model-checking for an efficient methodology. The analog phenomena are
formalized in the logic of Isabelle/HOL. The gate-level hardware is
automatically analyzed using IHaVeIt. Our proof reveals the correct values of a
crucial parameter of the bit-clock synchronization mechanism. Our main theorem
proves the functional correctness as well as the maximum number of cycles of
the transmission.
