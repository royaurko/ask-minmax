The geometry of the quadruple lens system Q2237+0305 is modeled with a simple
astigmatic lens: a power-law mass distribution: m \propto r^\beta with an
external shear \gamma. The image positions can be reproduced with an accuracy
better than 0.01 arcsec for any 0.0 < \beta < 1.85 and the corresponding value
of \gamma = 0.1385 - 0.0689 \beta. This is a factor of about 4 more precise
than what can be achieved by the best constant M/L lens models. The image
intensity ratios and the time delay ratios are almost constant along our one
parameter family of models, but the total magnification varies from 8 to >
1000, and the maximum time delay (between leading image B and trailing image C)
for H_0 of 75 km/sec/Mpc varies from more than 20 hours to about 1.5 hours,
while \beta increases from 0.0 to 1.85.
