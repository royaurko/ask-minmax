In this work we investigate and parameterize the amount and angular
distribution of Cherenkov photons, which are generated by low-energy secondary
particles (typically $\lesssim 500 $\,MeV), which accompany a muon track in
water or ice. These secondary particles originate from small energy loss
processes. We investigate the contributions of the different energy loss
processes as a function of the muon energy and the maximum transferred energy.
For the calculation of the angular distribution we have developed a generic
transformation method, which allows us to derive the angular distribution of
Cherenkov photons for an arbitrary distribution of track directions and their
velocities.
