Inclusion of inverse Compton effects in the calculation of
deuterium-deuterium burn under the extreme conditions considered by Eliezer et
al. [Phys. Lett. A 243 (1998) 298] are shown to decrease the maximum burn
temperature from about 300 keV to only 100--150 keV. This decrease is such that
tritium breeding by the DD --> T + p reaction is not sufficient to replace the
small amount of tritium that is initially added to the deuterium plasma in
order to trigger ignition at less than 10 keV.
