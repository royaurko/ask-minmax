The loss of linear momentum by gravitational radiation and the resulting
gravitational recoil of black-hole binary systems may play an important role in
the growth of massive black holes in early galaxies. We calculate the
gravitational recoil of non-spinning black-hole binaries at the second
post-Newtonian order (2PN) beyond the dominant effect, obtaining, for the first
time, the 1.5PN correction term due to tails of waves and the next 2PN term. We
find that the maximum value of the net recoil experienced by the binary due to
the inspiral phase up to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is of the
order of 22 km/s. We then estimate the kick velocity accumulated during the
plunge from the ISCO up to the horizon by integrating the momentum flux using
the 2PN formula along a plunge geodesic of the Schwarzschild metric. We find
that the contribution of the plunge dominates over that of the inspiral. For a
mass ratio m_2/m_1=1/8, we estimate a total recoil velocity (due to both
adiabatic and plunge phases) of 100 +/- 20 km/s. For a ratio 0.38, the recoil
is maximum and we estimate it to be 250 +/- 50 km/s. In the limit of small mass
ratio, we estimate V/c to be approximately 0.043 (1 +/- 20%)(m_2/m_1)^2. Our
estimates are consistent with, but span a substantially narrower range than,
those of Favata et al. (2004).
