We consider a puzzle such that a set of colored cubes is given as an
instance. Any cube is the unit length on each edge and its surface is colored
so that what we call Surface Color Condition is satisfied. Given a palette of 6
colors, the condition requires that each face should be assigned exactly one
color and all faces should be assigned 6 different colors from each other. The
puzzle asks to compose a 2x2x2 cube that satisfies Surface Color Condition from
8 suitable cubes in the instance. Note that cubes and solutions have 30
varieties respectively.
  In this paper, we present a collection of our research results on this
puzzle. First we present a novel necessary and sufficient condition that a
solid of a given variety is composable. This condition immediately leads us to
succinct procedures to identify the composability and to decide the assignment
of cubes to the corners of the solid. Next we create two extreme instances: a
universal instance (i.e., one having all 30 solutions) and an infeasible
instance (i.e., one having no solution). We show the minimum size of the
universal instance to be 12 and the maximum size of the infeasible instance to
be 23. The latter result affirmatively solves one of the open problems that
were raised in [E. Berkove et al., "An Analysis of the (Colored Cubes)^3
Puzzle," Discrete Mathematics, Vol. 308 (2008) pp. 1033--1045].
