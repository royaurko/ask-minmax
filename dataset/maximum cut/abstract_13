We determine the O(\alpha_s) radiative corrections to polarized top quark
pair production in e+ e- -annihilations with a specified gluon energy cut. We
write down fully analytical results for the unpolarized and polarized
O(\alpha_s) cross sections e+ e- -> tbar t (G) and e+ e- -> tbar t(pol.) (G)
including their polar orientation dependence relative to the beam direction. In
the soft gluon limit we recover the usual factorizing form known from the soft
gluon approximation. In the limit when the gluon energy cut takes its maximum
value we recover the totally inclusive unpolarized and polarized cross sections
calculated previously. We provide some numerical results on the cut-off
dependence of the various polarized and unpolarized cross sections and discuss
how the exact results numerically differ from the approximate soft-gluon
results.
