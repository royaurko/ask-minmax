Visibility-visibility correlation has been proposed as a technique for the
estimation of power spectrum, and used extensively for small field of view
observations, where the effect of $w-term$ is usually ignored. We consider
power spectrum estimation from the large field of view observations, where the
$w-term$ can have a significant effect. Our investigation shows that a nonzero
$w$ manifests itself as a modification of the primary aperture function of the
instrument. Using a gaussian primary beam, we show that the modified aperture
is an oscillating function with a gaussian envelope. We show that the two
visibility correlation reproduces the power spectrum beyond a certain baseline
given by the width, $U_{w}$ of the modified aperture. Further, for a given
interferometer, the maximum $U_{w}$ remains independent of the frequencies of
observation. This suggests that, the incorporation of large field of view in
radio interferometric observation has a greater effect for larger observing
wavelengths.
