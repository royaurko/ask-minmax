Infrared imaging properties of dusty winds around late-type stars are
investigated in detail, employing a self-consistent model that couples the
equations of motion and radiative transfer. Because of general scaling
properties, the angular profiles of surface brightness are self-similar. In any
given star, the profile shape is determined essentially by overall optical
depth at each wavelength and it is self-similarly scaled by the size of the
dust condensation zone. We find that the mid-IR is the best wavelength range to
measure directly the angular size of this zone, and from {\it IRAS} data we
identify the 15 best candidates for such future observations. We also show that
the visibility function at short wavelengths ($\la$ 2 \mic) directly determines
the scattering optical depth, and produce theoretical visibility curves for
various characteristic wavelengths and the entire parameter range relevant to
late-type stars. The infrared emission should display time variability because
of cyclical changes in overall optical depth, reflecting luminosity-induced
movement of the dust condensation point. Calculations of the wavelength
dependence of photometric amplitudes and time variability of envelope sizes are
in agreement with observations; envelopes are bigger and bluer at maximum
light.
