We study the thermodynamics of degenerate electron and charged vector boson
gases in very intense magnetic fields. In degenerate conditions of the electron
gas, the pressure transverse to the magnetic field $B$ may vanish, leading to a
transverse collapse. For W-bosons an instability arises because the
magnetization diverges at the critical field B_c = M_W^2/e. If the magnetic
field is self-consistently maintained, the maximum value it can take is of the
order of $2B_c/3$, but in any case the system becomes unstable and collapses.
