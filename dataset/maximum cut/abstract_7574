Higgs boson production in association with two forward jets and a central
photon at the CERN Large Hadron Collider is analyzed, for the Higgs boson
decaying into a b bbar pair in the m_H <= 140 GeV mass region. We study both
irreducible and main reducible backgrounds at parton level. Compared to the
Higgs production via vector-boson fusion, the request of a further photon at
moderate rapidities dramatically enhances the signal/background ratio.
Inclusive cross sections for p_T^\gamma >= 20 GeV can reach a few tens of fb's.
After a suitable choice of kinematical cuts, the cross-section ratio for signal
and irreducible-background can be enhanced up to >= ~1/10, with a signal cross
section of the order of a few fb's, for m_H ~ 120 GeV. The request of a central
photon radiation also enhances the relative signal sensitivity to the WWH
coupling with respect to the ZZH coupling. Hence, a determination of the cross
section for the associated production of a Higgs boson decaying into a b bbar
pair plus a central photon in vector-boson fusion could help in constraining
the b bbar H coupling, and the WWH coupling as well. A preliminary study of QCD
showering effects points to a further significant improvement of the signal
detectability over the background.
