We report the three-dimensional (3-D) momentum-resolved soft x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy of the Fermi liquid LaNiO$_3$. The out-of-plane and
in-plane cuts of the 3-D electron- and hole-Fermi surfaces (FSs) are observed
by energy- and angle- dependent photoemission measurements. The energy bands
forming the electron FS suggest an $\omega^2$ dependence of the imaginary part
of the self-energy and a `correlation kink' at an energy scale of 0.25 eV. In
contrast, the bands which form nesting character hole FSs do not show kinks and
match local density approximation calculations. The results indicate a
momentum-dependent mass renormalization, leading to electron-hole asymmetry in
strongly correlated LaNiO$_3$.
