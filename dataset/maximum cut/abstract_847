In this review we show that the multi-particle scattering amplitudes in N=4
SYM at large Nc and in the multi-Regge kinematics for some physical regions
have the high energy behavior appearing from the contribution of the Mandelstam
cuts in the complex angular momentum plane of the corresponding t-channel
partial waves. These Mandelstam cuts or Regge cuts are resulting from gluon
composite states in the adjoint representation of the gauge group SU(Nc). In
the leading logarithmic approximation (LLA) their contribution to the six point
amplitude is in full agreement with the known two-loop result.
  The Hamiltonian for the Mandelstam states constructed from n gluons in LLA
coincides with the local Hamiltonian of an integrable open spin chain. We
construct the corresponding wave functions using the integrals of motion and
the Baxter-Sklyanin approach.
