In problems of estimation and control which involve a network, efficient
distributed computation of averages is a key issue. This paper presents
theoretical and simulation results about the accumulation of errors during the
computation of averages by means of iterative "broadcast gossip" algorithms.
Using martingale theory, we prove that the expectation of the accumulated error
can be bounded from above by a quantity which only depends on the mixing
parameter of the algorithm and on few properties of the network: its size, its
maximum degree and its spectral gap. Both analytical results and computer
simulations show that in several network topologies of applicative interest the
accumulated error goes to zero as the size of the network grows large.
