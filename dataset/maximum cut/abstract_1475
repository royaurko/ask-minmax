In 2008 the CDF collaboration discovered a large excess of events containing
two or more muons, at least one of which seemed to have been produced outside
the beam pipe. We investigate whether similar "ghost" events could (and should)
have been seen in already completed experiments. The CDF di-muon data can be
reproduced by a simple model where a relatively light X particle undergoes
four-body decay. This model predicts a large number of ghost events in Fermilab
fixed-target experiments E772, E789 and E866, applying the cuts optimized for
analyses of Drell-Yan events. A correct description of events with more than
two muons requires a more complicated model, where two X particles are produced
from a very broad resonance Y. This model can be tested in fixed-target
experiments only if the cut on the angles, or rapidities, of the muons can be
relaxed. Either way, the UA1 experiment at the CERN ppbar collider should have
observed O(100) ghost events.
