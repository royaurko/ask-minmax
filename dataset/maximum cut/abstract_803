We present two results concerning the relation between poles and cuts by
using the example of N=1 U(N_c) gauge theories with matter fields in the
adjoint, fundamental and anti-fundamental representations. The first result is
the on-shell possibility of poles, which are associated with flavors and on the
second sheet of the Riemann surface, passing through the branch cut and getting
to the first sheet. The second result is the generalization of hep-th/0311181
(Intriligator, Kraus, Ryzhov, Shigemori, and Vafa) to include flavors. We
clarify when there are closed cuts and how to reproduce the results of the
strong coupling analysis by matrix model, by setting the glueball field to zero
from the beginning. We also make remarks on the possible stringy explanations
of the results and on generalization to SO(N_c) and USp(2N_c) gauge groups.
