SN2009ku, discovered by Pan-STARRS-1, is a Type Ia supernova (SNIa), and a
member of the distinct SN2002cx-like class of SNeIa. Its light curves are
similar to the prototypical SN2002cx, but are slightly broader and have a later
rise to maximum in g. SN2009ku is brighter (~0.6 mag) than other SN2002cx-like
objects, peaking at M_V = -18.4 mag - which is still significantly fainter than
typical SNeIa. SN2009ku, which had an ejecta velocity of ~2000 kms^-1 at 18
days after maximum brightness is spectroscopically most similar to SN2008ha,
which also had extremely low-velocity ejecta. However, SN2008ha had an
exceedingly low luminosity, peaking at M_V = -14.2 mag, ~4 mag fainter than
SN2009ku. The contrast of high luminosity and low ejecta velocity for SN2009ku
is contrary to an emerging trend seen for the SN2002cx class. SN2009ku is a
counter-example of a previously held belief that the class was more homogeneous
than typical SNeIa, indicating that the class has a diverse progenitor
population and/or complicated explosion physics. As the first example of a
member of this class of objects from the new generation of transient surveys,
SN2009ku is an indication of the potential for these surveys to find rare and
interesting objects.
