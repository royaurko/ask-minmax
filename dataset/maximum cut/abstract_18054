The emergent global behaviours of robotic swarms are important to achieve
their navigation task goals. These emergent behaviours can be verified to
assess their correctness, through techniques like model checking. Model
checking exhaustively explores all possible behaviours, based on a discrete
model of the system, such as a swarm in a grid. A common problem in model
checking is the state-space explosion that arises when the states of the model
are numerous. We propose a novel implementation of symmetry reduction, in the
form of encoding navigation algorithms relatively with respect to a reference,
based on the symmetrical properties of swarms in grids. We applied the relative
encoding to a swarm navigation algorithm, Alpha, modelled for the NuSMV model
checker. A comparison of the state-space and verification results with an
absolute (or global) and a relative encoding of the Alpha algorithm highlights
the advantages of our approach, allowing model checking larger grid sizes and
number of robots, and consequently, verifying more complex emergent behaviours.
For example, a property was verified for a grid with 3 robots and a maximum
allowed size of 8x8 cells in a global encoding, whereas this size was increased
to 16x16 using a relative encoding. Also, the time to verify a property for a
swarm of 3 robots in a 6x6 grid was reduced from almost 10 hours to only 7
minutes. Our approach is transferable to other swarm navigation algorithms.
