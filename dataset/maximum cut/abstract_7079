Multipartite Quantum Correlations is one of the most relevant indicator of
the quantumness of a system in many body systems. This remarkable feature is in
general difficult to characterize and the known definitions are hard to
measure. Besides the efforts dedicated to solve this problem, the question of
which is the best approach remains open. In this work, we study the Global
Quantum Discord, GQD, as a bipartite and multipartite measure. We also check
the limits of this definitions and present an experimental scheme to determine
the maximum of the GQD via the measurements of the system's excitations, during
the time evolution of the present system.
