We present a full Monte Carlo simulation of the multiplicity and eccentricity
distributions in U+U collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 A GeV. While unavoidable
trigger inefficiencies in selecting full-overlap U+U collisions cause
significant modifications of the multiplicity distribution shown in PRL94,
132301 (2005), a selection of source eccentricities by cutting the multiplicity
distribution is still possible.
