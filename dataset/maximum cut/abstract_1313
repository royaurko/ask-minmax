We calculate the imaginary part of the retarded two-loop self-energy of a
static vector boson in a plasma of quarks and gluons of temperature T, using
the imaginary time formalism. We recombine various cuts of the self-energy to
generate physical processes. We demonstrate how cuts containing loops may be
reinterpreted in terms of interference between Order $\alpha$ tree diagrams and
the Born term along with spectators from the medium. We apply our results to
the rate of dilepton production in the limit of dilepton invariant mass E>>T.
We find that all infrared and collinear singularities cancel in the final
result obtained in this limit.
