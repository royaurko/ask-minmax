Anomalous magnetic properties of the double perovskite ruthenates compound
Sr2YRuO6 are reported here. Magnetization measurements as a function of
temperature in low magnetic fields show clear evidence for two components of
magnetic order (TM1 ~ 32K and TM2 ~ 27K) aligned opposite to each other with
respect to the magnetic field direction even though only Ru5+moments can order
magnetically in this compound. The second component of the magnetic order at
TM2 ~ 27K results only in a magnetization reversal, and not in the negative
magnetization when the magnetization is measured in the field cooled (FC) mode.
Isothermal magnetization (M-H) measurements show hysteresis with maximum
coercivity (Hc) and remnant magnetization (Mr) at T ~ 27 K, corroborating the
presence of the two oppositely aligned magnetic moments, each with a
ferromagnetic component. The two components of magnetic ordering are further
confirmed by the double peak structure in the heat capacity measurements. These
anomalous properties have significance to some of the earlier results obtained
for the Cu-substituted superconducting Sr2YRu1-xCuxO6 compounds.
