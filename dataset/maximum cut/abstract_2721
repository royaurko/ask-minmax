For a nonrelativistic atom, which is minimally coupled to the quantized
radiation field, resonances emerging from excited atomic eigenstates are
constructed by an iteration scheme inspired by \cite{Pizzo2003} and
\cite{BachFrohlichPizzo2006}. This scheme successively removes an infrared cut
off in momentum space and yields a convergent algorithm enabling us to
calculate the resonance eigenvalues and eigenstates, to arbitrary order in the
feinstructure constant $\alpha \sim 1/137$, and is thus an alternative method
of proof of a similar result obtained in \cite{Sigal2010}.
