The measurement of the charged-current 8B solar neutrino reaction on
deuterium at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory confirms the neutrino oscillation
hypothesis for the solar neutrino problem, and the result favours the solution
with large neutrino mixing angles. We demonstrate that the current neutrino
oscillation data (including atmospheric and reactor neutrinos) are sufficient
to construct the lepton flavour mixing matrix with a reasonable accuracy. We
also infer the maximum size of CP violation effects consistent with the current
neutrino oscillation experiments.
