We investigate Legendrian graphs in $(\R^3, \xi_{std})$. We extend the
classical invariants, Thurston-Bennequin number and rotation number to
Legendrian graphs. We prove that a graph can be Legendrian realized with all
its cycles Legendrian unknots with $tb=-1$ and $rot=0$ if and only if it does
not contain $K_4$ as a minor. We show that the pair $(tb, rot)$ does not
characterize a Legendrian graph up to Legendrian isotopy if the graph contains
a cut edge or a cut vertex. For the lollipop graph the pair $(tb,rot)$
determines two Legendrian classes and for the handcuff graph it determines four
Legendrian classes.
