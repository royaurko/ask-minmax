Aging dynamics of a reentrant ferromagnet stage-2
Cu$_{0.8}$Co$_{0.2}$Cl$_{2}$ graphite intercalation compound has been studied
using DC magnetic susceptibility. This compound undergoes successive
transitions at the transition temperatures $T_{c}$ ($\approx 8.7$ K) and
$T_{RSG}$ ($\approx 3.3$ K). The relaxation rate $S_{ZFC}(t)$ exhibits a
characteristic peak at $t_{cr}$ below $T_{c}$. The peak time $t_{cr}$ as a
function of temperature $T$ shows a local maximum around 5.5 K, reflecting a
frustrated nature of the ferromagnetic phase. It drastically increases with
decreasing temperature below $T_{RSG}$. The spin configuration imprinted at the
stop and wait process at a stop temperature $T_{s}$ ($<T_{c}$) during the
field-cooled aging protocol, becomes frozen on further cooling. On reheating,
the memory of the aging at $T_{s}$ is retrieved as an anomaly of the
thermoremnant magnetization at $T_{s}$. These results indicate the occurrence
of the aging phenomena in the ferromagnetic phase ($T_{RSG}<T<T_{c}$) as well
as in the reentrant spin glass phase ($T<T_{RSG}$).
