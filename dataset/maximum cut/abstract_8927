A trade-off relation on our knowledge about two noncommuting observables of a
qubit system in simultaneous measurement is formulated. The obtained inequality
offers a quantitative information-theoretic representation of Bohr's principle
of complementarity, and can be interpreted as a trade-off relation on the
asymptotic accuracy of the maximum-likelihood estimation of the probability
distributions of observables.
