We consider two weakly coupled Richardson models to study the formation of a
relative phase and the Josephson dynamics between two mesoscopic attractively
interacting fermionic systems: our results apply to superconducting properties
of coupled ultrasmall metallic grains and to Cooper-pairing superfluidity in
neutral systems with a finite number of fermions. We discuss how a definite
relative phase between the two systems emerges and how it can be conveniently
extracted from the many-body wavefunction: we find that a definite relative
phase difference emerges even for very small numbers of pairs ~10. The
Josephson dynamics and the current-phase characteristics are then investigated,
showing that the critical current has a maximum at the BCS-BEC crossover. For
the considered initial conditions a two-state model gives a good description of
the dynamics and of the current-phase characteristics.
