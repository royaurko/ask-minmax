The unusual pre-main-sequence binary star named KH 15D undergoes remarkably
deep and long-lasting periodic eclipses. Some clues about the reason for these
eclipses have come from the observed evolution of the system's light curve over
the last century. Here we present UBVRI photometry of KH 15D based on
photographic plates from various observatories, ranging in time from 1954 to
1997. The system has been variable at the ~1 mag level since at least 1965.
There is no evidence for color variations, with a typical limit of Delta(B-V) <
0.2 mag. We confirm some previously published results that were based on a
smaller sample of plates: from approximately 1965 to 1990, the total flux was
modulated with the 48-day orbital period of the binary, but the maximum flux
was larger, the fractional variations were smaller, and the phase of minimum
flux was shifted by almost a half-cycle relative to the modern light curve. All
these results are consistent with the recently proposed theory that KH 15D is
being occulted by an inclined, precessing, circumbinary ring.
