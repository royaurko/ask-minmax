Understanding the evolution of business artifacts will enable business
analyst to discover more insight from process execution data. In this context,
describing how the artifacts are wired, helps in understanding, predicting and
optimizing the behavior of dynamic processes. In many cases, however, process
artifacts evolve over time, as they pass through the business's operations.
Consequently, understanding the evolution of artifacts becomes challenging and
requires analyzing the provenance of business artifacts. In this paper our aim
is to analyze and classify existing challenges in artifact centric business
processes. We propose to extend Provenance techniques to artifact centric BPMs
in order to perform cross cutting concerns on BPMs. Provenance is
pre-requirement of addressing cross cutting concerns, which will provide
information regarding artifact instance creation and its evolution during its
life cycle. Due to dynamic nature of dynamic processes and declarative
structure of Artifact Centric BPM systems, it's vital to make sure how an
artifact instance actually executed and evolved during its processing in run
time.
