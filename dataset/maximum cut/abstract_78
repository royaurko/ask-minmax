The formation of large scale structure is independent of the nature of the
cold dark matter (CDM), however the fate of very small scale inhomogeneities
depends on the micro-physics of the CDM particles. We investigate the matter
power spectrum for scales that enter the Hubble radius well before
matter-radiation equality, and follow its evolution until the time when the
first inhomogeneities become non-linear. Our focus lies on weakly interacting
massive particles (WIMPs), and as a concrete example we analyze the case when
the lightest supersymmetric particle is a bino. We show that collisional
damping and free-streaming of WIMPs lead to a matter power spectrum with a
sharp cut-off at about 10^(-6) M_odot and a maximum close to that cut-off. We
also calculate the transfer function for the growth of the inhomogeneities in
the linear regime. These three effects (collisional damping, free-streaming and
gravitational growth) are combined to provide a WMAP normalized primordial CDM
power spectrum, which could serve as an input for high resolution CDM
simulations. The smallest inhomogeneities typically enter the non-linear regime
at a redshift of about 60.
