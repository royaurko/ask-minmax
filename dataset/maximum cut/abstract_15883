We present here numerical hydrodynamic simulations of line-driven accretion
disk winds in cataclysmic variable systems. We calculate wind mass-loss rate,
terminal velocities, and line profiles for CIV (1550 A) for various viewing
angles. The models are 2.5-dimensional, include an energy balance condition,
and calculate the radiation field as a function of position near an optically
thick accretion disk. The model results show that centrifugal forces produce
collisions of streamlines in the disk wind which in turn generate an enhanced
density region, underlining the necessity of two dimensional calculations where
these forces may be represented. For disk luminosity Ldisk = Lsun, white dwarf
mass Mwd = 0.6 Msun, and white dwarf radii Rwd = 0.01 Rsun, we obtain a wind
mass-loss rate of dMwind/dt = 8.0E-12 Msun/yr, and a terminal velocity of ~3000
km/s. The line profiles we obtain are consistent with observations in their
general form, in particular in the maximum absorption at roughly half the
terminal velocity for the blue-shifted component, in the magnitudes of the wind
velocities implied by the absorption components, in the FWHM of the emission
components, and in the strong dependence in inclination angle.
