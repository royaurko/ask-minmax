The weak boson fusion process for neutral Higgs boson production is
investigated with particular attention to the accuracy with which the Higgs
boson coupling to weak bosons can be determined at CERN Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) energies in final states that contain a Higgs boson plus at least two
jets. Using fully differential perturbative matrix elements for the weak boson
fusion signal process and for the QCD background processes, we generate events
in which a Higgs boson is produced along with two jets that carry large
transverse momentum. The effectiveness of different prescriptions to enhance
the signal to background ratio is studied, and the expected signal purities are
calculated in each case. We find that a simple cut on the rapidity of one
final-state jet works well. We determine that an accuracy of delta_g/g ~ 10% on
the effective coupling g may be possible after ~ 200 fb^-1 of integrated
luminosity is accumulated at the LHC.
