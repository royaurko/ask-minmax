Given two players alternately picking pieces of a pizza sliced by radial
cuts, in such a way that after the first piece is taken every subsequent chosen
piece is adjacent to some previously taken piece, we provide a strategy for the
starting player to get 4/9 of the pizza. This is best possible and settles a
conjecture of Peter Winkler.
