We investigate the behavior of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator
$\hat{f}_n$ for a decreasing density $f$ near the boundaries of the support of
$f$. We establish the limiting distribution of $\hat{f}_n(n^{-\alpha})$, where
we need to distinguish between different values of $0<\alpha<1$. Similar
results are obtained for the upper endpoint of the support, in the case it is
finite. This yields consistent estimators for the values of $f$ at the
boundaries of the support. The limit distribution of these estimators is
established and their performance is compared with the penalized maximum
likelihood estimator.
