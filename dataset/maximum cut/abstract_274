We examine the regenerative cutting process by using a single degree of
freedom non-smooth model with a friction component and a time delay term.
Instead of the standard Lyapunov exponent calculations, we propose a
statistical 0-1 test analysis for chaos detection. This approach reveals the
nature of the cutting process signaling regular or chaotic dynamics. For the
investigated deterministic model we are able to show a transition from chaotic
to regular motion with increasing cutting speed. For two values of time delay
showing the different response the results have been confirmed by the means of
the spectral density and the multiscaled entropy.
