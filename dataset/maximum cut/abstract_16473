We investigate the interference effects of non-standard neutrino-matter
interactions (NSNI) with the mass-induced neutrino oscillations. The NSNI is
composed of flavor-changing neutrino interactions (FCNI) and flavor-diagonal
neutrino interactions (FDNI). Both of the interactions are introduced in the
\nu_\mu -\nu_\tau sector and the \nu_e -\nu_\mu sector in order to study their
effects in \nu_\mu\to\nu_\tau and \nu_\mu\to\nu_e oscillations, respectively.
The FCNI effect proves to possibly dominate the CP violating effect and
significantly survive as a fake CP violating effct in the neutrino energy
region where the pure CP violating effect, ordinary matter effect and FDNI
effect fall, for example, above 4 GeV at the baseline of L=730 km in the
\nu_\mu\to\nu_\tau oscillation for the maximum parameter values of FCNI and
FDNI allowed by the atmospheric neutrino oscillation data. The FCNI and FDNI
effects on CP violation in the $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e$ oscillation are negligibly
small due to the stringent constraints on FCNI from the bounds on lepton flavor
violating processes and on FDNI from the limits on lepton universality
violation.
