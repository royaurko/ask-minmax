The Gaussian model of discontinuous percolation, recently introduced by
Ara\'ujo and Herrmann [Phys. Rev. Lett., 105, 035701 (2010)], is numerically
investigated in three dimensions, disclosing a discontinuous transition. For
the simple-cubic lattice, in the thermodynamic limit, we report a finite jump
of the order parameter, $J=0.415 \pm 0.005$. The largest cluster at the
threshold is compact, but its external perimeter is fractal with fractal
dimension $d_A = 2.5 \pm 0.2$. The study is extended to hypercubic lattices up
to six dimensions and to the mean-field limit (infinite dimension). We find
that, in all considered dimensions, the percolation transition is
discontinuous. The value of the jump in the order parameter, the maximum of the
second moment, and the percolation threshold are analyzed, revealing
interesting features of the transition and corroborating its discontinuous
nature in all considered dimensions. We also show that the fractal dimension of
the external perimeter, for any dimension, is consistent with the one from
bridge percolation and establish a lower bound for the percolation threshold of
discontinuous models with finite number of clusters at the threshold.
