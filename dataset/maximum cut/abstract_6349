We have taken a 4-day spectroscopic observation and have been conducting a
13-day photometric study of the SU UMa-type dwarf nova, ER Ursae Majoris. The
mean $K$-amplitude for the emission lines is $54\pm 8$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\gamma$
velocity is 8$\pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$ from our spectroscopic results. A phase shift
of 0.22 is also obtained.
  Our photometric observation confirms superhumps in normal outbursts of ER UMa
and reconciles contradictory observational results obtained by different
contributors. We find that superhumps possibly develop near each normal outburst
maximum and fade out before the next outburst maximum. If the observed humps
were not late superhumps but ordinary superhumps, much more theoretical works
should be done to explain the new phenomena.
