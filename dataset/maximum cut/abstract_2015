We derive a variational principle for the dynamical stability of a cluster as
a gas sphere in a box. Newtonian clusters are always dynamically stable and,
for relativistic clusters, the relation between dynamical and thermodynamical
instabilities is analyzed. The boundaries between dynamically and
thermodynamically stable and unstable models are found numerically for
relativistic stellar systems with different cut off parameters. A criterion
based on binding energy curve is used for determination of the boundary of
dynamical stability.
