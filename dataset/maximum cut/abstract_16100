We performed extensive, multi-wavelength observations of the prototypical
symbiotic star Z Andromedae between 2000 and 2003, during a large eruption. The
rise to optical maximum occurred in three distinct stages. During the first
stage, the rise was very similar to an earlier, small outburst which we
determined was due to an accretion-disk instability. In the second stage, an
optically thick shell of material was ejected, and in the third stage, the
shell cleared to reveal a white dwarf whose luminosity was roughly 10^4 Lsun.
We suggest that the outburst was powered by an increase in the rate of nuclear
burning on the white-dwarf surface, triggered by a sudden burst of accretion.
This outburst thus combined elements of both dwarf novae and classical novae.
