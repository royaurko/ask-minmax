A 45 deg2 radio continuum imaging campaign of the nearest radio galaxy,
Centaurus A, is reported. Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the
Parkes 64m radio telescope at 1.4 GHz, the spatial resolution of the resultant
image is ~600 pc, resolving the ~500 kpc giant radio lobes with approximately
five times better physical resolution compared to any previous image, and
making this the most detailed radio continuum image of any radio galaxy to
date. In this paper, we present these new data and discuss briefly some of the
most interesting morphological features that we have discovered in the
images... abstract truncated.
