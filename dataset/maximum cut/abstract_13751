In F-theory GUTs interactions between fields are typically localised at
points of enhanced symmetry in the internal dimensions implying that the
coefficient of the associated operator can be studied using a local
wavefunctions overlap calculation. Some F-theory SU(5) GUT theories may exhibit
a maximum symmetry enhancement at a point to E8, and in this case all the
operators of the theory can be associated to the same point. We take initial
steps towards the study of operators in such theories. We calculate
wavefunctions and their overlaps around a general point of enhancement and
establish constraints on the local form of the fluxes. We then apply the
general results to a simple model at a point of E8 enhancement and calculate
some example operators such as Yukawa couplings and dimension-five couplings
that can lead to proton decay.
