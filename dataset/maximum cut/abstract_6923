In this paper we modify slightly Razborov's flag algebra machinery to be
suitable for the hypercube. We use this modified method to show that the
maximum number of edges of a 4-cycle-free subgraph of the n-dimensional
hypercube is at most 0.6068 times the number of its edges. We also improve the
upper bound on the number of edges for 6-cycle-free subgraphs of the
n-dimensional hypercube from the square root of 2 - 1 to 0.3755 times the
number of its edges. Additionally, we show that if the n-dimensional hypercube
is considered as a poset, then the maximum vertex density of three middle
layers in an induced subgraph without 4-cycles is at most 2.15121 times n
choose n/2.
