We use the Spitzer Space Telescope Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP) and the
Spitzer Archival Far-InfraRed Extragalactic Survey (SAFIRES) to study the
spectral energy distributions of spectroscopically confirmed type 1 quasars
selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By combining the Spitzer and
SDSS data with the 2-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) we are able to construct a
statistically robust rest-frame 0.1-100 micron type 1 quasar template. We find
the quasar population is well-described by a single power-law SED at
wavelengths less than 20 microns, in good agreement with previous work.
However, at longer wavelengths we find a significant excess in infrared
luminosity above an extrapolated power-law, along with signifiant
object-to-object dispersion in the SED. The mean excess reaches a maximum of
0.8 dex at rest-frame wavelengths near 100 microns.
