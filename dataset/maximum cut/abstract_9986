We reanalyze the catalogs of molecular clouds in the Local Group to determine
the parameters of their mass distributions in a uniform manner. The analysis
uses the error-in-variables method of parameter estimation which accounts not
only for the variance of the sample when drawn from a parent distribution but
also for errors in the mass measurements. Testing the method shows that it
recovers the underlying properties of cumulative mass distribution without bias
while accurately reflecting uncertainties in the parameters. Clouds in the
inner disk of the Milky Way follow a truncated power-law distribution with
index \gamma=-1.5 +/- 0.1 and maximum mass of 10^6.5 M_sun. The distributions
of cloud mass for the outer Milky Way and M33 show significantly steeper
indices (\gamma_OMW= -2.1 +/- 0.2 and \gamma_M33= -2.9 +/- 0.4) with no
evidence of a cutoff. The mass distribution of clouds in the Large Magellanic
Cloud has a marginally steeper distribution than the inner disk of the Milky
Way (\gamma=-1.7 +/- 0.2) and also shows evidence of a truncation with a
maximum mass of 10^6.5 M_sun. The mass distributions of molecular clouds vary
dramatically across the Local Group, even after accounting for the systematic
errors that arise in comparing heterogeneous data and catalogs. These
differences should be accounted for in studies that aim to reproduce the
molecular cloud mass distributions or in studies that use the mass spectrum as
a parameter in a model.
