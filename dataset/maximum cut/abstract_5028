The full Super-Kamiokande-III data-taking period, which ran from August of
2006 through August of 2008, yielded 298 live days worth of solar neutrino data
with a lower total energy threshold of 4.5 MeV. During this period we made many
improvements to the experiment's hardware and software, with particular
emphasis on its water purification system and Monte Carlo simulations. As a
result of these efforts, we have significantly reduced the low energy
backgrounds as compared to earlier periods of detector operation, cut the
systematic errors by nearly a factor of two, and achieved a 4.5 MeV energy
threshold for the solar neutrino analysis. In this presentation, I will present
the preliminary SK-III solar neutrino measurement results.
