Let $A(x) = A_0 + x_1 A_1+ \cdots +x_nA_n$ be a linear matrix, or pencil,
generated by given symmetric matrices A0, A1, ... An of size m with rational
entries. The set of real vectors x such that the pencil is positive
semidefinite is a convex semi-algebraic set called spectrahedron, described by
a linear matrix inequality (LMI). We design an exact algorithm that, up to
genericity assumptions on the input matrices, computes an exact algebraic
representation of at least one point in the spectrahedron, or decides that it
is empty. The algorithm does not assume the existence of an interior point, and
the computed point minimizes the rank of the pencil on the spectrahedron. The
degree d of the algebraic representation of the point coincides experimentally
with the algebraic degree of a generic semidefinite program associated to the
pencil. We provide explicit bounds for the complexity of our algorithm, proving
that the maximum number of arithmetic operations that are performed is
essentially quadratic in a multilinear Bezout bound of d. When the size m of
the pencil is fixed, such a bound, and hence the complexity, is polynomial in
n, the number of variables. We conclude by providing results of experiments
showing practical improvements with respect to state-of-the-art computer
algebra algorithms.
