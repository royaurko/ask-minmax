We use the method of `coupling to 2d QG' to study the analytic properties of
the universal specific free energy of the O(n) loop model in complex magnetic
field. We compute the specific free energy on a dynamical lattice using the
correspondence with a matrix model. The free energy has a pair of Yang-Lee
edges on the high-temperature sheet and a Langer type branch cut on the
low-temperature sheet. Our result confirms a conjecture by A. and Al.
Zamolodchikov about the decay rate of the metastable vacuum in presence of
Liouville gravity and gives strong evidence about the existence of a weakly
metastable state and a Langer branch cut in the O(n) loop model on a flat
lattice. Our results are compatible with the Fonseca-Zamolodchikov conjecture
that the Yang-Lee edge appears as the nearest singularity under the Langer cut.
