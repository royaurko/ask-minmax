Correlation in two-dimensional soap froth is analysed with an effective
potential for the first time. Cells with equal number of sides repel (with
linear correlation) while cells with different number of sides attract (with
NON-bilinear) for nearest neighbours, which cannot be explained by the maximum
entropy argument. Also, the analysis indicates that froth is correlated up to
the third shell neighbours at least, contradicting the conventional ideas that
froth is not strongly correlated.
