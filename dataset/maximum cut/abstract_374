It is shown that new pure shear acoustic surface waves with five different
velocities can be guided by stress free plane cuts with different
magneto-electrical properties in magneto-electro-elastic materials. The
possibility for the surface waves to be guided by a cut in pairs, which is
reported in this paper, is new in magneto-electro-elastic materials and has no
counterpart in piezoelectric materials. The five velocities of propagation of
the surface waves are obtained in explicit forms. It is shown that the
possibility for the surface waves to be guided in pairs disappears and the
number of surface waves decreases from 5 to 1 if the magneto-electro-elastic
material is changed to a piezoelectric material.
