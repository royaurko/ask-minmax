Advanced co-channel interference aware signal detection has drawn research
attention during the recent development of Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A)
systems and the interference-aware communications (IAC) is currently being
studied by 3GPP. This paper investigates link performance abstraction for the
IAC systems employing maximum-likelihood detector (MLD). The link performance
of MLD can be estimated by combining two performance bounds, namely, linear
receiver and genie-aided maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver. It is shown that the
conventional static approach based on static parameterization, while working
well under moderate and weak interference conditions, fails to generate a
well-behaved solution in the strong interference case. Inspired by this
observation, we propose a new adaptive approach where the combining parameter
is adaptively adjusted according to instantaneous interference-to-signal ratio
(ISR). The basic idea is to exploit the probabilistic behavior of the optimal
combining ratio over the ISR. The link-level simulation results are provided to
verify the prediction accuracy of the proposed link abstraction method.
Moreover, we use the proposed link abstraction model as a link-to-system
interface mapping in system-level simulations to demonstrate the performance of
the IAC receiver in interference-limited LTE systems
