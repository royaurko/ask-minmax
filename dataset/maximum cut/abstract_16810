The measurement of particle correlations and fluctuations has been suggested
as a method to search for the existence of a phase transition in relativistic
heavy ion collisions. If quark-gluon matter is formed in the collision of
relativistic heavy ions, measuring these correlations could lead to a
determination of the presence of partonic degrees of freedom within the
collision. Additionally, non-statistical fluctuations in global quantities such
as baryon number, strangeness, or charge may be observed near a QCD critical
point. Results for short and long-range multiplicity correlations
(forward-backward) are presented for several systems (Au+Au and Cu+Cu) and
energies (e.g. $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200, 62.4, and 22.4 GeV). For the highest
energy central A+A collisions, the correlation strength maintains a constant
value across the measurement region. In peripheral collisions, at lower
energies, and in pp data, the maximum appears at midrapidity. Comparison to
models with short-range (HIJING) and both short and long-range interactions
(Parton String Model) do not fully reproduce central Au+Au data. Preliminary
results for K/$\pi$ fluctuations are also shown as a function of centrality in
Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 22.4 GeV.
