We (analytically) calculate the energy spectrum corresponding to various
experimental and numerical turbulence data analyzed by Benzi et al.. We find
two bottleneck phenomena: While the local scaling exponent $\zeta_r(r)$ of the
structure function decreases monotonically, the local scaling exponent
$\zeta_p(p)$ of the corresponding spectrum has a minimum of
$\zeta_p(p_{min})\approx 0.45$ at $p_{min}\approx (10 \eta)^{-1}$ and a maximum
of $\zeta_p(p_{max})\approx 0.77$ at $p_{max}\approx 8 L^{-1}$. A physical
argument starting from the constant energy flux in p--space reveals the general
mechanism underlying the energy pileups at both ends of the p--space scaling
range. In the case studied here, they are induced by viscous dissipation and
the reduced spectral strength on the scale of the system size, respectively.
