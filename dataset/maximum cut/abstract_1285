We present a status report of our systematic theoretical and phenomenological
study of QCD-instanton induced processes in deep-inelastic scattering. We show
that this regime plays a distinguished role for studying manifestations of
QCD-instantons, since the typical hard momentum scale $Q$ provides a dynamical
infrared cutoff for the instanton size $\rho\lwig O(1/Q)$. For deep-inelastic
scattering at HERA, we present a preliminary theoretical estimate of the total
instanton-induced cross-section (subject to appropriate kinematical cuts). It
is surprisingly large, in the $ O(1-100)$ pb range, albeit still uncertain. We
report on our investigation of the discovery potential for instanton-induced
events at HERA by means of a Monte Carlo event generator. It is based on a
detailed study of the characteristic signatures of the final state, like a
large total transverse energy, $E_{T}= O(20)$ GeV, a large multiplicity, $n=
O(25)$, and a flavour-democratic production of hadrons. A combination of event
shape information with searches of $K^{0}$ mesons, muons, and multiplicity cuts
might help to discriminate further the QCD-instanton induced processes from the
standard perturbative QCD background.
