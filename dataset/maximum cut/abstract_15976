We analyze STIS spectra in the 1150-1700 Angstrom wavelength range obtained
for six early B supergiants in the neighboring galaxy M31. Because of their
likely high (nearly solar) abundance, these stars were originally chosen to be
directly comparable to their Galactic counterparts, and represent a much-needed
addition to our current sample of B-type supergiants, in our efforts to study
the dependence of the Wind Momentum-Luminosity Relationship on spectral type
and metallicity. As a first step to determine wind momenta we fit the P-Cygni
profiles of the resonance lines of N V, Si IV and C IV with standard methods,
and derive terminal velocities for all of the STIS targets. From these lines we
also derive ionic stellar wind column densities. Our results are compared with
those obtained previously in Galactic supergiants, and confirm earlier claims
of `normal' wind line intensities and terminal velocities in M31. For half of
the sample we find evidence for an enhanced maximum turbulent velocity when
compared to Galactic counterparts.
