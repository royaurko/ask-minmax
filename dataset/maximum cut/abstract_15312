We present near-infrared spectroscopic and photometric observations of nova
V5584 Sgr taken during the first 12 days following its discovery on Oct. 26.439
UT 2009. The evolution of the spectra is shown from the initial P Cygni phase
to an emission line phase. The prominent carbon lines seen in the JHK spectra
closely match those observed in a FeII class nova outburst. The spectra show
first-overtone CO bands in emission between 2.29-2.40 micron. By examining WISE
and other publicly available data, we show that the nova underwent a pronounced
dust formation phase during February - April 2010.
