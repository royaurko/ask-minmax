Features of the controllable displacement, annihilation, and transformation
of macroscopic regions of a weak frozen magnetic field (FMF) have been
experimentally studied in a plate of granulated ceramic YBa2Cu3O7-x under the
action of the transport current flowing through it. It is shown that the
displacement of regions with an FMF lower than the first critical field of the
ceramic granules (Hc1g) is associated with a relatively weak pinning force of
the hypervortices that is less than the maximum experimentally attainable
Lorenz force. A discussion is presented of the role of the transport current
that not only is one of the conditions for the appearance of the Lorenz force
but also acts on the internal current structure of the local FMF, which in turn
influences its mobility and magnitude. If a local field greater than Hc1g is
frozen in, the experimentally produced Lorenz force is less than the pinning
force of the Abrikosov vortices in the mixed state of the granules, and there
is no displacement of the regions with an FMF.
