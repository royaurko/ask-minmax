Rapidly rotating Kerr black holes can accelerate particles to arbitrarily
high energy if the angular momentum of the particle is fine-tuned to some
critical value. This phenomenon is robust as it is founded on the basic
properties of geodesic orbits around a near-extremal Kerr black hole. On the
other hand, the maximum energy of the acceleration is subjected to several
physical effects. There is convincing evidence that the particle acceleration
to arbitrarily high energy is one of the universal properties of general
near-extremal black holes. We also discuss gravitational particle acceleration
in more general context. This article is intended to provide a pedagogical
introduction to and a brief overview of this topic for non-specialists.
