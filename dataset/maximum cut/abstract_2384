Message passing is a key ingredient of concurrent programming. The purpose of
this paper is to describe the equivalence between the proof theory, the
categorical semantics, and term calculus of message passing. In order to
achieve this we introduce the categorical notion of a linear actegory and the
related polycategorical notion of a poly-actegory. Not surprisingly the
notation used for the term calculus borrows heavily from the (synchronous)
pi-calculus. The cut elimination procedure for the system provides an
operational semantics.
