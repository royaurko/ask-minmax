We study electron transport through a small metallic island in the
perturbative regime. Using a recently developed diagrammatic technique, we
calculate the occupation of the island as well as the conductance through the
transistor in forth order in the tunneling matrix elements, a process referred
to as cotunneling. Our formulation does not require the introduction of a
cut-off. At resonance we find significant modifications of previous theories
and good agreement with recent experiments.
