We present BVR photometric observations of the blazar PKS 0736+017. These
observations were carried out with three telescopes in Mexico and two in Spain
between December 1998 and April 2003. PKS 0736+017 shows remarkable variation
at different timescales and amplitudes. Maximum brightness was detected on
December 19, 2001 (B=14.90+/-0.01, V=14.34+/-0.01, and R=13.79+/-0.01). A
peculiar tendency to redden with increased brightness was detected throughout
our observations. Moreover, in one season a good correlation between flux level
and spectral slope is shown. This "anomalous" behaviour cannot be described by
common flare models of blazars. The flux vs. spectral slope correlation
observed in this and other blazars is worth further study.
