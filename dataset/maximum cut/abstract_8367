We performed angle-resolved photoemission experiments on overdoped single
crystal $Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}$ samples with Tc values as low as 55K and very
narrow transitions as measured by AC susceptibility. The photoemission data
indicate the presence of a ``shadow'' peak in the quasiparticle spectral
function $A(\omega)$ shifted by $(\pi,\pi)$ from the conventional quasiparticle
peak. The ratio of the shadow/quasiparticle peak amplitudes strongly increases
with the binding energy. This is consistent with the idea that the shadow peak
is not a structural replica of the quasiparticle peak, but rather a maximum in
a spectral function which can exist due to interaction with spin fluctuations
peaked at $(\pi,\pi)$.
