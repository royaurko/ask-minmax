Current-induced magnetization dynamics in Co/Cu/Co trilayer nanopillars
(~100nm in diameter) has been studied experimentally for large applied fields
perpendicular to the layers. An abrupt and hysteretic increase in dynamic
resistance is observed at high current densities for one polarity of the
current, comparable to the giant magnetoresistance effect observed at low
fields. A micromagnetic model, that includes a spin-transfer torque, suggests
that the current induces a complete reversal of the thin Co layer to alignment
antiparallel to the applied field-that is, to a state of maximum magnetic
energy.
