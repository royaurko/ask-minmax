The hypothesis regarding the existence of uncorrelated pre-formed pairs in
the pseudogap regime of superconducting $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ is tested experimentally
using bilayers of $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ and the itinerant ferromagnet $SrRuO_3$. In
our study, we monitor the influence of $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ on $T_p$, the
ferromagnetic ordering temperature of $SrRuO_3$. Here, $T_p$ is the temperature
of maximum dM/dT or dR/dT where M and R are the magnetization and resistance of
$SrRuO_3$, respectively. We compare the results with similar measurements
carried out on bilayers of $La_{1.88}Sr_{0.12}CuO_{4-y}$, $Au$ and $Cr$ with
$SrRuO_3$. We find that in bilayers made of underdoped 10 nm $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$/5
nm $SrRuO_3$, the $T_p$ values are shifted to lower temperatures by up to 6-8 K
as compared to $T_p\approx 140$ K of the 5 nm thick reference $SrRuO_3$ film.
In contrast, in the other type of bilayers, which are not in the pseudogap
regime near $T_p$, only a smaller shift of up to $\pm$2 K is observed. These
differences are discussed in terms of a proximity effect, where carriers from
the $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ layer are injected into the $SrRuO_3$ layer and vice versa.
We suggest that correlated electrons in the pseudogap regime of $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$
are responsible for the observed large $T_p$ shifts.
