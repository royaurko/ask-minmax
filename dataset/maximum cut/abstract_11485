We present 92cm observations of the high-redshift galaxy B2 0902+343 (z=3.40)
with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). Twenty-one cm HI is
detected in absorption, at a depth of 15.9 mJy (=~6\sigma) and rest frame
velocity width 120 km/s. We also report a null detection of OH emission or
absorption at the 1665/1667 MHz rest-frame transitions. Based on our spectral
sensitivity, we derive an upper limit on OH maser luminosity of
log(L/Lsun)<5.2. In addition, we consider the possibility of absorption, and
estimate a maximum column depth N(OH) of 1x10^15 cm^-2, corresponding to at
most 2x10^5-9x10^6 Msun of OH in the galaxy. The implications of these results
are discussed in the context of current efforts to extend the OH megamaser
luminosity function and galactic merger rate to high redshift.
