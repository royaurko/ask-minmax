In the spring of 2008 MAGIC organised multi-wavelength (MWL) observations of
the blazar 1ES 1011+496. 1ES 1011+496 is a high-frequency peaked BL Lac object
discovered at VHE gamma-rays by MAGIC in spring 2007 during an optical outburst
reported by the Tuorla Blazar Monitoring Programme. MAGIC re-observed the
source during the 2008 MWL campaign which also included the Mets\"ahovi, KVA,
Swift and AGILE telescopes. This was the first MWL campaign on this source that
also included VHE coverage. MAGIC observed 1ES 1011+496 from March 4th to May
24th 2008 for a total of 27.9 hours, of which 20 h remained after quality cuts.
The observations resulted in a detection of the source a ~7 sigma significance
level with a mean flux and spectral index similar to those during the
discovery.
  Here we will present the results of the MAGIC observations of the source in
combination with contemporaneous observations at other wavelengths (radio,
optical, X-rays, high energy gamma-rays) and discuss their implications on the
modelling of the spectral energy distribution.
