Measurements of charged pion and kaon production in central Pb+Pb collisions
at 40, 80 and 158 AGeV are presented. These are compared with data at lower and
higher energies as well as with results from p+p interactions. The mean pion
multiplicity per wounded nucleon increases approximately linearly with s_NN^1/4
with a change of slope starting in the region 15-40 AGeV. The change from pion
suppression with respect to p+p interactions, as observed at low collision
energies, to pion enhancement at high energies occurs at about 40 AGeV. A
non-monotonic energy dependence of the ratio of K^+ to pi^+ yields is observed,
with a maximum close to 40 AGeV and an indication of a nearly constant value at
higher energies.The measured dependences may be related to an increase of the
entropy production and a decrease of the strangeness to entropy ratio in
central Pb+Pb collisions in the low SPS energy range, which is consistent with
the hypothesis that a transient state of deconfined matter is created above
these energies. Other interpretations of the data are also discussed.
