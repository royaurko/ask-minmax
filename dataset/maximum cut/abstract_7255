Results are presented on a search for neutrino emission from a sample of six
microquasars, based on the data collected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope
between 2007 and 2010. By means of appropriate time cuts, the neutrino search
has been restricted to the periods when the acceleration of relativistic jets
was taking place at the microquasars under study. The time cuts have been
chosen using the information from the X-ray telescopes RXTE/ASM and Swift/BAT,
and, in one case, the gamma-ray telescope Fermi/LAT. Since none of the searches
has produced a statistically significant signal, upper limits on the neutrino
fluences are derived and compared to the predictions from theoretical models.
