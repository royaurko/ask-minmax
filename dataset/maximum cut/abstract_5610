Recent experiments reveal a significant increase in the graphene Fermi
velocity close to charge neutrality. This has widely been interpreted as a
confirmation of the logarithmic divergence of the graphene Fermi velocity
predicted by a perturbative approach. In this work, we reconsider this problem
using functional bosonization techniques calculating the effects of electron
interactions on the density of states non-perturbatively. We find that the
renormalized velocity is {\it finite} and independent of the high energy
cut-off, and we argue that the experimental observations are better understood
in terms of an anomalous dimension. Our results also represent a bosonized
solution for interacting Weyl fermions in (2+1) dimensions at half-filing.
