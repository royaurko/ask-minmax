We consider a full-duplex decode-and-forward system, where the wirelessly
powered relay employs the time-switching protocol to receive power from the
source and then transmit information to the destination. It is assumed that the
relay node is equipped with two sets of antennas to enable full-duplex
communications. Three different interference mitigation schemes are studied,
namely, 1) optimal 2) zero-forcing and 3) maximum ratio combining/maximum ratio
transmission. We develop new outage probability expressions to investigate
delay-constrained transmission throughput of these schemes. Our analysis show
interesting performance comparisons of the considered precoding schemes for
different system and link parameters.
