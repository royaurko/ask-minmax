Graphene exhibits zero-gap massless-Dirac fermion and zero density of states
at E = 0. These particles form localized states called edge states on finite
width strip with zigzag edges at E = 0. Naively thinking, one may expect that
current is also concentrated at the edge, but Zarbo and Nikolic numerically
obtained a result that the current density shows maximum at the center of the
strip. We derive a rigorous relation for the current density, and clarify the
reason why the current density of edge state has a maximum at the center.
