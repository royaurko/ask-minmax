In this note, we give a practical solution to the problem of determining the
maximal period of matrix generators of pseudo-random numbers which are based on
an integer-valued unimodular matrix of size NxN known as MIXMAX and arithmetic
defined on a Galois field GF[p] with large prime modulus p. The existing theory
of Galois finite fields is adapted to the present case, and necessary and
sufficient condition to attain the maximum period is formulated. Three
efficient algorithms are presented. First, allowing to compute the
multiplication by the MIXMAX matrix with O(N) operations. Second, to
recursively compute the characteristic polynomial with O(N^2) operations, and
third, to apply skips of large number of steps S to the sequence in O(N^2
log(S)) operations. It is demonstrated that the dynamical properties of this
generator dramatically improve with the size of the matrix N, as compared to
the classes of generators based on sparse matrices and/or sparse characteristic
polynomials. Finally, we present the implementation details of the generator
and the results of rigorous statistical testing.
