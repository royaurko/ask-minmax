High precision measurements of the Hall effect have been carried out for
archetypal heavy fermion compound - CeAl3 in a wide range of temperatures
1.8-300K. For the first time a complex activated behavior of the Hall
coefficient in CeAl3 with activation energies Ea1/kB=220K and Ea2/kB=3.3K has
been observed in the temperature intervals 50-300K and 10-35K respectively. At
temperatures below the maximum of the Hall effect T<Tmax=10K an asymptotic
dependence RH(T)=exp(-Ea3/kBT) was found in CeAl3 with the value Ea3/kB=0.38K
estimated from the experimental data. The temperature evolution of microscopic
parameters (effective mass and localization radius) evaluated for the many-body
states (heavy fermions) is discussed in terms of an electron-polaron states
formation in vicinity of Ce-sites in the CeAl3 matrix.
