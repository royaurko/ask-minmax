We report signal-to-noise ratio SNR ~ 100 optical spectra for four DA white
dwarf stars acquired with the GMOS spectrograph of the 8m Gemini north
telescope. These stars have 18<g<19 and are around Teff ~ 12000 K, were the
hydrogen lines are close to maximum. Our purpose is to test if the effective
temperatures and surface gravities derived from the relatively low
signal-to-noise ratio (<SNR> ~ 21) optical spectra acquired by the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey through model atmosphere fitting are trustworthy. Our
spectra range from 3800A to 6000A, therefore including H beta to H9. The H8
line was only marginally present in the SDSS spectra, but is crucial to
determine the gravity. When we compare the values published by Kleinman et al.
(2004) and Eisenstein et al. (2006) with our line-profile (LPT) fits, the
average differences are: Delta Teff ~ 320 K, systematically lower in SDSS, and
Delta log g ~ 0.24 dex, systematically larger in SDSS. The correlation between
gravity and effective temperature can only be broken at wavelengths bluer than
3800 A. The uncertainties in Teff are 60% larger, and in log g larger by a
factor of 4, than the Kleinman et al. (2004) and Eisenstein et al. (2006)
internal uncertainties.
