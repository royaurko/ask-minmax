In this Letter we re-examine the idea that gravitational waves are required
as a braking mechanism to explain the observed maximum spin-frequency of
neutron stars. We show that for millisecond X-ray pulsars, the existence of
spin equilibrium as set by the disk/magnetosphere interaction is sufficient to
explain the observations. We show as well that no clear correlation exists
between the neutron star magnetic field B and the X-ray outburst luminosity Lx
when considering an enlarged sample size of millisecond X-ray pulsars.
