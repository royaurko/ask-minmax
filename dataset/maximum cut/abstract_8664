We discuss the cosmology of string models with perturbative supersymmetry
breaking at a scale of ${\cal O}$(TeV). Such models exhibit Kaluza-Klein like
spectra and contain unstable massive gravitinos/gravitons. We find that
considerations of primordial nucleosynthesis constrain the maximum temperature
following inflation to be not much larger than the supersymmetry breaking
scale. This imposes conflicting requirements on the scalar field driving
inflation, making it rather difficult to construct a consistent cosmological
history for such models.
