We study the class of real-valued functions on convex subsets of R^n which
are computed by the maximum of finitely many affine functionals with integer
slopes. We prove several results to the effect that this property of a function
can be detected by sampling on small subsets of the domain. In so doing, we
recover in a unified way some prior results of the first contributor (some joint
with Liang Xiao). We also prove that a function on R^2 is a tropical polynomial
if and only if its restriction to each translate of a generic tropical line is
a tropical polynomial.
