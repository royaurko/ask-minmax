The launch of the Kepler mission on 7th March 2009 opened a new bright future
for the search of extra-solar planets while a huge amount of stars will be
observed leading to the opportunity to better understand stellar evolution.
This will allow us to probe different regions in the HR diagram and put more
constraints on the stellar models. Up to now the asteroseismic missions such as
MOST and CoRoT were providing some solar-like stars at a very slow cadence. But
to study the several hundreds of solar-like oscillating stars that will be
observed during the Kepler survey phase, an analysis devoted to one star is
impossible if we want to have as much information as we can in a small period
of time. We describe here our pipeline, A2Z, which calculates the global
parameters of the stars (rotation period, mean large spacing of the acoustic
modes, maximum amplitude of the modes), fits the modes globally, and estimates
the radius and mass of the stars. This pipeline has been tested on simulated
stars and applied to real data from CoRoT.
