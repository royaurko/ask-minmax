This paper considers the problem of channel coding with a given (possibly
suboptimal) maximum-metric decoding rule. A cost-constrained random-coding
ensemble with multiple auxiliary costs is introduced, and is shown to achieve
error exponents and second-order coding rates matching those of
constant-composition random coding, while being directly applicable to channels
with infinite or continuous alphabets. The number of auxiliary costs required
to match the error exponents and second-order rates of constant-composition
coding is studied, and is shown to be at most two. For i.i.d. random coding,
asymptotic estimates of two well-known non-asymptotic bounds are given using
saddlepoint approximations. Each expression is shown to characterize the
asymptotic behavior of the corresponding random-coding bound at both fixed and
varying rates, thus unifying the regimes characterized by error exponents,
second-order rates and moderate deviations. For fixed rates, novel exact
asymptotics expressions are obtained to within a multiplicative 1+o(1) term.
Using numerical examples, it is shown that the saddlepoint approximations are
highly accurate even at short block lengths.
