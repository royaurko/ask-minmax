We show the effects of supersymmetric higher derivative terms on inflation
models in supergravity. The results show that such terms generically modify the
effective kinetic coefficient of the inflaton during inflation if the cut off
scale of the higher derivative operators is sufficiently small. In such a case,
the $\eta$-problem in supergravity does not occur, and we find that the
effective potential of the inflaton generically becomes a power type potential
with a power smaller than two.
