We study the response of a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron stimulated by a periodic
sequence of conductance pulses arriving through the synapse in the high
frequency regime. In addition to the usual excitation threshold there is a
smooth crossover from the firing to the silent regime for increasing pulse
amplitude $g_{syn}$. The amplitude of the voltage spikes decreases
approximately linearly with $g_{syn}$. In some regions of parameter space the
response is irregular, probably chaotic. In the chaotic regime between the
mode-locked regions 3:1 and 2:1 near the lower excitation threshold the output
interspike interval histogram (ISIH) undergoes a sharp transition. If the
driving period is below the critical value, $T_i < T^*$, the output histogram
contains only odd multiples of $T_i$. For $T_i > T^*$ even multiples of $T_i$
also appear in the histogram, starting from the largest values. Near $T^*$ the
ISIH scales logarithmically on both sides of the transition. The coefficient of
variation of ISIH has a cusp singularity at $T^*$. The average response period
has a maximum slightly above $T^*$. Near the excitation threshold in the
chaotic regime the average firing rate rises sublinearly from frequencies of
order 1 Hz.
