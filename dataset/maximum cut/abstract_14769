Let $d \geq 3$ be an integer. It is known that the number of edges of the
edge polytope of the complete graph with $d$ vertices is $d(d-1)(d-2)/2$. In
this paper, we study the maximum possible number $\mu_d$ of edges of the edge
polytope arising from finite simple graphs with $d$ vertices. We show that
$\mu_{d}=d(d-1)(d-2)/2$ if and only if $3 \leq d \leq 14$. In addition, we
study the asymptotic behavior of $\mu_d$. Tuan--Ziegler gave a lower bound for
$\mu_d$ by constructing a random graph. We succeeded in improving this bound by
constructing both a non-random graph and a random graph whose complement is
bipartite.
