I discuss event cuts in DIS which improve the similarity between the current
Breit hemisphere and hemispheres in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. I also present a
method to study the scale evolution in quark hemispheres using data from fixed
energy $e^+e^-$ experiments. This method can benefit from the high statistics
and flavour tagging at LEP1, also at scales relevant for a comparison with HERA
results.
