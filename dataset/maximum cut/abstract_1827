In this article we construct a new family of linear maximum rank distance
(MRD) codes for all parameters. This family contains the only known family, the
Gabidulin codes, and contains codes inequivalent to the Gabidulin codes. We
also calculate the automorphism group of these codes, including the
automorphism group of the Gabidulin codes.
