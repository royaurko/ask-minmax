DM Cyg, a fundamental mode RRab star was observed in the 2007 and 2008
seasons in the frame of the Konkoly Blazhko Survey. Very small amplitude light
curve modulation was detected with 10.57 d modulation period. The maximum
brightness and phase variations do not exceed 0.07 mag and 7 min, respectively.
In spite of the very small amplitude of the modulation, beside the frequency
triplets characterizing the Fourier spectrum of the light curve two quintuplet
components were also identified. The accuracy and the good phase coverage of
our observations made it possible to analyse the light curves at different
phases of the modulation separately. Utilizing the IP method (S\'odor, Jurcsik
and Szeidl, 2009) we could detect very small systematic changes in the global
mean physical parameters of DM Cyg during its Blazhko cycle. The detected
changes are similar to what we have already found for a large modulation
amplitude Blazhko variable MW Lyrae. The amplitudes of the detected changes in
the physical parameters of DM Cyg are only about 10% of that what have been
found in MW Lyr. This is in accordance with its small modulation amplitude
being about one tenth of the modulation amplitude of MW Lyr.
