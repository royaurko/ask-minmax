ALHAMBRA is a project to gather data to sample a fraction of the Universe
with enough precision to follow the evolution of its content and properties
with z, a kind of Cosmic Tomography. It is defined as a 4 square degrees
photometric survey with 20 contiguous, equal width, medium band filters
covering from 3500 to 9700 A, plus the JHKs NIR bands. It was optimized to get
(for a fixed observing time) the maximum number of objects with accurate
classification and redshift and to be sensitive to relatively faint emission
features. The observations will be carried out with the 3.5m telescope in Calar
Alto (Spain). We intend to reach the limit AB=25 in all the optical filters
from the bluest to 8300 A, and from 24.7 to 23.4 for the remainder. The
expected limit in the NIR is fixed at Ks=20, H=21, J=22. The homogeneous and
contiguous spectral coverage will result in several hundred thousand objects
with accurate SED identification and z-values. The accuracy of the survey will
allow to make detailed studies, including galactic, without the need for any
further follow-up. Indeed, it will provide exciting targets for large
telescopes, the GTC in particular.
