The present study deals with the estimation of the mean value of
fecundability by fitting a theoretical distribution from the observed month of
first conception of the married women who did not use any contraceptive method
before their first conception. It is assumed that fecundability is fixed for a
given couple, but across couples it varies according to a specified
distribution. Under the classical approach, methods of moment and maximum
likelihood are used while for Bayesian approach we use the above two estimates
as prior for fecundability parameter. A real data analysis from the third
National Family Health Survey (NFHS-III) is analyzed as an application of
model. Finally, a simulation study is performed to access the performance of
the several of methods used in this paper
