We consider 1D Burgers equation driven by large-scale white-in-time random
force. The tails of the velocity gradients probability distribution function
(PDF) are analyzed by saddle-point approximation in the path integral
describing the velocity statistics. The structure of the saddle-point
(instanton), that is velocity field configuration realizing the maximum of
probability, is studied numerically in details. The numerical results allow us
to find analytical solution for the long-time part of the instanton. Its
careful analysis confirms the result of [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78 (8) 1452 (1997)
[chao-dyn/9609005]] based on short-time estimations that the left tail of PDF
has the form ln P(u_x) \propto -|u_x|^(3/2).
