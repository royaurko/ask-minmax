A method of obtaining approximate redshifts and spectral types of galaxies
using a photometric system of six broad-bandpass filters is developed. The
technique utilizes a smallest maximum difference approach rather than a
least-squares approach, and does not consider a galaxy's apparent magnitude in
the determination of its redshift. In an evalution of its accuracy using two
distinct galaxy samples, the photometric redshifts are found to have a root
mean square deviation of $\pm$0.05 from spectroscopically determined redshifts.
Possible systematic errors of the method are investigated, including the
effects of post-starburst (``E+A'') galaxies and attempts to measure redshifts
with incomplete color information. Applications of the technique are discussed.
