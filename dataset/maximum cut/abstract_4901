We present a comprehensive phenomenological study of heavy flavor
distributions and correlations in longitudinally polarized proton-proton
collisions at BNL-RHIC. All results are obtained with a flexible parton-level
Monte Carlo program at next-to-leading order accuracy and include the
fragmentation into heavy mesons, their subsequent semi-leptonic decays, and
experimental cuts. Next-to-leading order QCD corrections are found to be
significant for both cross sections and double-spin asymmetries. The
sensitivity of heavy flavor measurements at BNL-RHIC to the gluon polarization
of the nucleon is assessed. Electron-muon and muon-muon correlations turn out
to be the most promising observables. Theoretical uncertainties are estimated
by varying renormalization and factorization scales, heavy quark masses, and
fragmentation parameters.
