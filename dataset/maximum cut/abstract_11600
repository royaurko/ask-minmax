As a basis for the interpretation of data gathered by LOPES and other
experiments, we have carried out Monte Carlo simulations of geosynchrotron
radio emission from cosmic ray air showers. The simulations, having been
verified carefully with analytical calculations, reveal a wealth of information
on the characteristics of the radio signal and their dependence on specific air
shower parameters. In this article, we review the spatial characteristics of
the radio emission, its predicted frequency spectrum and its dependence on
important air shower parameters such as the shower zenith angle, the primary
particle energy and the depth of the shower maximum, which can in turn be
related to the nature of the primary particle.
