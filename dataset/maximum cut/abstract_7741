We examine the capability of the CERN Large Hadron Collider to discovery
supersymmetry (SUSY) with energy \sqrt{s}=7 TeV and integrated luminosity of
about 1 fb^{-1}. Our results are presented within the paradigm minimal
supergravity model (mSUGRA or CMSSM). Using a 6-dimensional grid of cuts for
optimization of signal to background-- including missing E_T-- we find for
m_{\tg}\sim m_{\tq} an LHC reach of m_{\tg}\sim 800,\ 950,\ 1100 and 1200 GeV
for 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 2 fb^{-1}, respectively. For m_{\tg}<< m_{\tq}, the reach
is instead near m_{\tg}\sim 480,\ 540,\ 620 and 700 GeV, for the same
integrated luminosities. We also examine the LHC reach in the case of very low
integrated luminosity where missing E_T may not be viable. We focus on the
multi-muon, multi-lepton (including electrons) and dijet signals. Although the
LHC reach without E_T^{miss} is considerably lower in these cases, it is still
substantial: for 0.3 fb^{-1}, the dijet reach in terms of gluino mass is up to
600 GeV for very low m_0, while the dilepton reach is to gluino masses of \sim
500 GeV over a range of m_0 values.
