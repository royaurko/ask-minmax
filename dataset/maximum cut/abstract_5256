We characterise the one-loop amplitudes for N=6 and N=4 supergravity in four
dimensions. For N=6 we find that the one-loop n-point amplitudes can be
expanded in terms of scalar box and triangle functions only. This
simplification is consistent with a loop momentum power count of n-3, which we
would interpret as being n+4 for gravity with a further -7 from the N=6
superalgebra. For N=4 we find that the amplitude is consistent with a loop
momentum power count of n, which we would interpret as being n+4 for gravity
with a further -4 from the N=4 superalgebra. Specifically the N=4 amplitudes
contain non-cut-constructible rational terms.
