It is well-known that the size of propositional classical proofs can be huge.
Proof theoretical studies discovered exponential gaps between normal or cut
free proofs and their respective non-normal proofs. The aim of this work is to
study how to reduce the weight of propositional deductions. We present the
formalism of proof-graphs for purely implicational logic, which are graphs of a
specific shape that are intended to capture the logical structure of a
deduction. The advantage of this formalism is that formulas can be shared in
the reduced proof.
  In the present paper we give a precise definition of proof-graphs for the
minimal implicational logic, together with a normalization procedure for these
proof-graphs. In contrast to standard tree-like formalisms, our normalization
does not increase the number of nodes, when applied to the corresponding
minimal proof-graph representations.
