Photon energy moments in B -> X_s+\gamma and the impact of experimental cuts
are analyzed, including the biases exponential in the effective hardness missed
in the conventional OPE. We incorporate the perturbative corrections fully
implementing the Wilsonian momentum separation ab initio. This renders
perturbative effects numerically suppressed while leaving heavy quark
parameters and the corresponding light-cone distribution function well defined
and preserving their physical properties. The moments of the distribution
function are given by the heavy quark expectation values of which many have
been extracted from the B -> X_c l\nu decays. The quantitative estimates for
the biases in the heavy quark parameters determined from the photon moments
show they cannot be neglected for E_cut \gsim 1.85GeV, and grow out of theory
control for E_cut above 2.1GeV. Implications for the moments in the B -> X_c
l\nu decays at high cuts are briefly addressed.
