We investigate the Gaussianity of the 4-year COBE-DMR data (in HEALPix
pixelisation) using an analysis based on spherical Haar wavelets. We use all
the pixels lying outside the Galactic cut and compute the skewness, kurtosis
and scale-scale correlation spectra for the wavelet coefficients at each scale.
We also take into account the sensitivity of the method to the orientation of
the input signal. We find a detection of non-Gaussianity at $> 99$ per cent
level in just one of our statistics. Taking into account the total number of
statistics computed, we estimate that the probability of obtaining such a
detection by chance for an underlying Gaussian field is 0.69. Therefore, we
conclude that the spherical wavelet technique shows no strong evidence of
non-Gaussianity in the COBE-DMR data.
