We compare optical and high quality x-ray data for three bright ellipticals
in the Virgo cluster, NGC 4472, 4649, and 4636. The distribution of total mass
in NGC 4472 and 4649 determined from x-ray data is sensitive to the stellar
mass over a considerable range in galactic radius extending to r = r_e, the
effective radius. The agreement of x-ray and optically-determined stellar
masses provides a unique verification of the stellar mass to light ratio which
is essentially constant over 0.1 < r/r_e < 1. However, dark matter in NGC 4636
is important at all radii > 0.35r_e. Evidently the dark to stellar mass ratio
varies in quite different ways in ellipticals of comparable optical luminosity,
implying the radial structure of dark halos may not be universal. There is some
evidence in NGC 4636 for additional support of the hot interstellar gas at r <
0.35 r_e; either a field B = 10^{-4} G or a small (but mechanically unstable)
central region of high gas temperature (T = 10^7 K) is required. The global
temperature structure in the hot interstellar medium of many recently observed
ellipticals is very similar, reaching a maximum near 3 - 4 r_e. This feature,
which may suggest a new structural scale, is inconsistent with current
theoretical gas dynamical models.
