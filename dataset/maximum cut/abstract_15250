Majority of the computer or mobile phone enthusiasts make use of the web for
searching activity. Web search engines are used for the searching; The results
that the search engines get are provided to it by a software module known as
the Web Crawler. The size of this web is increasing round-the-clock. The
principal problem is to search this huge database for specific information. To
state whether a web page is relevant to a search topic is a dilemma. This paper
proposes a crawler called as PDD crawler which will follow both a link based as
well as a content based approach. This crawler follows a completely new
crawling strategy to compute the relevance of the page. It analyses the content
of the page based on the information contained in various tags within the HTML
source code and then computes the total weight of the page. The page with the
highest weight, thus has the maximum content and highest relevance.
