We present a morphological analysis of distant field galaxies using the deep
ACS images from the public parallel NICMOS observations of the Hubble Ultra
Deep Field obtained in the F435W (B), F606W (V), F775W (i) and F850LP (z)
filters. We morphologically segregate galaxies using a combination of visual
classification and objective machine based selection. We use the Asymmetry (A)
and Central Concentration (C) parameters to characterize galaxies up to
z_AB<25mag. We take advantage of the multicolor dataset and estimate redshifts
for our sample using the Bayesian photometric redshift (BPZ) which enables us
to investigate the evolution of their morphological demographics with redshift.
Using a template fitting model and a maximum likelihood approach, we compute
the star-formation rate (SFR) for galaxies up to z~1.3 and its contributions
from different morphological types. We report that spirals are the main
providers to the total SFR. The E/S0s contribution flattens out at z~1 while
the Irr/Pec populations continuously rise to match the spirals contribution at
z~1.0. We use the i-z and V-i color-magnitude diagrams to constrain the
galaxies' formation histories and find that E/S0s show both a population of
luminous red galaxies in place at z~1.2 and a bluer and fainter population
resembling those of Irr/Pec at similar redshifts.
