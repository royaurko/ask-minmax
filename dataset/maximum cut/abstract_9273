We simulated the response of a 4p calorimetric g-detector array to decays of
radioactive isotopes on the s-process path. The GEANT 3.21 simulation package
was used. The main table contains estimates on the maximum sample size and
required neutron flux based on the latest available neutron capture cross
section at 30 keV. The results are intended to be used to estimate the
feasibility of neutron capture measurements with 4p arrays using the time of
flight technique.
