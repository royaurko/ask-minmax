Here we report the properties of field-effect transistors based on few layers
of chemical vapor transport grown alpha- MoTe_2 crystals mechanically
exfoliated onto SiO_2. We performed field-effect and Hall mobility
measurements, as well as Raman scattering and transmission electron microscopy.
In contrast to both MoS_2 and MoSe_2, our MoTe_2 field-effect transistors
(FETs) are observed to be hole-doped, displaying on/off ratios surpassing 106
and typical sub-threshold swings of ~ 140 mV per decade. Both field-effect and
Hall mobilities indicate maximum values approaching or surpassing 10 cm^2/Vs
which are comparable to figures previously reported for single or bi-layered
MoS_2 and/or for MoSe_2 exfoliated onto SiO_2 at room temperature and without
the use of dielectric engineering. Raman scattering reveals sharp modes in
agreement with previous reports, whose frequencies are found to display little
or no dependence on the number of layers. Given that both MoS_2 is electron
doped, the stacking of MoTe_2 onto MoS_2 could produce ambipolar field-effect
transistors and a gap modulation. Although the overall electronic performance
of MoTe_2 is comparable to those of MoS_2 and MoSe_2, the heavier element Te
should lead to a stronger spin orbit-coupling and possibly to concomitantly
longer decoherence times for exciton valley and spin indexes.
