A thermodynamic-like formalism is developed for superstatistical systems
based on conditional entropies. This theory takes into account large-scale
variations of intensive variables of systems in nonequilibrium stationary
states. Ordinary thermodynamics is recovered as a special case of the present
theory, and corrections to it can be systematically evaluated. A generalization
of Einstein's relation for fluctuations is presented using a maximum entropy
condition.
