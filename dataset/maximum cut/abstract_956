We develop 3rd order maximum-principle-satisfying direct discontinuous
Galerkin methods [8, 9, 19, 21] for convection diffusion equations on
unstructured triangular mesh. We carefully calculate the normal derivative
numerical flux across element edges and prove that, with proper choice of
parameter pair $(\beta_0,\beta_1)$ in the numerical flux, the quadratic
polynomial solution satisfies strict maximum principle. The polynomial solution
is bounded within the given range and third order accuracy is maintained. There
is no geometric restriction on the meshes and obtuse triangles are allowed in
the partition. A sequence of numerical examples are carried out to demonstrate
the accuracy and capability of the maximum-principle-satisfying limiter.
