MOND predicts a number of laws that galactic systems should obey irrespective
of their complicated, haphazard, and mostly unknowable histories -- as Kepler's
laws are obeyed by planetary systems. The main purpose of this work is to show
how, and to what extent, these MOND laws follow from only the paradigm's basic
tenets: departure from standard dynamics at accelerations a<~a0, and space-time
scale invariance in the limit a<<a0. Such predictions will be shared by all
MOND theories that embody these premises. This is important because we do not
know which of the existing MOND theories, if any, is a step in the right
direction. In the Newtonian-dynamics-plus-dark-matter paradigm, the validity of
such clear-cut laws -- which tightly constrain baryons, `dark matter', and
their mutual relations -- is contrary to expectations.
