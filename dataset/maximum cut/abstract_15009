Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points and $Q$ a convex $k$-gon in ${\mathbb R}^2$.
We analyze in detail the topological (or discrete) changes in the structure of
the Voronoi diagram and the Delaunay triangulation of $P$, under the convex
distance function defined by $Q$, as the points of $P$ move along prespecified
continuous trajectories. Assuming that each point of $P$ moves along an
algebraic trajectory of bounded degree, we establish an upper bound of
$O(k^4n\lambda_r(n))$ on the number of topological changes experienced by the
diagrams throughout the motion; here $\lambda_r(n)$ is the maximum length of an
$(n,r)$-Davenport-Schinzel sequence, and $r$ is a constant depending on the
algebraic degree of the motion of the points. Finally, we describe an algorithm
for efficiently maintaining the above structures, using the kinetic data
structure (KDS) framework.
