We perform hydrodynamical simulations of neutron-star mergers for a large
sample of temperature-dependent, nuclear equations of state, and determine the
threshold mass above which the merger remnant promptly collapses to form a
black hole. We find that, depending on the equation of state, the threshold
mass is larger than the maximum mass of a non-rotating star in isolation by
between 30 and 70 per cent. Our simulations also show that the ratio between
the threshold mass and maximum mass is tightly correlated with the compactness
of the non-rotating maximum-mass configuration. We speculate on how this
relation can be used to derive constraints on neutron-star properties from
future observations.
