We consider the newly found high mass and low magnetic field binary pulsar
PSR J1614-2230 in a model in which magnetars owe their strong magnetic fields
to a high baryon density, magnetized core. In our magnetar model all neutron
stars above a certain threhold mass are magnetars. This confronts us with the
very basic paradox as to why this high mass star, PSR J1614-2230, remains a
pulsar and shows no magnetar characteristics. This is a star that has acquired
its large mass by accretion from its binary companion over 5 gigayears.
  In this work we show that the maximum rate of energy gain from the strong
interaction phase transition from this slow accretion does not allow for high
enough interior temperature for ambipolar transport of the magnetic field to
the surface of the star and thus the PSR J 1614-2230 remains latent and does
not become an emergent magnetar.
