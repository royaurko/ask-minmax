We have monitored the R and I magnitudes of the black hole candidate system
A0620-00 (V616 Mon) in the years 1991-95 at the Wise Observatory. Combining our
data with some additional measurements, we analyze a sparsely covered 7 years
light curve of the star. We find that the average R-band magnitude is varying
on a time scale of a few hundreds days, with a peak to peak amplitude of 0.3
mag. The two maxima in the well known double hump binary cycle, as well as one
of the minima between them, vary by a few percent relative to one another in a
seemingly random way. One maximum is on the average higher than the other by
0.05 mag. The depth of the second minimum is varying with significantly higher
amplitude, in clear correlation with the long term variability of the mean
magnitude of the system. It is shallower than the other minimum at times of
maximum light, and it becomes deeper at times of minimum system light.
According to the commonly acceptable phasing of the binary cycle, the
systematically varying minimum corresponds to inferior conjunction of the red
dwarf in the system. We cannot suggest any simple geometrical model for
explaining the regularities that we find in the long term photometric behaviour
of the star.
