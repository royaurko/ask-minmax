We study local and global stability of nonhyperbolic chaotic attractors
contaminated by noise. The former is given by the maximum distance of a noisy
trajectory from the noisefree attractor, while the latter is provided by the
minimal escape energy necessary to leave the basin of attraction, calculated
with the Hamiltonian theory of large fluctuations. We establish the important
and counterintuitive result that both concepts may be opposed to each other.
Even when one attractor is globally more stable than another one, it can be
locally less stable. Our results are exemplified with the Holmes map, for two
different sets of parameter, and with a juxtaposition of the Holmes and the
Ikeda maps. Finally, the experimental relevance of these findings is pointed
out.
