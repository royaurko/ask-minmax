We have measured the fusion cross sections of the 12C(13C, p)24Na reaction
through off-line measurement of the beta-decay of 24Na using the beta-gamma
coincidence method. Our new measurements in the energy range of Ec.m. = 2.6-3.0
MeV do not show an obvious S-factor maximum but a plateau. Comparison between
this work and various models is presented.
