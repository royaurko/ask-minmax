Integrable cut-off constraints for semidiscrete Toda lattice are studied in
this paper. Lax presentation for semidiscrete analog of the $C$-series Toda
lattice is obtained. Nonlocal variables that allow to express symmetries of the
infinite semidiscrete lattice are introduced and cut-off constraints or a
certain type compatible with symmetries of the infinite lattice are classified.
