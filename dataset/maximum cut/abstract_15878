At this moment, the use of SNIa for cosmology lies on the assumption that the
SNe at high redshifts are equal to the local ones. However, some observations
indicate a correlation between the light curve (LC) properties and the
morphological type of the host galaxy. This could indicate a dependence with
the age (mass/composition) of the underlying population. In this work we have
chosen the delayed detonation explosion model in CO Chandrasekhar mass WDs to
explore the dependence of the SNIa LC and nucleosynthesis with the initial mass
and composition of the WD progenitor. The progenitor influences the final SNIa
via the mass of the CO core formed and the C/O ratio within it (1D explosion
models). We have followed the evolution of stars with masses between 1.5 and 8
Mo and metallicity, Z=0, 1.E-05, 0.001 and 0.02, from the pre-main sequence to
the TP-AGB phase. The differences obtained in the final C/O ratio within the
explosive WD are smaller than 22%. This results in a difference at maximum of
0.03 mag and of 0.1 mag when the brightness-decline relation is applied.
