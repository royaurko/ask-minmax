In this study we present the study of solar active regions based on BOAO
vector magnetograms and $H\alpha$ filtergrams. With the new calibration method
we analyzed BOAO vector magnetograms taken from the SOFT observational system
to compare with those of other observing systems. In this study it has been
demonstrated that (1) our longitudinal magnetogram matches very well the
corresponding Mitaka's magnetogram to the extent that the maximum correlation
yields r=0.962 between our re-scaled longitudinal magnetogram and the Mitaka's
magnetogram; (2) according to a comparison of our magnetograms of AR 8422 with
those taken at Mitaka solar observatory their longitudinal fields are very
similar to each other while transverse fields are a little different possibly
due to large noise level; (3) main features seen by our longitudinal
magnetograms of AR 8422 and AR 8419 and the corresponding Kitt Peak
magnetograms are very similar to each other; (4) time series of our vector
magnetograms and H-alpha observations of AR 8419 during its flaring (M3.1/1B)
activity show that the filament eruption followed the sheared inversion line of
the quadrupolar configuration of sunspots, indicating that the flare should be
associated with the quadrupolar field configuration and its interaction with
new filament eruption. Finally, it may be concluded that the Solar Flare
Telescope at BOAO works normally and it is ready to do numerous observational
and theoretical works associated with solar activities such as flares.
