We consider a two-parameter family of cylindrical force-free equilibria,
modeled to match numerical simulations of relativistic force-free jets. We
study the linear stability of these equilibria, assuming a rigid impenetrable
wall at the outer cylindrical radius R_j. We find that equilibria in which the
Lorentz factor \gamma(R) increases monotonically with increasing radius R are
stable. On the other hand, equilibria in which \gamma(R) reaches a maximum
value at an intermediate radius and then declines to a smaller value \gamma_j
at R_j are unstable. The most rapidly growing mode is an m=1 kink instability
which has a growth rate ~ (0.4 / \gamma_j) (c/R_j). The e-folding length of the
equivalent convected instability is ~2.5 \gamma_j R_j. For a typical jet with
an opening angle \theta_j ~ few / \gamma_j, the mode amplitude grows weakly
with increasing distance from the base of the jet, much slower than one might
expect from a naive application of the Kruskal-Shafranov stability criterion.
