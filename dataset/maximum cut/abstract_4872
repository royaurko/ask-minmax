While strong attenuation of single particle production and particle
correlations has provided convincing evidence for large parton energy loss in
the QGP, its application to jet tomography has inherent limitations due to the
inclusive nature of the measurements. Generalization of this suppression to
full jet observables leads to an unbiased, more differential and thus powerful
approach to determining the characteristics of the hot QCD medium created in
high-energy nuclear collisions. In this article we report on recent theoretical
progress in calculating jet shapes and the related jet cross sections in the
presence of QGP-induced parton energy loss. (i) A theoretical model of
intra-jet energy flow in heavy-ion collisions is discussed. (ii) Realistic
numerical simulations demonstrate the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}(p_T)$
evolves continuously with the jet cone size $R^{\max}$ or the acceptance cut
$\omega_{\min}$ - a novel feature of jet quenching. The anticipated broadening
of jets is subtle and most readily manifested in the periphery of the cone for
smaller cone radii.
