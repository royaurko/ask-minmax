We propose several improvements for Linear Programming (LP) decoding
algorithms for High Density Parity Check (HDPC) codes. First, we use the
automorphism groups of a code to create parity check matrix diversity and to
generate valid cuts from redundant parity checks. Second, we propose an
efficient mixed integer decoder utilizing the branch and bound method. We
further enhance the proposed decoders by removing inactive constraints and by
adapting the parity check matrix prior to decoding according to the channel
observations. Based on simulation results the proposed decoders achieve near-ML
performance with reasonable complexity.
