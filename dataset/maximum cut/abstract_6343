We have used the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space
Telescope to obtain deep photometry of the NGC 300 spiral galaxy in the
Sculptor group. The results have been used to derive an accurate distance
determination based on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch distance estimator. Both
edge-detection and maximum likelihood methods have been applied, to derive a
distance modulus (m-M)_0=26.30 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.12 for edge-detection, and
(m-M)_0=26.36 +/- 0.02 +/- 0.12 for maximum likelihood. These results are fully
consistent with the recent distance estimate derived from near-IR photometry of
Cepheids variable stars in the context of the Araucaria project, (m-M)_0= 26.37
+/- 0.05 +/- 0.03.
