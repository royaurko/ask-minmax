The Feynman-Metropolis-Teller treatment for compressed atoms is here
reconsidered in the framework of the relativistic generalised Fermi-Thomas
model, obtained by Ruffini et al. Physical properties of a zero temperature
plasma is thus investigated and the resulting equation of state, which keeps
into account quantum, relativistic and electromagnetic effects, is applied to
the study of equilibrium configurations of relativistic White Dwarfs.
  It is shown that numerical evaluation of such configuration leads, for the
same central density $\rho_c$, to smaller values of radius R and of mass M than
in the classical works of Chandrasekhar and Salpeter, the deviations being most
marked at the lowest densities (up to 30% from the
  Chandrasekhar model and 10% from the Salpeter one for $\rho_c \sim
10^6g/cm^3$, corresponding to $M \sim 0.2 M_{\odot}$).
  At high densities we considered the occurrence of inverse beta decays, whose
effect is to introduce gravitational instability of the configurations. We
consequently find the maximum mass of White Dwarfs, which, for an Oxygen and an
Iron WD, is respectively $1.365 M_{\odot}$ and $1.063 M_{\odot}$.
