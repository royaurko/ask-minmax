A theoretical approach using ab initio calculations has been applied to study
the interaction of an ultra-short laser pulse with the metal alloy
Fe$_{0.72}$Cr$_{0.18}$Ni$_{0.1}$ (AISI 304). The electronic structure is
simulated by taking into account the chemical and magnetic disorder of the
alloy by the coherent potential approximation implemented in a fully
relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker-formalism in the framework of spin density
functional theory. Utilizing these predictions we determined the electron heat
capacity and the electron-phonon coupling factor of
Fe$_{0.72}$Cr$_{0.18}$Ni$_{0.1}$ in dependence on the electron temperature for
two-temperature model applications. Compared with pure Fe a maximum deviation
of 5~\% for the electron heat capacity and 25~\% for the electron-phonon
coupling factor is found.
