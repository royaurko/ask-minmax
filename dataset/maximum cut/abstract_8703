With new data available from the SPS, at 40 and 80 GeV/A, I review the
systematics of bulk hadron multiplicities, with prime focus on strangeness
production. The classical concept of strangeness enhancement in central AA
collisions is reviewed, in view of the statistical hadronization model which
suggests to understand strangeness enhancement to arise chiefly in the
transition from the canonical to the grand canonical version of that model. I.
e. enhancement results from the fading away of canonical suppression. The model
also captures the striking strangeness maximum observed in the vicinity of
$\sqrt{s} \approx $ 8 GeV. A puzzle remains in the understanding of apparent
grand canonical order at the lower SPS, and at AGS energies.
