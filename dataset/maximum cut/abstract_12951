We experimentally and theoretically investigate the second order nonlinear
optical response of metallo-dielectric multilayer structures composed of Ag and
Ta2O5 layers, deposited by magnetron sputtering. Second harmonic generation
measurements were performed in reflection mode as a function of incidence
angle, using femtosecond pulses originating from a Ti:Sapphire laser system
tuned at 800 nm. The dependence of the generated signal was investigated as a
function of pump intensity and polarization state. Our experimental results
show that the conversion efficiency from a periodic metallo-dielectric sample
may be enhanced by at least a factor of 30 with respect to the conversion
efficiency from a single metal layer, thanks in part to the increased number of
active surfaces, pump field localization and penetration inside the metal
layers. The conversion efficiency maximum shifts from 70 degrees for the single
silver layer down to approximately 55 degrees for the stack. The experimental
results are found to be in good agreement with calculations based on coupled
Maxwell-Drude oscillators under the action of a nonlinear Lorentz force term.
