In this paper, we prove a variant of the Burger-Brooks transfer principle
which, combined with recent eigenvalue bounds for surfaces, allows to obtain
upper bounds on the eigenvalues of graphs as a function of their genus. More
precisely, we show the existence of a universal constants $C$ such that the
$k$-th eigenvalue $\lambda_k^{nr}$ of the normalized Laplacian of a graph $G$
of (geometric) genus $g$ on $n$ vertices satisfies $$\lambda_k^{nr} \leq C
\frac{d_{\max}(g+k)}{n},$$ where $d_{\max}$ denotes the maximum valence of
vertices of the graph. This result is tight up to a change in the value of the
constant $C$.
  We also use our transfer theorem to relate eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a
metric graph $\Gamma$ to the eigenvalues of simple graph models of $\Gamma$,
and discuss an application to the mesh partitioning problem.
