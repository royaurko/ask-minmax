A vorticity surge event that could be a paradigm for a wide class of bursting
events in turbulence is studied to examine how the energy cascade is
established and how this event could serve as a new test of LES turbulence
models. This vorticity surge event is tied to the formation of the energy
cascade in a direct numerical simulation by the traditional signatures of a
turbulent energy cascade such as spectra approaching -5/3 and strongly
Beltramized vortex tubes. A coherent mechanism is suggested by the nearly
simultaneous development of a maximum of the peak vorticity
$\|\omega\|_\infty$, growth of the dissipation, the appearance of a helically
aligned local vortex configuration and strong, transient oscillations in the
helicity wavenumber spectrum. This coherence is also examined for two LES
models, a traditional purely dissipative eddy viscosity model and a modern
method (LANS$-\alpha$) that respects the nonlinear transport properties of
fluids. Both LES models properly represent the spectral energy and energy
dissipation associated with this vorticity surge event. However, only the model
that preserves nonlinear fluid transport properties reproduces the helical
properties, including Beltrami-like vortex tubes.
