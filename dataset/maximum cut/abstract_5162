We revisit the potential of a Linear Collider concerning the study of lepton
flavour violation, in view of new LHC bounds and of the (very) recent
developments in lepton physics. Working in the framework of a type I
supersymmetric seesaw, we evaluate the prospects of observing seesaw-induced
lepton flavour violating final states of the type e \mu + missing energy,
arising from e+ e- and e- e- collisions. In both cases we address the potential
background from standard model and supersymmetric charged currents. We also
explore the possibility of electron and positron beam polarisation. The
statistical significance of the signal, even in the absence of kinematical
and/or detector cuts, renders the observation of such flavour violating events
feasible over large regions of the parameter space. We further consider the
\mu-\mu- + E^T_miss final state in the e- e- beam option finding that, due to a
very suppressed background, this process turns out to be a truly clear probe of
a supersymmetric seesaw, assuming the latter to be the unique source of lepton
flavour violation.
