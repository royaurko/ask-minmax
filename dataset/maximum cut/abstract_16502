We present and derive a technique for the introduction of defects into a beam
model based on the Cosserat theory of rods. The technique is designed for the
derivation of component models of non-ideal rods for use in MEMS devices. We
also present a worked through example of blob/nick defects (where the rod has
an area with an excess/lack of material) and a guide for a model with random
pits and blobs along the length of the beam. Finally we present a component
level model of a beam with a defect and compare it to results from a Finite
Element Analysis simulation. We test the Cosserat model for two cases without
any defect and four with a defect. Results are in good agreement with a maximum
0.5% difference for the ideal case and under 1% differences for all but one of
the defective cases, the exception being a 2% error in an extreme case for
which the model is expected to break down. Overall, the Cosserat model with and
without defects provides an accurate way of modelling long slender beams. In
addition, simulation times are greatly reduced through this approach and
further development for both component level models as well as as FEA
components is important for practical yet accurate modelling of MEMS both for
prediction and comparison.
