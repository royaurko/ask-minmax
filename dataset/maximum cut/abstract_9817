We propose a new methodology based on the Marshall-Olkin (MO) copula to model
cross-border systemic risk. The proposed framework estimates the impact of the
systematic and idiosyncratic components on systemic risk. Initially, we propose
a maximum-likelihood method to estimate the parameter of the MO copula. In
order to use the data on non-distressed banks for these estimates, we consider
times to bank failures as censored samples. Hence, we propose an estimation
procedure for the MO copula on censored data. The empirical evidence from
European banks shows that the proposed censored model avoid possible
underestimation of the contagion risk.
