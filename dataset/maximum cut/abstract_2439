The today estimated value of dark energy can be achieved by the vacuum
condensate induced by neutrino mixing phenomenon. Such a tiny value is
recovered for a cut-off of the order of Planck scale and it is linked to the
sub eV neutrino mass scale. Contributions to dark energy from auxiliary fields
or mechanisms are not necessary in this approach.
