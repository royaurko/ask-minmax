Shortly after its birth in a gravitational collapse, a proto-neutron star
enters in a phase of quasi-stationary evolution characterized by large
gradients of the thermodynamical variables and intense neutrino emission. In
few tens of seconds the gradients smooth out while the star contracts and cools
down, until it becomes a neutron star. In this paper we study this phase of the
proto-neutron star life including rotation, and employing finite temperature
equations of state. We model the evolution of the rotation rate, and determine
the relevant quantities characterizing the star. Our results show that an
isolated neutron star cannot reach, at the end of the evolution, the maximum
values of mass and rotation rate allowed by the zero-temperature equation of
state. Moreover, a mature neutron star evolved in isolation cannot rotate too
rapidly, even if it is born from a proto-neutron star rotating at the
mass-shedding limit. We also show that the I-Love-Q relations are violated in
the first second of life, but they are satisfied as soon as the entropy
gradients smooth out.
