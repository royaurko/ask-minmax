We have carried out a survey of the Andromeda galaxy for unresolved
microlensing (pixel lensing). We present a subset of four short timescale, high
signal-to-noise microlensing candidates found by imposing severe selection
criteria: the source flux variation exceeds the flux of an R=21 magnitude star
and the full width at half maximum timescale is less than 25 days. Remarkably,
in three out of four cases, we have been able to measure or strongly constrain
the Einstein crossing time of the event. One event, which lies projected on the
M31 bulge, is almost certainly due to a stellar lens in the bulge of M31. The
other three candidates can be explained either by stars in M31 and M32 or by
MACHOs.
