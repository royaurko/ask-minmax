A $(2,1)$-total labeling of a graph $G$ is an assignment $f$ from the vertex
set $V(G)$ and the edge set $E(G)$ to the set $\{0,1,...,k\}$ of nonnegative
integers such that $|f(x)-f(y)|\ge 2$ if $x$ is a vertex and $y$ is an edge
incident to $x$, and $|f(x)-f(y)|\ge 1$ if $x$ and $y$ are a pair of adjacent
vertices or a pair of adjacent edges, for all $x$ and $y$ in $V(G)\cup E(G)$.
The $(2,1)$-total labeling number $\lambda^T_2(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined as
the minimum $k$ among all possible assignments. In [D. Chen and W. Wang.
(2,1)-Total labelling of outerplanar graphs. Discr. Appl. Math. 155, 2585--2593
(2007)], Chen and Wang conjectured that all outerplanar graphs $G$ satisfy
  $\lambda^T_2(G) \leq \Delta(G)+2$, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of
$G$, while they also showed that it is true for $G$ with $\Delta(G)\geq 5$. In
this paper, we solve their conjecture completely, by proving that
  $\lambda^T_2(G) \leq \Delta(G)+2$ even in the case of $\Delta(G)\leq 4 $.
