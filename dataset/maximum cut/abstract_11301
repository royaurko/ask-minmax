Deconvolving COMPTEL gamma-ray data into images presents a major
methodological challenge. We developed a new algorithm called Multiresolution
Regularized Expectation Maximization (MREM), which explicitly accounts for
spatial correlations in the image by using wavelets (Dixon et al. 1998). We
demonstrate that MREM largely suppresses image noise in the reconstruction,
showing only significant structures that are present in the data. Application
to 1.8 MeV data results in a sky map that is much smoother than the maximum
entropy reconstructions presented previously, but it shows the same
characteristic emission features which have been established earlier.
