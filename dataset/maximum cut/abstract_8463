We have recently proposed the s+g wave model for superconducting
borocarbides. In spite of a substantial s-wave component, this order parameter
exhibits the H^1/2 dependent specific heat and a thermal conductivity linear in
H in the vortex state. This is characteristic for nodal superconductors when T,
\Gamma << \Delta where \Gamma is the quasiparticle scattering rate and \Delta
the maximum superconducting gap. Here we investigate the thermal conductivity
parallel to the c- and a- axis in a magnetic field tilted by \theta from the c-
axis and rotating within the a-b plane.
