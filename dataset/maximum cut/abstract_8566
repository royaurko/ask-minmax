We analyze non-local effects in electron transport across three-terminal
normal-superconducting-normal (NSN) structures. Subgap electrons entering
S-electrode from one N-metal may form Cooper pairs with their counterparts
penetrating from another N-metal. This phenomenon of crossed Andreev reflection
-- combined with normal scattering at SN interfaces -- yields two different
contributions to non-local conductance which we evaluate non-perturbatively at
arbitrary interface transmissions. Both these contributions reach their maximum
values at fully transmitting interfaces and demonstrate interesting features
which can be tested in future experiments.
