A series of superlattices composed of ferromagnetic
La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LCMO) and ferroelectric/paraelectric
Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3$ (0$\leq $x$\leq $1) were deposited on SrTiO$_3$
substrates using the pulsed laser deposition. Films of epitaxial nature
comprised of spherical mounds having uniform size are obtained.
Magnetotransport properties of the films reveal a ferromagnetic Curie
temperature in the range of 145-158 K and negative magnetoresistance as high as
30%, depending on the type of ferroelectric layers employed for their growth
(\QTR{it}{i.e.} '\QTR{it}{x'} value). Ferroelectricity at temperatures ranging
from 55 K to 105 K is also observed, depending on the barium content. More
importantly, the multiferroic nature of the film is determined by the
appearance of negative magnetocapacitance, which was found to be maximum around
the ferroelectric transition temperature (3% per \QTR{it}{tesla}). These
results are understood based on the role of the ferroelectric/paraelectric
layers and strains in inducing the multiferroism.
