The photon structure function F2gamma has been measured with data taken by
the ALEPH collaboration at LEP centre-of-mass energies sqrt s = 91 GeV with <
Q^2 > of 9.9, 20.7 and 284 GeV^2 and sqrt s = 183 GeV with < Q^2 > of 13.7 and
56.5 GeV^2. For the data at sqrt s = 183 GeV a two-dimensional unfolding method
employing the principle of maximum entropy is used, which reduces the errors
compared to one-dimensional methods.
