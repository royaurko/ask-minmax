Our first principles calculations reveal that oxidative cut of graphene is
realized by forming epoxy and then carbonyl pairs. Direct forming carbonyl pair
to tear graphene up from an edge position is not favorable in energy. This
atomic picture is valuable for developing effective graphene manipulation
means. The proposed epoxy pairs may be related to some long puzzling
experimental observations on graphene oxide.
