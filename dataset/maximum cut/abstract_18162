We use ACE/SWICS elemental composition data to compare the variations in
solar wind fractionation as measured by SWICS during the last solar maximum
(1999-2001), the solar minimum (2006-2009) and the period in which the Genesis
spacecraft was collecting solar wind (late 2001 - early 2004). We differentiate
our analysis in terms of solar wind regimes (i.e. originating from interstream
or coronal hole flows, or coronal mass ejecta). Abundances are normalized to
the low-FIP ion magnesium to uncover correlations that are not apparent when
normalizing to high-FIP ions. We find that relative to magnesium, the other
low-FIP elements are measurably fractionated, but the degree of fractionation
does not vary significantly over the solar cycle. For the high-FIP ions,
variation in fractionation over the solar cycle is significant: greatest for
Ne/Mg and C/Mg, less so for O/Mg, and the least for He/Mg. When abundance
ratios are examined as a function of solar wind speed, we find a strong
correlation, with the remarkable observation that the degree of fractionation
follows a mass-dependent trend. We discuss the implications for correcting the
Genesis sample return results to photospheric abundances.
