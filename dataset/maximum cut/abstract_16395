We studied the transition between the antiferromagnetic and the surface
spin-flop phases of a uniaxial antiferromagnetic [Fe(14 \AA)/Cr(11 \AA]$_{\rm
x20}$ superlattice. For external fields applied parallel to the in-plane easy
axis, the layer-by-layer configuration, calculated in the framework of a
mean-field one-dimensional model, was benchmarked against published polarized
neutron reflectivity data. For an in-plane field $H$ applied at an angle $\psi
\ne 0$ with the easy axis, magnetometry shows that the magnetization $M$
vanishes at H=0, then increases slowly with increasing $H$. At a critical value
of $H$, a finite jump in $M(H)$ is observed for $\psi<5^{\rm o}$, while a
smooth increase of $M$ $vs$ $H$ is found for $\psi>5^{\rm o}$. A dramatic
increase in the full width at half maximum of the magnetic susceptibility is
observed for $\psi \ge 5^{\rm o}$. The phase diagram obtained from
micromagnetic calculations displays a first-order transition to a surface
spin-flop phase for low $\psi$ values, while the transition becomes continuous
for $\psi$ greater than a critical angle, $\psi_{\rm max} \approx 4.75^{\rm
o}$. This is in fair agreement with the experimentally observed results.
