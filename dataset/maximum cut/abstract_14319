We study three dimensional oceanic Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) in
the Benguela region, as obtained from an output of the ROMS model. To do that
we first compute Finite-Size Lyapunov exponent (FSLE) fields in the region
volume, characterizing mesoscale stirring and mixing. Average FSLE values show
a general decreasing trend with depth, but there is a local maximum at about
100 m depth. LCSs are extracted as ridges of the calculated FSLE fields. They
present a "curtain-like" geometry in which the strongest attracting and
repelling structures appear as quasivertical surfaces. LCSs around a particular
cyclonic eddy, pinched off from the upwelling front are also calculated. The
LCSs are confirmed to provide pathways and barriers to transport in and out of
the eddy.
