We study the carrier-mediated exchange interaction, the so-called RKKY
coupling, between two magnetic moments in graphene using exact diagonalization
on the honeycomb lattice. By using the tight-binding nearest neighbor band
structure of graphene we avoid the use of a momentum cut-off which plagues
results in the Dirac continuum model formulation. We extract both the short and
long impurity-impurity distance behavior and show several corrections to
earlier long distance results. In the bulk the RKKY coupling is proportional to
$1/|{\bf R}|^3$ and displays $(1+\cos(2{\bf k}_D\cdot {\bf R})$-type
oscillations. A-A sublattice coupling is always ferromagnetic whereas A-B
subattice coupling is always antiferromagnetic and three times as large. We
also study the effect of edges in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) and find
that for impurities on the edge, the RKKY coupling decays exponentially because
of the localized zero energy edge states. For impurities inside a ZGNR the bulk
characteristics are quickly regained.
