A 50 min time series of one-dimensional slit-spectrograms, taken in quiet sun
at disk center, observed at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope (Observatorio del
Teide), was used to study the global and spatial variations of different line
parameters. In order to determine the vertical structure of the photosphere two
lines with well separated formation heights have been considered. The data have
been filtered of p-modes to isolate the pure convective phenomenon. From our
studies of global correlation coefficients and coherence and phase shift
analyzes between the several line parameters, the following results can be
reported. The convective velocity pattern preserves structures larger than 1.0"
up to the highest layers of the photosphere (~ 435 km). However, at these
layers, in the intensity pattern only structures larger than 2.0" are still
connected with those at the continuum level although showing inverted
brightness contrast. This confirms an inversion of temperature that we have
found at a height of ~140 km. A possible evidence of gravity waves superimposed
to the convective motions is derived from the phase shift analysis. We
interpret the behavior of the full width at half maximum and the equivalent
width as a function of the distance to the granular borders, as a consequence
of enhanced turbulence and/or strong velocity gradients in the intergranular
lanes.
