We describe a maximum entropy approach for computing volumes and counting
integer points in polyhedra. To estimate the number of points from a particular
set X in R^n in a polyhedron P in R^n, by solving a certain entropy
maximization problem, we construct a probability distribution on the set X such
that a) the probability mass function is constant on the intersection of P and
X and b) the expectation of the distribution lies in P. This allows us to apply
Central Limit Theorem type arguments to deduce computationally efficient
approximations for the number of integer points, volumes, and the number of 0-1
vectors in the polytope. As an application, we obtain asymptotic formulas for
volumes of multi-index transportation polytopes and for the number of multi-way
contingency tables.
