The first phase of the long-baseline neutrino experiment, LBNE10, will use a
broadband, high-energy neutrino beam with a 10-kt liquid argon TPC at 1300 km
to study neutrino oscillation. In this paper, we describe potential upgrades to
LBNE10 that use Project X to produce high-intensity, low-energy neutrino beams.
Simultaneous, high-power operation of 8- and 60-GeV beams with a 200-kt water
Cerenkov detector would provide sensitivity to nu_mu to nu_e oscillations at
the second oscillation maximum. We find that with ten years of data, it would
be possible to measure sin2(2theta_13) with precision comparable to that
expected from reactor antineutrino disappearance and to measure the value of
the CP phase, delta_CP, with an uncertainty of (5-10) degrees. This document is
submitted for inclusion in Snowmass 2013.
