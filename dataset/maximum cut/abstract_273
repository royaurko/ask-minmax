Triple patterning lithography (TPL) is one of the most promising techniques
in the 14nm logic node and beyond. However, traditional LELELE type TPL
technology suffers from native conflict and overlapping problems. Recently
LELEEC process was proposed to overcome the limitations, where the third mask
is used to generate the end-cuts. In this paper we propose the first study for
LELEEC layout decomposition. Conflict graphs and end-cut graphs are constructed
to extract all the geometrical relationships of input layout and end-cut
candidates. Based on these graphs, integer linear programming (ILP) is
formulated to minimize the conflict number and the stitch number.
