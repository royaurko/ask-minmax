In this study, terahertz (THz) absorption and transmission of monolayer
MoS$_{2}$ was calculated under different carrier concentrations. Results showed
that the THz absorption of monolayer MoS$_{2}$ is very small even under high
carrier concentrations and large incident angle. Equivalent loss of the THz
absorption is the total sum of reflection and absorption that is one to three
grades lower than that of graphene. The monolayer MoS$_{2}$ transmission is
much larger than that of the traditional GaAs and InAs two-dimensional electron
gas. The field-effect tubular structure formed by the monolayer
MoS$_{2}$-insulation-layer-graphene is investigated. In this structure the THz
absorption of graphene to reach saturation under low voltage. Meantime, the
maximum THz absorption of monolayer MoS$_{2}$ was limited to approximately 5\%.
Thus, monolayer MoS$_{2}$ is a kind of ideal THz Transparent Electrodes.
