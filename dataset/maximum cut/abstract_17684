To meet the evolving data rate requirements of emerging wireless
communication technologies, many parallel architectures have been proposed to
implement high throughput turbo decoders. However, concurrent memory
reading/writing in parallel turbo decoding architectures leads to severe memory
conflict problem, which has become a major bottleneck for high throughput turbo
decoders. In this paper, we propose a flexible and efficient VLSI architecture
to solve the memory conflict problem for highly parallel turbo decoders
targeting multi-standard 3G/4G wireless communication systems. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed parallel interleaver architecture, we
implemented an HSPA+/LTE/LTE-Advanced multi-standard turbo decoder with a 45nm
CMOS technology. The implemented turbo decoder consists of 16 Radix-4 MAP
decoder cores, and the chip core area is 2.43 mm^2. When clocked at 600 MHz,
this turbo decoder can achieve a maximum decoding throughput of 826 Mbps in the
HSPA+ mode and 1.67 Gbps in the LTE/LTE-Advanced mode, exceeding the peak data
rate requirements for both standards.
