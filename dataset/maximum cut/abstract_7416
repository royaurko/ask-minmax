Recent homogeneous and isotropic maps of UHECR, suggest an isotropic cosmic
origin almost uncorrelated to nearby Local Universe prescribed by GZK (tens
Mpc) cut-off. Z-Burst model based on UHE neutrino resonant scattering on light
relic ones in nearby Hot neutrino Dark Halo, may overcome the absence of such a
local imprint and explain the recent correlation with BL Lac at distances of a
few hundred Mpc. Z-Burst multiple imprint, due to very possible lightest
non-degenerated neutrino masses, may inject energy and modulate UHECR ZeV edge
spectra. The Z-burst (and GZK) ultra high energy neutrinos (ZeV and EeV band)
may also shine, by UHE neutrinos mass state mixing, and rise in corresponding
UHE Tau neutrino flavor, whose charged current tau production and its decay in
flight, maybe the source of UHE showering on Earth. The Radius and the
atmosphere size of our planet constrains the tau maximal distance and energy to
make a shower. These terrestrial tau energies are near GZK energy limit. Higher
distances and energies are available in bigger planets; eventual solar
atmosphere horizons may amplify the UHE tau flight allowing tau showering at
ZeV energies offering a novel way to reveal the expected Z-Burst extreme
neutrino fluxes.
