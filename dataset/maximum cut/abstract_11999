The electronic structure of crystalline CdTe, CdO, $\alpha$-TeO$_2$,
CdTeO$_3$ and Cd$_3$TeO$_6$ is studied by means of first principles
calculations. The band structure, total and partial density of states, and
charge densities are presented. For $\alpha$-TeO$_2$ and CdTeO$_3$, Density
Functional Theory within the Local Density Approximation (LDA) correctly
describes the insulating character of these compounds. In the first four
compounds, LDA underestimates the optical bandgap by roughly 1 eV. Based on
this trend, we predict an optical bandgap of 1.7 eV for Cd$_3$TeO$_6$. This
material shows an isolated conduction band with a low effective mass, thus
explaining its semiconducting character observed recently. In all these oxides,
the top valence bands are formed mainly from the O 2p electrons. On the other
hand, the binding energy of the Cd 4d band, relative to the valence band
maximum, in the ternary compounds is smaller than in CdTe and CdO.
