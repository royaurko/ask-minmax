We present a catalogue of positions, magnitudes and velocities for 3300
emission-line objects found by the Planetary Nebula Spectrograph in a survey of
the Andromeda Galaxy, M31. Of these objects, 2615 are found likely to be
planetary nebulae (PNe) associated with M31. Initial results from this survey
include: the likely non-existence of Andromeda VIII; a universal PN luminosity
function, with the exception of a small amount of obscuration, and a small
offset in normalization between bulge and disk components; very faint
kinematically-selected photometry implying no cut-off in the disk to beyond 4
scalelengths and no halo population in excess of the bulge out to 10 effective
bulge radii; disk kinematics that show significant dispersion and asymmetric
drift out to large radii, consistent with a warm flaring disk; and no sign of
any variation in kinematics with PN luminosity, suggesting that PNe arise from
a fairly uniform population of old stars.
