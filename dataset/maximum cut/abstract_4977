We study the $Z^\prime$ phenomenology for two extensions of the Electroweak
Standard Model (SM) which have an extra $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge factor. We show the
capabilities of the LHC in distinguishing the signals coming from these two
extensions and both of them from the Standard Model background. In order to
compare the behavior of these $B-L$ models we consider the reaction $p +
p\longrightarrow \mu^+ + \mu^- + X$ and compute some observables as the total
cross sections, number of events, forward-backward asymmetry, final particle
distributions like rapidity, transverse momentum, and dimuon invariant mass,
for two LHC regimes: $\sqrt{s}\,({\cal L})=7$ TeV ($1\, \textrm{fb}^{-1}$) and
$14 $ TeV ($100\, \textrm{fb}^{-1}$) for $M_{Z^{\prime}}$ = 1000 GeV and 1500
GeV. We show that by using appropriate kinematic cuts some of the observables
considered here are able to extract different properties of the $Z^\prime$
boson, and hence providing information about to which $B-L$ model it belongs
to.
