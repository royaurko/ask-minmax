We investigate the claim that all dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) reside
within halos that share a common, universal mass profile as has been derived
for dSphs of the Galaxy. By folding in kinematic information for 25 Andromeda
dSphs, more than doubling the previous sample size, we find that a singular
mass profile can not be found to fit all the observations well. Further, the
best-fit dark matter density profile measured for solely the Milky Way dSphs is
marginally discrepant (at just beyond the 1 sigma level) with that of the
Andromeda dSphs, where a profile with lower maximum circular velocity, and
hence mass, is preferred. The agreement is significantly better when three
extreme Andromeda outliers, And XIX, XXI and XXV, all of which have large
half-light radii (>600pc) and low velocity dispersions (sigma_v < 5km/s) are
omitted from the sample. We argue that the unusual properties of these outliers
are likely caused by tidal interactions with the host galaxy.
