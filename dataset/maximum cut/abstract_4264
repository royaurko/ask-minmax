With a large integrated luminosity expected at the Tevatron, a
next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation is no longer sufficient to describe the
data which yield the precision measurement of $M_W$, etc. Thus, we extend the
Collins-Soper-Sterman resummation formalism, for on-shell vector boson
production, to correctly include the effects of the polarization and the width
of the vector boson to the distributions of the decay leptons. We show how to
test the rich dynamics of the QCD multiple soft gluon radiation, for example,
by measuring the ratio $R_{CSS} \equiv \frac{\sigma (Q_T>Q_T^{\min})}{\sigma
_{Total}}$. ($Q_T$ is the transverse momentum of the vector boson.) We conclude
that both the total rates and the distributions of the lepton charge asymmetry
predicted by the resummed and the NLO calculations are different when kinematic
cuts are applied.
