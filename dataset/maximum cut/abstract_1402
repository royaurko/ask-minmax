Pure, or type-free, Linear Logic proof nets are Turing complete once
cut-elimination is considered as computation. We introduce modal
impredicativity as a new form of impredicativity causing the complexity of
cut-elimination to be problematic from a complexity point of view. Modal
impredicativity occurs when, during reduction, the conclusion of a residual of
a box b interacts with a node that belongs to the proof net inside another
residual of b. Technically speaking, superlazy reduction is a new notion of
reduction that allows to control modal impredicativity. More specifically,
superlazy reduction replicates a box only when all its copies are opened. This
makes the overall cost of reducing a proof net finite and predictable.
Specifically, superlazy reduction applied to any pure proof nets takes
primitive recursive time. Moreover, any primitive recursive function can be
computed by a pure proof net via superlazy reduction.
