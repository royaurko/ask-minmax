Brillouin scattering studies have been carried out on high quality single
crystals of Fe$_3$O$_4$ with [100] and [110] faces in the temperature range of
300 to 30 K. The room temperature spectrum shows a surface Rayleigh wave (SRW)
mode at 8 GHz and a longitudinal acoustic (LA) mode at 60 GHz. The SRW mode
frequency shows a minimum at the Verwey transition temperature $T_V$ of 123 K.
The softening of the SRW mode frequency from about 250 K to $T_V$ can be
quantitatively understood as a result of a decrease in the shear elastic
constant C$_{44}$, arising from the coupling of shear strain to charge
fluctuations. On the other hand, the LA mode frequency does not show any
significant change around $T_V$, but shows a large change in its intensity. The
latter shows a maximum at around 120 K in the cooling run and at 165 K in the
heating run, exhibiting a large hysteresis of 45 K. This significant change in
intensity may be related to the presence of stress-induced ordering of
Fe$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$ at the octahedral sites, as well as to stress-induced
domain wall motion.
