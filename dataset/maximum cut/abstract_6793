Knowledge of Jupiter's deep interior would provide unique constraints on the
formation of the Solar System. Measurement of its core mass and global
composition would shed light on whether the planet formed by accretion or by
direct gravitational collapse. At present, the inner structure of Jupiter is
poorly constrained and seismology, which consists of identifying acoustic
eigenmodes, offers a way to directly measure its deep sound speed profile, and
thus its physical properties. Seismology of Jupiter has been considered since
the mid 1970s, but hitherto the various attempts to detect global modes led, at
best, to ambiguous results. We report the detection of global modes of Jupiter,
based on radial velocity measurements performed with the SYMPA Fourier
spectro-imager. The global seismic parameters that we measure include the
frequency of maximum amplitude 1213+/-50 \mu Hz, the mean large frequency
spacing between radial harmonics 155.3+/-2.2 \mu Hz and the mode maximum
amplitude 49 (-10/+8) cm/s, all values that are consistent with current models
of Jupiter. This result opens the way to the investigation of the inner
structure of the Solar System's giant planets based on seismology techniques.
