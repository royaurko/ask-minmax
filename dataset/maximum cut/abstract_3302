We investigate properties below T_c of odd-frequency pairing which is
realized by antiferromagnetic critical spin fluctuations or spin wave modes. It
is shown that \Delta(\epsilon_n) becomes maximum at finite \epsilon_n, and
\Delta(\pi T) becomes maximum at finite T. Implications of the present results
to the experimental results of CeCu_2Si_2 and CeRhIn_5 are given.
