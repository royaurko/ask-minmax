We extend the notion of a source unfolding of a convex polyhedron P to be
based on a closed polygonal curve Q in a particular class rather than based on
a point. The class requires that Q "lives on a cone" to both sides; it includes
simple, closed quasigeodesics. Cutting a particular subset of the cut locus of
Q (in P) leads to a non-overlapping unfolding of the polyhedron. This gives a
new general method to unfold the surface of any convex polyhedron to a simple,
planar polygon.
