A generalization of a-maximization is proposed that maximizes a subject to
inequalities rather than equalities. The implication of this conjecture is that
in the absence of emergent symmetries, there is a maximum R-charge for fields
appearing in the path integral. This maximum R-charge leads to a novel way of
detecting emergent Abelian symmetries and non-Abelian gauge symmetries.
