The spectral shape of the synchrotron X-ray emission from SN 1006 reveals the
fundamental role played by radiative losses in shaping the high-energy tail of
the electron spectrum. We analyze data from the XMM-Newton SN 1006 Large
Program and confirm that in both nonthermal limbs the loss-limited model
correctly describes the observed spectra. We study the physical origin of the
observed variations of the synchrotron cutoff energy across the shell. We
investigate the role played by the shock velocity and by the electron
gyrofactor. We found that the cutoff energy of the syncrotron X-ray emission
reaches its maximum value in regions where the shock has experienced its
highest average speed. This result is consistent with the loss-limited
framework. We also find that the electron acceleration in both nonthermal limbs
of SN 1006 proceeds close to the Bohm diffusion limit, the gyrofactor being in
the range 1.5-4. We finally investigate possible explanations for the low
values of cutoff energy measured in thermal limbs.
