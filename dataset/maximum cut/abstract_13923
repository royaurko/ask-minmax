This paper presents a complete Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for
camera captured image/graphics embedded textual documents for handheld devices.
At first, text regions are extracted and skew corrected. Then, these regions
are binarized and segmented into lines and characters. Characters are passed
into the recognition module. Experimenting with a set of 100 business card
images, captured by cell phone camera, we have achieved a maximum recognition
accuracy of 92.74%. Compared to Tesseract, an open source desktop-based
powerful OCR engine, present recognition accuracy is worth contributing.
Moreover, the developed technique is computationally efficient and consumes low
memory so as to be applicable on handheld devices.
