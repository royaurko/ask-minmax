We study the quiver with relations of the endomorphism algebra of an APR
tilting module. We give an explicit description of the quiver with relations by
graded quivers with potential (QPs) and mutations. The result also implies that
mutations of QPs with algebraic cuts induce tilting mutations between the
associated truncated Jacobian algebras. Consequently, mutations of QPs provide
a rich source of derived equivalence classes of algebras. As an application, we
give a sufficient condition of QPs such that Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky's
question has a positive answer.
