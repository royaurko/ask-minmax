A simple cut-and-patch method is presented for the construction and
classification for fullerenes belonging to the octahedral point groups, $O$ or
$O_h$. In order to satisfy the symmetry requirement of the octahedral group,
suitable numbers of four- and eight-member rings, in addition to the hexagons
and pentagons, have to be introduced. An index consisting of four integers is
introduced to specify an octahedral fullerenes. However, to specify an
octahedral fullerene uniquely, we also found certain symmetry rules for these
indices. Based on the transformation properties under the symmetry operations
that an octahedral fullerene belongs to, we can identify four structural types
of octahedral fullerenes.
