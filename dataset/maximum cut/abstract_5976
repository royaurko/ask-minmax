We define a hierarchy of dynamic relaxed gas spheres as solutions of the
Poisson equation coupled to a hierarchy of approximations of the Liouville
equation leading, when this equation is satisfied, to the well-known isothermal
gas spheres in the static case, but also to a new form of dynamic maximum
relaxation. The two previous steps of the hierarchy correspond to an increasing
degree of local relaxation at the center of the configuration.
