We calculate the absorbtion cross-sections of $B_{c}$ mesons by $\pi$ and
$\rho$ mesons including anomalous processes using an effective hadronic
Lagrangian. The enhancement of Bc production is expected due to QGP formation
in heavy-ion experiments. However it is also expected that the production rate
of Bc meson can be affected due to the interaction with comovers. These
processes are relevant for experiments at RHIC. Thermal average cross-sections
of $B_{c}$ are evaluated with form factor when a cut off parameter in it is 1
and 2 GeV. Using these thermal average cross-sections in the kinetic equation
we investigate the time evolution of $B_{c}$ mesons due to dissociation in the
hadronic matter formed at RHIC.
