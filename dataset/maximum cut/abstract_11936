In this paper we derive the Clauser-Horne (CH) inequality for the full
electron counting statistics in a mesoscopic multiterminal conductor and we
discuss its properties. We first consider the idealized situation in which a
flux of entangled electrons is generated by an entangler. Given a certain
average number of incoming entangled electrons, the CH inequality can be
evaluated for different numbers of transmitted particles. Strong violations
occur when the number of transmitted charges on the two terminals is the same
($Q_1=Q_2$), whereas no violation is found for $Q_1\ne Q_2$. We then consider
two actual setups that can be realized experimentally. The first one consists
of a three terminal normal beam splitter and the second one of a hybrid
superconducting structure. Interestingly, we find that the CH inequality is
violated for the three terminal normal device. The maximum violation scales as
1/M and $1/M^2$ for the entangler and normal beam splitter, respectively, 2$M$
being the average number of injected electrons. As expected, we find full
violation of the CH inequality in the case of the superconducting system.
