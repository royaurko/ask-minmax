There exists a variety of exact solutions of the scalar field Einstein
equations, allowing for ``phantom regions'' with the negative kinetic field
term. These regions can be cut out, their boundaries being sewn together in
such a way that neither the scale factor (along with its first two derivatives)
nor density or pressure will experience a jump. Such a domain surgery
eliminates the ``Big Rip'' scenario, substituting for it the standard
inflation.
