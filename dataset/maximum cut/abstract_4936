We present the prospects for the discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson
decaying to $b\bar{b}$ pair through the Vector Boson Fusion mechanism in
association with a central photon at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The
photon provides a clean trigger and several advantages despite the fact that
the cross section decreases by approximately a factor of $\alpha_{em}$. After
applying various optimized selection criteria, we obtain a significance of
$\sim$1.9 using ALPGEN interfaced with PYTHIA. The expected $b$-jet efficiency
and fake rates and other detector acceptance cuts are taken into account to
obtain a more realistic result.
