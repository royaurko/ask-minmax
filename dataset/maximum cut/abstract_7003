Short-period exoplanets potentially lose envelope masses during their
evolution because of atmospheric escape caused by the intense XUV radiation
from their host stars. We develop a combined model of atmospheric mass loss
calculation and thermal evolution calculation of a planet to simulate its
evolution and explore the dependences on the formation history of the planet.
Thermal atmospheric escape as well as the Roche-lobe overflow contributes to
mass loss. The maximum initial planetary model mass depends primarily on the
assumed evolution model of the stellar XUV luminosity. We adapt the model to
CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b to explore the evolution of both planets and the
maximum initial mass of these planets. We take the recent X-ray observation of
CoRoT-7 into account and exploring the effect of different XUV evolution models
on the planetary initial mass. Our calculations indicate that both hot super
Earths could be remnants of Jupiter mass gas planets.
