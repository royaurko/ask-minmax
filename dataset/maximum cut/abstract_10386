A {\it sign pattern matrix} is a matrix whose entries are from the set
$\{+,-, 0\}$. The minimum rank of a sign pattern matrix $A$ is the minimum of
the ranks of the real matrices whose entries have signs equal to the
corresponding entries of $A$. It is shown in this paper that for any $m \times
n$ sign pattern $A$ with minimum rank $n-2$, rational realization of the
minimum rank is possible. This is done using a new approach involving sign
vectors and duality. It is shown that for each integer $n\geq 9$, there exists
a nonnegative integer $m$ such that there exists an $n\times m$ sign pattern
matrix with minimum rank $n-3$ for which rational realization is not possible.
A characterization of $m\times n$ sign patterns $A$ with minimum rank $n-1$ is
given (which solves an open problem in Brualdi et al. \cite{Bru10}), along with
a more general description of sign patterns with minimum rank $r$, in terms of
sign vectors of certain subspaces. A number of results on the maximum and
minimum numbers of sign vectors of $k$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb R^n$
are obtained. In particular, it is shown that the maximum number of sign
vectors of $2$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb R^n$ is $4n+1$. Several
related open problems are stated along the way.
