We propose a versatile approach to treat commonly arising constraints. It is
illustrated for interacting magnons of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a
square lattice. For systems of $L\times L$ sites a non-perturbative continuous
unitary transformation (CUT) is used to derive an effective Hamiltonian
conserving the number of magnons. They are bosonic particles with a hardcore
constraint which is captured by a local, repulsive interaction U. The limits
$U\to\infty$ and $L\to\infty$ are achieved by extrapolation. The residual spin
gap $\Delta_1$ is smaller than 0.01J reflecting the gapless nature of the
magnons. The one-magnon dispersion displays all known characteristics.
