In this paper, a fractional generalization of the wave equation that
describes propagation of damped waves is considered. In contrast to the
fractional diffusion-wave equation, the fractional wave equation contains
fractional derivatives of the same order $\alpha,\ 1\le \alpha \le 2$ both in
space and in time. We show that this feature is a decisive factor for
inheriting some crucial characteristics of the wave equation like a constant
propagation velocity of both the maximum of its fundamental solution and its
gravity and mass centers. Moreover, the first, the second, and the Smith
centrovelocities of the damped waves described by the fractional wave equation
are constant and depend just on the equation order $\alpha$. The fundamental
solution of the fractional wave equation is determined and shown to be a
spatial probability density function evolving in time that possesses finite
moments up to the order $\alpha$. To illustrate analytical findings, results of
numerical calculations and numerous plots are presented.
