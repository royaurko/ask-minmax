We study the mass dependence of various quantities (like the average and
maximum density, collision rate, participant-spectator matter, temperature as
well as time zones for higher density) by simulating the reactions at the
energy of vanishing flow. This study is carried out within the framework of
Quantum Molecular Dynamics model. Our findings clearly indicate an existence of
a power law in all the above quantities calculated at the balance energy. The
only significant mass dependence was obtained for the temperature reached in
the central sphere. All other quantities are rather either insensitive or
depend weakly on the system size at balance energy. The time zone for higher
density as well as the time of maximal density and collision rate follow a
power law inverse to the energy of vanishing flow.
