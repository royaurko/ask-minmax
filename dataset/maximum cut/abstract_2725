The propagation of surface (Rayleigh) waves over a rotating orthorhombic
crystal is studied. The crystal possesses three crystallographic axes, normal
to the symmetry planes: the half-space is cut along a plane normal to one of
these axes, the wave travels in the direction of another, and the rotation
occurs at a uniform rate about any of the three axes. The secular equation for
the surface wave speed is found explicitly; in contrast to the non-rotating
case, it is dispersive (frequency-dependent). Both Coriolis and centrifugal
accelerations appear in the equations of motion: none can be neglected in favor
of the other, even at small rotation rates.
