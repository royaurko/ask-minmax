We study the polynomial chaotic inflation model with a single scalar field in
a double well quartic potential which has recently been shown to be consistent
with Planck data. In particular, we study the effects of lifting the degeneracy
between the two vacua on the inflationary observables, i.e. spectral index n_s
and tensor-to-scalar perturbation ratio r_T. We find that removing the
degeneracy allows the model to satisfy the upper limit constraints on r_T from
Planck data, provided the field starts near the local maximum. We also
calculate the scalar power spectrum and non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL for the
primordial scalar perturbations in this model.
