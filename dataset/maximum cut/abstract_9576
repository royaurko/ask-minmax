Long-range interactions lead to non-Fermi liquid effects in dense matter. We
show that, in contrast to other material properties, their effect on the bulk
viscosity of quark matter is significant since they shift its resonant maximum
and can thereby change the viscosity by many orders of magnitude. This is of
importance for the damping of oscillations of compact stars, like in particular
unstable r-modes, and the quest to detect signatures of deconfined matter in
astrophysical observations. We find that, in contrast to neutron stars with
standard damping mechanisms, compact stars that contain ungapped quark matter
are consistent with the observed data on low mass x-ray binaries.
