We derive the exact frame-dragging rate inside rotating neutron stars. This
formula is applied to show that the frame-dragging rate monotonically decreases
from the centre to the surface of the neutron star along the pole. In case of
frame-dragging rate along the equatorial distance, it decreases initially away
from the centre, becomes negligibly small well before the surface of the
neutron star, rises again and finally approaches to a small value at the
surface. The appearance of local maximum and minimum in this case is the result
of the dependence of frame-dragging frequency on the distance and angle. Moving
from the equator to the pole, it is observed that this local maximum and
minimum in the frame dragging rate along the equator disappears after crossing
a critical angle. It is also noted that the positions of local maximum and
minimum of the frame-dragging rate along the equator depend on the rotation
frequency and central energy density of a particular pulsar.
