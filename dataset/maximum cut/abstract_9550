We report the successful growth of a large
(Ca$_{x}$La$_{1-x}$)(Ba$_{1.75-x}$La$_{0.25+x}$)Cu$_{3}$O$_{y}$ (CLBLCO) single
crystal. In this material, $x$ controls the maximum of Tc ($T_{c}^{\max}$),
with minimal structural changes. Therefore, it allows a search for correlations
between material properties and $T_{c}^{\max}$. We demonstrate that the
crystals are good enough for neutron scattering and cleave well enough for
Raman scattering. These results open new possibilities for cuprate research.
