The resistivity and Hall effect in CeNiSn are measured at temperatures down
to 35 mK and in magnetic fields up to 20 T with the current applied along the
{\it b} axis. The resistivity at zero field exhibits quadratic temperature
dependence below $\sim$0.16 K with a huge coefficient of the $T^2$ term (54
$\mu$$\Omega$cm/K$^2$). The resistivity as a function of field shows an
anomalous maximum and dip, the positions of which vary with field directions.
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations with a frequency {\it F} of $\sim$100 T
are observed for a wide range of field directions in the {\it ac} and {\it bc}
planes, and the quasiparticle mass is determined to be $\sim$10-20 {\it m}$_e$.
The carrier density is estimated to be $\sim10^{-3}$ electron/Ce. In a narrow
range of field directions in the {\it ac} plane, where the
magnetoresistance-dip anomaly manifests itself clearer than in other field
directions, a higher-frequency ($F=300\sim400\text{T}$) SdH oscillation is
found at high fields above the anomaly. This observation is discussed in terms
of possible field-induced changes in the electronic structure.
