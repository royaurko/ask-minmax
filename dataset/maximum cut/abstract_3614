Continuous wavelet transform and cross-wavelet transform have been used to
investigate the phase periodicity and synchrony of the monthly mean Wolf
($R_{z}$) and group ($R_{g}$) sunspot numbers during the period of June 1795 to
December 1995. The Schwabe cycle is the only one common period in Rg and Rz,
but it is not well-defined in case of cycles 5-7 of Rg and in case of cycles 5
and 6 of $R_{z}$. In fact, the Schwabe period is slightly different in $R_{g}$
and $R_{z}$ before cycle 12, but from cycle 12 onwards it is almost the same
for the two time series. Asynchrony of the two time series is more obviously
seen in cycles 5 and 6 than in the following cycles, and usually more obviously
seen around the maximum time of a cycle than during the rest of the cycle.
$R_{g}$ is found to fit $R_{z}$ better in both amplitudes and peak epoch during
the minimum time time of a solar cycle than during the maximum time of the
cycle, which should be caused by their different definition, and around the
maximum time of a cycle, $R_{g}$ is usually less than $R_{z}$. Asynchrony of
$R_{g}$ and $R_{z}$ should somewhat agree with different sunspot cycle
characteristics exhibited by themselves.
