We report and analyze the observational evidence of global kink oscillations
in a solar filament as observed in H alpha by National Solar Observatory
(NSO)/Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) instrument. An M1.1-class flare
in active region 11692 on 2013 March 15 induced a global kink mode in the
filament lying in the south-west of AR11692.We find periods of about 61 - 67
minutes and damping times of 92 - 117 minutes at three vertical slice positions
chosen in and around the filament apex. We find that the waves are damped. From
the observed global kink mode period and damping time scale using the theory of
resonant absorption we perform prominence seismology. We estimate a lower
cut-off value for the inhomogeneity length-scale to be around 0.34 - 0.44 times
the radius of the filament cross-section.
