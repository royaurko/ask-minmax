The space-time bit-interleaved coded modulation (ST-BICM) is an efficient
technique to obtain high diversity and coding gain on a block-fading MIMO
channel. Its maximum-likelihood (ML) performance is computed under ideal
interleaving conditions, which enables a global optimization taking into
account channel coding. Thanks to a diversity upperbound derived from the
Singleton bound, an appropriate choice of the time dimension of the space-time
coding is possible, which maximizes diversity while minimizing complexity.
Based on the analysis, an optimized interleaver and a set of linear precoders,
called dispersive nucleo algebraic (DNA) precoders are proposed. The proposed
precoders have good performance with respect to the state of the art and exist
for any number of transmit antennas and any time dimension. With turbo codes,
they exhibit a frame error rate which does not increase with frame length.
