The interesting anisotropic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) observed in the
quaternary EuRhAl4Si2 single crystalline sample has been studied by measuring
the isothermal magnetization in applied magnetic fields. EuRhAl4Si2,
crystallizes in the tetragonal crystal structure and orders
antiferromagnetically at ~12 K. The isothermal magnetization along the two
principle directions is highly anisotropic despite Eu2+ being an S-state ion
which lacks crystal electric field anisotropy to the first order. The variation
of entropy change, which is a measure of magnetocaloric effect, with field and
temperature, calculated from the isothermal magnetization data taken at various
temperatures along the principal crystallographic directions present
interesting physical properties in this compound. In the magnetically ordered
state the entropy change is highly nonlinear below spin flip fields; however in
the paramagnetic region, it is negative irrespective of the strength of applied
magnetic field. From iso-field data, for H // [100], entropy change is
initially positive before a crossover temperature of 7-10 K for fields 2T-7T,
reaching a maximum of -16 J/Kg K at 12 K. For H // [001] the observed maximum
entropy change at 7 T is -21 J/Kg K, which is large and comparable to the
largest known values in this temperature range. The variation of the entropy
vs. field plots strongly depends upon the direction of the applied magnetic
field.
