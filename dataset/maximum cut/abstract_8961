We present a summary of the beatwave particle acceleration program developed
at Ecole Polytechnique. In dedicated experiments, plasma formation, plasma wave
generation and saturation, and particle acceleration were successively studied
and understood in detail. A maximum energy gain of 1.3 MeV was obtained, which
is compatible with an accelerating gradient of 0.7 GV/m.
