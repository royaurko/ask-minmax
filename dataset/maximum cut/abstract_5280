The univariate Piecing-Together approach (PT) fits a univariate generalized
Pareto distribution (GPD) to the upper tail of a given distribution function in
a continuous manner. A multivariate extension was established by Aulbach et al.
(2012a): The upper tail of a given copula C is cut off and replaced by a
multivariate GPD-copula in a continuous manner, yielding a new copula called a
PT-copula. Then each margin of this PT-copula is transformed by a given
univariate distribution function. This provides a multivariate distribution
function with prescribed margins, whose copula is a GPD-copula that coincides
in its central part with C. In addition to Aulbach et al. (2012a), we achieve
in the present paper an exact representation of the PT-copula's upper tail,
giving further insight into the multivariate PT approach. A variant based on
the empirical copula is also added. Furthermore our findings enable us to
establish a functional PT version as well.
