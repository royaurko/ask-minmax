We show that various surface parameters in two-dimensional diffusion limited
aggregation (DLA) grow linearly with the number of particles. We find the ratio
of the average length of the perimeter and the accessible perimeter of a DLA
cluster together with its external perimeters to the cluster size, and define a
microscopic schematic procedure for attachment of an incident new particle to
the cluster. We measure the fractal dimension of the red sites (i.e., the sites
upon cutting each of them splits the cluster) equal to that of the DLA cluster.
It is also shown that the average number of the dead sites and the average
number of the red sites have linear relationships with the cluster size.
