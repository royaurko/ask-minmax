A model of interaction of massless vector and spinor fields is considered.
With the use of Bogolyubov quasi-average method we study a possibility of a
dynamical breaking of the initial symmetry. Assuming the existence of effective
cut-off $\Lambda$, we show, that there exists a solution, which breaks gauge
symmetry of the theory. Instead of Higgs scalars fermion-antifermion tachion
bound states are present here. As a result we have a theory with a massive
vector field, a massive spinor and a composite scalar.
