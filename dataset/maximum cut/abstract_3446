Measurements of the small,intermediate, and large ion concentrations and the
airearth current density along with simultaneous measurements of the
concentration and size-distribution of aerosol particles in the size ranges 4.4
to 163 nm and 0.5 to 20 micrometer diameters are reported for a drifting snow
period after the occurrence of a blizzard at a coastal station, Maitri,
Antarctica. Ion concentrations of all categories and the airearth current
simultaneously decrease by approximately an order of magnitude as the wind
speed increases from 5 to 10 meter per sec. The rate of decrease is the highest
for large ions, lowest for small ions and in between the two for intermediate
ions. Total aerosol number concentration decreases in the 4.4 to 163 nm size
range but increases in 0.5 to 20 micrmetr size range with wind speed. Size
distribution of the nanometer particles show a dominant maximum at 30 nm
diameter throughout the period of observations and the height of the maximum
decreases with wind speed. However, larger particles show a maximum at 0.7
micrometer diameter but the height of the maximum increases with increasing
wind speed. The results are explained in terms of scavenging of atmospheric
ions and aerosols by the drifting snow particles.
