We give a variational proof of global stability for bistable travelling waves
of scalar reaction-diffusion equations on the real line. In particular, we
recover some of the classical results by P. Fife and J.B. McLeod without any
use of the maximum principle. The method that is illustrated here in the
simplest possible setting has been successfully applied to more general
parabolic or hyperbolic gradient-like systems.
