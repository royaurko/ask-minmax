e have developed a simple process to obtain large magnetoresistance (MR) in
perovskite manganite thin films by a combination of focused ion beam (FIB)
milling and 120 keV H$_{2}^{+}$ ion implantation. Metal slits about 70 nm in
width were printed by 30 kV focused Ga ion beam nanolithography on a 4 mm
track, and the materials in these slits are then irradiated by the accelerated
H$_{2}^{+}$ ions. Using this method, in a magnetic field of 5 T we can get a
MR${>}$60% over a 230 K temperature scope, with a maximum value of 95% at
around 70 K. This technique is very promising in terms of its simplicity and
flexibility of fabrication and has potential for high-density integration.
