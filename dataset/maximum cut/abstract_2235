We consider gluon-fusion and weak-boson fusion production of Higgs plus two
jets in pp collisions at sqrt{s}=14 TeV (LHC) and sqrt{s}=50, 100, 200 TeV
(VLHC). We give cross sections for Higgs masses between 115 GeV and 200 GeV,
and discuss the experimental cuts that should be applied in order to enhance
the weak-boson fusion contribution with respect to the gluon-fusion background.
