We consider the dynamic complexity of some central graph problems such as
Reachability and Matching and linear algebraic problems such as Rank and
Inverse. As elementary change operations we allow insertion and deletion of
edges of a graph and the modification of a single entry in a matrix, and we are
interested in the complexity of maintaining a property or query. Our main
results are as follows: (1) Reachability is in DynFO; (2) Rank of a matrix is
in DynFO(+,x); (3) Maximum Matching (decision) is in non-uniform DynFO.
  Here, DynFO allows updates of the auxiliary data structure defined in
first-order logic, DynFO(+,x) additionally has arithmetics at initialization
time and non-uniform DynFO allows arbitrary auxiliary data at initialization
time. Alternatively, DynFO(+,x) and non-uniform DynFO allow updates by uniform
and non-uniform families of poly-size, bounded-depth circuits, respectively.
  The first result confirms a two decade old conjecture of Patnaik and Immerman
(1997). The proofs rely mainly on elementary Linear Algebra. The second result
can also be concluded from Frandsen and Frandsen (2009).
