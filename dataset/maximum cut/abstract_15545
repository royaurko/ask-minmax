Stability is a desirable property of complex ecosystems. If a community of
interacting species is at a stable equilibrium point then it is able to
withstand small perturbations without any adverse effect. In ecology, the
Jacobian matrix evalufated at an equilibrium point is known as the community
matrix, which represents the population dynamics of interacting species. The
system's asymptotic short- and long-term behaviour can be determined from
eigenvalues derived from the community matrix. Here we use results from the
theory of pseudospectra to describe intermediate, transient dynamics. We show
that the transition from stable to unstable dynamics includes a region of
transient instability, where the effect of a small perturbation is amplified
before ultimately decaying. The shift from stability to transient instability
depends on the magnitude of a perturbation, and we show how to determine lower
and upper bounds to the maximum amplitude of perturbations. Of five different
types of community matrix, we find that amplification is least severe with
predator-prey interactions. This analysis is relevant to other systems whose
dynamics can be expressed in terms of the Jacobian matrix. Through
understanding transient instability, we can learn under what conditions
multiple perturbations - multiple external shocks - will irrecoverably break
stability.
