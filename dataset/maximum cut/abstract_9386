Opto-mechanical systems have enabled wide-band optical frequency conversion
and multi-channel all-optical radio frequency amplification. Realization of an
on-chip silicon communication platform is limited by photodetectors needed to
convert optical information to electrical signals for further signal
processing. In this paper we present a coupled silicon micro-resonator, which
converts near-IR optical intensity modulation at 174.2MHz and 1.198GHz into
motional electrical current. This device emulates a photodetector which detects
intensity modulation of continuous wave laser light in the
full-width-at-half-maximum bandwidth of the mechanical resonance. The resonant
principle of operation eliminates dark current challenges associated with
convetional photodetectors.
