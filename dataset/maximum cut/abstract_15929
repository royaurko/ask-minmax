Photometric data for 34 early-type galaxies in the three high-redshift
clusters Cl 1324+3011 (z = 0.76), Cl 1604+4304 (z = 0.90), and Cl 1604+4321 (z
= 0.92), observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and with the Keck
10-meter telescopes by Oke, Postman & Lubin, are analyzed to obtain the
photometric parameters of mean surface brightness, magnitudes for the growth
curves, and angular radii at various Petrosian eta radii. The angular radii at
eta = 1.3 mag for the program galaxies are all larger than 0.24". All of the
galaxies are well resolved at this angular size using HST whose point-spread
function is 0.05", half width at half maximum. The data for each of the program
galaxies are listed at eta = 1.0, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, and 2.0 mag. They are
corrected by color equations and K terms for the effects of redshift to the
rest-frame Cape/Cousins I for Cl 1324+3011 and Cl 1604+4304 and R for Cl
1604+4321. The K corrections are calculated from synthetic spectral energy
distributions derived from evolving stellar population models of Bruzual &
Charlot which have been fitted to the observed broad-band (BVRI) AB magnitudes
of each program galaxy. The listed photometric data are independent of all
cosmological parameters. They are the source data for the Tolman surface
brightness test made in Paper IV.
