LHC measurements involve cuts on several observables, but resummed
calculations are mostly restricted to single variables. We show how the
resummation of a class of double-differential measurements can be achieved
through an extension of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). A prototypical
application is $pp \to Z + 0$ jets, where the jet veto is imposed through the
beam thrust event shape ${\mathcal T}$, and the transverse momentum $p_T$ of
the $Z$ boson is measured. A standard SCET analysis suffices for $p_T \sim
m_Z^{1/2} {\mathcal T}^{1/2}$ and $p_T \sim {\mathcal T}$, but additional
collinear-soft modes are needed in the intermediate regime. We show how to
match the factorization theorems that describe these three different regions of
phase space, and discuss the corresponding relations between fully-unintegrated
parton distribution functions, soft functions and the newly defined
collinear-soft functions. The missing ingredients needed at NNLL/NLO accuracy
are calculated, providing a check of our formalism. We also revisit the
calculation of the measurement of two angularities on a single jet in JHEP 1409
(2014) 046, finding a correction to their conjecture for the NLL cross section
at ${\mathcal O}(\alpha_s^2)$.
