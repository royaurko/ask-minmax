We have conducted a deep photometric survey of a 0.5 deg x 0.5 deg area of
the Galactic Plane using the WFI instrument on the 2.2-m ESO telescope on La
Silla, Chile. The dataset comprises a total of 267 R-band images, 204 from a 16
day observation run in 2005, supplemented by 63 images from a six week period
in 2002. Our reduction employed the new numerical kernel difference image
analysis method as implemented in the PYSIS3 code and resulted in more than
500,000 lightcurves of stars down to a magnitude limit of R ~ 24.5. A search
for variable stars resulted in the detection of 1318 variables of different
types. 1011 of these are eclipsing or contact binary stars. A number of the
contact binaries have low mass-ratios and several of the detached binaries
appear to have low-mass components. Three candidate contact binaries have
periods at the known cut off including two with periods lower than any
previously published. Also identified are 3 possible pre-main sequence detached
eclipsing binaries.
