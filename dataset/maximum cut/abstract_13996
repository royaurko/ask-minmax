Using a laser plasma accelerator, experiments with a 80 TW and 30 fs laser
pulse demonstrated quasi-monoenergetic electron spectra with maximum energy
over 0.4 GeV. This is achieved using a supersonic He gas jet and a sharp
density ramp generated by a high intensity laser crossing pre-pulse focused 3
ns before the main laser pulse. By adjusting this crossing pre-pulse position
inside the gas jet, among the laser shots with electron injection more than 40%
can produce quasi-monoenergetic spectra. This could become a relatively
straight forward technique to control laser wakefield electron beams
parameters.
