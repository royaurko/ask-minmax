We study the effects of the external tidal field on the violent relaxation
phase of star clusters dynamical evolution, with particular attention to the
kinematical properties of the equilibrium configurations emerging at the end of
this phase.We show that star clusters undergoing the process of violent
relaxation in the tidal field of their host galaxy can acquire significant
internal differential rotation and are characterized by a distinctive radial
variation of the velocity anisotropy. These kinematical properties are the
result of the symmetry breaking introduced by the external tidal field in the
collapse phase and of the action of the Coriolis force on the orbit of the
stars. The resulting equilibrium configurations are characterized by
differential rotation, with a peak located between one and two half-mass radii.
As for the anisotropy, similar to clusters evolving in isolation, the systems
explored in this Letter are characterized by an inner isotropic core, followed
by a region of increasing radial anisotropy. However for systems evolving in an
external tidal field the degree of radial anisotropy reaches a maximum in the
cluster intermediate regions and then progressively decreases, with the cluster
outermost regions being characterized by isotropy or a mild tangential
anisotropy. Young or old but less-relaxed dynamically young star clusters may
keep memory of these kinematical fingerprints of their early dynamical
evolution.
