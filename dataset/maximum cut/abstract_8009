The masses of the low lying baryons are evaluated using a total of ten
ensembles of dynamical twisted mass fermion gauge configurations. The
simulations are performed using two degenerate flavors of light quarks, and a
strange and a charm quark fixed to approximately their physical values. The
light sea quarks correspond to pseudo scalar masses in the range of about
210~MeV to 430~MeV. We use the Iwasaki improved gluonic action at three values
of the coupling constant corresponding to lattice spacing $a=0.094$~fm,
0.082~fm and 0.065~fm determined from the nucleon mass. We check for both
finite volume and cut-off effects on the baryon masses. We examine the issue of
isospin symmetry breaking for the octet and decuplet baryons and its dependence
on the lattice spacing. We show that in the continuum limit isospin breaking is
consistent with zero, as expected. We performed a chiral extrapolation of the
forty baryon masses using SU(2) $\chi$PT. After taking the continuum limit and
extrapolating to the physical pion mass our results are in good agreement with
experiment. We provide predictions for the mass of the doubly charmed
$\Xi_{cc}^*$, as well as of the doubly and triply charmed $\Omega$s that have
not yet been determined experimentally.
