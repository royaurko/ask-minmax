We present spectroscopic observations of the central star clusters in NGC
5253 the aim of which is to search for WC stars. Our observations show the
presence of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars not only of WN but also of WC subtype in two
star forming regions corresponding to the maximum optical and UV emission. The
massive star population we derive is consistent with young bursts of ~3 and 4
Myr. The region of maximum optical emission is found to provide the dominant
contribution of the ionizing flux as opposed to the less extinguished region of
maximum UV brightness. The presence of WR stars near the N-enriched regions
found by Walsh & Roy (1987, 1989) and Kobulnicky et al. (1997) suggests they
are a possible source of N. It is presently unclear whether or not our
detection of WC stars is compatible with the normal observed He/O and C/O
abundance ratios.
