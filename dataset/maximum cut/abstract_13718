In this article we obtain new results for the task of converting a
\textit{single} $N$-qubit W-class state (of the form
$\sqrt{x_0}\ket{00...0}+\sqrt{x_1}\ket{10...0}+...+\sqrt{x_N}\ket{00...1}$)
into maximum entanglement shared between two random parties. Previous studies
in random distillation have not considered how the particular choice of target
pairs affects the transformation, and here we develop a strategy for distilling
into \textit{general} configurations of target pairs. We completely solve the
problem of determining the optimal distillation probability for all three qubit
configurations and most four qubit configurations when $x_0=0$. Our proof
involves deriving new entanglement monotones defined on the set of four qubit
W-class states. As an additional application of our results, we present new
upper bounds for converting a generic W-class state into the standard W state
$\ket{W_N}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}}(\ket{10...0}+...+\ket{00...1})$.
