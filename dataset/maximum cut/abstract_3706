We consider the problem of estimating parameters of stochastic differential
equations (SDEs) with discrete-time observations that are either completely or
partially observed. The transition density between two observations is
generally unknown. We propose an importance sampling approach with an auxiliary
parameter when the transition density is unknown. We embed the auxiliary
importance sampler in a penalized maximum likelihood framework which produces
more accurate and computationally efficient parameter estimates. Simulation
studies in three different models illustrate promising improvements of the new
penalized simulated maximum likelihood method. The new procedure is designed
for the challenging case when some state variables are unobserved and moreover,
observed states are sparse over time, which commonly arises in ecological
studies. We apply this new approach to two epidemics of chronic wasting disease
in mule deer.
