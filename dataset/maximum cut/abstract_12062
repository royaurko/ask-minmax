Through the measurements of magnetic field dependence of specific heat in
$La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ in zero temperature limit, we find that the nodal slope
$v_\Delta$ of the superconducting gap has a very similar doping dependence of
the pseudogap temperature $T^*$ or value $\Delta_p$. Meanwhile the maximum
quasiparticle gap derived from $v_\Delta$ is quite close to $T^*$. Both
indicate a close relationship between the pseudogap and superconductivity. It
is also found that $T_c \approx \beta v_\Delta \gamma_n(0)$, where
$\gamma_n(0)$ is the extracted zero temperature value of the normal state
specific heat coefficient which is proportional to the size of the residual
Fermi arc $k_{arc}$. These observations mimic the key predictions of the SU(2)
slave boson theory based on the general resonating-valence-bond (RVB) picture.
