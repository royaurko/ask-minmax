A magnet designed for use in a magnetic refrigeration device is presented.
The magnet is designed by applying two general schemes for improving a magnet
design to a concentric Halbach cylinder magnet design and dimensioning and
segmenting this design in an optimum way followed by the construction of the
actual magnet. The final design generates a peak value of 1.24 T, an average
flux density of 0.9 T in a volume of 2 L using only 7.3 L of magnet, and has an
average low flux density of 0.08 T also in a 2 L volume. The working point of
all the permanent magnet blocks in the design is very close to the maximum
energy density. The final design is characterized in terms of a performance
parameter, and it is shown that it is one of the best performing magnet designs
published for magnetic refrigeration.
