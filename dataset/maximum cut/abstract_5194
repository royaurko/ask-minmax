We use our current understanding of the all-order singularity structure of
gauge theory amplitudes to probe their high-energy limit. Our starting point is
the dipole formula, a compact ansatz for the soft anomalous dimension matrix of
massless multi-particle amplitudes. In the high-energy limit, we find a simple
and general expression for the infrared factor generating all soft and
collinear singularities of the amplitude, which is valid to leading power in
$|t|/s$ and to all logarithmic orders. This leads to a direct and general proof
of leading-logarithmic Reggeization for infrared divergent contributions to the
amplitude. Furthermore, we can prove explicitly that the simplest form of
Reggeization, based on the absence of Regge cuts in the complex angular
momentum plane, breaks down at the NNLL level. Finally, we note that the known
features of the high-energy limit can be used to constrain possible corrections
to the dipole formula, starting at the three-loop order.
