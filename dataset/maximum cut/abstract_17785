The Grundy number of a graph is the maximum number of colors used by the
greedy coloring algorithm over all vertex orderings. In this paper, we study
the computational complexity of GRUNDY COLORING, the problem of determining
whether a given graph has Grundy number at least $k$. We show that GRUNDY
COLORING can be solved in time $O^*(2.443^n)$ on graphs of order $n$. While the
problem is known to be solvable in time $f(k,w)\cdot n$ for graphs of treewidth
$w$, we prove that under the Exponential Time Hypothesis, it cannot be computed
in time $O^*(c^{w})$, for any constant $c$. We also study the parameterized
complexity of GRUNDY COLORING parameterized by the number of colors, showing
that it is in FPT for graphs including chordal graphs, claw-free graphs, and
graphs excluding a fixed minor. Finally, we consider two previously studied
variants of GRUNDY COLORING, namely WEAK GRUNDY COLORING and CONNECTED GRUNDY
COLORING. We show that WEAK GRUNDY COLORING is fixed-parameter tractable with
respect to the weak Grundy number. In stark contrast, it turns out that
checking whether a given graph has connected Grundy number at least $k$ is
NP-complete already for $k=7$.
