The well-known Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds model for riffle shuffles assumes that
the cards are initially cut 'about in half' and then riffled together. We
analyze a natural variant where the initial cut is biased. Extending results of
Fulman (1998), we show a sharp cutoff in separation and L-infinity distances.
This analysis is possible due to the close connection between shuffling and
quasisymmetric functions along with some complex analysis of a generating
function.
