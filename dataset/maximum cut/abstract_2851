We test accurate models of Comptonization spectra over the high quality data
of the BeppoSAX long look at NGC 5548. The data are well represented by a plane
parallel corona with an inclination angle of 30$^{\circ}$, a soft photon
temperature of 5 eV and a hot plasma temperature and optical depth of $kT_{\rm
e}\simeq$ 360 keV and $\tau\simeq$ 0.1, respectively. If energy balance
applies, such values suggest that a more ``photon-starved'' geometry (e.g. a
hemispheric region) is necessary. The spectral softening detected during a
flare, appears to be associated to a decrease of the heating-to-cooling ratio,
indicating a geometric and/or energetic modification of the disk plus corona
system. The hot plasma temperature derived with the models above is
significantly higher than that obtained fitting the same data with a power law
plus high energy cut off model for the continuum. This is due to the fact that
in anisotropic geometries Comptonization spectra show "intrinsic" curvature
which moves the fitted high energy cut-off to higher energies.
