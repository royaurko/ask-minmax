In this note we give a simplified ordinal analysis of first-order reflection.
An ordinal notation system $OT$ is introduced based on psi-functions, and a
wellfoundedness proof of it is done in terms of distinguished classes. Provable
Sigma_{1}-sentences on L_{omega_{1}^{CK}} are bounded through cut-elimination
on operator controlled derivations.
