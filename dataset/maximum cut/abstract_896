We study the Interacting Logarithmic Entropy-Corrected Holographic Dark
Energy model with different cut-offs in Brans-Dicke cosmology and obtain the
equation of state and the squared of sound speed for each cut-off. The former
is used to describe the accelerating or decelerating behaviour and the later is
used to describe the classical stability or instability of the universe. The
correspondence between the scalar field models and the logarithmic
entropy-corrected holographic dark energy densities allows us to reconstruct
the potentials and the dynamics of the quintessence and tachyon scalar field
models in Brans-Dicke cosmology. We show that these models can describe the
observed accelerated expansion of our universe with a parameter space
consistent with the most recent observational data. However, it turns out that
there is fine-tuning problem concerning the value of Brans-Dicke parameter
$\omega$ at early universe which casts doubt on the viability of these dark
energy models.
