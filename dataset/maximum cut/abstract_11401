Thermal and ionization structures of self-similar, magnetically-driven disk
winds obtained in a companion paper \cite{Garcia2001a} are used to compute a
series of jet synthetic observations. These include spatially resolved
forbidden line emission maps, long-slit spectra, as well as line ratios. Line
profiles and jet widths appear to be good tracers of the wind dynamics and
collimation, whereas line ratios essentially trace gas excitation conditions.
  All the above diagnostics are confronted to observations of T Tauri star
microjets. Convolution by the observing beam is shown to be essential for a
meaningful test of the models. We find that jet widths and qualitative
variations in line profiles with both distance and line tracers are well
reproduced. A low-velocity [\ion{O}{i}] component is also obtained, originating
from the disk wind base. However, this component is too weak, predicted maximum
velocities are too high and electronic and total densities are too low. Denser
and slower magnetized winds, launched from disks with warm chromospheres, might
resolve these discrepancies.
