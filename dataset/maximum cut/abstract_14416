Wind topographically forced by hills and sand dunes accelerates on the upwind
(stoss) slopes and reduces on the downwind (lee) slopes. This secondary wind
regime, however, possesses a subtle effect, reported here for the first time
from field measurements of near-surface wind velocity over a low dune: the wind
velocity close to the surface reaches its maximum upwind of the crest. Our
field-measured data show that this upwind phase shift of velocity with respect
to topography is found to be in quantitative agreement with the prediction of
hydrodynamical linear analysis for turbulent flows with first order closures.
This effect, together with sand transport spatial relaxation, is at the origin
of the mechanisms of dune initiation, instability and growth.
