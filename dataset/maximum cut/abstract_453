We explore the constant intensity cut method that is widely used for the
derivation of the cosmic ray energy spectrum, for comparisons of data obtained
at different atmospheric depths, for measuring average shower profiles, and for
estimates of the proton-air cross section from extensive air shower data. The
constant intensity cut method is based on the selection of air showers by
charged particle or muon size and therefore is subject to intrinsic shower
fluctuations. We demostrate that, depending on the selection method, shower
fluctuations can strongly influence the characteristics of the selected
showers. Furthermore, a mixture of different primaries in the cosmic ray flux
complicates the interpretation of measurements based on the method of constant
intensity cuts. As an example we consider data published by the Akeno
Collaboration. The interpretation of the Akeno measurements suggests that more
than 60-70% of cosmic ray primaries in the energy range 10^{16}-19^{17} eV are
heavy nuclei. Our conclusions depend only weakly on the hadronic interaction
model chosen to perform the simulations, namely SIBYLL and QGSjet.
