Let $S$ be a compact hyperbolic Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 2$. We call
a systole a shortest simple closed geodesic in $S$ and denote by
$\mathop{sys}(S)$ its length. Let $\mathop{msys(g)}$ be the maximal value that
$\mathop{sys}(\cdot)$ can attain among the compact Riemann surfaces of genus
$g$. We call a (globally) maximal surface $S_{max}$ a compact Riemann surface
of genus $g$ whose systole has length $\mathop{msys}(g)$. In Section 2 we use
cutting and pasting techniques to construct compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces
with large systoles from maximal surfaces. This enables us to prove several
inequalities relating $\mathop{msys}(\cdot)$ of different genera. In Section 3
we derive similar intersystolic inequalities for non-compact hyperbolic Riemann
surfaces with cusps.
