We report molecular-dynamics simulations on a three-dimensional two-component
Lennard-Jones fluid. We identify two distinct static length scales. The longer
length scale, which diverges at low temperatures, is continuous with the
high-temperature static correlation length. The shorter length scale reflects
static clusters that form below a T_mc of approximately 2 well above an
apparent melting point T_m of approximately 1.08. We partially visualize the
clusters; their maximum radius is temperature-independent. Cluster static and
dynamic properties match Kivelson's model (S. A. Kivelson, et al., J. Chem.
Phys. 101, 2391 (1994)) for frustration-limited cluster-forming glasses.
