Aims: We study the Galactic large-scale synchrotron emission by generating a
reliable all-sky spectral index map and temperature map at 45 MHz. Methods: We
use our observations, the published all-sky map at 408 MHz, and a
bibliographical compilation to produce a map corrected for zero-level offset
and extragalactic contribution. Results: We present full sky maps of the
Galactic emission at 45 MHz and the Galactic spectral index between 45 and 408
MHz with an angular resolution of 5\degs. The spectral index varies between 2.1
and 2.7, reaching values below 2.5 at low latitude because of thermal free-free
absorption and its maximum in the zone next to the Northern Spur.
