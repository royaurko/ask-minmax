Two particle correlation measurements in heavy ion collisions at RHIC have
shown an extended near side correlation in $\Delta\eta$ relative to p+p for
both, momentum triggered and untriggered analyses. This phenomenon is also
known as the "ridge". An investigation into the momentum and centrality
dependence of two particle correlations is presented for Cu+Cu 200 GeV
collisions from the STAR experiment. We extract the amplitude, $\Delta\eta$ and
$\Delta\phi$ widths from the near side correlation structure, and show how its
parameters depend on centrality and the lower transverse momentum cut-off.
Implications for the origin of the ridge will be discussed.
