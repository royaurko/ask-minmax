Relativistic integral representation in terms of experimental neutron-proton
scattering phase shifts is used to compute the charge form factor of the
deuteron $ G_{Cd}(Q^2)$. The results of numerical calculations of
$|G_{Cd}(Q^2)|$ are presented in the interval of the four-momentum transfers
squared $0 \leq Q^2 \leq 35 fm^{-2}$. Zero and the prominent secondary maximum
in $|G_{Cd}(Q^2)|$ are the direct consequences of the change of sign in the
experimental $^3S_1 $- phase shifts. Till the point $Q^2 \simeq 20 fm^{-2}$ the
calculated total relativistic correction to $|G_{Cd}(Q^2)|$ is positive and
reaches the maximal value of 25% at $Q^2 \simeq 14 fm^{-2}$.
