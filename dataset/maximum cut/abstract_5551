The optical transmission and reflection in between two metalized optical
fiber tips is studied in the optical near-field and far-field domains. Besides
aluminum-coated tips for near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM),
specifically developed gold-coated fiber tips cut by focused ion beam (FIB) are
investigated. Transverse transmission maps of sub-wavelength width clearly
evidence optical near-field coupling between the tips for short tip distances
and becomes essentially Gaussian-shaped for larger distances in the far-field
regime. Moreover concentric reflection fringes observed for NSOM-type tips
illustrate the influence of the receiving fiber tip on the emission pattern of
the source tip.
