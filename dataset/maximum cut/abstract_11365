Rotational curves are measured for almost complete sample of 308 northern
spiral galaxies using the 6-m telescope. For observations we selected edge-on
galaxies from RFGC catalog with apparent axial ratio a/b>8, angular diameter
a<2', and declinations delta>+38deg above the Arecibo belt. About 97% of the
galaxies are detected in the H-alpha line. For them a typical rotation curve
extends till 87% of the standard galaxy radius. The rotation curve amplitude
shows close correlation with a width of the HI line. The median radial velocity
for the galaxies is 7800 km/sec, and the median maximum of the rotation curves
is 137 km/s. These new observational data will be used to study cosmic
streamings of galaxies seen on a scale of 200 Mpc.
