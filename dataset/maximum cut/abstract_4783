We compute the O(alpha_s) QCD corrections to charged triple vector boson
production at a hadron collider, i.e. the processes pp -> ZZW + X and pp -> WWW
+ X. Intermediate Higgs boson exchange effects, spin correlations from leptonic
vector boson decays, and off-shell contributions are all taken into account.
Results are implemented in a fully flexible Monte Carlo program that allows for
an easy customization of kinematical cuts and variation of the factorization
and renormalization scales. We analyze the dependence of the differential cross
sections under scale variations and present distributions where the QCD
corrections strongly modify the leading-order results.
