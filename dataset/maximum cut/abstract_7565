$K\pi$ $S$ wave scattering is studied using a chiral unitary approach (ChUT)
taking into account coupled channels. With the amplitudes derived from the
lowest order chiral Lagrangian as the kernel of a set of coupled channel
Bathe-Salpeter equations, the $I=1/2$ $S$ wave $K\pi$ scattering phase shifts
below 1.2 GeV can be fitted by one parameter, a subtraction constant, and a
scalar resonance corresponding to the controversial $\kappa$ ($K^*_0(800)$) can
be generated dynamically. A good description of the $I=3/2$ $S$ wave $K\pi$
scattering phase shifts below 1.2 GeV can also be obtained. An artificial
singularity in the conventional cut-off method of the 2-meson loop integral of
the ChUT is found. The formalism is applied to deal with the $S$ wave $K\pi$
final state interaction (FSI) in the decay $J/\psi\to {\bar
K}^{*0}(892)K^+\pi^-$, and a qualitatively good fit to the data is achieved.
The role of $\kappa$ in the decay is discussed.
