We show that the star counts in the spheroid of the Milky Way are not
symmetric about the l=0, l=180 deg. plane. The minimum counts are found towards
l=155 deg. The Galactic longitude of maximum star counts depends on the
magnitude and color selection of the halo stars. We interpret this as evidence
that the spheroid population is triaxial with a major axis oriented 65 deg from
the line of sight from the Sun to the Galactic center, and approximately
perpendicular to the Galactic bar. Large local star concentrations from tidal
debris and possible tidal debris are also observed. A full understanding of the
Galactic spheroid population awaits position information and three dimensional
space velocities for a representative set of stars in every substructure.
Tangential velocities for many stars will be provided by current and planned
astrometry missions, but no planned mission will measure stars faint enough to
unravel the more distant parts of the spheroid, which contain the majority of
the spatial substructure. This paper uses data from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) public data release DR3.
