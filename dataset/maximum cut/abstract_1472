Let $A(G)$ be the adjacency matrix of a graph $G$ with $\lambda_{1}(G)$,
$\lambda_{2}(G)$, ..., $\lambda_{n}(G)$ being its eigenvalues in non-increasing
order. Call the number $S_k(G):=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}^k(G) (k=0,1,...,n-1)$
the $k$th spectral moment of $G$. Let $S(G)=(S_0(G),S_1(G),...,S_{n-1}(G))$ be
the sequence of spectral moments of $G$. For two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, we
have $G_1\prec_sG_2$ if $S_i(G_1)=S_i(G_2) (i=0,1,...,k-1)$ and
$S_k(G_1)<S_k(G_2)$ for some $k\in {1,2,...,n-1}$. Denote by $\mathscr{G}_n^k$
the set of connected $n$-vertex graphs with $k$ cut edges. In this paper, we
determine the first, the second, the last and the second last graphs, in an
$S$-order, among $\mathscr{G}_n^k$, respectively.
