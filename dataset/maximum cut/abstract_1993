The angular two-point correlation function is calculated for the first 300
square degrees of the FIRST radio survey. Results for various subsamples are
also obtained. Double-lobed sources are shown to have a higher clustering
amplitude than the sample as a whole. Small differences in the correlation
function from one region of the sample to another and results of various flux
cuts are discussed.
