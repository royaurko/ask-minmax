The lowest energy configurations of short odd open chains with classical
spins are determined for antiferromagnetic bilinear and biquadratic
nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. The zero field residual magnetization
generates differences with the magnetic behavior of even chains, as the odd
chain is like a small magnet for weak magnetic fields. The lowest energy
configuration is calculated as a function of the total magnetization M, even
for M less than the zero field residual magnetization. Analytic expressions and
their proofs are provided for the threshold magnetic field needed to drive the
system away from the antiferromagnetic configuration and the spin polar angles
in its vicinity, when the biquadratic interaction is relatively weak. They are
also given for the saturation magnetic field and the spin polar angles close to
it. Finally, an analytic expression along with its proof is given for the
maximum magnetization in zero magnetic field for stronger biquadratic
interaction, where the lowest energy configuration is highly degenerate.
