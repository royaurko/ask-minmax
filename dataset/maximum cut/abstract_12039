Electrical spin injection from the Heusler alloy Co_2MnGe into a p-i-n
Al_0.1Ga_0.9As/GaAs light emitting diode is demonstrated. A maximum
steady-state spin polarization of approximately 13% at 2 K is measured in two
types of heterostructures. The injected spin polarization at 2 K is calculated
to be 27% based on a calibration of the spin detector using Hanle effect
measurements. Although the dependence on electrical bias conditions is
qualitatively similar to Fe-based spin injection devices of the same design,
the spin polarization injected from Co_2MnGe decays more rapidly with
increasing temperature.
