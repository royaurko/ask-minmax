We report on the first XMM-Newton observation of the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar
1RXS J170849.0-400910. The source was observed in 2003 August and was found at
a flux level a factor of about two lower than previous observations. Moreover,
a significant spectral evolution appears to be present, the source exhibiting a
much softer spectrum than in the past. Comparison of the present properties of
1RXS J170849.0-400910 with those from archival data shows a clear correlation
between the X-ray flux and the spectral hardness. In particular, the flux and
the spectral hardness reached a maximum level close to the two glitches the
source experienced in 1999 and in 2001, and successively decreased. Although
the excellent XMM-Newton spectral resolution should in principle allow us to
detect the absorption line reported in a phase-resolved spectrum with BeppoSAX
and interpreted as a cyclotron feature, we found no absorption features,
neither in the phase averaged spectrum nor in the phase resolved spectra. We
discuss in detail both the possibilities that the feature in the BeppoSAX data
may have resulted from a spurious detection or that it is real and
intrinsically variable. We then discuss a possible explanation for the glitches
and for the softening of the source emission which followed the flux decrease,
in the framework of the magnetar model.
