Dynamical simulations are a fundamental tool for studying the secular
evolution of disc galaxies. Even at their maximum resolution, they still follow
a limited number of particles and typically resolve scales of the order of a
few tens of parsecs. Generally, the spatial resolution is defined by (some
multiple of) the softening length, whose value is set as a compromise between
the desired resolution and the need for limiting small-scale noise. Several
works have studied the question whether a softening scale fixed in space and
time provides a good enough modelling of an astrophysical system. Here we
address this question within the context of dynamical simulations and disc
instabilities. We first follow the evolution of a galaxy-like object in
isolation and then set up a simulation of an idealised merger event. Alongside
a run using the standard fixed-softening approach, we performed simulations
where the softening lengths were let to vary from particle to particle
according to the evolution of the local density field in space and time. Even
though during the most violent phases of the merging the fixed-softening
simulation tends to underestimate the resulting matter densities, as far as the
evolution of the disc component is concerned we found no significant
differences among the runs. We conclude that using an appropriate fixed
softening scale is a safe approach to the problem of modelling an N-body,
non-cosmological disc galaxy system.
