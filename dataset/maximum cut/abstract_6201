The contributors Mili$\breve{c}$evi$\acute{c}$ et al. introduced the reformulated
Zagreb indices, which is a generalization of classical Zagreb indices of
chemical graph theory. In the paper, we characterize the extremal properties of
the first reformulated Zagreb index. We first introduce some graph operations
which increase or decrease this index. Furthermore, we will determine the
extremal tricyclic graphs with minimum and maximum the first Zagreb index by
these graph operations.
