The Coulomb effects hypothesis is used to interpret even-odd effects of
maximum total kinetic energy as a function of mass and charge of fragments from
thermal neutron induced fission of 235U. Assuming spherical fragments at
scission, the Coulomb interaction energy between fragments (C_sph) is higher
than the Q-value, the available energy. Therefore at scission the fragments
must be deformed, so that the Coulomb interaction energy does not exceed the
Q-value. The fact that the even-odd effects in the maximum total kinetic energy
as a function of the charge and mass, respectively, are lower than the even-odd
effects of Q is consistent with the assumption that odd mass fragments are
softer than the even-even fragments. Even-odd effects of charge distribution in
super asymmetric fragmentation also are interpreted with the Coulomb effect
hypothesis. Because the difference between C_sph and Q increases with
asymmetry, fragmentations require higher total deformation energy to occur.
Higher deformation energy of the fragments implies lower free energy to break
pairs of nucleons. This explains why in the asymmetric fragmentation region,
the even-odd effects of the distribution of proton number and neutron number
increases with asymmetry. Based on a similar reasoning, a prediction of a
relatively high even-odd effect in symmetric fragmentations is proposed.
