In this letter the performance of multiple relay channels is analyzed for the
situation in which multiple antennas are deployed only at the relays. The
simple repetition-coded decodeand- forward protocol with two different antenna
processing techniques at the relays is investigated. The antenna combining
techniques are maximum ratio combining (MRC) for reception and transmit
beamforming (TB) for transmission. It is shown that these distributed antenna
combining techniques can exploit the full spatial diversity of the relay
channels regardless of the number of relays and antennas at each relay, and
offer significant power gain over distributed space-time coding techniques.
