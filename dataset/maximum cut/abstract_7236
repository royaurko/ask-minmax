We extend and correct a recently proposed maximum-likelihood halo-independent
method to analyze unbinned direct dark matter detection data. Instead of the
recoil energy as independent variable we use the minimum speed a dark matter
particle must have to impart a given recoil energy to a nucleus. This has the
advantage of allowing us to apply the method to any type of target composition
and interaction, e.g. with general momentum and velocity dependence, and with
elastic or inelastic scattering. We prove the method and provide a rigorous
statistical interpretation of the results. As first applications, we find that
for dark matter particles with elastic spin-independent interactions and
neutron to proton coupling ratio $f_n/f_p=-0.7$, the WIMP interpretation of the
signal observed by CDMS-II-Si is compatible with the constraints imposed by all
other experiments with null results. We also find a similar compatibility for
exothermic inelastic spin-independent interactions with $f_n/f_p=-0.8$.
