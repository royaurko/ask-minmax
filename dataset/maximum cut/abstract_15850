We have mapped the dense gas distribution and dynamics in the NW region of
the Serpens molecular cloud in the CS(2-1) and N2H+(1-0) lines and 3 mm
continuum using the FCRAO telescope and BIMA interferometer. 7 continuum
sources are found. The N2H+ spectra are optically thin and fits to the 7
hyperfine components are used to determine the distribution of velocity
dispersion. 8 cores, 2 with continuum sources, 6 without, lie at a local
linewidth minimum and optical depth maximum. The CS spectra are optically thick
and generally self-absorbed over the full 0.2 pc extent of the map. We use the
line wings to trace outflows around at least 3, and possibly 4, of the
continuum sources, and the asymmetry in the self-absorption as a diagnostic of
relative motions between core centers and envelopes. The quiescent regions with
low N2H+ linewidth tend to have more asymmetric CS spectra than the spectra
around the continuum sources indicating higher infall speeds. These regions
have typical sizes ~5000 AU, linewidths ~0.5 km/s, and infall speeds ~0.05
km/s. The correlation of CS asymmetry with N2H+ velocity dispersion suggests
that the inward flows of material that build up pre-protostellar cores are
driven at least partly by a pressure gradient rather than by gravity alone. We
discuss a scenario for core formation and eventual star forming collapse
through the dissipation of turbulence.
