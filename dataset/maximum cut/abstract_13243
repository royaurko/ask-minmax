Recent works by Brown et al and Borras et al have explored numerical
optimisation procedures to search for highly entangled multi-qubit states
according to some computationally tractable entanglement measure. We present an
alternative scheme based upon the idea of searching for states having not only
high entanglement but also simple algebraic structure. We report results for 4,
5, 6, 7 and 8 qubits discovered by this approach, showing that many of such
states do exist. In particular, we find a maximally entangled 6-qubit state
with an algebraic structure simpler than the best results known so far. For the
case of 7, we discover states with high, but not maximum, entanglement and
simple structure, as well as other desirable properties. Some preliminary
results are shown for the case of 8 qubits.
