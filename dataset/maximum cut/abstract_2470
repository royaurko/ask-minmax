Following our recent theoretical and experimental results that show how
zero-permittivity metamaterials may provide anomalous tunneling and energy
squeezing through ultranarrow waveguide channels, here we report an
experimental investigation of the bending features relative to this
counterintuitive resonant effect. We generate the required effectively-zero
permittivity using a waveguide operating at the cut-off of its dominant mode,
and we show how sharp and narrow bends may be inserted within the propagation
channel without causing any sensible reflection or loss.
