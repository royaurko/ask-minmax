The discovery (Liang & Kargatis 1996), that the peak energy of time-resolved
spectra of gamma-ray burst (GRB) pulses decays exponentially with fluence, is
analytically shown to imply that the time-integrated photon number spectrum of
a pulse should have a unique shape, given by an underlying E^-1 behavior. We
also show that the asymptotic low energy normalization of the time-integrated
spectrum is equal to the exponential decay constant. We study analytically how
this general behavior is modified in more realistic situations and show that
diversity is then introduced in the properties of time-integrated GRB pulse
spectra. We argue that further diversity will occur in time-integrated
multi-pulse (complex) GRB spectra. The total energy received per cm^2 is
approximately the decay constant times the maximum peak energy of the pulse.
Our analytical results connect the properties of the time-integrated pulse
spectrum with those of the time-resolved spectra, and can thus be used when
studying observed GRB pulse spectra. We illustrate with the bright burst GRB
910807 and comment on GRB 910525 and GRB 921207.
