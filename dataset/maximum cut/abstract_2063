The single parameter scaling hypothesis is the foundation of our
understanding of the Anderson transition. However, the conductance of a
disordered system is a fluctuating quantity which does not obey a one parameter
scaling law. It is essential to investigate the scaling of the full conductance
distribution to establish the scaling hypothesis. We present a clear cut
numerical demonstration that the conductance distribution indeed obeys one
parameter scaling near the Anderson transition.
