We present the results from the discovery and study of ~3000
chromospherically active giant and subgiant stars toward the Galactic bulge. We
find that these stars are predominantly RS CVn binaries with rotation periods
between 10 and 100 days. We discover that the average rotational period of
these stars decreases with their distance from the Galactic plane. We find that
the primary stars in the RS CVn systems are predominantly first-ascent giants.
Our research also suggests that, if these stars have spot cycles like the sun,
then the cycle period must be longer than 10 years on average. We confirm that
the amplitude of the spot-induced modulations observed in the light curves of
these objects is generally larger at minimum light than at maximum.
Furthermore, we confirm that the amplitudes of the modulations due to stellar
spots generally increases as the observed change in average brightness
increases. We find no evidence for a relationship between a CA star's
brightness and its rotational period. However, the average period does increase
with colour for stars with periods >~30 days.
