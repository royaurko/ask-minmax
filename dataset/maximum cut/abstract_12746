We consider the maximum bipartite entanglement that can be distilled from a
single copy of a multipartite mixed entangled state, where we focus mostly on
$d\times d\times n$-dimensional tripartite mixed states. We show that this {\em
assisted entanglement}, when measured in terms of the generalized concurrence
(named G-concurrence) is (tightly) bounded by an entanglement monotone, which
we call the G-concurrence of assistance. The G-concurrence is one of the
possible generalizations of the concurrence to higher dimensions, and for pure
bipartite states it measures the {\em geometric mean} of the Schmidt numbers.
For a large (non-trivial) class of $d\times d$-dimensional mixed states, we are
able to generalize Wootters formula for the concurrence into lower and upper
bounds on the G-concurrence. Moreover, we have found an explicit formula for
the G-concurrence of assistance that generalizes the expression for the
concurrence of assistance for a large class of $d\times d\times n$ dimensional
tripartite pure states.
