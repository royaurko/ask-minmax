The Solar Maximum Mission satellite's Gamma Ray Spectrometer observed Earth's
atmosphere for most of the period 1980-1989. Its 28deg orbit ensured that a
range of geomagnetic latitudes (geomagnetic cutoff rigidities) was sampled. We
measured the variation with time and rigidity of albedo gamma-ray lines at 1.6
MeV, 2.3 MeV and 4.4 MeV which are diagnostic of Galactic cosmic radiation
penetrating the cutoff and of the secondary neutrons produced in the
atmosphere. We found that the gamma-ray line intensities varied inversely with
solar activity and cutoff rigidity, as expected. The line ratio (1.6 MeV + 2.3
MeV)/4.4 MeV was remarkably constant (close to 0.39) at all times and
rigidities; the former two lines are produced by 5-10 MeV secondary neutrons
causing excitation and de-excitation of 14N, while the latter is produced by
more energetic (>20 MeV) neutrons inducing spallation. We infer that the shape
of the secondary neutron energy spectrum is virtually constant everywhere and
at all times. We also measured the intensity of the 0.511 MeV electron-positron
annihilation line. This line too varies with solar cycle and cutoff rigidity,
but its fall-off from low to high rigidity is less marked than that of the
nuclear lines. This results from the energy dependences of the cross sections
for positron production and for the hadronic processes which which produce
secondary neutrons.
