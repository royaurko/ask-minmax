In a previous paper $[$B,V-1$]$, an algebra of holomorphic ``perikernels''
on a complexified hyperboloid $ X^{(c)}_{d-1} $ (in $\Bbb  C^d)$ has been
introduced; each perikernel $ {\cal K} $ can be seen as the analytic
continuation of a kernel $ {\bf K} $ on the unit sphere $ \Bbb S^{d-1} $ in an
appropriate ``cut-domain'' , while the jump of $ {\cal K} $ across the
corresponding ``cut'' defines a Volterra kernel $ K $ (in the sense of J.
Faraut $\lbrack$Fa-1$\rbrack$) on the one-sheeted hyperboloid $ X_{d-1} $ (in $
\Bbb R^d). $ \par In the present paper, we obtain results of harmonic analysis
for classes of perikernels which are invariant under the group $ {\rm
SO}(d,\Bbb C) $ and of moderate growth at infinity. For each perikernel $ {\cal
K} $ in such a class, the Fourier-Legendre coefficients of the corresponding
kernel $ {\bf K} $ on $ \Bbb S^{d-1} $ admit a carlsonian analytic
interpolation $ \tilde F(\lambda) $ in a half-plane, which is the ``spherical
Laplace transform''\ of the associated Volterra kernel $K$ on $ X_{d-1}. $
Moreover, the composition law $ {\cal K }= {\cal K}_1\ast^{( c)}{\cal K}_2 $
for perikernels (interpreted in terms of convolutions for the
