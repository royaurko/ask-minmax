The first geometric-arithmetic (GA) index and atom-bond connectivity (ABC)
index are molecular structure descriptors which play a significant role in
quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) and quantitative
structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. Das and Trinajsti\'{c}
[\textit{Chem. Phys. Lett.} \textbf{497} (2010) 149-151] showed that $GA$ index
is greater than $ABC$ index for all those graphs (except $K_{1,4}$ and $T^{*}$,
see Figure 1) in which the difference between maximum and minimum degree is
less than or equal to 3. In this note, it is proved that $GA$ index is greater
than $ABC$ index for line graphs of molecular graphs, for general graphs in
which the difference between maximum and minimum degree is less than or equal
to $(2\delta-1)^{2}$ (where $\delta$ is the minimum degree and $\delta\geq2$)
and for some families of trees. Thereby, a partial solution to an open problem
proposed by Das and Trinajsti\'{c} is given.
