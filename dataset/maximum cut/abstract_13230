At variance with the contributors' statement [L. P\'{a}lov\'{a}, P. Chandra and P.
Coleman, Phys. Rev. B 79, 075101 (2009)], we show that the behavior of the
universal scaling amplitude of the gap function in the phonon dispersion
relation as a function of the dimensionality $d$, obtained within a
self--consistent one--loop approach, is consistent with some previous
analytical results obtained in the framework of the $\epsilon$--expansion in
conjunction with the field theoretic renormalization group method [S. Sachdev,
Phys. Rev. B 55, 142 (1997)] and the exact calculations corresponding to the
spherical limit i.e. infinite number $N$ of the components of the order
parameter [H. Chamati. and N. S. Tonchev, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 33, 873
(2000)]. Furthermore we determine numerically the behavior of the "temporal"
Casimir amplitude as a function of the dimensionality $d$ between the lower and
upper critical dimension and found a maximum at $d=2.9144$. This is confirmed
via an expansion near the upper dimension $d=3$.
