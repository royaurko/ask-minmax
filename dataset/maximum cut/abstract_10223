The Luria-Delbr\"uck distribution is a classical model of mutations in cell
kinetics. It is obtained as a limit when the probability of mutation tends to
zero and the number of divisions to infinity. It can be interpreted as a
compound Poisson distribution (for the number of mutations) of exponential
mixtures (for the developing time of mutant clones) of geometric distributions
(for the number of cells produced by a mutant clone in a given time). The
probabilistic interpretation, and a rigourous proof of convergence in the
general case, are deduced from classical results on Bellman-Harris branching
processes. The two parameters of the Luria-Delbr\"uck distribution are the
expected number of mutations, which is the parameter of interest, and the
relative fitness of normal cells compared to mutants, which is the heavy tail
exponent. Both can be simultaneously estimated by the maximum likehood method.
However, the computation becomes numerically unstable as soon as the maximal
value of the sample is large, which occurs frequently due to the heavy tail
property. Based on the empirical generating function, robust estimators are
proposed and their asymptotic variance is given. They are comparable in
precision to maximum likelihood estimators, with a much broader range of
calculability, a better numerical stability, and a negligible computing time.
