High magnetic field studies of the cuprate superconductors revealed a non-BCS
temperature dependence of the upper critical field $H_{c2}(T)$ determined
resistively by several groups. These determinations caused some doubts on the
grounds of the contrasting effect of the magnetic field on the in-plane,
$\rho_{ab}$, and out-of-plane, $\rho_{c}$ resistances reported for large sample
of Bi2212. Here we present careful measurements of both $\rho_{ab}(B)$ and
$\rho_{c}(B)$ of tiny Bi2212 crystals in magnetic fields up to 50 Tesla. None
of our measurements revealed a situation when on field increase $\rho_c$
reaches its maximum while $\rho_{ab}$ remains very small if not zero. The
resistive $H_{c2}(T)$ estimated from $\rho_{ab}(B)$ and $\rho_{c}(B)$ are
approximately the same. We also present a simple explanation of the unusual
Nernst signal in superconducting cuprates as a normal state phenomenon. Our
results support any theory of cuprates, which describes the state above the
resistive phase transition as perfectly 'normal' with a zero off-diagonal order
parameter.
