Recently, it has been shown [arXiv:1106.3482] that the
two-Higgs-doublet-model potential may exhibit a maximum of 13 distinct
accidental symmetries. Such a classification is based on a six-dimensional
bilinear scalar field formalism realizing the SO(1,5) symmetry group. This note
presents the transformation relations for each of the 13 symmetries in the
original scalar field space and their one-to-one correspondence to the space of
scalar bilinears, thereby providing firm support for the completeness of the
classification.
