The construction of X-ray generator based on a pyroelectric crystal LiNbO3 is
described. Some properties of radiation spectra from the X-ray generator are
presented. Measurements of the spectra were performed at heating and cooling of
the crystal with copper and chromium targets. The maximum energy in the X-ray
spectrum versus crystal temperature is presented.
