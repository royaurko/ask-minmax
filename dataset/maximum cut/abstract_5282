We experimentally demonstrated an alternative approach of invisibility
cloaking that can combine technical advantages of all current major cloaking
strategies in a unified manner and thus can solve bottlenecks of individual
strategies. A broadband cylindrical invisibility cloak in free space is
designed based on scattering cancellation (the approach of previous plasmonic
cloaking), and implemented with anisotropic metamaterials (a fundamental
property of singular-transformation cloaks). Particularly, non-superluminal
propagation of electromagnetic waves, a superior advantage of
non-Euclidian-transformation cloaks constructed with complex branch cuts, is
inherited in this design, and thus is the reason of its relatively broad
bandwidth. This demonstration provides the possibility for future practical
implementation of cloaking devices at large scales in free space.
