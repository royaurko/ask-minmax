Raptor codes are rateless codes that achieve the capacity on the binary
erasure channels. However the maximum degree of optimal output degree
distribution is unbounded. This leads to a computational complexity problem
both at encoders and decoders. Aref and Urbanke investigated the potential
advantage of universal achieving-capacity property of proposed
spatially-coupled (SC) low-density generator matrix (LDGM) codes. However the
decoding error probability of SC-LDGM codes is bounded away from 0. In this
paper, we investigate SC-LDGM codes concatenated with SC low-density
parity-check codes. The proposed codes can be regarded as SC Hsu-Anastasopoulos
rateless codes. We derive a lower bound of the asymptotic overhead from
stability analysis for successful decoding by density evolution. The numerical
calculation reveals that the lower bound is tight. We observe that with a
sufficiently large number of information bits, the asymptotic overhead and the
decoding error rate approach 0 with bounded maximum degree.
