For type I seesaw and in the basis where the charged lepton and heavy
right-handed neutrino mass matrices are real and diagonal, four has been shown
to be the maximum number of zeros allowed in the neutrino Yukawa coupling
matrix $Y_\nu$. These four zero textures have been classified into two distinct
categories. We investigate certain phenomenological consequences of these
textures within a supersymmetric framework. This is done by using conditions
implied on elements of the neutrino Majorana mass matrix for textures of each
category in $Y_\nu$. These conditions turn out to be stable under radiative
corrections. Including the effective mass, which appears in neutrinoless double
beta decay, along with the usual neutrino masses, mixing angles and phases, it
is shown analytically and through scatter plots how restricted regions in the
seesaw parameter space are selected by these conditions. We also make
consequential statements on the yet unobserved radiative lepton flavor
violating decays such as $\mu \to e \gamma$. All these decay amplitudes are
proportional to the moduli of entries of the neutrino Majorana mass matrix. We
also show under which conditions the low energy CP violation, showing up in
neutrino oscillations, is directly linked to the CP violation required for
producing successful flavor dependent and flavor independent lepton asymmetries
during leptogenesis.
