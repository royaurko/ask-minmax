We examine and bring out the architecturally significant characteristics of
various virtualization and cloud oriented platforms. The impact of such
characteristics on the ability of guest applications to achieve various quality
attributes (QA) has also been determined by examining existing body of
architecture knowledge. We observe from our findings that efficiency, resource
elasticity and security are among the most impacted QAs, and virtualization
platforms exhibit the maximum impact on various QAs.
