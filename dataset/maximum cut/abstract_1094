We extend the parameterization of sine-type functions in terms of conformal
mappings onto slit domains given by Eremenko and Sodin to the more general case
of generating functions of real complete interpolating sequences. It turns out
that the cuts have to fulfill the discrete Muckenhoupt condition studied
earlier by Lyubarskii and Seip.
