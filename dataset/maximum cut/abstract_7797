At a 14 TeV proton-proton collider, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), we show
that top quark pair production is dominated at low invariant mass by the fusion
of two like-helicity gluons, producing top quark pairs in the left-left or
right-right helicity configurations. Whereas, at higher invariant mass the
production is dominated by the fusion of unlike-helicity gluons, producing top
quark pairs in the up-down or down-up off-diagonal configurations, identical to
top quark pair production via quark-antiquark annihilation. We study in detail
the low invariant mass region, and show that the spin correlations can be
easily observed in this region by looking at the distribution of the difference
in the azimuthal angles, Delta-phi, of the dileptons decay products of the top
quarks in the laboratory frame. Due to the large cross section for top pair
production at the LHC, even with a cut requiring that the invariant mass of the
top quark pair be less than 400 GeV, the approximate yield would be 10^4
di-lepton (e, mu) events per fb^{-1} before detector efficiencies are applied.
Therefore, there is ample statistics to form the Delta-phi distribution of the
dilepton events, even with the invariant mass restriction. We also discuss
possibilities for observing these spin correlations in the lepton plus jets
channel.
