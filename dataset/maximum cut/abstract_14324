We present an ultra broadband thin-film infrared absorber made of saw-toothed
anisotropic metamaterial. Absorbtivity of higher than 95% at normal incidence
is supported in a wide range of frequencies, where the full absorption width at
half maximum is about 86%. Such property is retained well at a very wide range
of incident angles too. Light of shorter wavelengths are harvested at upper
parts of the sawteeth of smaller widths, while light of longer wavelengths are
trapped at lower parts of larger tooth widths. This phenomenon is explained by
the slowlight modes in anisotropic metamaterial waveguide. Our study can be
applied in the field of designing photovoltaic devices and thermal emitters.
