Understanding finite-size effects is one of the key open questions in solving
planar AdS/CFT. In this paper we discuss these effects in the AdS_5xS^5 string
theory at one-loop in the world-sheet coupling. First we provide a very
general, efficient way to compute the fluctuation frequencies, which allows to
determine the energy shift for very general multi-cut solutions. Then we apply
this to two-cut solutions, in particular the giant magnon and determine the
finite-size corrections at subleading order. The latter are then compared to
the finite-size corrections from Luscher-Klassen-Melzer formulas and found to
be in perfect agreement.
