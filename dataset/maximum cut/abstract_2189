The radiative B -> tau^+ tau^- gamma decay is investigated in the framework
of the Standard Model. When only short (short and long together) distance
contributions are taken into account, the Branching Ratio is found as
9.54x10^(-9) (1.52x10^(-8)), for the value of the cut delta = 0.01 imposed on
the photon energy.
