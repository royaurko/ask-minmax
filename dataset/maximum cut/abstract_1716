We present an attempt of maximum entropy principle to determine valence quark
distributions in the proton at very low resolution scale $Q_0^2$. The initial
three valence quark distributions are obtained with limited dynamical
information from quark model and QCD theory. Valence quark distributions from
this method are compared to the lepton deep inelastic scattering data, and the
widely used CT10 and MSTW08 data sets. The obtained valence quark distributions
are consistent with experimental observations and the latest global fits of
PDFs. Maximum entropy method is expected to be particularly useful in the case
where relatively little information from QCD calculation is given.
