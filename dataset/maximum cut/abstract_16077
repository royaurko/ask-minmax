We have obtained deep near-infrared K_s-band William Herschel Telescope
observations of a sample of 15 nearby spiral galaxies having a range of Hubble
types and apparent bar strengths. The near-infrared light distributions are
converted into gravitational potentials, and the maximum relative gravitational
torques due to the bars and the spirals are estimated. We find that spiral
strength, Q_s, and bar strength, Q_b, correlate well with other measures of
spiral arm and bar amplitudes, and that spiral and bar strengths also correlate
well with each other. We also find a correlation between the position angle of
the end of the bar and the position angle of the inner spiral. These
correlations suggest that the bars and spirals grow together with the same
rates and pattern speeds. We also show that the strongest bars tend to have the
most open spiral patterns. Because open spirals imply high disk-to-halo mass
ratios, bars and spirals most likely grow together as a combined disk
instability. They stop growing for different reasons, however, giving the
observed variation in bar-spiral morphologies. Bar growth stops because of
saturation when most of the inner disk is in the bar, and spiral growth stops
because of increased stability as the gas leaves and the outer disk heats up.
