We present new results based on the entire CHOOZ data sample. We find (at 90%
confidence level) no evidence for neutrino oscillations in the anti_nue
disappearance mode, for the parameter region given by approximately Delta m**2
> 7 x 10**-4 eV^2 for maximum mixing, and sin**2(2 theta) = 0.10 for large
Delta m**2. Lower sensitivity results, based only on the comparison of the
positron spectra from the two different-distance nuclear reactors, are also
presented; these are independent of the absolute normalization of the anti_nue
flux, the cross section, the number of target protons and the detector
efficiencies.
