Feedstock and byproduct diffusion in the root growth of aligned CNT arrays
was discussed in this work. A non-dimensional modulus was proposed to
differentiate catalyst-decay controlled growth deceleration from diffusion
controlled one. It was found that aligned MWNT arrays are usually free of
feedstock diffusion while SWNT arrays are usually facing strong diffusion
limit. The present method can also be utilized to predict the maximum length
that CNT forest can grow in certain CVD process.
