We show that for polytopes P_1, P_2, ..., P_r \subset \R^d, each having n_i
\ge d+1 vertices, the Minkowski sum P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_r cannot achieve the
maximum of \prod_i n_i vertices if r \ge d. This complements a recent result of
Fukuda & Weibel (2006), who show that this is possible for up to d-1 summands.
The result is obtained by combining methods from discrete geometry (Gale
transforms) and topological combinatorics (van Kampen--type obstructions) as
developed in R\"{o}rig, Sanyal, and Ziegler (2007).
