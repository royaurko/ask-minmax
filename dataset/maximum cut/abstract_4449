Dynamical spontaneous breaking of some discrete symmetries including special
parities and time reversal and their restoration at finite temperature T are
researched in 3D Gross-Neveu model by means of Schwinger-Dyson equation in the
real-time thermal field theory in the fermion bubble diagram approximation.
When the momentum cut-off $\Lambda$ is large enough, the equation of critical
chemical potential $\mu_c$ and critical temperature $T_c$ will be
$\Lambda$-independent and identical to the one obtained by auxialiary scalar
field approach. The dynamical fermion mass m, as the order parameter of
symmetry breaking, has the same $(T_c-T)^{1/2}$ behavior as one in 4D NJL-model
when T is less than and near $T_c$ and this shows the second-order phase
transition feature of the symmetry restoration at $T>T_c$. It is also proven
that no scalar bound state could exist in this model.
