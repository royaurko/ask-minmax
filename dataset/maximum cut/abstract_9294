We demonstrate the ultranarrow temporal correlation (6 fs full width half
maximum) of twin beams generated by parametric down-conversion, by using the
inverse process of sum-frequency generation. The result relies on an achromatic
imaging of a huge bandwith of twin beams and on a careful control of their
spatial degrees of freedom. The detrimental effects of spatial filtering and of
imperfect imaging are shown toghether with the theoretical model used to
describe the results.
