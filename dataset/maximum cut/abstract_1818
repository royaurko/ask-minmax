We propose a numerical method to learn Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) distributions
with spatio-temporal constraints from experimental spike trains. This is an
extension of two papers [10] and [4] who proposed the estimation of parameters
where only spatial constraints were taken into account. The extension we
propose allows to properly handle memory effects in spike statistics, for large
sized neural networks.
