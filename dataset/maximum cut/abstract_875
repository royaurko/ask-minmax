We present results from a recent calculation of prompt photon-pair production
in association with two jets to next-to-leading order (NLO) at the LHC. The
virtual contribution is evaluated using the BlackHat library, a numerical
implementation of on-shell methods for one-loop amplitudes, in conjunction with
SHERPA. We study four sets of cuts: standard jet cuts, a set of Higgs-related
cuts suggested by ATLAS, and corresponding sets which isolate the kinematic
region where the process becomes the largest background to Higgs production via
vector-boson fusion.
