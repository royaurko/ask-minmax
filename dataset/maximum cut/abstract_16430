Axisymmetric numerical simulations of rotating stellar core collapse to a
neutron star are performed in the framework of full general relativity. The
so-called Cartoon method, in which the Einstein field equations are solved in
the Cartesian coordinates and the axisymmetric condition is imposed around the
$y=0$ plane, is adopted. The hydrodynamic equations are solved in the
cylindrical coordinates (on the $y=0$ plane in the Cartesian coordinates) using
a high-resolution shock-capturing scheme with the maximum grid size
$(2500,2500)$. A parametric equation of state is adopted to model collapsing
stellar cores and neutron stars following Dimmelmeier et al. It is found that
the evolution of central density during the collapse, bounce, and formation of
protoneutron stars agree well with those in the work of Dimmelmeier et al. in
which an approximate general relativistic formulation is adopted. This
indicates that such approximation is appropriate for following axisymmetric
stellar core collapses and subsequent formation of protoneutron stars.
Gravitational waves are computed using a quadrupole formula. It is found that
the waveforms are qualitatively in good agreement with those by Dimmelmeier et
al. However, quantitatively, two waveforms do not agree well. Possible reasons
for the disagreement are discussed.
