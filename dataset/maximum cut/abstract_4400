We consider the color spin locking (CSL) phase of two-flavor quark matter at
zero temperature for nonlocal instantaneous, separable interactions. We employ
a Lorentzian-type form factor allowing a parametric interpolation between the
sharp (Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model) and very smooth (e.g. Gaussian) cut-off
models for systematic studies of the influence on the CSL condensate the
deviation from the NJL model entails. This smoothing of the NJL model form
factor shows advantageous features for the phenomenology of compact stars: (i)
a lowering of the critical chemical potential for the onset of the chiral phase
transition as a prerequisite for stability of hybrid stars with extended quark
matter cores and (ii) a reduction of the smallest pairing gap to the order of
100 keV, being in the range of values interesting for phenomenological studies
of hybrid star cooling evolution.
