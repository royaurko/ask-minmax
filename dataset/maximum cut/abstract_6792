We generalize the Nozi\'eres-Schmitt-Rink (NSR) method to study the repulsive
Fermi gas in the absence of molecule formation, i.e., in the so-called "upper
branch". We find that the system remains stable except close to resonance at
sufficiently low temperatures. With increasing scattering length, the energy
density of the system attains a maximum at a positive scattering length before
resonance. This is shown to arise from Pauli blocking which causes the bound
states of fermion pairs of different momenta to disappear at different
scattering lengths. At the point of maximum energy, the compressibility of the
system is substantially reduced, leading to a sizable uniform density core in a
trapped gas. The change in spin susceptibility with increasing scattering
length is moderate and does not indicate any magnetic instability. These
features should also manifest in Fermi gases with unequal masses and/or spin
populations.
