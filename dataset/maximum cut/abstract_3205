Probably No! As an example, using soft EOSs consistent with existing
terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments for hybrid neutron stars containing
a quark core described with MIT bag model using reasonable parameters, we show
that the recently discovered new holder of neutron star maximum mass PSR
J1614-2230 of $1.97\pm0.04M_{\odot}$ can be well described by incorporating a
Yukawa gravitational correction that is consistent with existing constraints
from neutron-proton and neutron-lead scatterings as well as the spectroscopy of
antiproton atoms.
