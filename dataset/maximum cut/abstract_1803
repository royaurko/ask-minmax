Motivated by the work of Chung, Claesson, Dukes, and Graham, we define a
natural type B analog of the classic bubble sort, and use it to define a type B
analog of the maximum drop statistic. We enumerate (by explicit, recursive, and
generating function formulas) signed permutations with r type B descents and
type B maximum drop at most k. We also find a connection between these signed
permutations and certain 2-colored juggling sequences.
