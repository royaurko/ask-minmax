We study an initial stage of autoresonant growth of a solution in a
dissipative system. We construct an asymptotic formula of an autoresonant germ
that is an attractor for autoresonant solutions. We present a moment of a fall
and a maximum value of the amplitude for the germ. Numerical simulations are
done.
