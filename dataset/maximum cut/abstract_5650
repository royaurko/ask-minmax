We investigate core-collapse supernova (CCSN) nucleosynthesis in polar
axisymmetric simulations using the multidimensional radiation hydrodynamics
code CHIMERA. Computational costs have traditionally constrained the evolution
of the nuclear composition in CCSN models to, at best, a 14-species
$\alpha$-network. Such a simplified network limits the ability to accurately
evolve detailed composition, neutronization and the nuclear energy generation
rate. Lagrangian tracer particles are commonly used to extend the nuclear
network evolution by incorporating more realistic networks in post-processing
nucleosynthesis calculations. Limitations such as poor spatial resolution of
the tracer particles, estimation of the expansion timescales, and determination
of the "mass-cut" at the end of the simulation impose uncertainties inherent to
this approach. We present a detailed analysis of the impact of these
uncertainties on post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations and implications
for future models.
