We analyze the renormalization of the nucleon--nucleon interaction at low
energies in coordinate space for both one and two pion exchange chiral
potentials. The singularity structure of the long range potential and the
requirement of orthogonality respectively determines, once renormalizability is
imposed, the minimum and maximum number of counterterms allowed in the
effective description of the nucleon--nucleon interaction in a non-perturbative
context.
