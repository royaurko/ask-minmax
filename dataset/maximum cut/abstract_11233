A number of recently discovered extrasolar planet candidates have
surprisingly small orbits, which may indicate that considerable orbital
migration takes place in protoplanetary systems. A natural consequence of
orbital migration is for a series of planets to be accreted, destroyed, and
then thoroughly mixed into the convective envelope of the central star. We
study the ramifications of planet accretion for the final main sequence
metallicity of the star. If maximum disk lifetimes are on the order of 10 Myr,
stars with masses near 1 solar mass are predicted to have virtually no
metallicity enhancement. On the other hand, early F and late A type stars with
masses of 1.5--2.0 solar masses can experience significant metallicity
enhancements due to their considerably smaller convection zones during the
first 10 Myr of pre-main-sequence evolution. We show that the metallicities of
an aggregate of unevolved F stars are consistent with an average star accreting
about 2 Jupiter-mass planets from a protoplanetary disk having a 10 Myr
dispersal time.
