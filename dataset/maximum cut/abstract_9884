We consider the acceleration of the permanent magnets, consisting of
neodymium iron boron by means of the running magnetic field gradient. It is
shown that the specific magnetic moment per nucleon in neodymium iron boron is
determined by the remained magnetization of the substance. The maximum
accessable gradient of the magnetic field accelerating the permanent magnets is
determined by the coercive force thirty kilogauss. For the neodymium iron boron
magnets this gradient is equal to twenty kilogauss divided by one centimeter.
The finite velocity of the magnets six kilometers per second, the length of
acceleration is six hundred thirty-seven meters.
