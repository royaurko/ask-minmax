The traditional description of high-energy small-angle scattering in QCD has
two components -- a soft Pomeron Regge pole for the tensor glueball, and a hard
BFKL Pomeron in leading order at weak coupling. On the basis of gauge/string
duality, we present a coherent treatment of the Pomeron. In large-N QCD-like
theories, we use curved-space string-theory to describe simultaneously both the
BFKL regime and the classic Regge regime. The problem reduces to finding the
spectrum of a single j-plane Schrodinger operator. For ultraviolet-conformal
theories, the spectrum exhibits a set of Regge trajectories at positive t, and
a leading j-plane cut for negative t, the cross-over point being
model-dependent. For theories with logarithmically-running couplings, one
instead finds a discrete spectrum of poles at all t, where the Regge
trajectories at positive t continuously become a set of slowly-varying and
closely-spaced poles at negative t. Our results agree with expectations for the
BFKL Pomeron at negative t, and with the expected glueball spectrum at positive
t, but provide a framework in which they are unified. Effects beyond the single
Pomeron exchange are briefly discussed.
