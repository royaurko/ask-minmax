A strong edge coloring of a graph is a proper edge coloring in which every
color class is an induced matching. The strong chromatic index $\chiup_{s}'(G)$
of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of colors in a strong edge coloring of
$G$. Let $\Delta \geq 4$ be an integer. In this note, we study the properties
of the odd graphs, and show that every planar graph with maximum degree at most
$\Delta$ and girth at least $10 \Delta - 4$ has a strong edge coloring with
$2\Delta - 1$ colors. In addition, we prove that if $G$ is a graph with girth
at least $2\Delta - 1$ and $\mad(G) < 2 + \frac{1}{3\Delta - 2}$, where $\Delta
\geq 4$, then $\chiup_{s}'(G) \leq 2\Delta - 1$; if $G$ is a subcubic graph
with girth at least $8$ and $\mad(G) < 2 + \frac{2}{23}$, then $\chiup_{s}'(G)
\leq 5$.
