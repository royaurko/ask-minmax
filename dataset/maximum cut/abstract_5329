Production of leading neutrons in DIS is usually considered as a tool to
measure the pion structure function at small x accessible at HERA. The main
obstacle is the lack of reliable evaluations of the absorption corrections,
which significantly suppress the cross section. We performed a parameter free
calculation within the dipole approach and found the absorption corrections to
be nearly as strong, as for neutron production in pp collisions. We also
included the significant contribution of the iso-vector Reggeons with natural
(\rho, a_2) and unnatural (a_1, \rho-\pi\ cut) parity with parameters
constrained by phenomenology. With a certain modeling for the pion-to-proton
ratio of the structure functions we reached good agreement with data from the
ZEUS and H1 experiments, successfully reproducing the observed dependence on
the fractional neutron momentum z, the photon virtuality Q^2, and the
transverse momentum transfer q_T.
