Superdeduction is a method specially designed to ease the use of first-order
theories in predicate logic. The theory is used to enrich the deduction system
with new deduction rules in a systematic, correct and complete way.
  A proof-term language and a cut-elimination reduction already exist for
superdeduction, both based on Christian Urban's work on classical sequent
calculus. However the computational content of Christian Urban's calculus is
not directly related to the (lambda-calculus based) Curry-Howard
correspondence. In contrast the Lambda bar mu mu tilde calculus is a
lambda-calculus for classical sequent calculus.
  This short paper is a first step towards a further exploration of the
computational content of superdeduction proofs, for we extend the Lambda bar mu
mu tilde calculus in order to obtain a proofterm langage together with a
cut-elimination reduction for superdeduction. We also prove strong
normalisation for this extension of the Lambda bar mu mu tilde calculus.
