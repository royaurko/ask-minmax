While the Cox Proportional Hazard model is a fundamental tool in survival
analysis, its semi-parametric nature precludes the estimation of upper survival
quantiles in the presence of heavy censoring. In contrast, fully parametric
models do not suffer from this issue - at the expense of additional modeling
assumptions. In this article, we extend a popular family of parametric models
which make the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) assumption to account for
heteroscedasticity in the log-survival times. This adds substantial modeling
flexibility, and we show how to easily and rapidly compute maximum likelihood
estimators for the proposed model in the presence of censoring. In an
application to the analysis of a colon cancer study, we found that
heteroscedastic modeling greatly diminished the significance of outliers, while
even slightly decreasing the average size of prediction intervals.
