We derive an extended version of the well-known Lyth Bound on the total
variation of the inflaton field, incorporating higher order corrections in slow
roll. We connect the field variation $\Delta\phi$ to both the spectral index of
scalar perturbations and the amplitude of tensor modes. We then investigate the
implications of this bound for ``small field'' potentials, where the field
rolls off a local maximum of the potential. The total field variation during
inflation is {\em generically} of order $m_{\rm Pl}$, even for potentials with
a suppressed tensor/scalar ratio. Much of the total field excursion arises in
the last e-fold of inflation and in single field models this problem can only
be avoided via fine-tuning or the imposition of a symmetry. Finally, we discuss
the implications of this result for inflationary model building in string
theory and supergravity.
