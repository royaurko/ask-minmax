The problem of estimating the coefficient of bivariate tail dependence is
considered here from the robustness point of view; it combines two apparently
contradictory theories of robust statistics and extreme value statistics. The
usual maximum likelihood based or the moment type estimators of tail dependence
coefficient are highly sensitive to the presence of outlying observations in
data. This paper proposes some alternative robust estimators obtained by
minimizing the density power divergence with suitable model assumptions; their
robustness properties are examined through the classical influence function
analysis. The performance of the proposed estimators is illustrated through an
extensive empirical study considering several important bivariate extreme value
distributions.
