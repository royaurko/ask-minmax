We present a computational study of finite-time mixing of a line segment by
cutting and shuffling. A family of one-dimensional interval exchange
transformations is constructed as a model system in which to study these types
of mixing processes. Illustrative examples of the mixing behaviors, including
pathological cases that violate the assumptions of the known governing theorems
and lead to poor mixing, are shown. Since the mathematical theory applies as
the number of iterations of the map goes to infinity, we introduce practical
measures of mixing (the percent unmixed and the number of intermaterial
interfaces) that can be computed over given (finite) numbers of iterations. We
find that good mixing can be achieved after a finite number of iterations of a
one-dimensional cutting and shuffling map, even though such a map cannot be
considered chaotic in the usual sense and/or it may not fulfill the conditions
of the ergodic theorems for interval exchange transformations. Specifically,
good shuffling can occur with only six or seven intervals of roughly the same
length, as long as the rearrangement order is an irreducible permutation. This
study has implications for a number of mixing processes in which
discontinuities arise either by construction or due to the underlying physics.
