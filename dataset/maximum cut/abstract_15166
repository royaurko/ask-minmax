In this work, we have explored the possibilities of improving CP violation
discovery potential of newly planned Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE),
U.S.A., by combining with data from reactors. The third mixing angle
$\theta_{13}$ is now very precisely measured and this precise measurenent of
$\theta_{13}$ helps in measurement of CP violation. Here, CP violation is
studied with and without data from reactors. Impact of placing a ND is also
studied. It is found that CPV discovery potential of LBNE with ND increases
when combined with data from reactors. With a far detector of 35 kt, it is
possible to obtain 5$\sigma$ sensitivity of CPV when run for 5 years in $\nu$
and 5 years in $\bar{\nu}$ mode. When hierarchy is assumed to be normal
hierarchy, CPV sensitivity is maximum. CPV discovery is possible by combining 5
years neutino data from LBNE with 3 years anti-neutrino from reactors. This
study reveals that CPV can also be discovered at 5$\sigma$ cl in IH mode when
appearance measurement of LBNE is combined with reactors.
