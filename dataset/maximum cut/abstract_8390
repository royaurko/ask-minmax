The adsorption of large ions from solution to a charged surface is
investigated theoretically. A generalized Poisson--Boltzmann equation, which
takes into account the finite size of the ions is presented. We obtain
analytical expressions for the electrostatic potential and ion concentrations
at the surface, leading to a modified Grahame equation. At high surface charge
densities the ionic concentration saturates to its maximum value. Our results
are in agreement with recent experiments.
