We consider the maximal cut of a three-loop four point function with massless
kinematics. By applying Groebner bases and primary decomposition we develop a
method which extracts all ten propagator master integral coefficients for an
arbitrary triple-box configuration via generalized unitarity cuts. As an
example we present analytic results for the three loop triple-box contribution
to gluon-gluon scattering in Yang-Mills with adjoint fermions and scalars in
terms of three master integrals.
