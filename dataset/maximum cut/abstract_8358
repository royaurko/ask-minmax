We study by Monte Carlo computer simulations random sequential adsorption
(RSA) with diffusional relaxation, of lattice hard squares in two dimensions.
While for RSA without diffusion the coverage approaches its maximum jamming
value (large-time fractional coverage) exponentially, added diffusion allows
the deposition process to proceed to the full coverage. The approach to the
full coverage is consistent with the t**(-1/2) power law reminiscent of the
equilibrium cluster coarsening in models with nonconserved order-parameter
dynamics.
