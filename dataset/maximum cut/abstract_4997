A p-type HPGe detector has been segmented by cutting, with a diamond saw, and
etching six circumferential grooves through the Li-diffused dead layer. The
degree of segmentation was tested with the 88 keV gamma rays from a
well-collimated source of 109Cd. The fraction of events, recognized as
occurring in more than one segment, and rejected from the energy interval 2038
+/- 5 keV, was measured as 0.59.
