We study quarkonium correlators and spectral functions at zero and finite
temperature using the anisotropic Fermilab lattice formulation with anisotropy
xi=2 and 4. To control cutoff effects we use several different lattice
spacings. The spectral functions were extracted from lattice correlators with
Maximum Entropy Method based on a new algorithm. We find evidence for the
survival of 1S quarkonium states in the deconfined medium till relatively high
temperatures as well as for dissolution of 1P quarkonium states right above the
deconfinement temperature.
