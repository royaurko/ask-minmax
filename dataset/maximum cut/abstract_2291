Events with one lepton, one photon and missing energy are the subject of
recent searches at the Fermilab Tevatron. We compute possible contributions to
these type of events from the process p pbar --> photon l nu_l nu_tau
nubar_tau, where l=e,mu in the context of a Low Scale Technicolor Model. We
find that with somewhat tighter cuts than the ones used in the CDF search, it
could be possible to either confirm or exclude this model in a small region of
its parameter space.
