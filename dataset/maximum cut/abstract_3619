I will explain why most novae show a sharp optical peak in the light curve,
whereas a small number of novae, such as PU Vul, shows a long-lasted flat
optical maximum. Re-examination of occurrence condition of optically thick
winds clarifies that hydrostatic evolutions, in which optically thick winds are
suppressed, are realized during nova outbursts on low mass white dwarfs (WDs)
(less than about 0.7 Mo). In such a case, a nova outburst evolves very slowly,
because of no strong mass-ejection, and stays at low temperature stage a long
time, which results in a long-lasted flat optical peak. This explains outburst
nature of symbiotic nova PU Vul, that shows flat optical maximum lasted as long
as eight years with no spectral indication of wind mass-loss. On the other
hand, in ordinary nova outbursts, strong optically thick winds inevitably occur
that carry out most of the envelope matter very quickly. Thus the light curve
decays immediately after the optical peak, which results in a sharp peak of
optical light curve.
