By focusing a laser pulse inside a capillary partially filled with liquid, a
vapour bubble is created which emits a pressure wave. This pressure wave
travels through the liquid and creates a fast, focused axisymmetric microjet
when it is reflected at the meniscus. We numerically investigate the formation
of this microjet using axisymmetric boundary-integral simulations, where we
model the pressure wave as a pressure pulse applied on the bubble. We find a
good agreement between the simulations and experimental results in terms of the
time evolution of the jet and on all parameters that can be compared directly.
We present a simple analytical model that accurately predicts the velocity of
the jet after the pressure pulse and its maximum velocity.
