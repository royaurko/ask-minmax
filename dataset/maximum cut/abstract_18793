The kinematic properties of the ionized gas of local Luminous Compact Blue
Galaxy (LCBG) NGC 7673 are presented using three dimensional data taken with
the PPAK integral field unit at the 3.5-m telescope in the Centro Astron\'omico
Hispano Alem\'an. Our data reveal an asymmetric rotating velocity field with a
peak to peak difference of 60 km s$^{-1}$. The kinematic centre is found to be
at the position of a central velocity width maximum ($\sigma=54\pm1$ km
s$^{-1}$), which is consistent with the position of the luminosity-weighted
centroid of the entire galaxy. The position angle of the minor rotation axis is
168$^{\circ}$ as measured from the orientation of the velocity field contours.
At least two decoupled kinematic components are found. The first one is compact
and coincides with the position of the second most active star formation region
(clump B). The second one is extended and does not have a clear optical
counterpart. No evidence of active galactic nuclei activity or supernovae
galactic winds powering any of these two components has been found. Our data,
however, show evidence in support of a previously proposed minor merger
scenario in which a dwarf galaxy, tentatively identified with clump B, is
falling into NGC 7673. and triggers the starburst. Finally, it is shown that
the dynamical mass of this galaxy may be severely underestimated when using the
derived rotation curve or the integrated velocity width, under the assumption
of virialization.
