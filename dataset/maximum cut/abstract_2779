We study the three-loop four-point amplitude in ABJM theory. We determine the
dual conformal invariant integrals with highest number of propagators and fix
their coefficients by two-particle cuts. Evaluating such a combination of
integrals in dimensional regularization we provide evidence for exponentiation
of the amplitude, including the finite terms. In addition we show that the
three-loop amplitude can be expressed in terms of classical polylogarithms of
uniform degree of transcendentality.
