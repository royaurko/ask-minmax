We report polarized- and unpolarized-neutron scattering measurements of
magnetic excitations in single-crystal Na0.75CoO2. The data confirm
ferromagnetic correlations within the cobalt-layers and reveal
antiferromagnetic correlations perpendicular to the layers, consistent with an
A-type antiferromagnetic ordering. The magnetic modes propagating perpendicular
to the layers are sharp, and reach a maximum energy of ~12 meV. From a minimal
spin wave model, containing only nearest-neighbour Heisenberg exchange
interactions, we estimate the inter- and intra-layer exchange constants to be
12.2 +/- 0.5 meV and -6 +/- 2 meV, respectively. We conclude that the magnetic
fluctuations in Na0.75CoO2 are highly three-dimensional.
