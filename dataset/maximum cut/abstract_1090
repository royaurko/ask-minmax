The concept of star-duality is described for self-similar cut-and-project
tilings in arbitrary dimensions. This generalises Thurston's concept of a
Galois-dual tiling. The dual tilings of the Penrose tilings as well as the
Ammann-Beenker tilings are calculated. Conditions for a tiling to be self-dual
are obtained.
