We investigate the effect of an important class of glitches occurring in the
detector data on matched filter searches of gravitational waves from coalescing
compact binaries in the advanced detector era. The glitches, which can be
modeled as sine-Gaussians, can produce triggers with significant time delays
and thus have important bearing on veto procedures as will be described in the
paper. We provide approximated analytical estimates of the trigger SNR and time
as a function of the parameters describing the sine-Gaussian (center time,
center frequency and Q-factor) and the inspiral waveform (chirp mass). We
validate our analytical predictions through simple numerical simulations,
performed by filtering noiseless sine-Gaussians with the inspiral matched
filter and recovering the time and value of the maximum of the resulting SNR
time series. Although we identify regions of the parameter space in which each
approximation no longer reproduces the numerical results, the approximations
complement each other and together effectively cover the whole parameter space.
