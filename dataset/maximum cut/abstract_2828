This paper introduces a general perturbative quantization scheme for gauge
theories on manifolds with boundary, compatible with cutting and gluing, in the
cohomological symplectic (BV-BFV) formalism. Explicit examples, like abelian BF
theory and its perturbations, including nontopological ones, are presented.
