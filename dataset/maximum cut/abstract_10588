The Landau gauge gluon propagator for the pure gauge theory is evaluated on a
32^3x64 lattice with a physical volume of (3.35^3x6.7)fm^4. Comparison with two
smaller lattices at different lattice spacings allows an assessment of finite
volume and finite lattice spacing errors. Cuts on the data are imposed to
minimize these errors. Scaling of the gluon propagator is verified between
beta=6.0 and beta=6.2. The tensor structure is evaluated and found to be in
good agreement with the Landau gauge form, except at very small momentum
values, where some small finite volume errors persist. A number of functional
forms for the momentum dependence of the propagator are investigated. The form
D(q^2)=D_ir+D_uv, where D_ir(q^2) ~ (q^2+M^2)^-\eta and D_uv is an infrared
regulated one-loop asymptotic form, is found to provide an adequate description
of the data over the entire momentum region studied - thereby bridging the gap
between the infrared confinement region and the ultraviolet asymptotic region.
The best estimate for the exponent \eta is 3.2(+0.1/-0.2)(+0.2/-0.3), where the
first set of errors represents the uncertainty associated with varying the
fitting range, while the second set of errors reflects the variation arising
from different choices of infrared regulator in D_uv. Fixing the form of D_uv,
we find that the mass parameter M is (1020+/-100)MeV.
