We present a numerical study of an SU(3) gauged 2D model for adjoint scalar
fields, defined by dimensional reduction of pure gauge QCD in (2+1)D at high
temperature. In the symmetric phase of its global Z_2 symmetry, two colourless
boundstates, even and odd under Z_2, are identified. Their respective
contributions (poles) in correlation functions of local composite operators A_n
of degree n=2p and 2p+1 in the scalar fields (p=1,2) fulfill factorization. The
contributions of two particle states (cuts) are detected. Their size agrees
with estimates based on a meanfield-like decomposition of the p=2 operators
into polynomials in p=1 operators. No sizable signal in any A_n correlation can
be attributed to 1/n times a Debye screening length associated with n
elementary fields. These results are quantitatively consistent with the picture
of scalar ``matter'' fields confined within colourless boundstates whose
residual ``strong'' interactions are very weak.
