Fluid jets are found in nature at all length scales, from microscopic to
cosmological. Here we report on an electroosmotically driven jet from a single
glass nanopore about 75 nm in radius with a maximum flow rate ~15 pL/s. A novel
anemometry technique allows us to map out the vorticity and velocity fields
that show excellent agreement with the classical Landau-Squire solution of the
Navier Stokes equations for a point jet. We observe a phenomenon that we call
flow rectification: an asymmetry in the flow rate with respect to voltage
reversal. Such a nanojet could potentially find applications in
micromanipulation, nanopatterning, and as a diode in microfluidic circuits.
