We have used realistic Comptonization models to fit high quality BeppoSAX
data of 6 Seyfert galaxies. Our main effort was to adopt a Comptonization model
taking into account the anisotropy of the soft photon field. The most important
consequence is a reduction of the first scattering order, which produces a
break (the so-called anisotropy break) in the outgoing spectra. The physical
parameters of the hot corona (i.e. the temperature and optical depth) obtained
fitting this class of models to broad band X-ray spectra are substantially
different from those derived fitting the same data with the power law + cut-off
model commonly used in the literature. In particular, our best fits with
Comptonization models in slab geometry give a temperature generally much larger
and an optical depth much smaller than derived from the power law + cut-off
fits, using standard Comptonization formulae. The estimate of the reflection
normalization is also larger with the slab corona model. For most objects of
our sample, both models give Compton parameter values larger than expected in a
slab corona geometry, suggesting a more ``photon starved'' X-ray source
configuration. Finally, the two models provide different trends and correlation
between the physical parameters which has major consequences for the physical
interpretation of the data.
