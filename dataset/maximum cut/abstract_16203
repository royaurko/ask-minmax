We have mapped the SiO J=5-4 line at 217GHz from the HH211 molecular outflow
with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The high resolution map (1.6''x0.9'') shows
that the SiO J=5-4 emission comes from the central narrow jet along the outflow
axis with a width of ~0.8'' (~250 AU) FWHM. The SiO jet consists of a chain of
knots separated by 3-4'' (~1000 AU) and most of the SiO knots have counterparts
in shocked H_2 emission seen in a new, deep VLT near-infrared image of the
outflow. A new, innermost pair of knots are discovered at just +/-2'' from the
central star. The line ratio between the SiO J=5-4 data and upper limits from
the SiO J=1-0 data of Chandler & Richer (2001) suggests that these knots have a
temperature in excess of 300-500 K and a density of (0.5-1) x10^7 cm^{-3}. The
radial velocity measured for these knots is ~30 km/s, comparable to the maximum
velocity seen in the entire jet. The high temperature, high density, and
velocity structure observed in this pair of SiO knots suggest that they are
closely related to the primary jet launched close to the protostar.
