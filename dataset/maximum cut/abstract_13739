The evaporation of a tiny amount of water on the solid surface with different
wettability has been studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We found that,
as the surface changed from hydrophobicity to hydrophility, the evaporation
speed did not show a monotonically decrease from intuition, but increased
first, and then decreased after reached a maximum value. The competition
between the number of the water molecules on the water-gas surface from where
the water molecules can evaporate and the potential barrier to prevent those
water molecules from evaporating results in the unexpected behavior of the
evaporation. A theoretical model based on those two factors can fit the
simulation data very well. This finding is helpful in understanding the
evaporation on the biological surfaces, designing artificial surface of ultra
fast water evaporating or preserving water in soil.
