We present the results of numerical analysis of a model of normal zone
propagation in coated conductors. The main emphasis is on the effects of
increased contact resistance between the superconducting film and the
stabilizer on the speed of normal zone propagation, the maximum temperature
rise inside the normal zone, and the stability margins. We show that with
increasing contact resistance the speed of normal zone propagation increases,
the maximum temperature inside the normal zone decreases, and stability margins
shrink. This may have an overall beneficial effect on quench protection quality
of coated conductors. We also briefly discuss the propagation of solitons and
development of the temperature modulation along the wire.
