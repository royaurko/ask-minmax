Several characterizations of the Generalized Inverse Gaussian (GIG)
distribution have been proposed in the literature, especially over the past two
decades. These characterization theorems are surveyed, and two new
characterizations are established, one based on maximum likelihood estimation
and the other is a Stein characterization.
