We review some recent additions to the tool-chest of techniques for finding
compact integrand representations of multiloop gauge-theory amplitudes -
including non-planar contributions - applicable for N=4 super-Yang-Mills in
four and higher dimensions, as well as for theories with less supersymmetry. We
discuss a general organization of amplitudes in terms of purely cubic graphs,
review the method of maximal cuts, as well as some special D-dimensional
recursive cuts, and conclude by describing the efficient organization of
amplitudes resulting from the conjectured duality between color and kinematic
structures on constituent graphs.
