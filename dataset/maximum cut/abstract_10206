An approach to land surface temperature (LST) estimation that relies upon
Bayesian inference has been tested against multiband infrared radiometric
imagery from the Terra MODIS instrument. Bayesian LST estimators are shown to
reproduce standard MODIS product LST values starting from a parsimoniously
chosen (hence, uninformative) range of prior band emissivity knowledge. Two
estimation methods have been tested. The first is the iterative contraction
mapping of joint expectation values for LST and surface emissivity described in
a previous paper. In the second method, the Bayesian algorithm is reformulated
as a Maximum \emph{A-Posteriori} (MAP) search for the maximum joint
\emph{a-posteriori} probability for LST, given observed sensor aperture
radiances and \emph{a-priori} probabilities for LST and emissivity.
  Two MODIS data granules each for daytime and nighttime were used for the
comparison. The granules were chosen to be largely cloud-free, with limited
vertical relief in those portions of the granules for which the sensor zenith
angle $| ZA | < 30^{\circ}$. Level 1B radiances were used to obtain LST
estimates for comparison with the Level 2 MODIS LST product.
  The Bayesian LST estimators accurately reproduce standard MODIS product LST
values. In particular, the mean discrepancy for the MAP retrievals is $| <
\Delta T > | < 0.3 K$, and its standard deviation does not exceed $1 K$. The
$\pm 68 %$ confidence intervals for individual LST estimates associated with
assumed uncertainty in surface emissivity are of order $0.8 K$.
  The Appendix presents a proof of convergence of the iterative contraction
mapping algorithm.
