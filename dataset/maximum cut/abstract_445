The present paper shows that for a given integer k greater than 2 it is
possible to construct an at least k-differentiable Riemannian metric on the
sphere of a certain dimension such that the cut locus of a point of it becomes
a fractal. Moreover, we show that this construction can be extended to the case
of Finsler sphere as well.
