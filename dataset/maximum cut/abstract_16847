We consider the equation $u_t=u_{xx}+u_{yy}+b(x)f(u)+g(u)$, $(x,y)\in\mathbb
R^2$ with monostable nonliearity, where $b(x)$ is a nonnegative measure on
$\mathbb R$ that is periodic in $x.$ In the case where $b(x)$ is a smooth
periodic function, there exists a pulsating travelling wave that propagates in
the direction $(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)$ -- with average speed $c$ if and only
if $c\geq c^*(\theta,b),$ where $c^*(\theta,b)$ is a certain positive number
depending on $b.$ Moreover, the quantity
$w(\theta;{b})=\min_{|\theta-\phi|<\frac{\pi}{2}}c^*(\phi;{b})/\cos(\theta-\phi)$
is called the spreading speed. This theory can be extended by showing the
existence of the minimal speed $c^*(\theta,b)$ for any nonnegative measure $b$
with period $L.$ We then study the question of maximizing $c^*(\theta,b)$ under
the constraint $\int_{[0,L)}b(x)dx=\alpha L,$ where $\alpha$ is an arbitrarily
given positive constant. We prove that the maximum is attained by periodically
arrayed Dirac's delta functions $h(x)=\alpha L\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z}\delta(x+kL)$
for any direction $\theta$. Based on these results, for the case that $b=h$ we
also show the monotonicity of the spreading speedsin $\theta$ and study the
asymptotic shape of spreading fronts for large $L$ and small $L$ . Finally, we
show that for general 2-dimensional periodic equation
$u_t=u_{xx}+u_{yy}+b(x,y)f(u)+g(u)$, $(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2$, the similar
conclusions do not hold.
