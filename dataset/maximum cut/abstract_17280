More than 1000 red giants have been observed by NASA/Kepler mission during a
nearly continuous period of ~ 13 months. The resulting high-frequency
resolution (< 0.03 muHz) allows us to study the granulation parameters of these
stars. The granulation pattern results from the convection motions leading to
upward flows of hot plasma and downward flows of cooler plasma. We fitted
Harvey-like functions to the power spectra, to retrieve the timescale and
amplitude of granulation. We show that there is an anti-correlation between
both of these parameters and the position of maximum power of acoustic modes,
while we also find a correlation with the radius, which agrees with the theory.
We finally compare our results with 3D models of the convection.
