We propose a dipole-force linear waveguide which confines neutral atoms up to
lambda/2 above a microfabricated single-mode dielectric optical guide. The
optical guide carries far blue-detuned light in the horizontally-polarized TE
mode and far red-detuned light in the vertically-polarized TM mode, with both
modes close to optical cut-off. A trapping minimum in the transverse plane is
formed above the optical guide due to the differing evanescent decay lengths of
the two modes. This design allows manufacture of mechanically stable
atom-optical elements on a substrate. We calculate the full vector bound modes
for an arbitrary guide shape using two-dimensional non-uniform finite elements
in the frequency-domain, allowing us to optimize atom waveguide properties. We
find that a rectangular optical guide of 0.8um by 0.2um carrying 6mW of total
laser power (detuning +-15nm about the D2 line) gives a trap depth of 200uK for
cesium atoms (m_F = 0), transverse oscillation frequencies of f_x = 40kHz and
f_y = 160kHz, collection area ~ 1um^2 and coherence time of 9ms. We discuss the
effects of non-zero m_F, surface interactions, heating rate, the substrate
refractive index, and the limits on waveguide bending radius.
