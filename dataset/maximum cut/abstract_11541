We attempt to study the characteristics of the different stellar populations
present in the Galactic central region. A Monte Carlo method is used to
simultaneously fit 11 thin disc and triaxial outer bulge density parameters on
(Ks,J-Ks) star count data in almost 100 windows from the DENIS near infrared
large scale survey at -8 deg < l< 12 deg and -4 deg < b < 4 deg. Various bulge
density profiles and luminosity functions were tested uing a population
synthesis scheme. The best models, selected by a maximum likelihood test, give
the following description: the outer bulge is proxy, prolate, and oriented
10.6+/-3 deg with respect to the Sun-center direction. It seems that the main
bulge population is not older than 10 Gyr, but this preliminary result needs
further work to be confirmed. A significant central hole is found in the middle
of the thin disc. We discuss these results in regard to previous findings and
the scenario of bulge formation.
