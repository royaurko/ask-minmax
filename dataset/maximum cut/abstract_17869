It is already stated in the previous studies that the radius of the giant
planets is affected by stellar irradiation. The confirmed relation between
radius and incident flux depends on planetary mass intervals. In this study, we
show that there is a single relation between radius and irradiated energy per
gram per second ($l_-$), for all mass intervals. There is an extra increase in
radius of planets if $l_-$ is higher than 1100 times energy received by the
Earth ($l_\oplus$). This is likely due to dissociation of molecules. The tidal
interaction as a heating mechanism is also considered and found that its
maximum effect on the inflation of planets is about 15 per cent. We also
compute age and heavy element abundances from the properties of host stars,
given in the TEPCat catalogue (Southworth 2011). The metallicity given in the
literature is as [Fe/H]. However, the most abundant element is oxygen, and
there is a reverse relation between the observed abundances [Fe/H] and [O/Fe].
Therefore, we first compute [O/H] from [Fe/H] by using observed abundances, and
then find heavy element abundance from [O/H]. We also develop a new method for
age determination. Using the ages we find, we analyse variation of both radius
and mass of the planets with respect to time, and estimate the initial mass of
the planets from the relation we derive for the first time. According to our
results, the highly irradiated gas giants lose 5 per cent of their mass in
every 1 Gyr.
