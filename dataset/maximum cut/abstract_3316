We introduce a simple model for an engine based on the Nernst effect. In the
presence of a magnetic field, a vertical heat current can drive a horizontal
particle current against a chemical potential. For a microscopic model invoking
classical particle trajectories subject to the Lorentz force, we prove a
universal bound 3-2*sqrt(2) simeq 0.172 for the ratio between maximum
efficiency and Carnot efficiency. This bound, as the slightly lower one 1/6 for
efficiency at maximum power, can indeed be saturated for large magnetic field
and small fugacity irrespective of the aspect ratio.
