Using Dirac sea picture for both left and right moving Weyl fermion (massless
fermions) in $1+1$ dimensional world with a general relativity metric field we
calculate the Weyl anomaly. That is to say we calculate the trace of the
energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu}^{\> \mu}$ arising from the fermions. With the
gauge choice ansatz $g_{\mu \nu}=e^{2\Omega (\vec{x})}\eta_{\mu \nu}$ for the
metric tensor formally the field $\Omega (\vec{x})$ drops out of the action.
However, the cut-off for the ultraviolet divergence does depend on $\Omega$. At
first we calculate the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude in 2-dimensional
Euclideanized theory and note that $\Omega$-dependence comes from the
suppression (deviation from unity) of the a priori unit overlap (vacuum does
not change) by pair production after all occurring (Schwinger mechanism
analog).
