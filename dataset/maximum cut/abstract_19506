Electronic spin and orbital (dd) excitation spectra of
(Ca{x}La{1-x})(Ba{1.75-x}La{0.25+x})Cu{3}O{y} samples are measured by resonant
inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). In this compound, Tc of samples with
identical hole dopings is strongly affected by the Ca/Ba substitution x due to
subtle variations in the lattice constants, while crystal symmetry and disorder
as measured by line-widths are x independent. We examine two extreme values of
x and two extreme values of hole-doping content y corresponding to
antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. The x dependence of the spin mode
energies is approximately the same for both the antiferromagnetic and
superconducting samples. This clearly demonstrates that RIXS is sensitive to J
even in doped samples. A positive correlation between the superexchange J and
the maximum of Tc at optimal doping Tc^{max} is observed. We also measured the
x dependence of the d_{xy} -> d_{x^2-y^2} and d_{xz/yz} -> d_{x^2-y^2} orbital
splittings. We infer that the effect of the unresolved d_{3z^2-r^2} ->
d_{x^2-y^2} excitation on Tc^{max} is much smaller than the effect of J. There
appears to be dispersion in the d_{xy} -> d_{x^2-y^2} peak of up to 0.05 eV.
Our fitting of the peaks furthermore indicates an asymmetric dispersion for the
d_{xz/yz} -> d_{x^2-y^2} excitation. A peak at ~0.8 eV is also observed, and
attributed to a dd excitation in the chain layer.
