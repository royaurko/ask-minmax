Long-term $JHK$ light curves have recently become available for large numbers
of the more luminous stars in the SMC. We have used these $JHK$ light curves,
along with OGLE $V$ and $I$ light curves, to examine the variability of a
sample of luminous red giants in the SMC which show prominent long secondary
periods (LSPs). The origin of the LSPs is currently unknown. In oxygen-rich
stars, we found that while most broad band colours (e.g. $V-I$) get redder when
an oxygen-rich star dims during its LSP cycle, the $J$-$K$ colour barely
changes and sometimes becomes bluer. We interpret the $J$-$K$ colour changes as
being due to increasing water vapour absorption during declining light caused
by the development a layer of dense cool gas above the photosphere. This result
and previous observations which indicate the development of a chromosphere
between minimum to maximum light suggest that the LSP phenomenon is associated
with the ejection of matter from the stellar photosphere near the beginning of
light decline. We explore the possibility that broadband light variations from
the optical to the near-IR regions can be explained by either dust absorption
by ejected matter or large spots on a rotating stellar surface. However,
neither model is capable of explaining the observed light variations in a
variety of colour-magnitude diagrams. We conclude that some other mechanism is
responsible for the light variations associated with LSPs in red giants.
