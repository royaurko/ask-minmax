We review the different performance limitations of circular colliders, namely
the limitations of energy reach, maximum attainable luminosity and beam
lifetime. This paper considers only head-on collisions. We consider the range
of beam energies from 45GeV to 250 GeV and collider circumferences from 20 to
100kms.
