Electromagnetic wave scattering from planar dielectric films deposited on
one-dimensional, randomly rough, perfectly conducting substrates is studied by
numerical simulations for both p- and s-polarization. The reduced Rayleigh
equation, which is the integral equation satisfied by the scattering amplitude
after eliminating the fields inside the film, is the starting point for the
simulation. This equation is solved numerically by considering a random surface
of finite length, and by introducing wave number cut-offs in the evanescent
part of the spectrum. Upon discretization, a system of linear equations is
obtained, and by solving this matrix system for an ensemble of surface
realizations, the contribution to the mean differential reflection coefficient
from the incoherently scattered field, $<\partial R_\nu/\partial
\theta>_{incoh}$ (\nu=p,s), is obtained nonperturbatively. It is demonstrated
that when the scattering geometry supports at least two guided waves,
$<\partial R_\nu/\partial \theta>_{incoh}$, has, in addition to the well known
enhanced backscattering peak, well-defined satellite peaks in agreement with
theory, for most of the parameters considered.
