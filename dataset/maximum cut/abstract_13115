Copy Number Variations (CNVs) of regions of the human genome are important in
disease association studies.The digital array is a nanofluidic biochip which
utilizes integrated channels and valves that partition mixtures of sample and
reagents into 765 nanovolume reaction chambers. It was recently shown how one
can perform statistical analysis of CNV in a DNA sample the digital array. In
particular, it was shown how one can accurately estimate the true concentration
of the molecules in the DNA sample and then determine the ratios of different
sequences along with statistical confidence intervals on these estimations. In
this paper we perform computation of maximum number of copies which can be
distinguished using the digital array which gives its resolution in terms of
its ability to determine CNV. Then, we demonstrate the usefulness of the
mathematical analysis to solve an important real-world problem of determination
of the copy number of X chromosome as our example application.
