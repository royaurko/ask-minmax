A wavelet-like model for distributions of objects in natural and man-made
terrestrial environments is developed. The model is constructed in a
self-similar fashion, with the sizes, amplitudes, and numbers of objects
occurring at a constant ratios between parent and offspring objects. The
objects are randomly distributed in space according to a Poisson process.
Fractal supports and a cascade model are used to organize objects
intermittently in space. In its basic form, the model is for continuously
varying random fields, although a level-cut is introduced to model two-phase
random media. The report begins with a description of relevant concepts from
fractal theory, and then progresses through static (time-invariant),
steady-state, and non-steady models. The results can be applied to such diverse
phenomena as turbulence, geologic distributions, urban buildings, vegetation,
and arctic ice floes. The model can be used as a basis for synthesizing
realistic terrestrial scenes, and for predicting the performance of sensing and
communication systems in operating environments with complex, intermittent
distributions of scattering objects.
