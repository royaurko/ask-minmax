A preliminary determination of the Dirac phase in the PMNS matrix is
$\dell\approx -\frac{\pi}{2}$. A rather accurately determined Jarlskog
invariant $J$ in the CKM matrix is close to the maximum. Since the phases in
the CKM and PMNS matrices will be accurately determined in the future, it is an
interesting problem to relate these two phases. This can be achieved in a
families-unified grand unification if the weak CP violation is introduced
spontaneously {\it \`a la} Froggatt and Nielsen at a high energy scale, where
only one meaningful Dirac CP phase appears.
