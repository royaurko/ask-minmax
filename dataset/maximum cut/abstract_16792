This Letter presents the first results from the observations of LSI +61 303
using Large Area Telescope data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope
between 2008 August and 2009 March. Our results indicate variability that is
consistent with the binary period, with the emission being modulated at 26.6
+/- 0.5 days. This constitutes the first detection of orbital periodicity in
high-energy gamma rays (20 MeV-100 GeV, HE). The light curve is characterized
by a broad peak after periastron, as well as a smaller peak just before
apastron. The spectrum is best represented by a power law with an exponential
cutoff, yielding an overall flux above 100 MeV of 0.82 +/- 0.03(stat) +/-
0.07(syst) 10^{-6} ph cm^{-2} s^{-1}, with a cutoff at 6.3 +/- 1.1(stat) +/-
0.4(syst) GeV and photon index Gamma = 2.21 +/- 0.04(stat) +/- 0.06(syst).
There is no significant spectral change with orbital phase. The phase of
maximum emission, close to periastron, hints at inverse Compton scattering as
the main radiation mechanism. However, previous very high-energy gamma ray
(>100 GeV, VHE) observations by MAGIC and VERITAS show peak emission close to
apastron. This and the energy cutoff seen with Fermi suggest the link between
HE and VHE gamma rays is nontrivial.
