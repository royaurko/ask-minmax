We show that the observation of the Drell-Yan production of low-mass
lepton-pairs (M < 20 GeV) at high rapidities (Y > 3) at the LHC can make a
direct measurement of parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the low x region,
x < 10^{-4}. We describe a procedure that greatly reduces the sensitivity of
the predictions to the choice of the factorization scale and, in particular,
show how, by imposing a cutoff on the transverse momentum of the lepton-pair,
the data are able to probe PDFs in the important low scale, low x domain. We
include the effects of the Sudakov suppression factor.
