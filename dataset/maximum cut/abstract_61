We consider large random graphs with prescribed degrees, such as those
generated by the configuration model. In the regime where the empirical degree
distribution approaches a limit $\mu$ with finite mean, we establish the
systematic convergence of a broad class of graph parameters that includes in
particular the independence number, the maximum cut size and the log-partition
function of the antiferromagnetic Ising and Potts models. The corresponding
limits are shown to be Lipschitz and concave functions of $\mu$. Our work
extends the applicability of the celebrated interpolation method, introduced in
the context of spin glasses, and recently related to the fascinating problem of
right-convergence of sparse graphs.
