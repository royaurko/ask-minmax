In era of NOvA operation, it is planned to slip-stack six on six Booster
proton batches in the Recycler ring for a total intensity of 5 1013
protons/cycle. During the slip-stacking, the chromaticities are required to be
jumped from (-2,-2) to (-20,-20). However, they can only be adjusted to
(-12,-12) from (-2,-2) using existing 2 families of powered sextupoles. On the
other hand, the presently designed Recycler lattice for Nova replaces the 30
straight section with 8 D-D half FODO cells . We use 3 quads in a half-cell to
obtain the working point under the limit of the feasible quad strength, and the
maximum beta-function in this section cannot be less than 80 m. In this paper,
we re-designed the end shims of the permanent magnets in the ring lattice with
appropriate quadrupole and sextupole components to meet both chromaticity and
tune requirements. We are able to use 2 quads in a half cell in RR30 straight
section within feasible quad strength. The maximum beta-functions are also
lowered to around 55 m. The dynamic aperture tracking has been done using MAD
to simulate the scenario of beam injection into the Recycler ring for Nova.
