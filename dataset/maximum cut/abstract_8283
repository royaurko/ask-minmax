We study the effect of Galactic foregrounds with spatially varying spectral
indices on analysis of simulated data from the Planck Satellite. We also
briefly mention the effect the extra-galactic point sources have on the data
analysis and summarise the most recent constraints on Galactic emission at GHz
frequencies.
