We report on the results of a detailed spectral analysis of 389 RXTE
observations of the Galactic microquasar GRO J1655-40, performed during its
2005 outburst. The maximum luminosity reached during this outburst was 1.4
times higher than in the previous (1996-1997) outburst. However, the spectral
behavior during the two outbursts was very similar. In particular, Ldisk was
proportional to Tin^4 up to the same critical luminosity and in both outbursts
there were periods during which the energy spectra were very soft, but could
not be fit with standard disk models.
