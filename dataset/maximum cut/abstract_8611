The results of a search for W boson pair production in pbar-p collisions at
sqrt{s}=1.8 TeV with subsequent decay to emu, ee, and mumu channels are
presented. Five candidate events are observed with an expected background of
3.1+-0.4 events for an integrated luminosity of approximately 97 pb^{-1}.
Limits on the anomalous couplings are obtained from a maximum likelihood fit of
the E_T spectra of the leptons in the candidate events. Assuming identical
WWgamma and WWZ couplings, the 95 % C.L. limits are -0.62<Delta_kappa<0.77
(lambda = 0) and -0.53<lambda<0.56 (Delta_kappa = 0) for a form factor scale
Lambda = 1.5 TeV.
