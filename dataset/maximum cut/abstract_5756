To explore the potential of molecular gas treatment of freshly cut lithium
foils in non-electrolyte based passivation of high energy-density Li anodes,
density functional theory (DFT) has been used to study the decomposition of
molecular gases on metallic lithium surfaces. By combining DFT geometry
optimization and Molecular Dynamics, the effects of atmospheric (N2, O2, CO2)
and hazardous (F2, SO2) gas decomposition on Li(bcc) (100), (110), and (111)
surfaces on relative surface energies, work functions, and emerging electronic
and elastic properties are investigated. The simulations suggest that exposure
to different molecular gases can be used to induce and control reconstructions
of the metal Li surface and substantial changes (up to over 1 eV) in the work
function of the passivated system. Contrary to the other considered gases,
which form metallic adlayers, SO2 treatment emerges as the most effective in
creating an insulating passivation layer for dosages <= 1 mono-layer. The
substantial Li->adsorbate charge transfer and adlayer relaxation produce marked
elastic stiffening of the interface, with the smallest change shown by
nitrogen-treated adlayers.
