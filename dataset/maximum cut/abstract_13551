We report measurements of the energy resolution of ultra-sensitive
superconducting bolometric detectors. The device is a superconducting titanium
nanobridge with niobium contacts. A fast microwave pulse is used to simulate a
single higher-frequency photon, where the absorbed energy of the pulse is equal
to the photon energy. This technique allows precise calibration of the input
coupling and avoids problems with unwanted background photons. Present devices
have an intrinsic full-width at half-maximum energy resolution of approximately
23 terahertz, near the predicted value due to intrinsic thermal fluctuation
noise.
