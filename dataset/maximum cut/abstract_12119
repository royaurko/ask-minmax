In order to gain insights into the origin of colossal magneto-resistance
(CMR) in manganese oxides, we performed a ^{139}La NMR study in the
double-layered compound La_{1.2}Sr_{1.8}Mn_2O_7. We find that above the Curie
temperature T_C=126 K, applying a magnetic field induces a long-range
ferromagnetic order that persists up to T=330 K. The critical field at which
the induced magnetic moment is saturated coincides with the field at which the
CMR effect reaches to a maximum. Our results therefore indicate that the CMR
observed above T_C in this compound is due to the field-induced ferromagnetism
that produces a metallic state via the double exchange interaction.
