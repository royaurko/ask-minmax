We study a simple swarming model on a two-dimensional lattice where the
self-propelled particles exhibit a tendency to align ferromagnetically. Volume
exclusion effects are present: particles can only hop to a neighboring node if
the node is empty. Here we show that such effects lead to a surprisingly rich
variety of self-organized spatial patterns. As particles exhibit an
increasingly higher tendency to align to neighbors, they first self-segregate
into disordered particle aggregates. Aggregates turn into traffic jams. Traffic
jams evolve toward gliders, triangular high density regions that migrate in a
well-defined direction. Maximum order is achieved by the formation of elongated
high density regions - bands - that transverse the entire system. Numerical
evidence suggests that below the percolation density the phase transition
associated to orientational order is of first-order, while at full occupancy it
is of second-order. The model highlights the (pattern formation) importance of
a coupling between local density, orientation, and local speed.
