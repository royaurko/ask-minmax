The structure of molecular cloud cores supported by thermal pressure and a
poloidal magnetic field is reinvestigated in the magnetohydrostatic and
axisymmetric approximation. In addition to oblate configurations found in
earlier work, solutions yielding prolate spheroidal shapes have also been
obtained for a reference state described by a uniform sphere threaded by a
uniform background magnetic field. The solutions for prolate configurations are
found to be relevant for lower masses than for their oblate counterparts. Of
particular importance is the result that the prolate cloud cores have radii
less than a maximum given by $0.25 pc (a/0.2km/s)^2 (P_{\rm ext}/10^{-12}
dyne/cm^2)^{-1/2}$, where $a$ is the sound speed and $P_{\rm ext}$ is the
external pressure of the background medium. The existence of such solutions
obviates the presence of toroidal fields in such modeled structures.
