Surface Acoustic Waves on piezoelectric substrates can be used to investigate
the dynamic conductivity of thin films in a non-contact and very sensitive way,
especially at low conductivities. Here, we report on such surface acoustic wave
studies to characterize thin manganite film like La0.67Ca0.33MnO3, exhibiting a
Jan Teller effect with a strong electron phonon interaction and a metal
insulator transition at high temperatures. We report on the deposition of
La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 on piezoelectric substrates (LiNbO3 in different crystal cuts)
employing a pulsed laser deposition technique. The structural qualities of the
thin films are examined by X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscope and
Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. For the electrical characterization, we
employ the surface acoustic wave technique, accompanied by conventional
DC-resistance measurements for comparison.
