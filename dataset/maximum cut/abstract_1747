This paper addresses the estimation of parameters of a Bayesian network from
incomplete data. The task is usually tackled by running the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm several times in order to obtain a high
log-likelihood estimate. We argue that choosing the maximum log-likelihood
estimate (as well as the maximum penalized log-likelihood and the maximum a
posteriori estimate) has severe drawbacks, being affected both by overfitting
and model uncertainty. Two ideas are discussed to overcome these issues: a
maximum entropy approach and a Bayesian model averaging approach. Both ideas
can be easily applied on top of EM, while the entropy idea can be also
implemented in a more sophisticated way, through a dedicated non-linear solver.
A vast set of experiments shows that these ideas produce significantly better
estimates and inferences than the traditional and widely used maximum
(penalized) log-likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimates. In particular,
if EM is adopted as optimization engine, the model averaging approach is the
best performing one; its performance is matched by the entropy approach when
implemented using the non-linear solver. The results suggest that the
applicability of these ideas is immediate (they are easy to implement and to
integrate in currently available inference engines) and that they constitute a
better way to learn Bayesian network parameters.
