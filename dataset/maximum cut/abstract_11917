We have derived the dipolar relaxation function for a cluster model whose
volume distribution was obtained from the generalized maximum Tsallis
nonextensive entropy principle. The power law exponents of the relaxation
function are simply related to a global fractal parameter $\alpha$ and for
large time to the entropy nonextensivity parameter $q$. For intermediate times
the relaxation follows a stretched exponential behavior. The asymptotic power
law behaviors both in the time and the frequency domains coincide with those of
the Weron generalized dielectric function derived from an extension of the Levy
central limit theorem. They are in full agreement with the Jonscher
universality principle. Moreover our model gives a physical interpretation of
the mathematical parameters of the Weron stochastic theory and opens new paths
to understand the ubiquity of self-similarity and power laws in the relaxation
of large classes of materials in terms of their fractal and nonextensive
properties.
