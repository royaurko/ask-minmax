We report on the design, fabrication, and on-sky performance of the Florida
Image Slicer for Infrared Cosmology and Astrophysics (FISICA)- a
fully-cryogenic all-reflective image-slicing integral field unit for the
FLAMINGOS near-infrared spectrograph. Designed to accept input beams near f/15,
FISICA with FLAMINGOS provides R \sim 1300 spectra over a 16x33-arcsec
field-of-view on the Cassegrain f/15 focus of the KPNO 4-meter telescope, or a
6x12-arcsec field-of-view on the Nasmyth or Bent Cassegrain foci of the Gran
Telescopio Canarias 10.4-meter telescope. FISICA accomplishes this using three
sets of "monolithic" powered mirror arrays, each with 22 mirrored surfaces cut
into a single piece of aluminum. We review the optical and opto-mechanical
design and fabrication of FISICA, as well as laboratory test results for FISICA
integrated with the FLAMINGOS instrument. Finally, we present performance
results from observations with FISICA at the KPNO 4-m telescope and comparisons
of FISICA performance to other available IFUs on 4-m to 8-m-class telescopes.
