We present a new method for the calculation of differential distributions
directly in Mellin space without recourse to the usual momentum-fraction (or
z-) space. The method is completely general and can be applied to any process.
It is based on solving the Integration-by-Parts identities when one of the
powers of the propagators is an abstract number. The method retains the full
dependence on the Mellin variable and can be implemented in any program for
solving the IBP identities based on algebraic elimination, like Laporta.
General features of the method are: 1) faster reduction, 2) smaller number of
master integrals compared to the usual z-space approach and 3) the master
integrals satisfy difference instead of differential equations. This approach
generalizes previous results related to fully inclusive observables like the
recently calculated three-loop space-like anomalous dimensions and coefficient
functions in inclusive DIS to more general processes requiring separate
treatment of the various physical cuts. Many possible applications of this
method exist, the most notable being the direct evaluation of the three-loop
time-like splitting functions in QCD.
