Estimates of the magnetic field of neutron stars in X-ray pulsars are
obtained using the hypothesis of the equilibrium period for disk and wind
accretion and also from the BATSE data on timing of X-ray pulsars using the
observed maximum spin-down rate. Cyclotron lines at energies $\ge 100$ keV in
several Be-transient are predicted for future observations.
 We suggest a new method of estimating distances to X-ray pulsars and their
magnetic fields. Using observations of fluxes and period variations in the
model of disk accretion one can estimate the magnetic momentum of a neutron
star and the distance to X-ray pulsar.
 As an illustration the method is applied to the system GROJ1008-57.
