We investigate numerically the interactions of two in-phase and out-of-phase
Airy beams and nonlinear accelerating beams in Kerr and saturable nonlinear
media, in one transverse dimension. We find that bound and unbound soliton
pairs, as well as single solitons, can form in such interactions. If the
interval between two incident beams is large relative to the width of their
first lobes, the generated soliton pairs just propagate individually and do not
interact. However, if the interval is comparable to the widths of the maximum
lobes, the pairs interact and display varied behavior. In the in-phase case,
they attract each other and exhibit stable bound, oscillating, and unbound
states, after shedding some radiation initially. In the out-of-phase case, they
repel each other and after an initial interaction, fly away as individual
solitons. While the incident beams display acceleration, the solitons or
soliton pairs generated from those beams do not.
