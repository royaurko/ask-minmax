Maximum gravitational wave emission from binary stars in eccentric orbits
occurs near the periastron passage. We show that for a stationary distribution
of binary neutron stars in the Galaxy, several high-eccentricity systems with
orbital periods in the range from tens of minutes to several days should exist
that emit broad gravitational-wave pulses in the frequency range 1-100 mHz. The
space interferometer LISA could register the pulsed signal from these system at
a signal-to-noise ratio level $S/N>5\sqrt{5}$ in the frequency range $\sim
10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ Hz during one-year observational time. Some detection
algorithms for such a signal are discussed.
