We study the degenerate, the star and the degenerate star chromatic numbers
and their relation to the genus of graphs. As a tool we prove the following
strengthening of a result of Fertin et al.: If $G$ is a graph of maximum degree
$\Delta$, then $G$ admits a degenerate star coloring using $O(\Delta^{3/2})$
colors. We use this result to prove that every graph of genus $g$ admits a
degenerate star coloring with $O(g^{3/5})$ colors. It is also shown that these
results are sharp up to a logarithmic factor.
