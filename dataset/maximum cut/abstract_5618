We have measured the lifetime of spin imbalances in the quasiparticle
population of a superconductor in the frequency domain. A time-dependent spin
imbalance is created by injecting spin-polarised electrons into a thin-film
mesoscopic superconductor (Al) at finite excitation frequencies and finite
magnetic field. The time-averaged value of the spin imbalance as a function of
excitation frequency shows a cut-off corresponding to the spin lifetime. The
spin lifetime is relatively constant in the accessible ranges of magnetic
fields and temperatures; its value is in agreement with previous estimates. Our
data are qualitatively well-described by a theoretical model taking into
account all quasiparticle tunnelling processes from a normal metal into a
superconductor.
