The dilaton action in 3+1 dimensions plays a crucial role in the proof of the
a-theorem. This action arises using Wess-Zumino consistency conditions and
crucially relies on the existence of the trace anomaly. Since there are no
anomalies in odd dimensions, it is interesting to ask how such an action could
arise otherwise. Motivated by this we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to examine
both even and odd dimensional CFTs. We find that in even dimensions, by
promoting the cut-off to a field, one can get an action for this field which
coincides with the WZ action in flat space. In three dimensions, we observe
that by finding an exact Hamilton-Jacobi counterterm, one can find a
non-polynomial action which is invariant under global Weyl rescalings. We
comment on how this finding is tied up with the F-theorem conjectures.
