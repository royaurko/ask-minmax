A definition of $p$-volume of rectangular matrices is given. We generalize
the results for square maximum-volume submatrices to the case rectangular
maximal-volume submatrices and provide estimates for the growth of the
coefficients. Three promising applications of such submatrices are presented:
recommender systems, finding maximal elements in low-rank matrices and
preconditioning of overdetermined linear systems. The code is available online
at \url{https://bitbucket.org/muxas/rect_maxvol}.
