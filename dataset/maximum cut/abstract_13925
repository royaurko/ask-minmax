For broadband wireless communication systems, Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) has been combined with Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO)
techniques. Bit-Interleaved Coded Multiple Beamforming (BICMB) can achieve both
spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing for flat fading MIMO channels. For
frequency selective fading MIMO channels, BICMB with OFDM (BICMB-OFDM) can be
applied to achieve both spatial diversity and multipath diversity, making it an
important technique. However, analyzing the diversity of BICMB-OFDM is a
challenging problem. In this paper, the diversity analysis of BICMB-OFDM is
carried out. First, the maximum achievable diversity is derived and a full
diversity condition RcSL <= 1 is proved, where Rc, S, and L are the code rate,
the number of parallel steams transmitted at each subcarrier, and the number of
channel taps, respectively. Then, the performance degradation due to the
correlation among subcarriers is investigated. Finally, the subcarrier grouping
technique is employed to combat the performance degradation and provide
multi-user compatibility.
