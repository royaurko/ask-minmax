We characterize the reflectance peak near the Brewster angle for both an
interface between two dielectric media and a single slab. To approach this
problem analytically, we approximate the reflectance by a first-order diagonal
Pad\'e. In this way, we calculate the width and the skewness of the peak and we
show that, although they present a well-resolved maximum, they are otherwise
not so markedly dependent on the refractive index.
