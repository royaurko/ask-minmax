We illustrate how the Matrix Element Method at Next-to-Leading Order
(MEM@NLO) can be used to discriminate between events arising from the
production of a Higgs boson, which subsequently decays to a final state
consisting of ell^+ell^-gamma, and the background production of the same final
state. We illustrate how the method could be used in an experimental analysis
by devising cuts on the signal (P_S) and background (P_B) weights that are
computed event-by-event in this approach. We find that we can increase the
S/sqrt(B) ratio by around 50\% compared to an invariant mass fit on its own.
Considering only statistical uncertainty, this is equivalent to recording a
factor of around two times more integrated luminosity.
