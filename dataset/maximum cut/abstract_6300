An equation of state (EOS) of neutron star matter, describing both the
neutron star crust and the liquid core, is calculated. It is based on the
effective nuclear interaction SLy of the Skyrme type, which is particularly
suitable for the application to the calculation of the properties of very
neutron rich matter (Chabanat et al. 1997, 1998). The structure of the crust,
and its EOS, is calculated in the T=0 approximation, and under the assumption
of the ground state composition. The crust-core transition is a very weakly
first-order phase transition, with relative density jump of about one percent.
The EOS of the liquid core is calculated assuming (minimal) n-p-e-mu
composition. Parameters of static neutron stars are calculated and compared
with existing observational data on neutron stars. The minimum and maximum
masses of static neutron stars are 0.094 M_sun and 2.05 M_sun, respectively.
Effects of rotation on the minimum and the maximum mass of neutron stars are
briefly discussed.
