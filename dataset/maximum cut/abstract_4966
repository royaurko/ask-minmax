We study the single spin asymmetries for the $\pi
p^\uparrow\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-X$ process. We consider the asymmetries
contributed by the coupling of the Boer-Mulders function with the transversity
distribution and the pretzelosity distribution, characterized by the
$\sin(\phi+\phi_S)$ and $\sin(3\phi-\phi_S)$ azimuthal angular dependence,
respectively. We estimate the magnitude of these asymmetries at COMPASS by
using proper weighting functions. We find that the $\sin(\phi+\phi_S)$
asymmetry is of the size of a few percent and can be measured through the
experiment. The $\sin(3\phi-\phi_S)$ asymmetry is smaller than the
$\sin(\phi+\phi_S)$ asymmetry. After a cut on $q_T$, we succeed in enhancing
the asymmetry.
