We provide a simple non-perturbative formulation for non-commutative
four-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. The formulation is
constructed by a combination of deconstruction (orbifold projection), momentum
cut-off and matrix model techniques. We also propose a moduli fixing term that
preserves lattice supersymmetry on the deconstruction formulation. Although the
analogous formulation for four-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theories is proposed also in Nucl.Phys.B857(2012), our action is simpler and
better suited for computer simulations. Moreover, not only for the
non-commutative theories, our formulation has a potential to be a
non-perturbative tool also for the commutative four-dimensional N = 2
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories.
