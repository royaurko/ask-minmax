We present an in-depth analysis of the sometimes understated role of the
principle of energy conservation in linear irreversible thermodynamics. Our
case study is that of a thermoelectric generator (TEG), which is a heat engine
of choice in irreversible thermodynamics, owing to the coupling between the
electrical and heat fluxes. We show why Onsager's reciprocal relations must be
considered locally and how internal dissipative processes emerge from the
extension of these relations to a global scale: the linear behavior of a heat
engine at the local scale is associated with a dissipation process that must
partake in the global energy balance. We discuss the consequences of internal
dissipations on the so-called efficiency at maximum power, in the light of our
comparative analyses of exoreversibility and endoreversibility on the one hand,
and of two classes of heat engines, autonomous and periodically-driven, on the
other hand. Finally, basing our analysis on energy conservation, we also
discuss recent works which claim the possibility to overcome the traditional
boundaries on efficiency imposed by finite-time thermodynamics in
thermoelectric systems with broken time-reversal symmetry; this we do by
introducing a "thermal" thermopower and an "electrical" thermopower which
permits an analysis of the thermoelectric response of the TEG considering a
possible dissymmetry between the electrical/thermal and the thermal/electrical
couplings.
