We present complete results for the $O(\alpha_s)$ corrections to the
production of a heavy quark pair plus a hard photon, in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation,
including both photon and $Z$ intermediate states. Virtual corrections are
calculated analytically in $4 - 2 \epsilon$ dimensions, together with the soft
approximation to the real emission diagrams. After cancellation of infrared
divergences, real and virtual contributions are combined numerically to obtain
the cross section for the production of two heavy quark jets plus a hard photon
in next-to-leading order. The resulting fully differential cross section can be
used to construct arbitrary distributions with the desired experimental cuts.
