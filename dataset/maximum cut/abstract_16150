We perform multi-scale non-Gaussianity detection and localization to the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) first-year data in both wavelet and
real spaces. Such an analysis is facilitated by spherical wavelet transform and
inverse transform techniques developed by the YAWtb team. Skewness and kurtosis
as test statistics are calculated on scales from about $1^{\circ}$ to
$30^{\circ}$ on the sky as well as toward different directions using
anisotropic spherical Morlet wavelet (SMW). A maximum deviation from Gaussian
simulations with a right tail probability of $\sim 99.9%$ is detected at an
angular scale of $\sim12^{\circ}$ at an azimuthal orientation of $\sim
0^{\circ}$ on the sky. In addition, some significant non-Gaussian spots have
been identified and localized in real space from both the combined Q-V-W map
recommended by the WMAP team and the Tegmark foreground-cleaned map. Systematic
effects due to beams and noise can be rejected as the source of this
non-Gaussianity. Several tests show that residual foreground contamination may
significantly contribute to this non-Gaussian feature. It is thus still
premature to do more precise tests on the non-Gaussianity of the intrinsic CMB
fluctuations before we can identify the origin of these foreground signals,
understand their nature, and finally remove them from the CMB maps completely.
