In this work we deal with the critical behavior of the bulk viscosity in the
linear sigma model (LSM) as an example of a system which can be treated by
using different techniques. Starting from the Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck
equation we compute the bulk viscosity over entropy density of the LSM in the
large-N limit. We search for a possible maximum of the bulk viscosity over
entropy density at the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition. The
information about this critical temperature, as well as the effective masses,
is obtained from the effective potential. We find that the expected maximum (as
a measure of the conformality loss) is absent in the large N in agreement with
other models in the same limit. However, this maximum appears when, instead of
the large-N limit, the Hartree approximation within the
Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism is used. Nevertheless, this last
approach to the LSM does not give rise to the Goldstone theorem and also
predicts a first order phase transition instead of the expected second order
one. Therefore both, the large-N limit and the CJT-Hartree approximations,
should be considered as complementary for the study of the critical behavior of
the bulk viscosity in the LSM.
