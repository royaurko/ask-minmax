A non perturbative renormalization scheme for Nucleon-Nucleon interaction
based on boundary conditions at short distances is presented and applied to the
One Pion Exchange Potential. It is free of off-shell ambiguities and
ultraviolet divergences, provides finite results at any step of the calculation
and allows to remove the short distance cut-off in a suitable way. Low energy
constants and their non-perturbative evolution can directly be obtained from
experimental threshold parameters in a completely unique and model independent
way when the long range explicit pion effects are eliminated. This allows to
compute scattering phase shifts which are, by construction consistent with the
effective range expansion to a given order in the C.M. momentum $p$. In the
singlet $^1S_0$ and triplet $^3S_1- ^3D_1$ channels ultraviolet fixed points
and limit cycles are obtained respectively for the threshold parameters. Data
are described satisfactorily up to CM momenta of about $p \sim m_\pi$.
