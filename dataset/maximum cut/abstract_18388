We have measured the rest--frame lambda~1500 Ang comoving specific luminosity
density of star--forming galaxies at redshift 3.5<z<6.5 from deep images taken
with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)and the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS),
obtained as part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). We
used color selection criteria to construct samples of star--forming galaxies at
redshifts z~4, 5 and 6, identified by the signature of the 912 Ang Lyman
continuum discontinuity and Lyman-alpha forest blanketing in their rest--frame
UV colors (Lyman--break galaxies). The ACS samples cover ~0.09 square degree,
and are also relatively deep, reaching between 0.2 and 0.5 L_3^*, depending on
the redshift, where $L_3^*$ is the characteristic UV luminosity of Lyman--break
galaxies at z~3. The specific luminosity density of Lyman--break galaxies
appears to be nearly constant with redshift from z~3 to z~6, although the
measure at z~6 remains relatively uncertain, because it depends on the accurate
estimate of the faint counts of the z~6 sample. If Lyman--break galaxies are
fair tracers of the cosmic star formation activity, our results suggest that at
z~6 the universe was already producing stars as vigorously as it did near its
maximum several Gyr later, at 1<~z<~3. Thus, the onset of large--scale star
formation in the universe is to be sought at around z~6 or higher, namely at
less than ~7% of the current cosmic age.
