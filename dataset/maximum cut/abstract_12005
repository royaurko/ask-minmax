Critical current measurements were made on thin films of YBa2Cu3O7-delta and
Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-delta produced by sol-gel and pulsed laser deposition,
respectively. Both samples have high critical currents at low temperatures and
the critical current, Jc, is largest in the overdoped Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-delta
thin film. Annealing studies show a large increase in Jc with increasing hole
concentration and suggests that the maximum Jc should occur for overdoped
samples. The very overdoped region of the superconducting phase diagram was
probed by studying bulk ceramic Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-delta samples, where it was
found that the irreversibility field systematically increases with increasing
hole concentration when scaled by the reduced temperature (t = (1 - T/Tc)).
