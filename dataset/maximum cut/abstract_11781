We report an investigation of the heterogeneity in super-cooled liquids and
glasses using the non-Gaussianity parameter. We simulate selenium and a binary
Lennard-Jones system by molecular dynamics. In the non-Gaussianity three time
domains can be distinguished. First there is an increase on the ps-scale due to
the vibrational (ballistic) motion of the atoms. This is followed, on an
intermediate time-scale, by a growth, due to local relaxations
(beta-relaxation) at not too high temperatures. A maximum is reached at times
corresponding to long range diffusion (alpha-relaxation). At long times the
non-Gaussianity slowly drops, the system becoming homogeneous on these
time-scales. In both systems studied, the non-Gaussianity follows in the
intermediate time domain, corresponding to the beta-relaxations, a law ~ t^1/2.
This general behavior is explained by collective hopping and dynamic
heterogeneity. We support this finding by a model calculation.
