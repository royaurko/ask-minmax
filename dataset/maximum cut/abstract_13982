We report on the properties of strong pulses from PSR B0656+14 by analyzing
the data obtained using Urumqi 25-m radio telescope at 1540 MHz from August
2007 to September 2010. In 44 hrs of observational data, a total of 67 pulses
with signal-to-noise ratios above a 5-{\sigma} threshold were detected. The
peak flux densities of these pulses are 58 to 194 times that of the average
profile, and the pulse energies of them are 3 to 68 times that of the average
pulse. These pulses are clustered around phases about 5 degrees ahead of the
peak of the average profile. Comparing with the width of the average profile,
they are relatively narrow, with the full widths at half-maximum range from
0.28 to 1.78 degrees. The distribution of pulse-energies of the pulses follows
a lognormal distribution. These sporadic strong pulses detected from PSR
B0656+14 are different in character from the typical giant pulses, and from its
regular pulses.
