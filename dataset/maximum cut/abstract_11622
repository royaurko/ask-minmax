In this paper, we restudy the spectral lag features of short bright gamma-ray
bursts (T90 < 2.6s) with a BATSE time-tagged event (TTE) sample including 65
single pulse bursts. We also make an investigation on the characteristics of
ratios between the spectral lag and the full width at half maximum ($FWHM$) of
the pulses, called relative spectral lags (RSLs). We draw the conclusions as
follows: 1) Spectral lags of short GRBs are normally distributed and
concentrated on around the value of 0.014 with 40 percent of them having
negative lags. With K-S test, we find the lag distribution is identical with a
normal one caused by white noises, which indicates the lags of the vast
majority of short bursts are so small that they are negligible as Norris et al.
have suggested.
