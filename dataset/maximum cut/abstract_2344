In the present paper we consider the interacting holographic model of dark
energy to investigate the validity of the generalized second laws of
thermodynamics in non-flat (closed) universe enclosed by the event horizon
measured from the sphere of the horizon named $L$. We show that for $L$ as the
system's IR cut-off the generalized second law is respected for the special
range of the deceleration parameter.
