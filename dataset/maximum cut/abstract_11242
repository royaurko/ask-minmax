Circularization of late-type main-sequence binaries is usually attributed to
turbulent convection, while that of early-type binaries is explained by
resonant excitation of g modes. We show that the latter mechanism operates in
solar-type stars also and is at least as effective as convection, despite
inefficient damping of g modes in the radiative core. The maximum period at
which this mechanism can circularize a binary composed of solar-type stars in
10 Gyr is as low as 3 days, if the modes are damped by radiative diffusion only
and g-mode resonances are fixed; or as high as 6 days, if one allows for
evolution of the resonances and for nonlinear damping near inner turning
points. Even the larger theoretical period falls short of the observed
transition period by a factor two.
