The possibility of ferromagnetic ordering is revisited in the band model. The
coherent potential approximation decoupling has been used for the strong
on-site Coulomb interaction. The driving forces towards the ferromagnetism are
the on-site and inter-site molecular fields coming from different Coulomb
interactions. Another driving force is the lowering of the kinetic energy with
growing magnetic moment coming from the dependence of the hopping integrals on
occupation of the neighboring sites involved in hopping. This effect is
described by the hopping interaction, $\Delta t$, and by what we call the
exchange-hopping interaction, $t_{ex}$. The exchange-hopping interaction, which
is the difference in hopping integrals for different occupation of neighboring
lattice sites, acts in analogous way to the Hund's magnetic exchange
interaction. The results are calculated for semi-elliptic density of states
(DOS) and for the distorted semi-elliptic DOS with the maximum around the Fermi
energy. They show a natural tendency towards the magnetic ordering at the end
of the 3d row for the DOS with maximum density around the Fermi energy, when
the hopping integrals grow with the occupation of the neighboring lattice
sites.
