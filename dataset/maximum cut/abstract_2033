In the context of a simple microscopic schematic scalar model we study the
effects of spatial correlations in force transmission in granular assemblies.
We show that the parameters of the normalized weights distribution function,
$P(v)\sim v^{\alpha}\exp(-v/\phi)$, strongly depend on the spatial extensions,
$\xi_V$, of such correlations. We show, then, the connections between
measurable macroscopic quantities and microscopic mechanisms enhancing
correlations. In particular we evaluate how the exponential cut-off,
$\phi(\xi_V)$, and the small forces power law exponent, $\alpha(\xi_V)$, depend
on the correlation length, $\xi_V$. If correlations go to infinity, weights are
power law distributed.
