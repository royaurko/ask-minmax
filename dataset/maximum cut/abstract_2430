It is shown, in the context of a recent formulation of elementary particles
in terms of, what may be called, a Quantum Mechanical Kerr-Newman metric, that
spin is a consequence of a space-time cut off at the Compton wavelength and
Compton time scale. On this basis, we deduce the Dirac equation from a simple
coordinate transformation.
