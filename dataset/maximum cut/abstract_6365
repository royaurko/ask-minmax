A new method has been proposed to evaluate the frictional force in the
stationary state. This method is applied to the 1-dimensional model of clean
surfaces. The kinetic frictional force is seen to depend on velocity in
general, but the dependence becomes weaker as the maximum static frictional
force increases and in the limiting case the kinetic friction gets only weakly
dependent on velocity as described by one of the laws of friction. It is also
shown that there is a phase transition between state with vanishing maximum
static frictional force and that with finite one. The role of randomness at the
interface and the relation to the impurity pinning of the sliding
Charge-Density-Wave are discussed. to appear in Phys.Rev.B. abstract only. Full
