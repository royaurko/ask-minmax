A sixth order quadrupole boson Hamiltonian is treated through a time
dependent variational principle approach choosing as trial function a coherent
state with respect to zeroth $b^{\dagger}_0$ and second
$b^{\dagger}_2+b^{\dagger}_{-2}$ components of the quadrupole bosons. The
coefficients involved in the model Hamiltonian are chosen so that the classical
effective potential energy term has two distinct minima. The equation of motion
for the radial coordinate is analytically solved and the resulting trajectories
are extensively studied. One distinguishes three energy regions exhibiting
different types of trajectories. When one passes from the region characterized
by two wells to the region of energies higher than the maximum value of the
effective potential the trajectories period exhibits a singularity which
reflects a phase transition. The classical trajectories are quantized by a
constraint similar to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition. The
semiclassical spectra corresponding to the two potential wells have specific
properties. The tunneling process through the potential barrier is also
studied. The transmission coefficients exhibit jumps in magnitude when the
angular momentum acquires certain values.
