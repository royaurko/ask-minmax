We present results of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy (STS)
measurements on the "Kondo insulator" SmB$_6$. The vast majority of surface
areas investigated was reconstructed but, infrequently, also patches of varying
size of non-reconstructed, Sm- or B-terminated surfaces were found. On the
smallest patches, clear indications for the hybridization gap and
inter-multiplet transitions were observed. On non-reconstructed surface areas
large enough for coherent co-tunneling we were able to observe clear-cut Fano
resonances. Our locally resolved STS indicated considerable finite conductance
on all surfaces independent of their structure.
