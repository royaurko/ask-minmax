In this paper, we present two programs to fit M_W at LEP2 using the best
measurable kinematical variables. The theoretical probabilities of observing
the final-state kinematical configurations are computed by integrating over the
quantities that are not well measured. Therefore, an event-by-event kinematical
reconstruction is avoided. M_W is then determined through a maximum likelihood
fit.
