We quantify the effects of the voids known to exist in the Universe upon the
reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state $w$. We show that the
effect can start to be comparable with some of the other errors taken into
account when analysing supernova data, depending strongly upon the low redshift
cut-off used in the sample. For the supernova data alone, the error induced in
the reconstruction of $w$ is much larger than the percent level. When the
Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and the CMB data are included in the fit, the
effect of the voids upon the determination of $w$ is much lessened, but is not
much smaller than some of the other errors taken into consideration when
performing such fits.
