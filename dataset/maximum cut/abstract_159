We describe a web of connections between the following topics: the
mathematical theory of voting and social choice; the computational complexity
of the Maximum Cut problem; the Gaussian Isoperimetric Inequality and Borell's
generalization thereof; the Hypercontractive Inequality of Bonami; and, the
analysis of Boolean functions. A major theme is the technique of reducing
inequalities about Gaussian functions to inequalities about Boolean functions f
: {-1,1}^n -> {-1,1}, and then using induction on n to further reduce to
inequalities about functions f : {-1,1} -> {-1,1}. We especially highlight De,
Mossel, and Neeman's recent use of this technique to prove the Majority Is
Stablest Theorem and Borell's Isoperimetric Inequality simultaneously.
