The alliance polynomial of a graph $G$ with order $n$ and maximum degree
$\Delta$ is the polynomial $A(G; x) = \sum_{k=-\Delta}^{\Delta} A_{k}(G) \,
x^{n+k}$, where $A_{k}(G)$ is the number of exact defensive $k$-alliances in
$G$. We obtain some properties of $A(G; x)$ and its coefficients for regular
graphs. In particular, we characterize the degree of regular graphs by the
number of non-zero coefficients of their alliance polynomial. Besides, we prove
that the family of alliance polynomials of $\Delta$-regular graphs with small
degree is a very special one, since it does not contain alliance polynomials of
graphs which are not $\Delta$-regular. By using this last result and direct
computation we find that the alliance polynomial determines uniquely each cubic
graph of order less than or equal to $10$.
