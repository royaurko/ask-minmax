Although primarily aimed at the galactic archeology and evolution, automated
all-sky spectroscopic surveys (RAVE, SDSS) are also a valuable source for the
binary star research community. Identification of double-lined spectra is easy
and it is not limited by the rare occurrences of eclipses. When the spectrum is
properly classified, its atmospheric parameters can be calculated by comparing
the spectrum with the best fit atmosphere model. We present the analysis of the
binary stars from the sample of roughly 250.000 RAVE survey spectra. The
classification and binary discovery method is based on the correlation function
analysis. The comparison of these spectra with the model shows that it is
possible to estimate the essential atmospheric parameters relatively well.
Large number of such estimates and the fact that RAVE consists of a magnitude
selected sample without any color cuts makes it suitable for a binary star
population study.
