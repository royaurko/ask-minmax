A low momentum nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential V-low-k is derived from meson
exhange potentials by integrating out the model dependent high momentum modes
of V_NN. The smooth and approximately unique V-low-k is used as input for shell
model calculations instead of the usual Brueckner G matrix. Such an approach
eliminates the nuclear mass dependence of the input interaction one finds in
the G matrix approach, allowing the same input interaction to be used in
different nuclear regions. Shell model calculations of 18O, 134Te and 135I
using the same input V-low-k have been performed. For cut-off momentum Lambda
in the vicinity of 2 fm-1, our calculated low-lying spectra for these nuclei
are in good agreement with experiments, and are weakly dependent on Lambda.
