We compute the maximum mass of moderately rotating strange stars as a
function of the strange quark mass, of the QCD coupling constant, $\alpha_c$,
and of the bag constant (vacuum energy density), $B$, in the MIT bag model of
quark matter with lowest order quark-gluon interactions. For a fixed value of
$B$, the maximum stellar mass depends only weakly on $\alpha_c$, and is
independent of this coupling in the limit of massless quarks. However, if it is
the value of the chemical potential of quark matter at zero pressure which is
held constant, for example at the value corresponding to the stability limit of
nucleons against conversion to quark matter, the maximum mass of the strange
star is higher by up to 25% for $\alpha_c=0.6$, than for non-interacting
quarks, and this may be relevant in the discussion of kHz QPO sources. The
maximum mass of a non-rotating strange star could be sufficiently high to allow
an orbital frequency as low as 1.0 kHz in the marginally stable orbit. However,
for all $\alpha_c<0.6$, the stellar mass cannot exceed $2.6M_\odot$ at any
rotational period $\ge1.6 $ms.
