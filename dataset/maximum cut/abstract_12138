We have derived a universal relaxation function for heterogeneous materials
using the maximum entropy principle for nonextensive systems. The power law
exponents of the relaxation function are simply related to a global fractal
parameter and for large time to the entropy nonextensivity parameter q. For
intermediate times the relaxation follows a stretched exponential behavior. The
asymptotic power law behaviors both in the time and the frequency domains
coincide with those of the Weron generalized dielectric function derived in the
stochastic theory from an extension of the Levy central limit theorem. These
results are in full agreement with the Jonscher universality principle and find
application in the characterization of the dielectric properties of aerogels
catalytic supports as well as in the problem of the relation between morphology
and dielectric properties of polymer composites.
