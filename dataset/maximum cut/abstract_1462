From the analysis of Dopplergrams in the K I 7699 A and Na I 5890 A spectral
lines observed with the Magneto-Optical filter at Two Heights (MOTH) experiment
during the austral summer in 2002-03 we find upward traveling waves in magnetic
regions. Our analysis shows that the dispersion relation of these waves
strongly depends on whether the wave is detected in the low-beta or high-beta
regime. Moreover, the observed dispersion relation does not show the expected
decrease of the acoustic cut-off frequency for the field guided slow magnetic
wave. Instead, we detected an increase of the travel times below the acoustic
cut-off frequency and at the same time a decrease of the travel time above it.
To study the formation height of the spectral lines employed by MOTH in greater
detail we are currently in the process of employing 3D MHD simulations carried
out with CO5BOLD to perform NLTE spectral synthesis.
