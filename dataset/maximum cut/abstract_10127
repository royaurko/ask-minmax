In making inference on the relation between failure and exposure histories in
the Cox semiparametric model, the maximum partial likelihood estimator (MPLE)
of the finite dimensional odds parameter, and the Breslow estimator of the
baseline survival function, are known to achieve full efficiency when data is
available for all time on all cohort members, even when the covariates are time
dependent. When cohort sizes become too large for the collection of complete
data, sampling schemes such as nested case control sampling must be used and,
under various models, there exist estimators based on the same information as
the MPLE having smaller asymptotic variance. Though the MPLE is therefore not
efficient under sampling in general, it approaches efficiency in highly
stratified situations, or instances where the covariate values are increasingly
less dependent upon the past, when the covariate distribution, not depending on
the real parameter of interest, is unknown and there is no censoring. In
particular, in such situations, when using the nested case control sampling
design, both the MPLE and the Breslow estimator of the baseline survival
function achieve the information lower bound both in the distributional and the
minimax senses in the limit as the number of cohort members tends to infinity.
