In this paper, we recalibrate the Cepheid distance to some nearby galaxies
observed by the HST Key Project (KP) and the Sandage-Tammann-Saha (STS) group.
We use much of the KP methodology in our analysis but apply new techniques,
based on Fourier methods to estimate the mean magnitudes to published Cepheid
data. We also apply different calibrating PL relations to estimate Cepheid
distances, and investigate the sensitivity of the distance moduli to the
adopted calibrating PL relation. We re-determine the OGLE LMC PL relations
using a more conservative approach and also study the effect of using Galactic
PL relations on the distance scale. For the KP galaxies, we find good agreement
with an average discrepancy of -0.002 and 0.075mag. when using the LMC and
Galaxy, respectively, as a calibrating PL relation. However, the Cepheid
distance to STS galaxies are shorter by -0.178mag. and -0.108mag. on average
again when using the LMC and Galaxy PL relations, respectively. We also
calculate the distance to these galaxies using PL relations at maximum light
and find very good agreement with mean light PL distances. However, after
correcting for metallicity effects, the difference between the distance moduli
obtained using the two sets of calibrating PL relations becomes negligible.
This suggests that Cepheids in the LMC and Galaxy do follow different PL
relations, at least at the median periods of the target galaxies.
