We present Suzaku XIS observation of V2491 Cyg (Nova Cyg 2008 No. 2) obtained
in quiescence, more than two years after the outburst. The nova was detected as
a very luminous source in a wide spectral range from soft to hard X-rays. A
very soft blackbody-like component peaking at 0.5 keV indicates that either we
observe remaining, localized hydrogen burning on the surface of the white
dwarf, or accretion onto a magnetized polar cap. In the second case, V2491 Cyg
is a candidate "soft intermediate polar". We obtained the best fit for the
X-ray spectra with several components: two of thermal plasma, a blackbody and a
complex absorber. The later is typical of intermediate polars. The X-ray
light-curve shows a modulation with a $\sim$38 min period. The amplitude of
this modulation is strongly energy dependent and reaches maximum in the
0.8--2.0 keV range. We discuss the origin of the X-ray emission and pulsations,
and the likelihood of the intermediate polar scenario.
