In this paper, we study a class of quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation of
the form $$-\varepsilon^2\Delta
u+V(x)u-\varepsilon^2(\Delta(|u|^{2\alpha}))|u|^{2\alpha-2}u
&=&\lambda|u|^{q-2}u+|u|^{2^*(2\alpha)-2}u,\quad\mbox{in}{\mathbb{R}}^N, $$
where $\varepsilon>0,\lambda>0,q\geq2,\alpha>1/2$ are constants, $N\geq3$. By
using change of variable and variational approach, the existence of positive
solution which has a local maximum point and decays exponentially is obtained.
