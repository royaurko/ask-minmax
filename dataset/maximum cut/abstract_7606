Say that mu is a ``subpartition'' of an integer partition lambda if the
multiset of parts of mu is a submultiset of the parts of lambda, and define an
integer partition lambda to be ``wide'' if for every subpartition mu of lambda,
mu >= mu' in dominance order (where mu' denotes the conjugate or transpose of
mu). Then Brian Taylor and the first contributor have conjectured that an integer
partition lambda is wide if and only if there exists a tableau of shape lambda
such that (1) for all i, the entries in the ith row of the tableau are
precisely the integers from 1 to lambda_i inclusive, and (2) for all j, the
entries in the jth column of the tableau are pairwise distinct. This conjecture
was originally motivated by Rota's basis conjecture and, if true, yields a new
class of integer multiflow problems that satisfy max-flow min-cut and
integrality. Wide partitions also yield a class of graphs that satisfy
``delta-conjugacy'' (in the sense of Greene and Kleitman), and the above
conjecture implies that these graphs furthermore have a completely saturated
stable set partition. We present several partial results, but the conjecture
remains very much open.
