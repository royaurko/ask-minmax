A spin-rotation-invariant Green's-function theory of long-range and
short-range order (SRO) in the $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with
spatially anisotropic couplings on a simple cubic lattice is presented. The
staggered magnetization, the two-spin correlation functions, the correlation
leng spin-rotation-invariant Green's-function theory of long-range and
short-range order (SRO) in the $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with
spatially anisotropic couplings on a simple cubic lattice is presented. The
staggered magnetization, the two-spin correlation functions, the correlation
lengths, and the static spin susceptibility are calculated self-consistently
over the whole temperature region, where the effects of spatial anisotropy are
explored. As compared with previous spin-wave approaches, the N\'{e}el
temperature is reduced by the improved description of SRO. The maximum in the
temperature dependence of the uniform static susceptibility is shifted with
anisotropy and is ascribed to the decrease of SRO with increasing temperature.
Comparing the theory with experimental data for the magnetization and
correlation length of La$_2$CuO$_4$, a good agreement in the temperature
dependences is obtained.
