We determine the set of all genus g bridge numbers of many iterated torus
knots, listing these numbers in a sequence called the bridge spectrum. In
addition, we prove a structural lemma about the decomposition of a strongly
irreducible bridge surface induced by cutting along a collection of essential
surfaces.
