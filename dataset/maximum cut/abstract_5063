Discovery of the Higgs boson in any decay channel depends on the existence of
event variables or cuts with sensitivity to the presence of the Higgs. We
demonstrate the non-optimality of the kinematic variables which are currently
expected to play the largest role in the discovery (or exclusion) of the Higgs
at the LHC in the tau channel. Any LHC collaboration looking for opportunities
to gain advantages over its rivals should, perhaps, consider the alternative
strategy we propose.
