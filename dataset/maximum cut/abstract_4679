For logarithmically divergent one-loop lattice Feynman integrals I(p,a),
subject to mild general conditions, we prove the following expected and crucial
structural result: I(p,a) = f(p)log(aM)+g(p)+h(p,M) up to terms which vanish
for lattice spacing a -> 0. Here p denotes collectively the external momenta
and M is a mass scale which may be chosen arbitrarily. The f(p) and h(p,M) are
shown to be universal and coincide with analogous quantities in the
corresponding continuum integral when the latter is regularized either by
momentum cut-off or dimensional regularization. The non-universal term g(p) is
shown to be a homogeneous polynomial in p of the same degree as f(p). This
structure is essential for consistency between renormalized lattice and
continuum formulations of QCD at one loop.
