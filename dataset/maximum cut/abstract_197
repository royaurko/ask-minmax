Dynamics of central collisions of heavy nuclei in the energy range from few
tens of MeV/nucleon to a couple of GeV/nucleon is discussed. As the beam energy
increases and/or the impact parameter decreases, the maximum compression
increases. It is argued that the hydrodynamic behavior of matter sets in the
vicinity of balance energy. At higher energies shock fronts are observed to
form within head-on reaction simulations, perpendicular to beam axis and
separating hot compressed matter from cold. In the semicentral reactions a weak
tangential discontinuity develops in-between these fronts. The hot compressed
matter exposed to the vacuum in directions parallel to the shock fronts begins
to expand collectively into these directions. The expansion affects particle
angular distributions and mean energy components and further shapes of spectra
and mean energies of particles emitted into any one direction. The variation of
slopes and the relative yields measured within the FOPI collaboration are in a
general agreement with the results of simulations. As to the FOPI data on
stopping, they are consistent with the preference for transverse over the
longitudinal motion in the head-on Au + Au collisions. Unfortunately, though,
the data cannot be used to decide directly on that preference due to acceptance
cuts. Tied to the spatial and temporal changes in the reactions are changes in
the entropy per nucleon.
