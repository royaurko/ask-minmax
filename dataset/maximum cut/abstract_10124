The Garman-Klass unbiased estimator of the variance per unit time of a
zero-drift Brownian Motion B, based on the usual financial data that reports
for time windows of equal length the open (OPEN), minimum (MIN), maximum (MAX)
and close (CLOSE) values, is quadratic in the statistic S1=(CLOSE-OPEN,
OPEN-MIN, MAX-OPEN). This estimator, with efficiency 7.4 with respect to the
classical estimator (CLOSE-OPEN)^2, is widely believed to be of minimal
variance. The current report disproves this belief by exhibiting an unbiased
estimator with slightly but strictly higher efficiency 7.7322. The essence of
the improvement lies in the observation that the data should be compressed to
the statistic S2 defined on W(t)= B(0)+[B(t)-B(0)]sign[(B(1)-B(0)] as S1 was
defined on the Brownian path B(t). The best S2-based quadratic unbiased
estimator is presented explicitly. The Cramer-Rao upper bound for the
efficiency of unbiased estimators, corresponding to the efficiency of
large-sample Maximum Likelihood estimators, is 8.471. This bound cannot be
attained because the distribution is not of exponential type. Regression-fitted
quadratic functions of S2 (with mean 1) markedly out-perform those of S1 when
applied to random walks with heavy-tail-distributed increments. Performance is
empirically studied in terms of the tail parameter.
