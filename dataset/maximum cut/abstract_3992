We adopted uvby Stroemgren photometry to investigate the metallicity
distribution of Omega Cen Red Giant (RG) stars. We provided a new empirical
calibration of the Stroemgren m1 = (v-b)-(b-y) metallicity index based on
cluster stars. The new calibration has been applied to a sample of Omega Cen
RGs. The shape of the estimated metallicity distribution is clearly asymmetric,
with a sharp cut-off at low metallicities ([Fe/H] < -2.0) and a metal-rich tail
up to [Fe/H] ~ 0.0. Two main metallicity peaks have been identified, around
[Fe/H] ~ -1.9 and -1.3 dex, and a metal-rich shoulder at ~ 0.2 dex.
