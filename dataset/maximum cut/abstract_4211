We calculate the $B_K$ parameter within the framework of the $1/N_c$
expansion. We essentially use the technique presented by Bardeen, Buras and
G\'erard but calculate an off-shell Green function in order to disentangle
different contributions. We study this Green function in pure Chiral
Perturbation Theory (CHPT) first and afterwards in the $1/N_c$ expansion in the
presence of an explicit cut-off to determine $B_K$ and the counterterms
appearing in CHPT. The high energy part is done using the renormalization
group. For the low-energy contributions we use both CHPT and an Extended
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. This model has the right properties to match with
the high energy QCD behaviour. We then study explicit chiral symmetry breaking
effects by calculating with both massless and degenerate quarks together with
the real case. A detailed analysis and comparison with the results found within
other approaches is done. Consequences for present lattice calculations of this
parameter are then obtained. As final result we get $0.60 < \hat B_K < 0.80$.
If $m_s=m_d=0$ we get $0.25 < \hat B^\chi_K < 0.55$.
