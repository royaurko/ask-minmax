We examine the validity of Hertz's linear elastic theory for central
collisions using a viscoelastic model. This model explains why Hertz's theory
is accurate in predicting the collision time and maximum contact area even when
$40\%$ of the kinetic energy is lost due to viscous dissipation. The main
reason is that both the collision time and maximum contact area have a very
weak dependence on the impact velocity. Moreover, we show that colliding
objects exhibit an apparent size dependent yield strength, which results from
larger objects dissipating less energy at a given impact velocity.
