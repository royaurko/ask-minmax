The connection between the radio emission from "lightnings" produced by the
absorption of high-energy photons from the cosmic gamma-ray background in a
neutron star magnetosphere and radio bursts from rotating radio transients
(RRATs) is investigated. The lightning length reaches 1000 km; the lightning
radius is 100 m and is comparable to the polar cap radius. If a closed
magnetosphere is filled with a dense plasma, then lightnings are efficiently
formed only in the region of open magnetic field lines. For the radio emission
from a separate lightning to be observed, the polar cap of the neutron star
must be directed toward the observer and, at the same time, the lightning must
be formed. The maximum burst rate is related to the time of the plasma outflow
from the polar cap region. The typical interval between two consecutive bursts
is ~100 s. The width of a single radio burst can be determined both by the
width of the emission cone formed by the lightning emitting regions at some
height above the neutron star surface and by a finite lightning lifetime. The
width of the phase distribution for radio bursts from RRATs, along with the
integrated pulse width, is determined by the width of the bundle of open
magnetic field lines at the formation height of the radio emission. The results
obtained are consistent with the currently available data and are indicative of
a close connection between RRATs, intermittent pulsars, and extreme nullers.
