Suzaku Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) achieved the lowest background level than
any other previously or currently operational missions sensitive in the energy
range of 10--600 keV, by utilizing PIN photodiodes and GSO scintillators
mounted in the BGO active shields to reject particle background and
Compton-scattered events as much as possible. Because it does not have imaging
capability nor rocking mode for the background monitor, the sensitivity is
limited by the reproducibility of the non X-ray background (NXB) model. We
modeled the HXD NXB, which varies with time as well as other satellites with a
low-earth orbit, by utilizing several parameters, including particle monitor
counts and satellite orbital/attitude information. The model background is
supplied as an event file in which the background events are generated by
random numbers, and can be analyzed in the same way as the real data. The
reproducibility of the NXB model depends on the event selection criteria (such
as cut-off rigidity and energy band) and the integration time, and the 1sigma
systematic error is estimated to be less than 3% (PIN 15--40 keV) and 1% (GSO
50--100 keV) for more than 10 ksec exposure.
