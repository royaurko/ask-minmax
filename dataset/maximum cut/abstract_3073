We study lattice gas models with the imposition of a constraint on the
maximum number of bonds (nearest neighbor interactions) that particles can
participate in. The critical parameters, as well as the coexistence region are
studied using the mean field approximation and the Bethe-Peierls approximation.
We find that the reduction of the number of interactions suppresses the
temperature-density region where the liquid and gas phases coexist. We confirm
these results from simulations using the histogram reweighting method employing
grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations.
