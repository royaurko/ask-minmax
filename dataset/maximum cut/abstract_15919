We study the temporal/spectral variability of two extragalactic TeV sources,
Mrk 421 and Mrk 501, based on 5-year observations with the ASCA and RXTE
satellites. We found that the peak of the synchrotron emission exists just in
the X-ray band and its position shifted from lower to higher energy when the
source became brighter. Relationship between the peak energy and peak
luminosity showed quite different behavior in the two sources; Mrk 421 showed
very little change in the peak position (0.5-2 keV), while Mrk 501 revealed the
largest shift ever observed in blazars (1-100 keV). We analyze these X-ray data
with the flux changes in TeV band, which are obtained from 35 truly
simultateneous observations. Very different spectral evolution of both objects
indicates some differences in the electron acceleration mechanism at work
during the flares. We argue that the flux variability of Mrk 421 is associated
with an increase in the number of electrons, while the flare of Mrk 501 is
mostly due to the large changes in maximum energy of electrons. We also discuss
the characteristic temporal variability of TeV sources, and implications for
the X-ray emitting site in the relativistic jet.
