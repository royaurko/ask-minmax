Convenience and safeguarding our home appliances have become an important
issue when dealing with an advancement and growth of an economy. This research
focuses on the design and construction of a Dual Sensor heat-monitoring system.
The circuit works by monitoring temperature from an external input and
comparing the temperature level with that of a preset temperature value. The
power output of the circuit is cut off or switched OFF or an alarm is triggered
ON if the temperature of the external input is equal to or, greater than the
preset temperature value. The methodology involves the application of linear
precision temperature sensors i.e., they generate a voltage that is directly
proportional to the temperature. Basically the system is constructed using
temperature sensors and comparators. The system is powered using a 12V power
supply. The results of the tests showed that the power output of the circuit is
switched OFF hence switching OFF the heating device or an alarm is triggered ON
when the device exceeded a preset temperature level. The general operation of
the system and performance is dependent on the temperature difference between
the preset temperature value and external temperature intended to be monitored.
The overall system was tested and found perfectly functional.
