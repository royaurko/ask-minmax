Little Higgs models are formulated as effective theories with a cut-off of up
to 100 times the electroweak scale. Neutrino masses are then a puzzle, since
the usual see-saw mechanism involves a much higher scale that would introduce
quadratic corrections to the Higgs mass parameter. We propose a model that can
naturally accommodate the observed neutrino masses and mixings in Little Higgs
scenarios. Our framework does not involve any large scale or suppressed Yukawa
couplings, and it implies the presence of three extra (Dirac) neutrinos at the
TeV scale. The masses of the light neutrinos are induced radiatively, they are
proportional to small (\approx keV) mass parameters that break lepton number
and are suppressed by the Little Higgs cut-off.
