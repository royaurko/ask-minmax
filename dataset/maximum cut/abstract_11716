Temperature-dependence and magnetic field-dependence of the Hall effect and
the magnetic property in manganese-oxide thin films are studied. The
spontaneous magnetization and the Hall resistivity are obtained for a various
of magnetic fields over all the temperature. It is shown that the Hall
resistivity in small magnetic field is to exhibit maximum near the Curie point,
and strong magnetic field moves the position of the Hall resistivity peak to
much high temperature and suppresses the peak value. The change of the Hall
resistance in strong magnetic field may be larger than that of the diagonal
ones. The abnormal Hall resistivity in the ferromagnetic manganese-oxide
thin-films is attributed to the spin-correlation fluctuation scattering.
