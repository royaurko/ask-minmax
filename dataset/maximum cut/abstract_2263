We investigate the QED Compton process (both elastic and inelastic) in
unpolarized and longitudinally polarized electron-proton scattering. The cross
section can be expressed in terms of the equivalent photon distribution of the
proton. We provide the necessary kinematical cuts to extract the photon content
of the proton at HERMES and eRHIC. We point out that such a process can give
valuable information on $g_1(x_B, Q^2)$ in the small $x_B$, broad $Q^2$ region
at eRHIC and especially in the lower $Q^2$, medium $x_B$ region in fixed target
experiments.
