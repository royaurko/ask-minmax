A sample of 427 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), measured by the RHESSI satellite, is
studied statistically with respect to duration and hardness ratio. Standard
statistical tests are used, such as $\chi^2$, F-test and the maximum likelihood
ratio test, in order to compare the number of GRB groups in the RHESSI database
with that of the BATSE database. Previous studies based on the BATSE Catalog
claim the existence of an intermediate GRB group, besides the long and short
groups. Using only the GRB duration $T_{90}$ as information and $\chi^2$ or
F-test, we have not found any statistically significant intermediate group in
the RHESSI data. However, maximum likelihood ratio test reveals a significant
intermediate group. Also using the 2-dimensional hardness / $T_{90}$ plane, the
maximum likelihood analysis reveals a significant intermediate group. Contrary
to the BATSE database, the intermediate group in the RHESSI data-set is harder
than the long one. The existence of an intermediate group follows not only from
the BATSE data-set, but also from the RHESSI one.
