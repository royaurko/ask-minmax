In the hadronic phase, the dominant configuration of QCD with two flavors of
massless quarks is a gas of massless pions. We calculate the bulk viscosity
(zeta) using the Boltzmann equation with the kinetic theory generalized to
incorporate the trace anomaly. We find that the dimensionless ratio zeta/s, s
being the entropy density, is monotonic increasing below T=120 MeV, where
chiral perturbation theory is applicable. This, combined with previous results,
shows that zeta/s reaches its maximum near the phase transition temperature Tc,
while eta/s, eta being the shear viscosity, reaches its minimum near Tc in QCD
with massless quarks.
