Feedback between training and competition should be considered in athletic
training.The aim of the study was contemporary coaching tendencies in women s
and men s judo with particular focus on a biomechanical classification of
throws and grappling actions. Throwing technique frequencies grouped in the
seven biomechanical classes were dependent on gender. A significant difference
was found between frequencies of variable arm of physical lever technique
scored by males and females as compared to the techniques counts. Significant
differences between men who competed in extra lightweight and heavy weight
concerned the frequency of the techniques used with maximum arm or variable arm
of physical lever and a couple of forces applied by trunk and legs.In females a
tendency to higher frequency of techniques that used couple of forces applied
by arm or arms and leg was observed in extra lightweight compared to the heavy
weight. Because the technique preferred in the fight depends on a gender and
weight category of a judoka, the relationships found in this study, which can
be justified by the biomechanics of throws, should be taken into consideration
in technical and tactical coaching of the contestants. A method used in this
study can be recommended for future research concerning coaching tendencies
