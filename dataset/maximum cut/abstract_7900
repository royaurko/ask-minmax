Inclusive Proton/pion ratios show an enhancement at intermediate transverse
momentum (P_{T} ~ 1.5 - 4.0 GeV/c) in central sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 GeV Au+Au
collisions compared to peripheral Au+Au and p+p collisions. This effect
suggests a production mechanism, different from fragmentation, which is
consistent with coalescence and recombination models. A high E_{T} trigger
particle selects a surface-biased jet, which is measured to have a similar
p_{T} distribution as a p+p jet. This jet is used to enhance the quenching
effects of the recoiling, medium traversing one. We reconstruct the trigger jet
using the FASTJET algorithm, with a E_{T} (p_{T}) cut of 3.0 GeV(/c) on the
towers(tracks) in order to reduce the heavy-ion collision background. The
particle identification of tracks with p_{T} up to ~ 2.8 GeV/c is obtained by
taking advantage of STAR TOF and TPC detectors with full azimuth coverage.
Correlations in \Delta\phi between jets and identified hadrons are presented,
and the particle ratios in different regions of azimuth are measured. Particle
ratios associated with the trigger jet vs. the recoil jet, and comparisons to
inclusive particle ratios can help to distinguish between jet-related (vacuum
and medium-modified) and bulk-related contributions to the ratios enhancement.
