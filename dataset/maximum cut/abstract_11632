The direct imaging from the ground of extrasolar planets has become today a
major astronomical and biological focus. This kind of imaging requires
simultaneously the use of a dedicated high performance Adaptive Optics [AO]
system and a differential imaging camera in order to cancel out the flux coming
from the star. In addition, the use of sophisticated post-processing techniques
is mandatory to achieve the ultimate detection performance required. In the
framework of the SPHERE project, we present here the development of a new
technique, based on Maximum A Posteriori [MAP] approach, able to estimate
parameters of a faint companion in the vicinity of a bright star, using the
multi-wavelength images, the AO closed-loop data as well as some knowledge on
non-common path and differential aberrations. Simulation results show a 10^-5
detectivity at 5sigma for angular separation around 15lambda/D with only two
images.
