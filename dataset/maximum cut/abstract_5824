The net optical light curves and spectra of the supernova (SN) 2003dh are
obtained from the published spectra of GRB 030329, covering about 6 days before
SN maximum to about 60 days after. The bulk of the U-band flux is subtracted
from the observed spectra using early-time afterglow templates, because strong
line blanketing greatly depresses the UV and U-band SN flux in a metal-rich,
fast-moving SN atmosphere. The blue-end spectra of the gamma-ray burst
(GRB)connected hypernova SN 1998bw is used to determine the amount of
subtraction. The subtraction of a host galaxy template affects the late-time
results. The derived SN 2003dh light curves are narrower than those of SN
1998bw, rising as fast before maximum, reaching a possibly fainter maximum, and
then declining ~ 1.2-1.4 times faster. We then build UVOIR bolometric SN light
curve. Allowing for uncertainties, it can be reproduced with a spherical ejecta
model of Mej ~ 7+/-3 Msun, KE ~ (3.5+/-1.5)E52 ergs, with KE/Mej ~ 5 following
previous spectrum modelling, and M(Ni56) ~ (0.4 +0.15/-0.1) Msun. This suggests
a progenitor main-sequence mass of about 25-40 Msun, lower than SN 1998bw but
significantly higher than normal Type Ic SNe and the GRB-unrelated hypernova SN
2002ap.
