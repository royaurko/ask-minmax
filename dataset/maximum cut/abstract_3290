We present late time spectropolarimetric observations of SN 2007sr, obtained
with the VLT telescope at ESO Paranal Observatory when the object was 63 days
after maximum light. The late time spectrum displays strong line polarization
in the CaII absorption features. SN 2007sr adds to the case of some normal Type
Ia SNe that show high line polarization or repolarization at late times, a fact
that might be connected with the presence of high velocity features at early
times.
