The pseudoachromatic index of a graph is the maximum number of colors that
can be assigned to its edges, such that each pair of different colors is
incident to a common vertex. If for each vertex its incident edges have
different color, then this maximum is known as achromatic index. Both indices
have been widely studied. A geometric graph is a graph drawn in the plane such
that its vertices are points in general position, and its edges are
straight-line segments. In this paper we extend the notion of pseudoachromatic
and achromatic indices for geometric graphs, and present results for complete
geometric graphs. In particular, we show that for $n$ points in convex position
the achromatic index and the pseudoachromatic index of the complete geometric
graph are $\lfloor \tfrac{n^2+n}{4} \rfloor$.
