The BATSE mission aboard CGRO can be used to observe hard X-ray sources by
using the Earth occultation method. This method relies on measuring a step in
the count rate profile in each BATSE detector as a source rises above or sets
below the Earth's limb. A major problem in determining the step sizes (and
hence the flux) is in extracting the steps from the varying background. A
technique for flat-fielding the response of gamma ray detectors has been
developed at Southampton. The technique uses a dynamic Monte-Carlo model to
simulate the dominant components of the gamma-ray background encountered by the
experiment at any point in its orbit. A maximum likelihood imaging method is
also being developed that will be used to make a sky survey with all 9 years of
the BATSE Continuous data set in the 20 - 500 keV range. An all sky map of 25 -
35 keV emission has been made using 60 days of data and has a 3 sigma flux
sensitivity of 14 mCrab.
