We derive the microcanonical ensemble from the Maximum Entropy Principle
(MEP) using the phase space volume entropy of P. Hertz. Maximizing this entropy
with respect to the probability distribution with the constraints of
normalization and average energy, we obtain the condition of constant energy.
This approach is complementary to the traditional derivation of the
microcanonical ensemble from the MEP using Shannon entropy and assuming a
priori that the energy is constant which results in equal probabilities.
