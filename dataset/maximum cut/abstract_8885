A geometric view of the possible outcomes of elastic collisions of two
massive bodies is developed that integrates laboratory, center of mass, and
relative body frames in a single diagram. From these diagrams all the
scattering properties of binary collisions can be obtained. The particular case
of gravitational scattering by a moving massive object corresponds to the
slingshot maneuver, and its maximum velocity is obtained.
