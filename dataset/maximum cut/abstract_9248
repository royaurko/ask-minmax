We outline key elements of a theory that accounts for anomalous properties of
the PuCoGa$_5$ and PuRhGa$_5$ compounds as a consequence of a two-body
interference between two Kondo screening channels. Virtual valence fluctuations
of the magnetic Pu configurations create two conduction channels of different
symmetry. Using the symplectic large-N approach, we are able to demonstrate our
pairing mechanism in an exactly solvable large-N limit. The critical
temperature reaches its maximum when the energy levels of excited valence
configurations are almost degenerate. The symmetry of the order parameter is
determined by the product of the Wannier form factors in the interfering
conduction channels.
