Gravity waves generated by an object moving at constant speed at the water
surface form a specific pattern commonly known as the Kelvin wake. It was
proved by Lord Kelvin that such a wake is delimited by a constant angle $\simeq
19.47^\circ$. However a recent study by Rabaud and Moisy based on the
observation of airborne images showed that the wake angle seems to decrease as
the Froude number $Fr$ increases, scaling as $Fr^{-1}$ for large Froude
numbers. To explain such observations the contributors make the strong hypothesis
that an object of size $b$ cannot generate wavelengths larger than $b$. With no
need of such an assumption and modelling the moving object by an axisymmetric
pressure field, we analytically show that the angle corresponding to the
maximum amplitude of the waves scales as $Fr^{-1}$ for large Froude numbers,
whereas the angle delimiting the wake region outside which the surface is
essentially flat remains constant and equal to the Kelvin angle for all $Fr$.
