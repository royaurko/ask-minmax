(Jaynes') Method of (Shannon-Kullback's) Relative Entropy Maximization (REM
or MaxEnt) can be - at least in the discrete case - according to the Maximum
Probability Theorem (MPT) viewed as an asymptotic instance of the Maximum
Probability method (MaxProb). A simple bayesian interpretation of MaxProb is
given here. MPT carries the interpretation over into REM.
