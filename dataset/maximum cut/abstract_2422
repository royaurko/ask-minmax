The HBT-Analyzer is an universal tool for particle correlations analysis
under the ROOT environment. It provides an efficient mixing mechanism, a wide
range of correlation and monitoring functions, and a set of cuts that are
applicable on different levels of analysis. Thanks to an object oriented design
it is very easily extensible for particular user needs. It also enables easy
resolution studies of Monte-Carlo simulated data. The general concept and
design is presented as well as example analysis results obtained within ALICE
experiment.
