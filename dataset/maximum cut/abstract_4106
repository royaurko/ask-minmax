This paper presents an overview of the MammoGrid project and some of its
achievements. In terms of the global grid project, and European research in
particular, the project has successfully demonstrated the capacity of a
grid-based system to support effective collaboration between physicians,
including handling and querying image databases, as well as using grid
services, such as image standardization and Computer-Aided Detection (CADe) of
suspect or indicative features. In terms of scientific results, in radiology,
there have been significant epidemiological findings in the assessment of
breast density as a risk factor, but the results for CADe are less clear-cut.
Finally, the foundations of a technology transfer process to establish a
working MammoGrid plus system in Spain through the company Maat GKnowledge and
the collaboration of CIEMAT and hospitals in Extremadura.
