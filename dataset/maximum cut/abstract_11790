We present a general theory of the superconductive proximity effect in
disordered normal--superconducting (N-S) structures, based on the recently
developed Keldysh action approach. In the case of the absence of interaction in
the normal conductor we reproduce known results for the Andreev conductance G_A
at arbitrary relation between the interface resistance R_T and the diffusive
resistance R_D. In two-dimensional N-S systems, electron-electron interaction
in the Cooper channel of normal conductor is shown to strongly affect the value
of G_A as well as its dependence on temperature, voltage and magnetic field. In
particular, an unusual maximum of G_A as a function of temperature and/or
magnetic field is predicted for some range of parameters R_D and R_T. The
Keldysh action approach makes it possible to calculate the full statistics of
charge transfer in such structures. As an application of this method, we
calculate the noise power of an N-S contact as a function of voltage,
temperature, magnetic field and frequency for arbitrary Cooper repulsion in the
normal metal and arbitrary values of the ratio R_D/R_T.
