We report the detection of a 51-joule (320 +/- 90 EeV) cosmic ray by the
Fly's Eye air shower detector in Utah. This is substantially greater than the
energy of any previously reported cosmic ray. A Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min cutoff
of the energy spectrum (due to pion photoproduction energy losses) should occur
below this energy unless the highest energy cosmic rays have traveled less than
about 30 Mpc. The error box for the arrival direction in galactic coordinates
is centered on b=9.6 deg, l=163.4 deg. The particle cascade reached a maximum
size near a depth of 815 g/cm^2 in the atmosphere, a depth which does not
uniquely identify the type of primary particle.
