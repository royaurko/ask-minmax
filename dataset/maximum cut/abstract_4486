Within an effective field theory framework we compute the most general
structure of the one-loop corrections to the 4D gauge couplings in one- and
two-dimensional orbifold compactifications with non-vanishing constant gauge
background (Wilson lines). Although such models are non-renormalisable, we keep
the analysis general by considering the one-loop corrections in three
regularisation schemes: dimensional regularisation (DR), Zeta-function
regularisation (ZR) and proper-time cut-off regularisation (PT). The relations
among the results obtained in these schemes are carefully addressed. With
minimal re-definitions of the parameters involved, the results obtained for the
radiative corrections can be applied to most orbifold compactifications with
one or two compact dimensions. The link with string theory is discussed. We
mention a possible implication for the gauge couplings unification in such
models.
