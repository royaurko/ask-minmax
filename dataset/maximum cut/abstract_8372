Using Abelian Bosonization, we develop a simple and powerful method to
calculate the correlation functions of the two channel Kondo model and its
variants. The method can also be used to identify all the possible boundary
fixed points and their maximum symmetry, to calculate straightforwardly the
finite size spectra, to demonstrate the physical picture at the boundary
explicitly. Comparisons with Non-Abelian Bosonization method are made. Some
fixed points corresponding to 4 pieces of bulk fermions coupled to s=1/2
impurity are listed.
