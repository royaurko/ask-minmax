The paper discusses ISW estimates through EMU-ASKAP survey.
  The main ideas this paper covers include:
  1- Discussion on source distribution, confusion, position accuracy and
shotnoise (with discussion focusing on SN ratios).
  2- Selection of maximum redshift and maximum 'l' ranges in relation with SN
ratios.
