As the mobile application landscape expands, wireless networks are tasked
with supporting different connection profiles, including real-time traffic and
delay-sensitive communications. Among many ensuing engineering challenges is
the need to better understand the fundamental limits of forward error
correction in non-asymptotic regimes. This article characterizes the
performance of random block codes over finite-state channels and evaluates
their queueing performance under maximum-likelihood decoding. In particular,
classical results from information theory are revisited in the context of
channels with rare transitions, and bounds on the probabilities of decoding
failure are derived for random codes. This creates an analysis framework where
channel dependencies within and across codewords are preserved. Such results
are subsequently integrated into a queueing problem formulation. For instance,
it is shown that, for random coding on the Gilbert-Elliott channel, the
performance analysis based on upper bounds on error probability provides very
good estimates of system performance and optimum code parameters. Overall, this
study offers new insights about the impact of channel correlation on the
performance of delay-aware, point-to-point communication links. It also
provides novel guidelines on how to select code rates and block lengths for
real-time traffic over wireless communication infrastructures.
