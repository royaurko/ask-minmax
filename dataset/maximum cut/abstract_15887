We report the presence of a 106-day cycle in the radio variability of Sgr A*
based on an analysis of data observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) over the
past 20 years. The pulsed signal is most clearly seen at 1.3 cm with a ratio of
cycle frequency to frequency width f/Delta_f= 2.2+/-0.3. The periodic signal is
also clearly observed at 2 cm. At 3.6 cm the detection of a periodic signal is
marginal. No significant periodicity is detected at both 6 and 20 cm. Since the
sampling function is irregular we performed a number of tests to insure that
the observed periodicity is not the result of noise. Similar results were found
for a maximum entropy method and periodogram with CLEAN method. The probability
of false detection for several different noise distributions is less than 5%
based on Monte Carlo tests. The radio properties of the pulsed component at 1.3
cm are spectral index alpha ~ 1.0+/- 0.1 (for S nu^alpha), amplitude Delta
S=0.42 +/- 0.04 Jy and characteristic time scale Delta t_FWHM ~ 25 +/- 5 days.
The lack of VLBI detection of a secondary component suggests that the
variability occurs within Sgr A* on a scale of ~5 AU, suggesting an instability
of the accretion disk.
