We study the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations (RWE and ZE) at the
`algebraically special frequency' $\Omega$, where these equations admit an
exact solution (elaborated here), generating the SUSY relationship between
them. The physical significance of the SUSY generator and of the solutions at
$\Omega$ in general is elucidated as follows. The RWE has no (quasinormal or
total-transmission) modes at all; however, $\Omega$ is nonetheless `special' in
that (a) for the outgoing wave into the horizon one has a `miraculous'
cancellation of a divergence expected due to the exponential potential tail,
and (b) the branch-cut discontinuity at $\omega=\Omega$ vanishes in the
outgoing wave to infinity. Moreover, (a) and (b) are related. For the ZE, its
only mode is the-inverse-SUSY generator, which is at the same time a
quasinormal mode_and_ a total-transmission mode propagating to infinity. The
subtlety of these findings (of general relevance for future study of the
equations on or near the negative imaginary $\omega$-axis) may help explain why
the situation has sometimes been controversial. For finite black-hole rotation,
the algebraically special modes are shown to be totally transmitting, and the
implied singular nature of the Schwarzschild limit is clarified. The analysis
draws on a recent detailed investigation of SUSY in open systems
[math-ph/9909030].
