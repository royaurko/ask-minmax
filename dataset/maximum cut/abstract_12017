The La-2125 type La2-xDyxCa2xBa2Cu4+2xOz (0.1 < x < 0.5; LDBO) compounds have
been synthesized and studied for their structural and superconducting
properties by room temperature neutron diffraction, high field dc
magnetization, four-probe resistivity and iodometric double titration. The
Rietveld analysis of the neutron diffraction data reveals tetragonal structure
for all the samples, which crystallizes into La-123 type tetragonal structure
in P4/mmm space group. Iodometric double titrations were performed to determine
the oxygen content values and calculate mobile charge carrier (holes) density.
The superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) increases from ~ 20 K for x =
0.1 to a maximum of 75 K for x = 0.5. Flux pinning force (Fp) and critical
current density (Jc), calculated from the low temperature hysteresis loops,
also increases with increasing dopant concentration. The paper presents the
studies on structure and superconducting properties of all LDBO compounds in
light of the role of calcium in inducing superconductivity in the tetragonal
non-superconducting oxide.
