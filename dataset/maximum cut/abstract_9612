We prove large deviation results for sums of heavy-tailed random elements in
rather general convex cones being semigroups equipped with a rescaling
operation by positive real numbers. In difference to previous results for the
cone of convex sets, our technique does not use the embedding of cones in
linear spaces. Examples include the cone of convex sets with the Minkowski
addition, positive half-line with maximum operation and the family of square
integrable functions with arithmetic addition and argument rescaling.
