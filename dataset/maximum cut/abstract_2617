We study the Pi-calculus, enriched with pairing and non-blocking input, and
define a notion of type assignment that uses the type constructor "arrow". We
encode the circuits of the calculus X into this variant of Pi, and show that
all reduction (cut-elimination) and assignable types are preserved. Since X
enjoys the Curry-Howard isomorphism for Gentzen's calculus LK, this implies
that all proofs in LK have a representation in Pi.
