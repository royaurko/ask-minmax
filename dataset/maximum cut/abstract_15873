The unprecedented quality of recent colour-magnitude diagrams of resolved
stellar populations in nearby galaxies requires state-of-the-art techniques to
infer the star formation histories which gave rise to the observed
distributions. We have developed a maximum likelihood technique, which coupled
to a variational calculus allows us to make a robust, non-parametric
reconstruction of the evolution of the star formation rate. A full Bayesian
analysis is also applied to assess whether the best solutions found are also
good fits to the data. Applying this new method to WFPC2 observations of five
dSph galaxies of the Local Group, we find a wide variety of star formation
histories, with no particular epoch being dominant. In the case of the solar
neighbourhood observed by Hipparcos we infer, with an unprecedented resolution
of 50 Myr, its star formation history over the past 3 Gyr. The surprising
regularity of star formation episodes separated by some 0.5 Gyr could be
interpreted as the result of interactions with two spiral arms or the Galactic
bar. These bursts possibly trigger the formation of massive star clusters which
slowly dissolve into the galactic field.
