We introduce NIFTY, "Numerical Information Field Theory", a software package
for the development of Bayesian signal inference algorithms that operate
independently from any underlying spatial grid and its resolution. A large
number of Bayesian and Maximum Entropy methods for 1D signal reconstruction, 2D
imaging, as well as 3D tomography, appear formally similar, but one often finds
individualized implementations that are neither flexible nor easily
transferable. Signal inference in the framework of NIFTY can be done in an
abstract way, such that algorithms, prototyped in 1D, can be applied to real
world problems in higher-dimensional settings. NIFTY as a versatile library is
applicable and already has been applied in 1D, 2D, 3D and spherical settings. A
recent application is the D3PO algorithm targeting the non-trivial task of
denoising, deconvolving, and decomposing photon observations in high energy
astronomy.
