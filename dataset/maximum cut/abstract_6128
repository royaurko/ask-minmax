We prove a pointwise control for the Green's function of polyharmonic
operators with holes: this control is uniform while holes shrink. For the usual
Laplacian, such a control is given by the maximum principle; the techniques
developed here applies to general polyharmonic operators for which there is no
comparison principle.
