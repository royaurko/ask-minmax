We prove the following result of Bondal's: that there is a fully faithful
embedding $\kappa$ of the perfect derived category of a proper toric variety
into the derived category of constructible sheaves on a compact torus. We
compare this result to a torus-equivariant version considered in joint work
with Fang, Liu, and Zaslow. There we showed that in the torus-equivariant
version the image of the embedding is cut out by microlocal conditions. To
establish a similar characterization of the image of $\kappa$ is an open
problem.
