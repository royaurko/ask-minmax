The ANTARES neutrino telescope is being constructed at a site off the French
Mediterranean coast at a depth of 2400m. When high energy neutrinos interact in
water, the charged secondary particles produce Cherenkov light which can be
measured in photomultiplier tubes. Different event signatures are possible;
this work introduces a reconstruction algorithm for events with a hadronic and
potentially an electromagnetic shower producing a signal in the detector. An
algorithm for the combined reconstruction of shower direction and energy is
described, based on a maximum likelihood fit which matches the signal expected
in the photomultipliers for an assumed direction and energy with the signal
actually measured.
