We begin to briefly survey the experimental and conceptual side of baryon
transfers in particle scattering. A discussion of baryon transfers in heavy ion
scattering follows. It shortly reviews existing string model concepts, which
were found to be consistent with the data. With this motivation we turn to a
more careful consideration of the relevant topological structures. The baryon
transfer is associated with one of two possible cuts in baryonium exchange.
  From the color structure the baryonium can be identified with an Odderon
exchange. We conjecture that the two Odderon cuts occur with an opposite sign
and partially cancel. As the Odderon is predicted to have a rather high
trajectory it has to involve small coupling constants. As this suppression is
not anticipated for diffractive processes a tiny observable backward peak is
argued to occur in the initial baryon distribution in massive diffractive
systems.
