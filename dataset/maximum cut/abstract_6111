Cubic and quartic non-autonomous differential equations with continuous
piecewise linear coefficients are considered. The main concern is to find the
maximum possible multiplicity of periodic solutions. For many classes, we show
that the mutiplicity is the same when the coefficients are polynomial functions
of degree n or piecewise linear functions with n segments.
