We report photometry and spectroscopy of the evolution of Nova Sagittarii
1994 #1 (V4332 Sagittarii) during outburst. We compare the photometric and
spectral evolution of this outburst to known classes of outbursts -- including
classical novae and outbursts occurring on symbiotic stars -- and find this
object does NOT conform to any known class of outburst. The closest match to
the behavior of this unusual object is M31 RV, an extremely luminous and red
variable object discovered in the bulge of M31 in 1988. However, the temporal
behavior and maximum luminosity of the two events differ by several orders of
magnitude, requiring substantial intrinsic variation if these two events are
members the same type of outburst.
  Our model of the spectroscopic evolution of this outburst shows that the
effective temperature cooled from 4400 K to 2300 K over the three month span of
our observations. In combination with line diagnostics in our later spectra,
including [OI] lambda 5577 and the dramatic increase in the Halpha to Hbeta
ratio, we infer the existence of a cool, dense (N_e ~ 10^{8-9} cm^{-3})
envelope that is optically thick in the Hydrogen Balmer recombination lines
(case C). We suggest that a nuclear event in a single star, in which a slow
shock drove the photosphere outwards, can power the observed luminosity
evolution and the emission spectrum.
