In this paper we investigate the effect of the resummation of threshold logs
on the rate for B -> X_s gamma. We calculate the differential rate
dGamma/dE_gamma including the infinite set of terms of the form alpha_s^n
log^{n+1}(1-x) and alpha_s^n log^n(1-x) in the Sudakov exponent. The
resummation is potentially important since these logs turn into
log(2E_{cut}/m_b), when the rate is integrated from the lower cut
x=2E_{cut}/m_b to 1. The resummed rate is then convolved with models for the
structure function to study whether or not the logs will be enhanced due to the
fermi motion of the heavy quark. A detailed discussion of the accuracy of the
calculation with and without the inclusion of the non-perturbative effects
dictated by the B meson structure function is given. We also investigate the
first moment with respect to (1-x), which can be used to measure \bar\Lambda
and lambda_1. It is shown that there are some two loop corrections which are
just as large as the alpha_s^2 beta_0 term, which are usually expected to
dominate. We conclude that, for the present energy cut, the threshold logs do
not form a dominant sub-series and therefore their resummation is unnecessary.
Thus, the prospects for predicting the rate for B -> X_s gamma accurately,
given the present energy cut, are promising.
