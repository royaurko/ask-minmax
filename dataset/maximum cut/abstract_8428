We calculate the Josephson coupling energy $U_J(\phi)$ (related to the
supercurrent $I=(2e/\hbar) dU_J/d\phi$) for a disordered normal metal between
two superconductors with a phase difference $\phi$. We demonstrate that the
symmetry of the scattering matrix of non-interacting quasiparticles in zero
magnetic field implies that $U_J(\phi)$ has a minimum at $\phi=0$. A maximum
(that would lead to a $\pi$-junction or negative superfluid density) is
excluded for any realization of the disorder.
