Many experimental studies of protein deposition on solid surfaces involve
alternating adsorption/desorption steps. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of a desorption step (separating two adsorption steps) on the kinetics,
the adsorbed-layer structure, and the saturation density. Our theoretical
approach involves a density expansion of the pair distribution function and an
application of an interpolation formula to estimate the saturation density as a
function of the density at which the desorption process commences, $\rho_1$,
and the density of the depleted configuration, $\rho_2$. The theory predicts an
enhancement of the saturation density compared with that of a simple,
uninterrupted RSA process and a maximum in the saturation density when
$\rho_2={2/3}\rho_1$. The theoretical results are in qualitative and in
semi-quantitative agreement with the results of numerical simulations.
