Bi2Sr2CaCu2O{8 + \delta} crystals with varying hole concentrations (0.12 < p
< 0.23) were studied to investigate the effects of doping on the symmetry and
magnitude of the superconducting gap. Electronic Raman scattering experiments
that sample regions of the Fermi surface near the diagonal (B_{2g}) and
principal axes (B_{1g}) of the Brillouin Zone have been utilized. The frequency
dependence of the Raman response function at low energies is found to be linear
for B_{2g} and cubic for B_{1g} (T< T_c). The latter observations have led us
to conclude that the doping dependence of the superconducting gap is consistent
with d_{x^2-y^2} symmetry, for slightly underdoped and overdoped crystals.
Studies of the pair-breaking peak found in the B_{1g} spectra demonstrate that
the magnitude of the maximum gap decreases monotonically with increasing hole
doping, for p > 0.12. Based on the magnitude of the B_{1g} renormalization, it
is found that the number of quasiparticles participating in pairing increases
monotonically with increased doping. On the other hand, the B_{2g} spectra show
a weak "pair-breaking peak" that follows a parabolic-like dependence on hole
concentration, for 0.12 < p < 0.23.
