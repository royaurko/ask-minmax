In this paper, we study the estimation of $R=P [Y < X ]$, also so-called the
stress-strength model, when both $X$ and $Y$ are two independent random
variables with the generalized linear failure rate distributions, under
different assumptions about their parameters. We address the maximum likelihood
estimator (MLE) of $R$ and the associated asymptotic confidence interval. In
addition, we compute the MLE and the corresponding Bootstrap confidence
interval when the sample sizes are small. The Bayes estimates of $R$ and the
associated credible intervals are also investigated. An extensive computer
simulation is implemented to compare the performances of the proposed
estimators. Eventually, we briefly study the estimation of this model when the
data obtained from both distributions are progressively type-II censored. We
present the MLE and the corresponding confidence interval under three different
progressive censoring schemes. We also analysis a set of real data for
illustrative purpose.
