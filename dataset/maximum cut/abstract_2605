Compactification of 6d N=(2,0) theory of type G on a punctured Riemann
surface has been effectively used to understand S-dualities of 4d N=2 theories.
We can further introduce branch cuts on the Riemann surface across which the
worldvolume fields are transformed by the discrete symmetries associated to
those of the Dynkin diagram of type G. This allows us to generate more
S-dualities, and in particular to reproduce a couple of S-dual pairs found
previously by Argyres and Wittig.
