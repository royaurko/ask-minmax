The effect of uniaxial pressure (P_u) on the magnetic susceptibility (X),
magnetization (M), and magnetoresistance (MR) of the heavy-fermion metamagnet
CeRu2Si2 has been investigated. For the magnetic field along the tetragonal c
axis, it is found that characteristic physical quantities, i.e., the
temperature of the susceptibility maximum (T_max), the pagamagnetic Weiss
temperature (Q_p), 1/X at 2 K, and the magnetic field of the metamagnetic
anomaly (H_M), scale approximately linearly with P_u, indicating that all the
quantities are related to the same energy scale, probably of the Kondo
temperature. The increase (decrease) of the quantities for P_u || c axis (P_u
|| a axis) can be attributed to a decrease (increase) in the nearest Ce-Ru
distance. Consistently in MR and X, we observed a sign that the anisotropic
nature of the hybridization, which is believed to play an important role in the
metamagnetic anomaly, can be controlled by applying the uniaxial pressure.
