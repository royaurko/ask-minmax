We present the results of FLUKA simulations of the propagation of cosmogenic
muons in a 20 kton spherical liquid scintillator detector underneath 700 to 900
meters of rock. A showering muon is one which deposits at least 3 GeV in the
detector in addition to ionization energy. We find that 20 percent of muons are
showering and a further 10 percent of muon events are muon bundles of which
more than one muon enters the detector. In this range the showering and bundle
fractions are robust against changes in the depth and topography, thus the
total shower and bundle rate for a given experiment can be obtained by
combining our results with an estimate for the total muon flux. One consequence
is that a straightforward adaptation of the full detector showering muon cuts
used by KamLAND to JUNO or RENO 50 would yield a nearly vanishing detector
efficiency.
