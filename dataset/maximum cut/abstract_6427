The giant magnetoimpedance effect in composite wires consising of a
non-magnetic inner core and soft magnetic shell is studied theoretically. It is
assumed that the magnetic shell has a helical anisotropy. The current and field
distributions in the composite wire are found by means of a simultaneous
solution of Maxwell equations and the Landau-Lifshitz equation. The expressions
for the diagonal and off-diagonal impedance are obtained for low and high
frequencies. The dependences of the impedance on the anisotropy axis angle and
the shell thickness are analyzed. Maximum field sensitivity is shown to
correspond to the case of the circular anisotropy in the magnetic shell. It is
demonstrated that the optimum shell thickness to obtain maximum impedance ratio
is equal to the effective skin depth in the mahnetic material.
