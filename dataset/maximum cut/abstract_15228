Although roughly half of all stars are considered to be part of binary or
multiple systems, there are only two confirmed cases of RR Lyrae pulsators with
companions. One of them is TU Uma (Wade et al 1999) - a classical RR Lyrae star
in a very eccentric orbit - and the other is OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-02792 (Pietrzynski
et al 2012). Considering the wealth of well-studied RR Lyrae stars, this number
is astoundingly low. Having more RR Lyrae stars in binary systems at hand would
be extremely valuable to get independent measurements of the masses. The data
from the Kepler mission with their unprecedented precision and the long time
span of about four years offer a unique possibility to systematically search
for the signatures of binarity in RR Lyrae stars. Using the pulsation as a
clock, we studied the variations in the timing of maximum light to hunt for
possible binary systems in the sample.
