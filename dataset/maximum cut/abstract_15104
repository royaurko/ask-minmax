We show that both aspect ratios of randomly oriented triaxial ellipsoids
(representing isosurfaces of an isotropic 3D random field) can be determined
from a single 2D cross-section of their sample using the probability
distribution of the filamentarity F of the structures seen in the cross-section
(F=0 for a circle and F=1 for a line). The probability distribution of F has a
robust form with a sharp maximum and truncation that are sensitive to the
ellipsoids' aspect ratios. We show that the aspect ratios of triaxial
ellipsoids with randomly distributed dimensions can still be recovered from the
probability distribution of F. This method is applicable to many shape
recognition and classification problems, here illustrated with neutral hydrogen
density in the turbulent interstellar medium of the Milky Way. The gas
distribution is shown to be filamentary with the mean axis ratio 1:2:20.
