We present a series of optical spectroscopic and near-infrared photometric
observations of the Be star X Persei, from the beginning of the recent emission
phase. Our data show that after the latest extended low state (ELS), both the
equivalent width (EW) of the H\alpha emission line and the JHK luminosities
gradually increased. The recent maximum H\alpha EW and JHK magnitudes are more
than but comparable to the 1986-1989 maxima, which reflects a more extensive
and denser envelope in the new emission phase.
  The IR photometry and the H\alpha EW increase coincidently in the early stage
of the new emission phase. However, the variations in the following years,
specially in 1994 and 1995, are much different from the early variations. An
unusual variation that while the H\alpha EW in X Per increases considerably,
the JHK magnitudes decline rapidly is seen in our nearly simultaneous
pectroscopic and near-infrared observations.
  An expanding ring model is put forward to interpret the observed unusual
variations between the H\alpha EW and near-IR luminosity during the recent
emission phase of X Persei. Our results indicate that although both infrared
excess and H\alpha emission line arise from the envelope, their main
ontributors, in some cases, are likely to originate in the different part of
the envelope.
