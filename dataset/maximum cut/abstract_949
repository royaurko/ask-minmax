In [Curtin and Pourgholi, A group sum inequality and its application to power
graphs, J. Algebraic Combinatorics, 2014], it is proved that among all directed
power graphs of groups of a given order $ n $, the directed power graph of
cyclic group of order $ n $ has the maximum number of undirected edges. In this
paper, we continue their work and we determine a non-cyclic nilpotent group of
an odd order $ n $ whose directed power graph has the maximum number of
undirected edges among all non-cyclic nilpotent groups of order $n$.
  We next determine non-cyclic $p$-groups whose undirected power graphs have
the maximum number of edges among all groups of the same order.
