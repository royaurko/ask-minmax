We present analytical results for all six-photon helicity amplitudes. For the
computation of this loop induced process two recently developed methods, based
on form factor decomposition and on multiple cuts, have been used. We obtain
compact results, demonstrating the applicability of both methods to one-loop
amplitudes relevant to precision collider phenomenology.
