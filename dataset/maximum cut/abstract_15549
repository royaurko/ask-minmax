Two classes of GRBs have been identified thus far and are prescribed to
different physical scenarios $-$ NS-NS or NS-BH mergers, and collapse of
massive stars, for short and long GRBs, respectively. A third, intermediate in
durations class, was suggested to be present in previous catalogs, such as
BATSE and Swift, based on statistical tests regarding a mixture of two or three
normal distributions. However, this might possibly not be an adequate model.
This paper investigates whether the distribution of $\log T_{90}$ from Fermi
shows evidence for a third, intermediate, class of GRBs. Mixtures of standard
Gaussians, skew-normal, sinh-arcsinh and alpha-skew-normal distributions are
fitted using a maximum likelihood method. The preferred model is chosen based
on the Akaike information criterion. It is found that mixtures of two
skew-normal or two sinh-arcsinh distributions are more likely to describe the
observed duration distribution than a mixture of three standard Gaussians.
Based on statistical reasoning, existence of a third (intermediate) class of
GRBs in Fermi data is rejected.
