We calculate the free energy density of the two dimensional O(3) non linear
sigma model over a large temperature region. At high temperatures the
calculations could be done by perturbation theory whereas in the low
temperature regime we used Monte-Carlo simulations. Using the Fixed--Point
action the results do not show any remarkable cut-off effects and furthermore
the behaviour of these effects is nearly the same over the whole temperature
region. The results of the Fixed-Point action are then compared to those of the
standard Wilson action.
