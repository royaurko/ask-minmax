The constituents of cold dense matter are still far from being understood.
However, neutron star observations such as the recently observed pulsar PSR
J1614-2230 with a mass of 1.97+/-0.04 M_solar help to considerably constrain
the hadronic equation of state (EoS). We systematically investigate the
influence of the hyperon potentials on the stiffness of the EoS. We find that
they have but little influence on the maximum mass compared to the inclusion of
an additional vector meson mediating repulsive interaction amongst hyperons.
The new mass limit can only be reached with this additional meson regardless of
the hyperon potentials. Further, we investigate the impact of the nuclear
compression modulus and the effective mass of the nucleon at saturation density
on the high density regime of the EoS. We show that the maximum mass of purely
nucleonic stars is very sensitive to the effective nucleon mass but only very
little to the compression modulus.
