Theory suggests that a star making a close passage by a supermassive black
hole at the center of a galaxy can under most circumstances be expected to emit
a giant flare of radiation as it is disrupted and a portion of the resulting
stream of shock-heated stellar debris falls back onto the black hole itself. We
examine the first results of an ongoing archival survey of galaxy clusters
using Chandra and XMM-selected data, and report a likely tidal disruption flare
from SDSS J131122.15-012345.6 in Abell 1689. The flare is observed to vary by a
factor of >30 over at least 2 years, to have maximum L_X(0.3-3.0 keV)> 5 x
10^{42} erg s^{-1} and to emit as a blackbody with kT~0.12 keV. From the galaxy
population as determined by existing studies of the cluster, we estimate a
tidal disruption rate of 1.2 x 10^{-4} galaxy^{-1} year^{-1} if we assume a
contribution to the observable rate from galaxies whose range of luminosities
corresponds to a central black hole mass (M_bh) between 10^6 and 10^8 M_sun.
