To investigate whether the dense Kondo compound CeB6 might evolve into a
topological insulator under sufficient pressure, four-point electrical
resistivity measurements have been carried out over the temperature range 1.3 K
to 295 K in a diamond anvil cell to 122 GPa. The temperature of the resistivity
maximum initially increases slowly with pressure but disappears between 12 and
20 GPa. The marked changes observed under pressure suggest that a valence
and/or structural transition may have occurred. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction
measurements, however, fail to detect any change in crystal structure to 85
GPa. Although a transition into an insulating phase is not observed, this dense
Kondo system is completely suppressed at 43 GPa, leaving behind what appears to
be a conventional Fermi liquid metal.
