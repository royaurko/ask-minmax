In four-dimensional theories with massless particles, the one-loop amplitudes
can be expressed in terms of a basis of scalar integrals and rational terms.
Since the scalar bubble integrals are the only UV divergent integrals, the sum
of the bubble coefficients captures the 1-loop UV behavior. In particular, in a
renormalizable theory the sum of the bubble coefficients equals the tree-level
amplitude times a proportionality constant that is related to the one-loop beta
function coefficient beta_0. In this paper, we study how this proportionality
is achieved from the viewpoint of on-shell amplitudes. For n-point MHV
amplitude in (super) Yang-Mills theory, we demonstrate the existence of a
hidden structure in each individual bubble coefficient which directly leads to
systematic cancellations within the sum of them. The origin of this structure
can be attributed to the collinear poles within a two-particle cut. Due to the
cancellation, the one-loop beta function coefficient can be identified as a sum
over the residues of unique collinear poles in particular two-particle cuts.
Using CSW recursion relations, we verify the generality of this statement by
reproducing the correct proportionality factor from such cuts for n-point
split-helicity N^kMHV amplitudes.
