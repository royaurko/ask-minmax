A survival model is derived from the exponential function using the concept
of fractional differentiation. The hazard function of the proposed model
generates various shapes of curves including increasing,
increasing-constant-increasing, increasing-decreasing-increasing, and so-called
bathtub hazard curve. The model also contains a parameter that is the maximum
of the survival time.
