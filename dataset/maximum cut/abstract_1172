We present a novel set of Feynman rules and generalised unitarity
cut-conditions for computing one-loop amplitudes via d-dimensional integrand
reduction algorithm. Our algorithm is suited for analytic as well as numerical
result, because all ingredients turn out to have a four-dimensional
representation. We will apply this formalism to NLO QCD corrections.
