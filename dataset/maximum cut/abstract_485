In this paper we introduce the concept of MV-topology, a special class of
fuzzy topological spaces, and prove a proper extension of Stone Duality to the
categories of limit cut complete MV-algebras and Stone MV-spaces, namely,
zero-dimensional compact Hausdorff MV-topological spaces. Then we describe the
object class of limit cut complete MV-algebras, and show that any semisimple
MV-algebra has a limit cut completion, namely, a minimum limit cut complete
extension. Last, we compose our duality with other known ones, thus obtaining
new categorical equivalences and dualities involving categories of MV-algebras.
