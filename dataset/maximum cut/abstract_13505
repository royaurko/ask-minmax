In a recent work Zhang and coworkers (PRB 82, 075111 (2010)) studied the
Zeeman splitting of the Kondo resonance for the single impurity Anderson model
in a finite magnetic field $B$ with the numerical renormalization group (NRG)
method. There, it was found that with increasing magnetic field $B$ the
position of the Kondo resonance in the total spectral function \textit{does
not} approach its position in the spin resolved spectral function.
Additionally, the position of the Kondo maximum exceeded the Zeeman energy for
$B/ T_K\gtrsim 5-10$, where $T_K$ is the low energy Kondo scale of the model
($g=2$, $\mu_B=k_B=\hbar=1$). In this comment we argue that both these findings
are produced by an improper choice of NRG parameter values. However, we
reproduce the crossover in the splitting from Kondo-like behavior to a
non-universal splitting larger than the Zeeman energy, but this crossover
occurs at much larger fields of the order of the charge scale.
