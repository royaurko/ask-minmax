We consider the design and analysis of the efficiently-encodable
rate-compatible ($E^2RC$) irregular LDPC codes proposed in previous work. In
this work we introduce semi-structured $E^2RC$-like codes and protograph
$E^2RC$ codes. EXIT chart based methods are developed for the design of
semi-structured $E^2RC$-like codes that allow us to determine near-optimal
degree distributions for the systematic part of the code while taking into
account the structure of the deterministic parity part, thus resolving one of
the open issues in the original construction. We develop a fast EXIT function
computation method that does not rely on Monte-Carlo simulations and can be
used in other scenarios as well. Our approach allows us to jointly optimize
code performance across the range of rates under puncturing. We then consider
protograph $E^2RC$ codes (that have a protograph representation) and propose
rules for designing a family of rate-compatible punctured protographs with low
thresholds. For both the semi-structured and protograph $E^2RC$ families we
obtain codes whose gap to capacity is at most 0.3 dB across the range of rates
when the maximum variable node degree is twenty.
