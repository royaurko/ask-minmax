We analyze the prospect for observing the intermediate neutral Higgs boson
($h_2$) in its decay to two lighter Higgs bosons ($h_1$) at the presently
operating hadron colliders in the framework of the CP violating MSSM using the
PYTHIA event generator. We consider the lepton+ 4-jets+ $\met$ channel from
associate $W h_2$ production, with $W h_2 \ra W h_1 h_1 \ra \ell \nu_\ell b
\bar b b\bar b$. We require two or three tagged $b$-jets. We explicitly
consider all relevant Standard Model backgrounds, treating $c$-jets separately
from light flavor and gluon jets and allowing for mistagging. We find that it
is very hard to observe this signature at the Tevatron, even with 20 fb$^{-1}$
of data, in the LEP--allowed region of parameter space due to the small signal
efficiency. At the LHC, a priori huge SM backgrounds can be suppressed by
applying judiciously chosen kinematical selections. After all cuts, we are left
with a signal cross section of around 0.5 fb, and a signal to background ratio
between 1.2 and 2.9. According to our analysis this Higgs signal should be
viable at the LHC in the vicinity of present LEP exclusion once 20 to 50
fb$^{-1}$ of data have been accumulated at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV.
