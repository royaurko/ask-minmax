The process e^+e^- -> gamma gamma (gamma) is studied using data recorded with
the OPAL detector at LEP. The data sample corresponds to a total integrated
luminosity of 25.38 pb^{-1} taken at centre-of-mass energies of 130-172 GeV.
The measured cross-sections agree well with the expectation from QED. In a
combined fit using data from all centre-of-mass energies, the angular
distribution is used to obtain improved limits on the cut-off parameters:
Lambda_+ > 195 GeV and Lambda_- > 210 GeV (95% CL). In addition, limits on
non-standard e^+e^-gamma couplings and contact interactions, as well as a 95%
CL mass limit for an excited electron, M_{e^*} > 194 GeV for an e^+e^-gamma
coupling kappa = 1, are determined.
