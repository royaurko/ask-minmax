CMS reports on the recently updated, preliminary results with the full
datasets of 2011 and 2012 in the analysis of the Higgs-like Boson at 125 GeV.
Utilizing 5.1$fb^{-1}$ of 7 TeV data and 19.6$fb^{-1}$ of 8 TeV data, a signal
strength of $0.78^{+0.28}_{-0.26}$ times the Standard Model (SM) expectations
with a mass of $125.4\pm0.8$ GeV is observed. The significance of this
resonance with respect to the background only prediction is $3.2\sigma$. The
cut-based cross-check analysis observes signal strength of
$1.11^{+0.32}_{-0.30}$ times the SM expectations with a significance of
$3.9\sigma$ at 124.5 GeV.
