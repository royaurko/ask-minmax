An analogue of a spectral triple over SUq(2) is constructed for which the
usual assumption of bounded commutators with the Dirac operator fails. An
analytic expression analogous to that for the Hochschild class of the Chern
character for spectral triples yields a non-trivial twisted Hochschild
3-cocycle. The problems arising from the unbounded commutators are overcome by
defining a residue functional using projections to cut down the Hilbert space.
