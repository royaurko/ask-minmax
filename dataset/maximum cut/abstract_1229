We present a detailed statistical study of the observed anisotropy in radio
polarizations from distant extragalactic objects. This anisotropy was earlier
found by Birch (1982) and reconfirmed by Jain and Ralston (1999) in a larger
data set. A very strong signal was seen after imposing the cut
$|RM-\bar{RM}|>6$ rad/m$^2$, where $RM$ is the rotation measure and $\bar{RM}$
its mean value. In this paper we show that there are several indications that
this anisotropy cannot be attributed to bias in the data.
  We also find that a generalized statistic shows a very strong signal in the
entire data without imposing the RM dependent cut. Finally we argue that an
anisotropic background pseudoscalar field can explain the observations.
