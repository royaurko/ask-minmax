We report the first measurement of proper motions in the SN1006 remnant
(G327.6+14.6) based entirely on digital images. CCD images from three epochs
spanning a period of 11 years are used: 1987 from Las Campanas, and 1991 and
1998 from CTIO. Measuring the shift of delicate Balmer filaments along the
northwest rim of the remnant, we obtain proper motions of 280 +/- 8 mas/yr
along the entire length where the filaments are well defined, with little
systematic variation along the filaments. We also report very deep Halpha
imaging observations of the entire remnant that clearly show very faint
emission surrounding almost the entire shell, as well as some diffuse emission
regions in the (projected) interior. Combining the proper motion measurement
with a recent measurement of the shock velocity based on spectra of the same
filaments by Ghavamian et al. leads to a distance of 2.17 +/- 0.08 kpc to
SN1006. Several lines of argument suggest that SN1006 was a Type Ia event, so
the improved distance measurement can be combined with the peak luminosity for
SNeIa, as determined for events in galaxies with Cepheid-based distances, to
calculate the apparent brightness of the spectacular event that drew wide
attention in the eleventh century. The result, V_max = -7.5 =/- 0.4, lies
squarely in the middle of the wide range of estimates based on the historical
observations.
