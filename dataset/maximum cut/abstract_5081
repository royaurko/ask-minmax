In this paper a supersymmetric version of a generalized unitarity cut method
in application to MHV and NMHV for form factors of operators from the N=4 SYM
stress-tensor current supermultiplet $T^{AB}$ at one loop is discussed. The
explicit answers for 3 and 4 point NMHV form factors at tree and one loop level
are obtained. The general structure of n-point NMHV form factor at one loop is
discussed as well as the relation between form factor with super momentum equal
to zero and the logarithmic derivative of the superamplitude with respect to
the coupling constant.
