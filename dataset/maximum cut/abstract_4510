We argue that any non-gravitational holographic dual to asymptotically flat
string theory in $d$-dimensions naturally resides at spacelike infinity. Since
spacelike infinity can be resovled as a $(d-1)$-dimensional timelike
hyperboloid (i.e., as a copy of de Sitter space in $(d-1)$ dimensions), the
dual theory is defined on a Lorentz signature spacetime. Conceptual issues
regarding such a duality are clarified by comparison with linear dilaton
boundary conditions, such as those dual to little string theory. We compute
both time-ordered and Wightman boundary 2-point functions of operators dual to
massive scalar fields in the asymptotically flat bulk.
