A measurement of the ratio R_chic = (chic -> Jpsi + gam)/ Jpsi in pC, pTi and
pW interactions at 920 GeV/c (sqrt{s}=41.6 GeV) in the Feynman-x range -0.35 <
x_F(Jpsi) < 0.15 is presented. Both mu+mu- and e+e- Jpsi decay channels are
observed with an overall statistics of about 15000 chic events, which is by far
the largest available sample in pA collisions. The result is R_chic =
0.188+-0.013(st)(+0.024)(-0.022)(sys) averaged over the different materials,
when no Jpsi and chic polarisations are considered. The chic_1 to chic_2
production ratio R_12 = R_chic1/R_chic2 is measured to be 1.02+-0.40, leading
to a cross section ratio sigma(chic_1)/sigma(chic_2)=0.57+-0.23. The dependence
of R_chic on the Feynman-x of the Jpsi, x_F(Jpsi), and its transverse momentum,
p_T(Jpsi), is studied, as well as its dependence on the atomic number, A, of
the target. For the first time, an extensive study of possible biases on R_chic
and R_12 due to the dependence of acceptance on the polarization states of Jpsi
and chic is performed. By varying the polarisation parameter, lambda(obs), of
all produced Jpsi's by two sigma around the value measured by HERA-B, and
considering the maximum variation due to the possible chic_1 and chic_2
polarisations, it is shown that R_chic could change by a factor between 1.02
and 1.21 and R_12 by a factor between 0.89 and 1.16.
