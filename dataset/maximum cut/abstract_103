A new technique of Fourier analysis on a cut sky (Gorski, 1994) has been
applied to the two year COBE DMR sky maps. The Bayesian power spectrum
estimation results are consistent with the Harrison-Zel'dovich n=1 model. The
maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the power spectrum of
primordial perturbations are n=1.22 (1.02) and Q_{rms-PS}=17 (20) uK including
(excluding) the quadrupole anisotropy. The marginal likelihood function on n
renders n=1.10 \pm 0.32 (0.87 \pm 0.36).
