Using the Position and Proper Motion Extended-L (PPMXL) catalogue, we have
used optical and near-infrared colour cuts together with a reduced proper
motion cut to find bright M dwarfs for future exoplanet transit studies.
PPMXL's low proper motion uncertainties allow us to probe down to smaller
proper motions than previous similar studies. We have combined unique objects
found with this method to that of previous work to produce 8479 K<9 M dwarfs.
Low resolution spectroscopy was obtained of a sample of the objects found using
this selection method to gain statistics on their spectral type and physical
properties. Results show a spectral type range of K7-M4V. This catalogue is the
most complete collection of K<9 M dwarfs currently available and is made
available here.
