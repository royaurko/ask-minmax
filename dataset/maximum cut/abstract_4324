Strong interaction effects are addressed in connection to extracting
|V_{cb}|. A comprehensive approach is described not relying on a 1/m_c
expansion; it allows a percent accuracy without ad hoc assumptions about
higher-order effects. An alternative to the M_X^2 variable is proposed
improving convergence. Intrinsic hardness of integrated observables with a cut
on E_\ell is discussed; it can be responsible for the behavior of <M_X^2>
reported by BaBar. Consequences of the proximity to the `BPS' limit are
considered.
