We give elementary proofs of two theorems concerning bounds on the maximum
argument of the eigenvalues of a product of two unitary matrices --- one by
Childs \emph{et al.} [J. Mod. Phys., \textbf{47}, 155 (2000)] and the other one
by Chau [arXiv:1006.3614]. Our proofs have the advantages that the necessary
and sufficient conditions for equalities are apparent and that they can be
readily generalized to the case of infinite-dimensional unitary operators.
