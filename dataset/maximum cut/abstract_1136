A new method to construct quasicrystalline lattices is proposed. It is based
on Landau crystallization theory. Like well-known cut and projection methods
our approach deals with N dimensional crystallography, but we don't need any
conception similar to an acceptance domain or atomic surfaces. The selection of
nodes, included into the lattice, is based on simple rules provided their local
order in a real space.
