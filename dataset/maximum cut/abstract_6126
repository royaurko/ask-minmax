The entropy production by simple electrical circuits (R, RC, RL) is analyzed.
It comes out that the entropy production is minimal, in agreement with a well
known theorem due to Prigogine. In this way, it is wrong a recent result by
Zupanovic, Juretic and Botric (Physica Review E 70, 056198) who claimed that
the entropy production in simple electrical circuits is a maximum
