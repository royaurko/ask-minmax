We propose a possible resolution to the cosmological constant problem through
a scenario in which the universe is composed of three components: matter,
radiation (CMB) and vacuum energy such that vacuum energy is not constant and
is decaying into the matter component. Matter in this scenario consists of
baryonic matter and primordial black holes (PBHs) as the dark matter. Local
equilibrium condition between PBHs and CMB confines the mass and the radius of
PBHs. The mechanism accounting for the decaying process is nothing but the
absorption of vacuum energy modes by the PBHs up to a wavelength of the order
of their radius. Acting as a natural cut-off on the wavelength of vacuum energy
modes, this leads to the observed value for the vacuum energy density.
