We investigate the prospect of stop squark search at Tevatron RUN-II in
mSUGRA motivated as well as unconstrained supersymmetric models, when the
lighter stop squark turns out to be the next lightest supersymmetric particle
(NLSP). In this case the decay into a 4-body final state consisting of a b
quark, the lightest neutralino and two light fermions may compete with the much
publicized loop induced two body decay into a charm quark and the lightest
neutralino. We systematically study the parameter space in mSUGRA where the
lighter stop squark turns out to be the NLSP and calculate the branching ratios
of the competing channels in both models. Our results show that the four body
decay may indeed be the main discovery channel particularly in the low tan
$\beta$ scenarios. We discuss the detectability of stop squark pairs in the
4-body decay channel leading to one lepton with 2 or more jets accompanied by a
large amount of missing energy. We also studied the corresponding background
processes and the kinematic cuts required to suppress them using parton level
Monte Carlo simulations. We have commented upon with illustrative examples, the
required revision of the existing mass limits of the stop NLSP assumed to decay
solely into the loop induced 2-body channel in the presence of the competing
4-body decay.
