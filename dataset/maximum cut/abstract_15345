We discuss the "constant speed of sound" (CSS) parameterization of the
equation of state of high density matter, and its application to the Field
Correlator Method (FCM) model of quark matter. We show how observational
constraints on the maximum mass and typical radius of neutron stars are
expressed as constraints on the CSS parameters. We find that the observation of
a $2\,{\rm M}_\odot$ star already severely constrains the CSS parameters, and
is particularly difficult to accommodate if the squared speed of sound in the
high density phase is assumed to be around $1/3$ or less.
  We show that the FCM equation of state can be accurately represented by the
CSS parameterization. We display the mapping between the FCM and CSS
parameters, and see that FCM only allows equations of state in a restricted
subspace of the CSS parameters.
