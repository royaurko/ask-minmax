MaxEnt's variational principle, in conjunction with Shannon's logarithmic
information measure, yields only exponential functional forms in
straightforward fashion. In this communication we show how to overcome this
limitation via the incorporation, into the variational process, of suitable
dynamical information. As a consequence, we are able to formulate a somewhat
generalized Shannonian Maximum Entropy approach which provides a unifying
"thermodynamic-like" explanation for the scale-invariant phenomena observed in
social contexts, as city-population distributions. We confirm the MaxEnt
predictions by means of numerical experiments with random walkers, and compare
them with some empirical data.
