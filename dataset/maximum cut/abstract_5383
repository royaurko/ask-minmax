We establish a new weak coupling limit in F-theory. The new limit may be
thought of as the process in which a local model bubbles off from the rest of
the Calabi-Yau. The construction comes with a small deformation parameter $t$
such that computations in the local model become exact as $t \to 0$. More
generally, we advocate a modular approach where compact Calabi-Yau geometries
are obtained by gluing together local pieces (log Calabi-Yau spaces) into a
normal crossing variety and smoothing, in analogy with a similar cutting and
gluing approach to topological field theories. We further argue for a
holographic relation between F-theory on a degenerate Calabi-Yau and a dual
theory on its boundary, which fits nicely with the gluing construction.
