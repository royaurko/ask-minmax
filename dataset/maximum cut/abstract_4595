The cross sections for low-energy neutrino-deuteron reactions are calculated
within heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory employing cut-off regularization
scheme. The transition operators are derived up to
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in the Weinberg counting rules, while the
nuclear matrix elements are evaluated using the wave functions generated by a
high-quality phenomenological NN potential. With the adoption of the
axial-current-four-nucleon coupling constant fixed from the tritium beta decay
data, our calculation is free from unknown low-energy constants. Our results
exhibit a high degree of stability against different choices of the cutoff
parameter, a feature which indicates that, apart from radiative corrections,
the uncertainties in the calculated cross sections are less than 1 %.
