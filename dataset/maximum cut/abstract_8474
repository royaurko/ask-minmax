The magnetization curves M(H) for ideal type-II superconductors and the
maximum, minimum, and saddle point magnetic fields of the vortex lattice are
calculated from Ginzburg-Landau theory for the entire ranges of applied
magnetic fields Hc1 <= H < Hc2 or inductions 0 <= B < Hc2 and Ginzburg-Landau
parameters sqrt(1/2) <= kappa <= 1000. Results for the triangular and square
flux-line lattices are compared with the results of the circular cell
approximation. The exact magnetic field B(x,y) and magnetization M(H, kappa)
are compared with often used approximate expressions, some of which deviate
considerably or have limited validity. Useful limiting expressions and
analytical interpolation formulas are presented.
