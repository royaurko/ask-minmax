A laser-cooled neutral-atom beam from a low-velocity intense source is split
into two beams while guided by a magnetic-field potential. We generate our
multimode-beamsplitter potential with two current-carrying wires on a glass
substrate combined with an external transverse bias field. The atoms bend
around several curves over a $10$-cm distance. A maximum integrated flux of
$1.5\cdot10^{5} \mathrm{atoms/s}$ is achieved with a current density of
$5\cdot10^{4} \mathrm{Ampere/cm^{2}}$ in the 100-$\mathrm{\mu m}$ diameter
wires. The initial beam can be split into two beams with a 50/50 splitting
ratio.
