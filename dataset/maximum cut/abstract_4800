A prospective analysis for the search of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson
with the CMS detector is presented in the context of the early LHC data. The
aim is to establish an analysis strategy for inclusive production of the Higgs
boson decaying in WW* pairs in the context of the early LHC data. Higgs mass
region between 120-200 GeV, in which this signature was proposed as highly
sensitive, has been studied. The W decays into lnu are considered, where l
stands for e or mu. The final states are characterized by two, opposite-sign,
high transverse momentum leptons, missing energy, carried out by the undetected
neutrinos, and little jet activity. This study uses Monte Carlo (MC) events
with full detector simulation, including limited calibration and alignment
precision as expected at the LHC startup. Sets of sequential cuts are applied
to each of the three topologies, in order to isolate a signal which exceeds the
tt and continuum WW backgrounds. Alternatively, an artificial neural network
multi-variate analysis technique is used.
