Data taken on the University of Sussex 0.46-m telescope in 2006 and 2007 are
combined with previously published data to obtain a better defined light curve
for the RRab-type variable DY And, a slightly improved period of 0.6030897
+0.0000006 -0.0000002 days and a new time of maximum. Evidence is presented
that may indicate the Blazhko effect in this system. In addition, a new time of
maximum has been obtained for VX Tri.
