Predictions for Higgs production with processes of the type $e^+ e^-
\rightarrow \mu{\bar \mu}\;b\bar b $ at LEP~2 and the NLC are calculated. Short
analytical formulae describe the double differential distribution in the
invariant masses of the $\mu \bar \mu$ and $b \bar{b}$ pairs. The total cross
section may be got with two numerical integrations. The various
Higgs-background interferences vanish either identically or are small. The
background contributions depend strongly on cuts applied on the invariant
masses.
