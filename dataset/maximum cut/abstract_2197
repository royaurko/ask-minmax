We study the effect of energy loss on charm and bottom quarks in high-energy
heavy-ion collisions including hadronization, longitudinal expansion and
partial thermalization. We consider in detail the detector geometry and single
lepton energy cuts of the ALICE and CMS detectors at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) to show the large suppression of high $p_T$ heavy quarks and the
consequences of their semileptonic decays.
