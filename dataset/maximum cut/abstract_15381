The MCNP program used to simulate the hard x-ray emission from KSU dense
plasma focus device, an electron beam spectrum of maximum energy 100 keV was
used to hit anode target. The bremsstrahlung radiation was measured using the
F2 tally functions on the chamber walls and on a virtual sphere surrounding the
machine, the radiation spectrum was recorded for various anode materials like
tungsten, stainless steel and molybdenum. It was found that tungsten gives the
best and the most intense radiation for the same electron beam. An aluminum
filter of thickness 2mm and 4mm was used to cutoff the lower energy band from
the x-ray spectrum. It was found that the filters achieved the mission and
there is no distinct difference in between.
