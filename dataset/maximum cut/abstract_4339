A computer program ee4fgamma for calculating cross sections of any four
fermion final state of e+e--annihilation at high energy and the corresponding
bremsstrahlung reaction that is possible in the framework of the Standard Model
is presented. As the fermion masses are arbitrary, the cross sections can be
computed without any collinear cut, the on-shell top quark production can be
studied and the Higgs boson exchange can be incorporated in a consistent way.
The program can be used as a Monte Carlo generator of unweighted events as
well.
