The sum of Wishart matrices has an important role in multiuser communication
employing multiantenna elements, such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
multiple access channel (MAC), MIMO Relay channel, and other multiuser channels
where the mathematical model is best described using random matrices. In this
paper, the distribution of linear combination of complex Wishart distributed
matrices has been studied. We present a new closed form expression for the
marginal distribution of the eigenvalues of a weighted sum of K complex central
Wishart matrices having covariance matrices proportional to the identity
matrix. The expression is general and allows for any set of linear
coefficients. As an application example, we have used the marginal distribution
expression to obtain the ergodic sum-rate capacity for the MIMO-MAC network,
and the cut-set upper bound for the MIMO-Relay case, both as closed form
expressions. We also present a very simple expression to approximate the sum of
Wishart matrices by one equivalent Wishart matrix. All of our results are
validated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. As expected, the agreement
between the exact eigenvalue distribution and simulations is perfect, whereas
for the approximate solution the difference is indistinguishable.
