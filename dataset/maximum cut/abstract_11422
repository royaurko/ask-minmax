Neutron stars are expected to contain a significant number of hyperons in
addition to protons and neutrons in the highest density portions of their
cores. Following the work of Jones, we calculate the coefficient of bulk
viscosity due to nonleptonic weak interactions involving hyperons in
neutron-star cores, including new relativistic and superfluid effects. We
evaluate the influence of this new bulk viscosity on the gravitational
radiation driven instability in the r-modes. We find that the instability is
completely suppressed in stars with cores cooler than a few times 10^9 K, but
that stars rotating more rapidly than 10-30% of maximum are unstable for
temperatures around 10^10 K. Since neutron-star cores are expected to cool to a
few times 10^9 K within seconds (much shorter than the r-mode instability
growth time) due to direct Urca processes, we conclude that the gravitational
radiation instability will be suppressed in young neutron stars before it can
significantly change the angular momentum of the star.
