We push further our study of the all-order asymptotic expansion in beta
matrix models with a confining, offcritical potential, in the regime where the
support of the equilibrium measure is a reunion of segments. We first address
the case where the filling fractions of those segments are fixed, and show the
existence of a 1/N expansion to all orders. Then, we study the asymptotic of
the sum over filling fractions, in order to obtain the full asymptotic
expansion for the initial problem in the multi-cut regime. We describe the
application of our results to study the all-order small dispersion asymptotics
of solutions of the Toda chain related to the one hermitian matrix model (beta
= 2) as well as orthogonal polynomials outside the bulk.
