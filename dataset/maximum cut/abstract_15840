A theoretical light curve for the 1999 outburst of U Scorpii is presented in
order to obtain various physical parameters of the recurrent nova. Our U Sco
model consists of a very massive white dwarf (WD) with an accretion disk and a
lobe-filling, slightly evolved, main-sequence star (MS). The model includes a
reflection effect by the companion and the accretion disk together with a
shadowing effect on the companion by the accretion disk. The early visual light
curve (t ~ 1-15 days after maximum) is well reproduced by a thermonuclear
runaway model on a very massive WD close to the Chandrasekhar limit (M_{WD}=
1.37 \pm 0.01 M_\odot), in which optically thick winds blowing from the WD play
a key role in determining the nova duration. The duration of the strong wind
phase (t~0-17 days) is very consistent with the BeppoSAX supersoft X-ray
detection at t~19-20 days because supersoft X-rays are self-absorbed by the
massive wind. The envelope mass at the peak is estimated to be ~3x10^{-6}
M_\odot, which is indicating an average mass accretion rate ~2.5x10^{-7}
M_\odot yr^{-1} during the quiescent phase between 1987 and 1999. These
quantities are exactly the same as those predicted in a new progenitor model of
Type Ia supernovae.
