The effect of geometrical confinement, atomic position and orientation of
Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) on their thermal properties are investigated using
the phonon dispersion obtained using a Modified Valence Force Field (MVFF)
model. The specific heat ($C_{v}$) and the ballistic thermal conductance
($\kappa^{bal}_{l}$) shows anisotropic variation with changing cross-section
shape and size of the SiNWs. The $C_{v}$ increases with decreasing
cross-section size for all the wires. The triangular wires show the largest
$C_{v}$ due to their highest surface-to-volume ratio. The square wires with
[110] orientation show the maximum $\kappa^{bal}_{l}$ since they have the
highest number of conducting phonon modes. At the nano-scale a universal
scaling law for both $C_{v}$ and $\kappa^{bal}_{l}$ are obtained with respect
to the number of atoms in the unit cell. This scaling is independent of the
shape, size and orientation of the SiNWs revealing a direct correlation of the
lattice thermal properties to the atomistic properties of the nanowires. Thus,
engineering the SiNW cross-section shape, size and orientation open up new ways
of tuning the thermal properties at the nanometer regime.
