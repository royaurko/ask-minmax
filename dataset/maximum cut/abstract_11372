We present a study of two X-ray bursters in the Galactic Center field with
the ART-P telescope onboard GRANAT. During 1990-1992 approximately 100 X-ray
bursts were detected from the Galactic Center field and most of them were
identified with the two persistent sources, A1742-294 and SLX1744-299/300. The
burst recurrence times were found to be ~2.4 and ~4.6 hours, respectively,
which is significantly shorter them was previously thought. We calculated the
mean and maximum fluxes during the bursts and investigated their time profiles.
We found that the shape of A1742-294 bursts correlates with the burst peak
flux. The spectral analysis was carried out for the strongest burst, detected
from A1742-294 on Oct 18, 1990.
