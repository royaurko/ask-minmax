We report the synthesis, (micro)structural, magneto-transport and
magnetization of polycrystalline La2/3Ca1/3MnO3:Agx composites with x = 0.0,
0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) near
ferromagnetic (FM) transition is increased significantly with addition of Ag.
The FM transition temperature (TFM) is also increased slightly with Ag
addition. Magneto-transport measurements revealed that magneto-resistance MR is
found to be maximum near TFM. Further the increased MR of up to 60% is seen
above 300 K for higher silver added samples in an applied field of 7 Tesla.
Sharp TCR is seen near TFM with highest value of up to 15 % for Ag (0.4)
sample, which is an order of magnitude higher than as for present pristine
sample and best value yet reported for any polycrystalline LCMO compound.
Increased TCR, TFM and significant above room temperature MR of
La2/3Ca1/3MnO3:Agx composites is explained on the basis of improved grains size
and connectivity with silver addition in the matrix. Better coupled FM domains
and nearly conducting grain boundaries give rise to improved physical
properties of the La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 manganites.
