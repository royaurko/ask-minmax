Some of the properties of the globular clusters in NGC 5128 are compared to
those of Galactic globular clusters. Assuming the color- metallicity relations
that hold for Galactic globular clusters then the metal-poor clusters in NGC
5128 that have [Fe/H] < -1.80 are significantly fainter than are the more
metal-rich globulars in that galaxy. No such metallicity dependent luminosity
difference is observed among the globular clusters associated with the Milky
Way. Furthermore the NGC 5128 cluster sample contains two objects that, on the
basis of their observed colors, appear to be super metal-poor. It is speculated
that many of these apparently faint and metal-poor clusters in NGC 5128 are
actually objects resembling intermediate-age Galactic open clusters. It is also
found that large clusters with FWHM > 10 pc are typically less luminous in NGC
5128 than are their more more compact counterparts. In this respect the NGC
5128 cluster system is similar to the Galactic globular cluster system.
Finally, the present data may hint at the possibility that the NGC 5128 cluster
system differs from that surrounding the Milky Way, in that the NGC 5128
objects do not seem to exhibit a clear cut gap between the regions of the FWHM
vs M_v plane that are occupied by globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal
galaxies.
