In a recent experiment, a single DNA double helix is stretched and relaxed in
the presence of spermidine, a short positive polyelectrolyte, and the pulling
force is measured as a function of DNA extension. In a certain range of
spermidine concentration, a force plateau appears whose value shows maximum as
a function of spermidine concentration. We present a quantitative theory of
this plateau force based on the theory of reentrant condensation and derive
almost parabolic behavior of the plateau force as a function of the logarithm
of the spermidine concentration in the range of condensation. Our result is in
good agreement with experimental data.
