The hadronic shower longitudinal and lateral leakages and its effect on the
pion response and energy resolution of iron-scintillator barrel hadron
prototype calorimeter with longitudinal tile configuration with a thickness of
9.4 nuclear interaction lengths have been investigated. The results are based
on 100 GeV pion beam data at incidence angle $\Theta = 10^o$ at impact point Z
in the range from - 36 to 20 cm which were obtained during test beam period in
May 1995 with setup equipped scintillator detector planes placed behind and
back of the calorimeter. The fraction of the energy of 100 GeV pions at $\Theta
= 10^o$ leaking out at the back of this calorimeter amounts to 1.8 % and agrees
with the one for a conventional iron-scintillator calorimeter. Unexpected
behaviour of the energy resolution as a function of leakage is observed: 6 %
lateral leakage lead to 18 % improving of energy resolution in compare with the
showers without leakage. The measured values of longitudinal punchthrough
probability $(18 \pm 1) %$ and $(20 \pm 1) %$ for two different hit definitions
of leaking events agree with the earlier measurement for our calorimeter and
with the one for a conventional iron-scintillator calorimeter with the same
nuclear interaction length thickness respectively. Due to more soft cut for hit
definition in the leakage detectors the measured value of longitudinal
punchthrough probability more corresponds to the calculated iron equivalent
length $L_{Fe} = 158 cm$.
