We consider relaxation of an isolated system to the equilibrium using
detailed balance condition and Onsager's fluctuation approximation. There is a
small deviation from the equilibrium in two parameters. For this system,
explicit expressions both for the dependence of trajectory entropy on random
thermodynamic fluxes and for the dependence of entropy production on the most
probable thermodynamic fluxes are obtained. Onsager's linear relations are
obtained for the considered model using two methods (maximization of trajectory
entropy and Ziegler's maximization of entropy production). Two existing
interpretations of the maximum entropy production principle - as a physical
principle and as an effective inference procedure - are discussed in the paper.
