We examine the amplitude of the rotation velocity that can be attributed to
the dark matter halos of disk galaxies, focusing on well measured intermediate
radii. The data for 60 galaxies spanning a large range of mass and Hubble
types, taken together, are consistent with a dark halo velocity log(Vh) = C + B
log(r) with C = 1.47 (+0.15, -0.19) and B = 1/2 over the range 1 < r < 74 kpc.
The range in C stems from different choices of the stellar mass estimator, from
minimum to maximum disk. For all plausible choices of stellar mass, the implied
densities of the dark halos are lower than expected from structure formation
simulations in LCDM, which anticipate C > 1.6. This problem is not specific to
a particular type of galaxy or to the innermost region of the halo (cusp or
core); the velocity attributable to dark matter is too low at all radii.
