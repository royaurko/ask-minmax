Ultrathin polymer films that are produced e.g. by spin-coating are believed
to be stressed since polymers are 'frozen in' into out-of-equilibrium
configurations during this process. In the framework of a viscoelastic thin
film model, we study the effects of lateral residual stresses on the dewetting
dynamics of the film. The temporal evolution of the height profiles and the
velocity profiles inside the film as well as the dissipation mechanisms are
investigated in detail. Both the shape of the profiles and the importance of
frictional dissipation vs. viscous dissipation inside the film are found to
change in the course of dewetting. The interplay of the non-stationary
profiles, the relaxing initial stress and changes in the dominance of the two
dissipation mechanisms caused by nonlinear friction with the substrate is
responsible for the rich behavior of the system. In particular, our analysis
sheds new light on the occurrence of the unexpected maximum in the rim width
obtained recently in experiments on PS-PDMS systems.
