We prove that logarithmically divergent one-loop lattice Feynman integrals
have the general form I(p,a) = f(p)log(aM)+g(p,M) up to terms which vanish for
lattice spacing a -> 0. Here p denotes collectively the external momenta and M
is an arbitrary mass scale. The f(p) is shown to be universal and to coincide
with the analogous quantity in the corresponding continuum integral
(regularized, e.g., by momentum cut-off). This is essential for universality of
the lattice QCD beta-function and anomalous dimensions of renormalized lattice
operators at one loop. The result and argument presented here are simplified
versions of ones given in arXiv:0709.0781. A noteworthy feature of the argument
here is that it does not involve Taylor expansion in external momenta, hence
infra-red divergences associated with that expansion do not arise.
