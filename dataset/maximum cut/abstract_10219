We compute the joint probability density function (jpdf) P_N(M, \tau_M) of
the maximum M and its position \tau_M for N non-intersecting Brownian
excursions, on the unit time interval, in the large N limit. For N \to \infty,
this jpdf is peaked around M = \sqrt{2N} and \tau_M = 1/2, while the typical
fluctuations behave for large N like M - \sqrt{2N} \propto s N^{-1/6} and
\tau_M - 1/2 \propto w N^{-1/3} where s and w are correlated random variables.
One obtains an explicit expression of the limiting jpdf P(s,w) in terms of the
Tracy-Widom distribution for the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) of Random
Matrix Theory and a psi-function for the Hastings-McLeod solution to the
Painlev\'e II equation. Our result yields, up to a rescaling of the random
variables s and w, an expression for the jpdf of the maximum and its position
for the Airy_2 process minus a parabola. This latter describes the fluctuations
in many different physical systems belonging to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
universality class in 1+1 dimensions. In particular, the marginal probability
density function (pdf) P(w) yields, up to a model dependent length scale, the
distribution of the endpoint of the directed polymer in a random medium with
one free end, at zero temperature. In the large w limit one shows the
asymptotic behavior \log P(w) \sim - w^3/12.
