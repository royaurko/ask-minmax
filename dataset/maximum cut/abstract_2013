We construct self-consistent light and mass distribution models for 4 distant
spiral galaxies. The models include a bulge, a disk and an isothermal dark
matter. We find the luminosity profiles to have much steeper cut-off than that
of a simple exponential disk. We apply k-corrections and derive rest-frame
B-band mass-to-light ratios of the visible components and the central densities
of the dark halos; we discover no significant evolution with redshift of these
parameters.
