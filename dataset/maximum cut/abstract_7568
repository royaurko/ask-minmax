The B -> X_s l+ l- decay rate is known at the next-to-next-to-leading order
in QCD. It is proportional to alpha_em (mu)^2 and has a +- 4% scale uncertainty
before including the O(alpha_em log(M_W^2/m_b^2)) electromagnetic corrections.
We evaluate these corrections and confirm the earlier findings of Bobeth et al.
>. Furthermore, we complete the calculation of logarithmically enhanced
electromagnetic effects by including also QED corrections to the matrix
elements of four-fermion operators. Such corrections contain a collinear
logarithm log(m_b^2/m_l^2) that survives integration over the low dilepton
invariant mass region 1 GeV^2 < q^2 < 6 GeV^2 and enhances the integrated decay
rate in this domain. For the low-q^2 integrated branching ratio in the muonic
case, we find B (B -> X_s mu^+mu^-) = (1.59 +- 0.11) 10^(-6), where the error
includes the parametric and perturbative uncertainties only. For B (B -> X_s
e^+e^-), in the current BaBar and Belle setups, the logarithm of the lepton
mass gets replaced by angular cut parameters and the integrated branching ratio
for the electrons is expected to be close to that for the muons.
