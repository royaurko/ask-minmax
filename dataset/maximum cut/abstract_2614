We study the ground-state (T = 0) morphologies in the d = 3 random-field
Ising model (RFIM) using a computationally efficient graph-cut method. We focus
on paramagnetic states which arise for disorder strengths \Delta > \Delta c,
where \Delta c is the critical disorder strength at T = 0. These paramagnetic
states consist of correlated "domains" of up and down spins which are separated
by rough, fractal interfaces. They show novel scattering properties with a cusp
singularity in the correlation function at short distances.
