In this paper, we define a property, trimness, for lattices. Trimness is a
not-necessarily-graded generalization of distributivity; in particular, if a
lattice is trim and graded, it is distributive. Trimness is preserved under
taking intervals and suitable sublattices. Trim lattices satisfy a weakened
form of modularity. The order complex of a trim lattice is contractible or
homotopic to a sphere; the latter holds exactly if the maximum element of the
lattice is a join of atoms.
  Other than distributive lattices, the main examples of trim lattices are the
Tamari lattices and various generalizations of them. We show that the Cambrian
lattices in types A and B defined by Reading are trim, and we conjecture that
all Cambrian lattices are trim.
