We derive an upper limit for the mixedness of single bosonic mode gaussian
states propagating in dissipative channels. It is a function of the initial
squeezing and temperature of the channel only. Moreover the time at which von
Neumann's entropy reaches its maximum value coincides with that of complete
loss of coherence, thus defining a quantum-classical transition.
