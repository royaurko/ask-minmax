Closed, spatially homogeneous cosmological models with a perfect fluid and a
scalar field with exponential potential are investigated, using dynamical
systems methods. First, we consider the closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
models, discussing the global dynamics in detail. Next, we investigate
Kantowski-Sachs models, for which the future and past attractors are
determined. The global asymptotic behaviour of both the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker and the Kantowski-Sachs models is that they either
expand from an initial singularity, reach a maximum expansion and thereafter
recollapse to a final singularity (for all values of the potential parameter
kappa), or else they expand forever towards a flat power-law inflationary
solution (when kappa^2<2). As an illustration of the intermediate dynamical
behaviour of the Kantowski-Sachs models, we examine the cases of no barotropic
fluid, and of a massless scalar field in detail. We also briefly discuss
Bianchi type IX models.
