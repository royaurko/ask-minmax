Relativistic tunnel ionization of atoms by intense, elliptically polarized
light is considered. The relativistic version of the Landau-Dykhne formula is
employed. The general analytical expression is obtained for the relativistic
photoelectron spectra. The most probable angle of electron emission, the
angular distribution near this angle, the position of the maximum and the width
of the energy spectrum are calculated. In the weak field limit we obtain the
familiar non-relativistic results. For the case of circular polarization our
analytical results are in agreement with recent derivations of Krainov [V.P.
Krainov, J. Phys. B, {\bf 32}, 1607 (1999)].
