Surfaces which do not exhibit surface melting below the melting point
(nonmelting surfaces) have been recently observed to sustain a very large
amount of overheating. We present a theory which identifies a maximum
overheating temperature, and relates it to other thermodynamical properties of
the surface, in particular to geometrical properties more readily accessible to
experiment. These are the angle of partial wetting, and the nmelting-induced
faceting angle. We also present molecular dynamics simulations of a liquid
droplet deposited on Al(111), showing lack of spreading and partial wetting in
good agreement with the theory. PACS numbers: 68.10.Cr, 68.45.Gd, 61.50.Jr
