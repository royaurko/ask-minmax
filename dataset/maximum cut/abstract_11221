A planetary microlensing event is characterized by a short-lived perturbation
to the standard Paczy\'nski curve. Planetary perturbations typically last from
a few hours to a day, and have maximum amplitudes, $\dmax$, of $5-20%$ of the
standard curve. There exist a subset of binary-source events that can reproduce
these main features, and thus masquerade as planetary events. These events
require a binary source with a small flux ratio, $\epsil \sim 10^{-2}-10^{-4}$,
and a small impact parameter for the fainter source, $\beta_2 \lsim \epsil /
\dmax$. The detection probability of events of this type is $\sim \beta_2$, and
can be as high as $\sim 30%$; this is comparable to planetary detection rates.
Thus a sample of planetary-like perturbations could be seriously contaminated
by binary-source events, and there exists the possibility that completely
meaningless physical parameters would be derived for any given perturbation.
Here I derive analytic expressions for a binary-source event in the extreme
flux ratio limit, and use these to demonstrate the basic degeneracy between
binary source and planet perturbations. I describe how the degeneracy can be
broken by dense and accurate sampling of the perturbation, optical/infrared
photometry, or spectroscopic measurements.
