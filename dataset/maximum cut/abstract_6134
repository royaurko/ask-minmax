We introduce a new class of problems lying halfway between questions about
graph capacity and intersection. We say that two binary sequences x and y of
the same length have a skewincidence if there is a coordinate i for which
x_i=y_{i+1}=1 or vice versa. We give rather sharp bounds on the maximum number
of binary sequences of length n any pair of which has a skewincidence.
