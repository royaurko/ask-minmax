The 3D phase diagram of iron pnictides where the critical temperature depends
on charge density and microstrain in the active FeAs layers is proposed. The
iron pnictides superconductors are shown to be a practical realization of a
heterostructure at the atomic limit made of a superlattice of FeAs layers
intercalated by spacer layers. We have focussed our interest on the A 1-x
BxFe2As2 (122) families and we show that FeAs layers have a tensile microstrain
due to the misfit strain between the active layers and the spacers. We have
identified the critical range of doping and microstrain where the critical
temperature gets amplified to its maximum value.
