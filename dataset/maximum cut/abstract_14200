Ejection of material after the Deep Impact collision with Comet Tempel 1 was
studied based on analysis of the images made by the Deep Impact cameras during
the first 13 minutes after impact. Analysis of the images shows that there was
a local maximum of the rate of ejection at time of ejection ~10 s with typical
velocities ~100 m/s. At the same time, a considerable excessive ejection in a
few directions began, the direction to the brightest pixel changed by ~50 deg,
and there was a local increase of brightness of the brightest pixel. The
ejection can be considered as a superposition of the normal ejection and the
longer triggered outburst.
