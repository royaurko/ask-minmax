We analyze the spectrum of the ultrahigh energy (above \approx 10^{9} GeV)
cosmic rays. With a maximum likelihood analysis we show that the observed
spectrum is consistent with the decay of extragalactic GUT scale particles. The
predicted mass for these superheavy particles is m_X=10^b GeV, where
b=14.6_{-1.7}^{+1.6}.
