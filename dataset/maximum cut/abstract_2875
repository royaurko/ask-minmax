We study the apparent lack of power on large angular scales in the WMAP data.
We confirm that although there is no apparent lack of power at large angular
scales for the full-sky maps, the lowest multipoles of the WMAP data happen to
have the magnitudes and orientations, with respect to the Galactic plane, that
are needed to make the large scale power in cut-sky maps surprisingly small.
Our analysis shows that most of the large scale power of the observed CMB
anisotropy maps comes from two regions around the Galactic plane (~9% of the
sky). One of them is a cold spot within ~40 degrees of the Galactic center and
the other one is a hot spot in the vicinity of the Gum Nebula. If the current
full-sky map is correct, there is no clear deficit of power at large angular
scales and the alignment of the l=2 and l=3 multipoles remains the primary
intriguing feature in the full-sky maps. If the full-sky map is incorrect and a
cut is required, then the apparent lack of power remains mysterious. Future
missions such as Planck, with a wider frequency range and greater sensitivity,
will permit a better modeling of the Galaxy and will shed further light on this
issue.
