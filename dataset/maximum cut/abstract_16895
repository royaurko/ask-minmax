We present a family of static and evolving spherically symmetric Lorentzian
wormhole solutions in N+1 dimensional Einstein gravity. In general, for static
wormholes, we require that at least the radial pressure has a barotropic
equation of state of the form $p_r=\omega_r \rho$, where the state parameter
$\omega_r$ is constant. On the other hand, it is shown that in any dimension $N
\geq 3$, with $\phi(r)=\Lambda=0$ and anisotropic barotropic pressure with
constant state parameters, static wormhole configurations are always
asymptotically flat spacetimes, while in 2+1 gravity there are not only
asymptotically flat static wormholes and also more general ones. In this case,
the matter sustaining the three-dimensional wormhole may be only a pressureless
fluid. In the case of evolving wormholes with $N \geq 3$, the presence of a
cosmological constant leads to an expansion or contraction of the wormhole
configurations: for positive cosmological constant we have wormholes which
expand forever and, for negative cosmological constant we have wormholes which
expand to a maximum value and then recollapse. In the absence of a cosmological
constant the wormhole expands with constant velocity, i.e without acceleration
or deceleration. In 2+1 dimensions the expanding wormholes always have an
isotropic and homogeneous pressure, depending only on the time coordinate.
