We perform an analytic continuation of the two-loop remainder function for
the six-point planar MHV amplitude in N=4 SUSY, found by Goncharov, Spradlin,
Vergu and Volovich from the light-like Wilson loop representation. The
remainder function is continued into a physical region, where all but two
energy invariants are negative. It turns out to be pure imaginary in the
multi-Regge kinematics, which is in an agreement with the predictions based on
the Steinmann relations for the Regge poles and Mandelstam cut contributions.
The leading term reproduces correctly the expression calculated by one of the
contributors in the BFKL approach, while the subleading term presents a result, that
was not yet found with the use of the unitarity techniques. This supports the
applicability of the Wilson loop approach to the planar MHV amplitudes in N=4
SUSY.
