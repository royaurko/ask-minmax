Extending our recent work, we report on a calculation of the vector current
correlation function for light valence quarks in the deconfined phase of
quenched QCD in the temperature range 1.16Tc<T<2.98Tc. After performing a
systematic analysis of the in fluence of cut-off effects on light quark meson
correlators using clover improved Wilson fermions, we discuss resulting
constraints on the electrical conductivity in a quark gluon plasma.
