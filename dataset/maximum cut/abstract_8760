We show that for all finite fields F_q, there exists a curve C over F_q of
genus 3 such that the number of rational points on C is within 3 of the
Serre-Weil upper or lower bound. For some q, we also obtain improvements on the
upper bound for the number of rational points on a genus 3 curve over F_q.
