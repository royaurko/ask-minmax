Feynman diagrams are calculated by means of their Taylor series expansion in
terms of external momenta squared. It is demonstrated in various examples that
by the application of conformal mapping and Pad\'{e} approximants, it is
possible to obtain high precision results in the spacelike as well as in the
timelike region on the cut. Examples are given for two- and three-point
functions, but in principle the method is applicable also to four-point
functions.
