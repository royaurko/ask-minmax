This paper studies the following question: Given a surface $\Sigma$ and an
integer $n$, what is the maximum number of cliques in an $n$-vertex graph
embeddable in $\Sigma$? We characterise the extremal graphs for this question,
and prove that the answer is between $8(n-\omega)+2^{\omega}$ and $8n+{3/2}
2^{\omega}+o(2^{\omega})$, where $\omega$ is the maximum integer such that the
complete graph $K_\omega$ embeds in $\Sigma$. For the surfaces $\mathbb{S}_0$,
$\mathbb{S}_1$, $\mathbb{S}_2$, $\mathbb{N}_1$, $\mathbb{N}_2$, $\mathbb{N}_3$
and $\mathbb{N}_4$ we establish an exact answer.
