For an entire mapping $f:\mathbb C\mapsto\mathbb C$ and a triple $(p,\alpha,
r)\in (0,\infty)\times(-\infty,\infty)\times(0,\infty]$, the Gaussian integral
means of $f$ (with respect to the area measure $dA$) is defined by $$ {\mathsf
M}_{p,\alpha}(f,r)=\Big({\int_{|z|<r}e^{-\alpha|z|^2}dA(z)}\Big)^{-1}{\int_{|z|<r}|f(z)|^p{e^{-\alpha|z|^2}}dA(z)}.
$$ Via deriving a maximum principle for ${\mathsf M}_{p,\alpha}(f,r)$, we
establish not only Fock-Sobolev trace inequalities associated with ${\mathsf
M}_{p,p/2}(z^m f(z),\infty)$ (as $m=0,1,2,...$), but also convexities of
$r\mapsto\ln {\mathsf M}_{p,\alpha}(z^m,r)$ and $r\mapsto {\mathsf
M}_{2,\alpha<0}(f,r)$ in $\ln r$ with $0<r<\infty$.
