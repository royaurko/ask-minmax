Microarray technology is a process that allows thousands of genes
simultaneously monitor to various experimental conditions. It is used to
identify the co-expressed genes in specific cells or tissues that are actively
used to make proteins, This method is used to analysis the gene expression, an
important task in bioinformatics research. Cluster analysis of gene expression
data has proved to be a useful tool for identifying co-expressed genes,
biologically relevant groupings of genes and samples. In this paper we analysed
K-Means with Automatic Generations of Merge Factor for ISODATA- AGMFI, to group
the microarray data sets on the basic of ISODATA. AGMFI is to generate initial
values for merge and Spilt factor, maximum merge times instead of selecting
efficient values as in ISODATA. The initial seeds for each cluster were
normally chosen either sequentially or randomly. The quality of the final
clusters was found to be influenced by these initial seeds. For the real life
problems, the suitable number of clusters cannot be predicted. To overcome the
above drawback the current research focused on developing the clustering
algorithms without giving the initial number of clusters.
