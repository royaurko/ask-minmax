We provide an analytic theory to explain Anghel et al.'s recent numerical
finding whereby a maximum in the global performance emerges for a
sparsely-connected competitive population [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 058701 (2004)].
We show that the effect originates in the highly-correlated dynamics of
strategy choice, and can be significantly enhanced using a simple modification
to the model.
