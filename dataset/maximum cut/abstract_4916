We refine the relativistic constituent quark model developed in our previous
papers to include the confinement of quarks. It is done, first, by introducing
the scale integration in the space of alpha-parameters, and, second, by cutting
this scale integration on the upper limit which corresponds to an infrared
cutoff. In this manner one removes all possible thresholds presented in the
initial quark diagram. The cutoff parameter is taken to be the same for all
physical processes. We adjust other model parameters by fitting the calculated
quantities of the basic physical processes to available experimental data. As
an application, we calculate the electromagnetic form factors of the pion and
the transition form factors of the omega and eta Dalitz decays.
