Cosmic strings derived from string theory, supergravity or any theory of
choice should be stable if we hope to observe them. In this paper we consider
D-term strings in D=4, N=1 supergravity with a constant Fayet-Iliopoulos term.
We show that the positive deficit angle supersymmetric D-term string is
non-perturbatively stable by using standard Witten-Nester techniques to prove a
positive energy theorem. Particular attention is paid to the negative deficit
angle D-term string, which is known to violate the dominant energy condition.
Within the class of string solutions we consider, this violation implies that
the negative deficit angle D-term string must have a naked pathology and
therefore the positive energy theorem we prove does not apply to it. As an
interesting aside, we show that the Witten-Nester charge calculates the total
gravitational energy of the D-term string without the need for a cut-off, which
may not have been expected.
