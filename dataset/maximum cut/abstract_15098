This paper deals with MIMO detection for rank 4 LTE systems. The paper
revolves around a previously known detector [1, by Inkyu Lee, TCOM'2010] which
we shall refer to as RCSMLD
(Reduced-Constellation-Size-Maximum-Likelihood-Detector). However, a direct
application of the scheme in [1, by Inkyu Lee, TCOM'2010] to LTE/LTE-A rank 4
test cases results in unsatisfactory performance. The first contribution of the
paper is to introduce several modifications that can jointly be applied to the
basic RCSMLD scheme which, taken together, result in excellent performance. Our
second contribution is the development of a highly efficient hardware structure
for RCSMLD that allows for an implementation with very few multiplications.
