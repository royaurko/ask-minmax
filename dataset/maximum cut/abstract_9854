Let $\{X(t)= (X_1(t),X_2(t))^T,\ t \in \mathbb{R}^N\}$ be an
$\mathbb{R}^2$-valued continuous locally stationary Gaussian random field with
$\mathbb{E}[X(t)]=\mathbf{0}$. For any compact sets $A_1, A_2 \subset
\mathbb{R}^N$, precise asymptotic behavior of the excursion probability \[
\mathbb{P}\bigg(\max_{s\in A_1} X_1(s)>u,\, \max_{t\in A_2} X_2(t)>u\bigg),\ \
\text{ as }\ u \rightarrow \infty \] is investigated by applying the double sum
method. The explicit results depend not only on the smoothness parameters of
the coordinate fields $X_1$ and $X_2$, but also on their maximum correlation
$\rho$.
