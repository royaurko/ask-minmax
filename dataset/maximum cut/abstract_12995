The synthesis and structural study of the stoichiometric perovskite
La0.5Ba0.5CoO3 have allowed three forms to be isolated. Besides the disordered
La0.5Ba0.5CoO3 and the perfectly ordered layered LaBaCo2O6, a third form called
nanoscale-ordered LaBaCo2O6, is obtained. As evidenced by transmission electron
microscopy investigations, the latter consists of 112-type 90 degree oriented
domains fitted into each other at a nanometer scale which induce large strains
and consequently local atomic scale lattice distortions. These three
ferromagnetic perovskites exhibit practically the same Tc (174-179 K), but
differently from the other phases, the nanoscale-ordered LaBaCo2O6 is a hard
ferromagnet, with Hc = 4.2 kOe, due to the strains which may pin domain walls,
preventing the reversal of the spins in a magnetic field. The magnetotransport
properties of these phases show that all of them exhibit a maximum intrinsic
magnetoresistance, close to 6-7 % around Tc under 70 kOe but that the ordered
phase exhibits a much higher tunnelling magnetoresistance effect at low
temperature of about 15 % against 4 % due to the grain boundary effects.
