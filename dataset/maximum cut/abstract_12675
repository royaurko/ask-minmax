We analyze theoretically the propagation of surface plasmon polaritons about
a metallic corner with a finite bend radius, using a one-dimensional model
analogous to the scattering from a finite-depth potential well. We obtain
expressions for the energy reflection and transmission coefficients in the
short wavelength limit, as well as an upper bound for the transmittance. In
certain cases we find that propagation on non-planar interfaces may result in
lower losses than on flat surfaces, contrary to expectation. In addition, we
also find that the maximum transmittance depends non-monotonously on the bend
radius, allowing increased transmission with decreasing radius.
