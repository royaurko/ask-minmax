Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (spMVM) is the dominant operation in many
sparse solvers. We investigate performance properties of spMVM with matrices of
various sparsity patterns on the nVidia "Fermi" class of GPGPUs. A new "padded
jagged diagonals storage" (pJDS) format is proposed which may substantially
reduce the memory overhead intrinsic to the widespread ELLPACK-R scheme. In our
test scenarios the pJDS format cuts the overall spMVM memory footprint on the
GPGPU by up to 70%, and achieves 95% to 130% of the ELLPACK-R performance.
Using a suitable performance model we identify performance bottlenecks on the
node level that invalidate some types of matrix structures for efficient
multi-GPGPU parallelization. For appropriate sparsity patterns we extend
previous work on distributed-memory parallel spMVM to demonstrate a scalable
hybrid MPI-GPGPU code, achieving efficient overlap of communication and
computation.
