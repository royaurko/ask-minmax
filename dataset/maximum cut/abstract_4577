Some questions arising in the application of the thermal model to hadron
production in heavy ion collisions are studied. We do so by applying the
thermal model of hadron production to particle yields calculated by the
microscopic transport model RQMD(v2.3). We study the bias of incomplete
information about the final hadronic state on the extraction of thermal
parameters.It is found that the subset of particles measured typically in the
experiments looks more thermal than the complete set of stable particles. The
hadrons which show the largest deviations from thermal behaviour in RQMD(v2.3)
are the multistrange baryons and antibaryons. We also looked at the influence
of rapidity cuts on the extraction of thermal parameters and found that they
lead to different thermal parameters and larger disagreement between the RQMD
yields and the thermal model.
