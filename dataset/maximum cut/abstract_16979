The size and geometry of the prostate are known to be pivotal quantities used
by clinicians to assess the condition of the gland during prostate cancer
screening. As an alternative to palpation, an increasing number of methods for
estimation of the above-mentioned quantities are based on using imagery data of
prostate. The necessity to process large volumes of such data creates a need
for automatic segmentation tools which would allow the estimation to be carried
out with maximum accuracy and efficiency. In particular, the use of transrectal
ultrasound (TRUS) imaging in prostate cancer screening seems to be becoming a
standard clinical practice due to the high benefit-to-cost ratio of this
imaging modality. Unfortunately, the segmentation of TRUS images is still
hampered by relatively low contrast and reduced SNR of the images, thereby
requiring the segmentation algorithms to incorporate prior knowledge about the
geometry of the gland. In this paper, a novel approach to the problem of
segmenting the TRUS images is described. The proposed approach is based on the
concept of distribution tracking, which provides a unified framework for
modeling and fusing image-related and morphological features of the prostate.
Moreover, the same framework allows the segmentation to be regularized via
using a new type of "weak" shape priors, which minimally bias the estimation
procedure, while rendering the latter stable and robust.
