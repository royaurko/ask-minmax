We present MBIS (Multivariate Bayesian Image Segmentation tool), a clustering
tool based on the mixture of multivariate normal distributions model. MBIS
supports multi-channel bias field correction based on a B-spline model. A
second methodological novelty is the inclusion of graph-cuts optimization for
the stationary anisotropic hidden Markov random field model. Along with MBIS,
we release an evaluation framework that contains three different experiments on
multi-site data. We first validate the accuracy of segmentation and the
estimated bias field for each channel. MBIS outperforms a widely used
segmentation tool in a cross-comparison evaluation. The second experiment
demonstrates the robustness of results on atlas-free segmentation of two image
sets from scan-rescan protocols on 21 healthy subjects. Multivariate
segmentation is more replicable than the monospectral counterpart on
T1-weighted images. Finally, we provide a third experiment to illustrate how
MBIS can be used in a large-scale study of tissue volume change with increasing
age in 584 healthy subjects. This last result is meaningful as multivariate
segmentation performs robustly without the need for prior knowledge
