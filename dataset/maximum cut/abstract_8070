We present a method which uses cuts in colour-colour and reduced proper
motion-colour space to select white dwarfs without the recourse to spectroscopy
while allowing an adjustable compromise between completeness and efficiency.
Rather than just producing a list of white dwarf candidates, our method
calculates a probability of being a white dwarf (Pwd) for any object with
available multi band photometry and proper motion. We applied this method to
all objects in the SDSS DR10 photometric footprint and to a few selected
sources in DR7 which did not have reliable photometry in DR9 or DR10. This
application results in a sample of 61969 DR10 and 3799 DR7 photometric sources
with calculated Pwd from which it is possible to select a sample of ~23000
high-fidelity white dwarf candidates with Teff >~ 7000 K and <= 19. This sample
contains over 14000 high confidence white dwarfs candidates which have not yet
received spectroscopic follow-up. These numbers show that, to date, the
spectroscopic coverage of white dwarfs in the SDSS photometric footprint is, on
average, only ~40% complete. While we describe here in detail the application
of our selection to the SDSS catalogue, the same method could easily be applied
to other multi colour, large area surveys. We also publish a list of 8701
bright (<= 19) WDs with SDSS spectroscopy, of which 1781 are new
identifications in DR9/10.
