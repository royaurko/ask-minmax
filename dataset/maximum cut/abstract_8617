Status of the KEKB accelerator and the detector, BELLE, is reported. The
construction of the 3.5 Gev x 8 GeV electron-positron collider, and the
solenoid detector, BELLE, was completed in December, 1998. The commissioning of
them has been made since then. The BELLE detector has observed the first
hadronic event from the beam collision on Jun 1, 1999. The achieved maximum
luminosity by August 4th, 1999, was 3 x 10^32 cm^-2 sec^-1. The KEKB operation
will be continued after two months of summer break.
