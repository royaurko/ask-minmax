We consider the influence of optical and temperature-dependent atomic
fluctuations on the formation and propagation of optical vortex solitons in
dense media realized as hollow-core optical fibers filled with a cold atomic
gas in presence of optical pumping. We show different perturbation-induced
scenaria of complete destruction and smooth transformations of the topological
characteristics of localized optical structures in hollow-core fiber. The
maximum levels of optical and atomic fluctuations at which the soliton regime
can be maintained has been determined. The estimates for these levels show an
opportunity to observe the optical vortex solitions in the core-filling gas of
the fiber for temperatures smaller than the critical temperature for
Bose-Einstein condensate.
