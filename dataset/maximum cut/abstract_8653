We study charmonium properties below and above $T_c$ up to 1.8$T_c$, on
quenched anisotropic lattices. Information of the spectral functions is
extracted using the maximum entropy method and the constrained curve fitting.
We also calculate the color singlet and averaged free energies and evaluate the
charmonium spectrum with the potential model analysis. The relation between the
lattice result of the spectral function analysis and the potential model is
discussed.
