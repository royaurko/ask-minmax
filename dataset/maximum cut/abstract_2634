The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi satellite has detected ~120
pulsars above 100 MeV. While most gamma-ray pulsars have spectra that are well
modeled by a power law with an exponential cut-off at around a few GeV, some
show significant pulsed high-energy (HE, >10 GeV) emission. I present a study
of HE emission from LAT gamma-ray pulsars and discuss prospects for the
detection of pulsations at very high energies (VHE, >100 GeV) with ground-based
instruments.
