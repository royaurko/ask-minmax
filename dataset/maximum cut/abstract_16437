Gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries are searched using the
matched filtering technique. As the model waveform depends on a number of
parameters, it is necessary to filter the data through a template bank covering
the astrophysically interesting region of the parameter space. The choice of
templates is defined by the maximum allowed drop in signal-to-noise ratio due
to the discreteness of the template bank. In this paper we describe the
template-bank algorithm that was used in the analysis of data from the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and GEO 600 detectors to
search for signals from binaries consisting of non-spinning compact objects.
Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we study the efficiency of the bank and show
that its performance is satisfactory for the design sensitivity curves of
ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors GEO 600, initial
LIGO, advanced LIGO and Virgo. The bank is efficient to search for various
compact binaries such as binary primordial black holes, binary neutron stars,
binary black holes, as well as a mixed binary consisting of a non-spinning
black hole and a neutron star.
