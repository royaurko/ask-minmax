We construct an exact expression for the site percolation threshold p_c on a
quasi-regular tree, and a related exact lower bound for a quasi-regular graph.
Both are given by the inverse spectral radius of the appropriate Hashimoto
matrix used to count non-backtracking walks. The obtained bound always exceeds
the inverse spectral radius of the original graph, and it is also generally
tighter than the existing bound in terms of the maximum degree.
