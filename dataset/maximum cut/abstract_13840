We present an exact method of greatly speeding up belief propagation (BP) for
a wide variety of potential functions in pairwise MRFs and other graphical
models. Specifically, our technique applies whenever the pairwise potentials
have been {\em truncated} to a constant value for most pairs of states, as is
commonly done in MRF models with robust potentials (such as stereo) that impose
an upper bound on the penalty assigned to discontinuities; for each of the $M$
possible states in one node, only a smaller number $m$ of compatible states in
a neighboring node are assigned milder penalties. The computational complexity
of our method is $O(mM)$, compared with $O(M^2)$ for standard BP, and we
emphasize that the method is {\em exact}, in contrast with related techniques
such as pruning; moreover, the method is very simple and easy to implement.
Unlike some previous work on speeding up BP, our method applies both to
sum-product and max-product BP, which makes it useful in any applications where
marginal probabilities are required, such as maximum likelihood estimation. We
demonstrate the technique on a stereo MRF example, confirming that the
technique speeds up BP without altering the solution.
