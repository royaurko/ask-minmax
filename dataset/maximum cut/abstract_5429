The unitary group U(N) acts by conjugations on the space H(N) of NxN
Hermitian matrices, and every orbit of this action carries a unique invariant
probability measure called an orbital measure. Consider the projection of the
space H(N) onto the real line assigning to an Hermitian matrix its (1,1)-entry.
Under this projection, the density of the pushforward of a generic orbital
measure is a spline function with N knots. This fact was pointed out by Andrei
Okounkov in 1996, and the goal of the paper is to propose a multidimensional
generalization. Namely, it turns out that if instead of the (1,1)-entry we cut
out the upper left matrix corner of arbitrary size KxK, where K=2,...,N-1, then
the pushforward of a generic orbital measure is still computable: its density
is given by a KxK determinant composed from one-dimensional splines. The result
can also be reformulated in terms of projections of the Gelfand-Tsetlin
polytopes.
