We discuss the profile of the impact--parameter dependent elastic scattering
amplitude. Extraction of impact-parameter dependence from the dataset with
inclusion of the experimental data on elastic scattering at the LHC energies
helps to reveal the asymptotics of hadron interactions. Analysis of the data
clearly indicates that the impact-parameter elastic scattering amplitude exceed
the black disk limit at the LHC energy 7TeV and the inelastic overlap function
reaches its maximum value at $b>0$
