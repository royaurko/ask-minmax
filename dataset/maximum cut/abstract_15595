Let $e(E_1,\ldots,E_r)$ be the minimum genus of a closed Riemann surface
whose jacobian variety is isogenous to a product $E_1 \times \cdots \times E_r
\times A$, where $A$ is a product of jacobian varietes and $E_{1},\ldots,
E_{r}$ are elliptic curves. Let $e(r)$ be the maximum of these values
$e(E_1,\ldots,E_r)$. If $r \leq 3$, then it is known that
$e(E_1,\ldots,E_r)=r=e(r)$. We prove that (i) if $r \geq 4$ is even, then $e(r)
\leq 1+2^{(r-2)/2}r$ and (ii) if $r \geq 5$ is odd, then $e(r) \leq
1+2^{(r-3)/2}(r-1)$. This is done by constructing explicit Riemann surfaces
whose jacobian variety is isogenous to a product of any given $r$ elliptic
curves with some others jacobian varieties. The construction also permits to
obtain a $2$-dimensional family of Riemann surfaces of genus $g \in \{5,9\}$
whose jacobian varieties are isogenous to the product of $g$ elliptic curves
and also a $1$-dimensional family of Riemann surfaces of genus $13$ whose
jacobian varieties are isogenous to the product of $13$ elliptic curves.
