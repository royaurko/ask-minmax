We study the problem of estimability of means in undirected graphical
Gaussian models with symmetry restrictions represented by a colored graph.
Following on from previous studies, we partition the variables into sets of
vertices whose corresponding means are restricted to being identical. We find a
necessary and sufficient condition on the partition to ensure equality between
the maximum likelihood and least-squares estimators of the mean.
