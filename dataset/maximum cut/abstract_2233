Systematic and careful studies are made on the properties of the IJ=00
$\pi\pi$ and $K\bar K$ coupled-channel system, using newly derived dispersion
relations between the phase shifts and poles and cuts. The effects of nearby
branch point singularities to the determination of the $f_0(980)$ resonance are
estimated and and discussed.
