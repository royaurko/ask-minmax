Nowadays, sustained development of different social media can be observed
worldwide. One of the relevant research domains intensively explored recently
is analysis of social communities existing in social media as well as
prediction of their future evolution taking into account collected historical
evolution chains. These evolution chains proposed in the paper contain group
states in the previous time frames and its historical transitions that were
identified using one out of two methods: Stable Group Changes Identification
(SGCI) and Group Evolution Discovery (GED). Based on the observed evolution
chains of various length, structural network features are extracted, validated
and selected as well as used to learn classification models. The experimental
studies were performed on three real datasets with different profile: DBLP,
Facebook and Polish blogosphere. The process of group prediction was analysed
with respect to different classifiers as well as various descriptive feature
sets extracted from evolution chains of different length. The results revealed
that, in general, the longer evolution chains the better predictive abilities
of the classification models. However, chains of length 3 to 7 enabled the
GED-based method to almost reach its maximum possible prediction quality. For
SGCI, this value was at the level of 3 to 5 last periods.
