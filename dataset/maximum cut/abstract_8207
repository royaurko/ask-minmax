We present optical ($B$, $V$, $R_{\rm c}$, $I_{\rm c}$ and $y$) and near
infrared ($J$, $H$ and $K_{\rm s}$) photometric and spectroscopic observations
of a classical nova V1280 Scorpii for five years from 2007 to 2011. Our
photometric observations show a declining event in optical bands shortly after
the maximum light which continues $\sim$ 250 days. The event is most probably
caused by a dust formation. The event is accompanied by a short ($\sim$ 30
days) re-brightening episode ($\sim$ 2.5 mag in $V$), which suggests a
re-ignition of the surface nuclear burning. After 2008, the $y$ band
observations show a very long plateau at around $y$ = 10.5 for more than 1000
days until April 2011 ($\sim$ 1500 days after the maximum light). The nova had
taken a very long time ($\sim$ 50 months) before entering the nebular phase
(clear detection of both [\ion{O}{iii}] 4959 and 5007) and is still continuing
to generate the wind caused by H-burning. The finding suggests that V1280 Sco
is going through the historically slowest evolution. The interval from the
maximum light (2007 February 16) to the beginning of the nebular phase is
longer than any previously known slow novae: V723 Cas (18 months), RR Pic (10
months), or HR Del (8 months). It suggests that the mass of a white dwarf in
the V1280 Sco system might be 0.6 $M_\mathrm{\sun}$ or smaller. The distance,
based on our measurements of the expansion velocity combined with the directly
measured size of the dust shell, is estimated to be 1.1 $\pm$ 0.5 kpc.
