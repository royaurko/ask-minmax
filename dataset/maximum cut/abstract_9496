An intuitive physical mechanism for single attosecond pulse generation in
multi-cycle pulse regime is proposed. We suggest that the continuum spectra of
HHG can be controlled through the modulation of carrier wave, while keeping the
multi-cycle envelope unchanged approximately. By increasing the time interval
between the adjacent maximum return kinetic energy peaks, the kinetic energy of
the side peaks will be apparently suppressed by the multi-cycle envelope. The
photons with energies near the cutoff burst only at the pulse center with high
coherence, which contribute to the generation of single attosecond pulse. We
verify this mechanism by using a multi-cycle tri-color pulse as driver field.
