We discuss the phase structure of the NJL model in curved spacetime with
magnetic field using $1/N$-expansion and linear curvature approximation. The
effective potential for composite fields $\bar\psi \psi$ is calculated using
the proper-time cut-off in the following cases: a) at non-zero curvature,
b) at non-zero curvature and non-zero magnetic field, and c) at non-zero
curvature and non-zero covariantly constant gauge field. Chiral symmetry
breaking is studied numerically. We show that the gravitational field may
compensate the effect of the magnetic field what leads to restoration of chiral
symmetry.
