The spectra of postoutburst novae display either He+N or Fe II lines as the
most prominent non-Balmer lines at maximum light. Spectral diagnostics indicate
physical conditions for 'He/N' spectra that are consistent with their origin in
the white dwarf (WD) ejecta, whereas 'Fe II' spectra point to their formation
in a large circumbinary envelope of gas whose origin is the secondary star. A
determining parameter for which of the two types of spectra predominates may be
the binary mass ratio Msec/MWD. The increasing fraction of novae that are
observed to be 'hybrid' objects, where both classes of spectra appear
sequentially, is explained by changing parameters in the two emitting regions
during the postoutburst decline. We argue that most novae may be hybrids that
show both types of spectra during decline. The emission line intensity ratio O
I {\lambda}8446/{\lambda}7773 is suggested as a good density diagnostic for the
ejecta, and a finding list of emission lines identified in recent spectroscopic
surveys of novae is presented as an aid to future line identification work.
