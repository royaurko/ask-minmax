A partial matrix is a matrix where only some of the entries are given. We
determine the maximum rank of the symmetric completions of a symmetric partial
matrix where only the diagonal blocks are given and the minimum rank and the
maximum rank of the antisymmetric completions of an antisymmetric partial
matrix where only the diagonal blocks are given.
