We propose a Faraday anomalous dispersion optical filter (FADOF) based on a
rare-earth ion doped crystal. We present theoretical analyses for the
solid-state FADOF transmission. Our theoretical model predicts a maximum
transmission efficiency of 71% and a double-peaked transmission spectrum with a
bandwidth of 6 GHz under current experimental conditions. Our proposal may have
important applications in optical communications.
