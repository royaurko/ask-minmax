Motivated by WMAP's confirmation of an anomalously low value of the
quadrupole moment of the CMB temperature fluctuations, we investigate the
effects on the CMB of cutting off the primordial power spectrum P(k) at low
wave numbers. This could arise, for example, from a break in the inflaton
potential, a prior period of matter or radiation domination, or an oscillating
scalar field which couples to the inflaton. We reanalyze the full WMAP
parameter space supplemented by a low-k cutoff for P(k). The temperature
correlations by themselves are better fit by a cutoff spectrum, but including
the TE temperature-polarization spectrum reduces this preference to a 1.4 sigma
effect. Inclusion of large scale structure data does not change the conclusion.
If taken seriously, the low-k cutoff is correlated with optical depth so that
reionization occurs even earlier than indicated by the WMAP analysis.
