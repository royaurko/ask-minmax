We present a software framework for Belle II that reconstructs B mesons in
many decay modes with minimal user intervention. It does so by reconstructing
particles in user-supplied decay channels, and then in turn using these
reconstructed particles in higher-level decays. This hierarchical
reconstruction allows one to cover a relatively high fraction of all B decays
by specifying a limited number of particle decays. Multivariate classification
methods are used to achieve a high signal-to-background ratio in each
individual channel. The entire reconstruction, including the application of
pre-cuts and classifier trainings, is automated to a high degree and will allow
users to retrain to account for analysis-specific signal-side selections.
