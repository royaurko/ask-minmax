We study the effects of strong magnetic fields on the neutron star structure.
If the interior field of a star is on the same order of the surface field
currently observed, the influences of the magnetic field on the star mass and
radius are negligible. If one assumes that the internal magnetic field can be
as large as that estimated from the scalar virial theorem, considerable effects
can be induced. The maximum mass of stars is arisen substantially while the
central density is largely suppressed. For two equal-mass stars the radius of
the magnetic star can be larger by about 10% $\sim$ 20% than the nonmagnetic
star.
