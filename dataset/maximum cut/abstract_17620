We report observations of white-light ejecta in the low corona, for two
X-class flares on the 2013 May 13, using data from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. At least two distinct
kinds of sources appeared (chromospheric and coronal), in the early and later
phases of flare development, in addition to the white-light footpoint sources
commonly observed in the lower atmosphere. The gradual emissions have a clear
identification with the classical loop-prominence system, but are brighter than
expected and possibly seen here in the continuum rather than line emission. We
find the HMI flux exceeds the radio/X-ray interpolation of the bremsstrahlung
produced in the flare soft X-ray sources by at least one order of magnitude.
This implies the participation of cooler sources that can produce free-bound
continua and possibly line emission detectable by HMI. One of the early sources
dynamically resembles "coronal rain", appearing at a maximum apparent height
and moving toward the photosphere at an apparent constant projected speed of
134 $\pm$ 8 $\mathrm{km s^{-1}}$. Not much literature exists on the detection
of optical continuum sources above the limb of the Sun by non-coronagraphic
instruments, and these observations have potential implications for our basic
understanding of flare development, since visible observations can in principle
provide high spatial and temporal resolution.
