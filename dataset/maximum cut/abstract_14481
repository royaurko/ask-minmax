The highly two-dimensional superconducting system
Sr2(Mg$_y$Ti$_{1-y}$)O3FeAs, recently synthesized in the range of 0.2 < y <
0.5, shows an Mg concentration-dependent $T_c$. Reducing the Mg concentration
from y=0.5 leads to a sudden increase in $T_c$, with a maximum $T_c$ ~40 K at
y=0.2. Using first principles calculations, the unsynthesized stoichiometric
y=0 and the substoichiometric y=0.5 compounds have been investigated. For the
50% Mg-doped phase (y=0.5), Sr2(Mg$_y$Ti$_{1-y}$)O3 layers are completely
insulating spacers between FeAs layers, leading to the fermiology such as that
found for other Fe pnictides. At y=0, representing a phase with metallic
Sr2TiO3 layers, the $\Gamma$-centered Fe-derived Fermi surfaces (FSs)
considerably shrink or disappear. Instead, three $\Gamma$-centered Ti FSs
appear, and in particular two of them have similar size, like in MgB2.
Interestingly, FSs have very low Fermi velocity in large fractions: the lowest
being 0.6$\times10^6$ cm/s. Furthermore, our fixed spin moment calculations
suggest the possibility of magnetic ordering, with magnetic Ti and nearly
nonmagnetic Fe ions. These results indicate a crucial role of
Sr2(Mg$_y$Ti$_{1-y}$)O3 layers in this superconductivity.
