We report on a preliminary measurement of time-dependent CP-violating
asymmetries in B0 --> J/psi K0S and B0 --> psi(2S) K0S decays recorded by the
BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric B Factory at SLAC. The data sample
consisted of 9.0 fb-1 collected at the Y(4S) resonance and 0.8 fb-1
off-resonance. One of the pair of neutral B mesons produced at the Y(4S) was
fully reconstructed, while the flavor of the other neutral B meson was tagged
at the time of its decay. The value of the asymmetry amplitude, sin(2beta), was
determined from a maximum likelihood fit to the time distribution of 120 tagged
candidates to be sin(2beta) = 0.12 +- 0.37 (stat.) +- 0.09 (syst.)
(preliminary).
