We present radio interferometric observations of two irregular galaxies that
were candidates for having unusually extended HI emission. The galaxies, UGC
199 and DDO 26, otherwise appeared to be normal, low-luminosity systems with
modest star-formation rates. To a detection limit of 2--3E19 /cm^2 at a
resolution of about 50", however, the HI around neither galaxy is unusually
extended compared to other irregulars. The HI around UGC 199 appears as a
regular, symmetric distribution with regular rotation and a maximum rotation
speed of about 80 km/s. By contrast, the HI around DDO 26 shows a concentration
into two blobs with an arm in the outer parts to the northwest and some
additional emission to the northwest of that. The kinematical major axis is
approximately 75 deg from the HI and optical morphological axis which is
unusual for Im galaxies. In addition the velocity field in the outer parts of
the galaxy is messy and the velocity profiles at the two HI peaks are broad. We
suggest that DDO 26 has been perturbed externally or may be two dwarfs in the
process of merging.
