In this thesis we investigate proposed duals to QCD. Duals to QCD fall into
two categories: `top-down' and `bottom-up'. We take inspiration from both by
truncating a consistent solution to the type IIB supergravity equations of
motion (top-down). This model demonstrates dynamical chiral symmetry breaking,
has a running coupling and contains a holographic description of the vector
meson sector. By artificially extending the existing U(1) symmetry to SU(2)
(bottom-up) we then obtain a holographic description of the axial vector
sector. We show that this model reproduces the masses and decay constants of
the lightest mesons to the 10% level. By regulating the UV with a sharp cut-off
we can reproduce the rho meson masses to within 2%. Finally we demonstrate that
this model can be used to reproduce a very good agreement with hadronization
data for particle production over a range of four orders of magnitude.
