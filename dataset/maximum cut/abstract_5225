We propose a novel algorithm for greedy forward feature selection for
regularized least-squares (RLS) regression and classification, also known as
the least-squares support vector machine or ridge regression. The algorithm,
which we call greedy RLS, starts from the empty feature set, and on each
iteration adds the feature whose addition provides the best leave-one-out
cross-validation performance. Our method is considerably faster than the
previously proposed ones, since its time complexity is linear in the number of
training examples, the number of features in the original data set, and the
desired size of the set of selected features. Therefore, as a side effect we
obtain a new training algorithm for learning sparse linear RLS predictors which
can be used for large scale learning. This speed is possible due to matrix
calculus based short-cuts for leave-one-out and feature addition. We
experimentally demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm and its ability to
find good quality feature sets.
