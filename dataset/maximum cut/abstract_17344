We present the 1.9--4.2um spectra of the five bright (L<11.2) young stars
associated with silhouette disks with moderate to high inclination angle of
39--80deg in the M42 and M43 regions. The water ice absorption is seen toward
d121-1925 and d216-0939, while the spectra of d182-316, d183-405, and d218-354
show no water ice feature around 3.1um within the detection limits. By
comparing the water ice features toward nearby stars, we find that the water
ice absorption toward d121-1925 and d216-0939 most likely originates from the
foreground material and the surrounding disk, respectively. The angle of the
disk inclination is found to be mainly responsible for the difference of the
optical depth of the water ice among the five young stars. Our results suggest
that there is a critical inclination angle between 65deg and 75deg for the
circumstellar disk where the water ice absorption becomes strong. The average
density at the disk surface of d216-0939 was found to be 6.38x10^(-18) g
cm^(-3). The water ice absorption band in the d216-0939 disk is remarkable in
that the maximum optical depth of the water ice band is at a longer wavelength
than detected before. It indicates that the primary carrier of the feature is
purely crystallized water ice at the surface of the d216-0939 disk with
characteristic size of ~0.8um, which suggests grain growth. This is the first
direct detection of purely crystallized water ice in a silhouette disk.
