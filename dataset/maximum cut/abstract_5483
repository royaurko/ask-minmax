Intrabeam scattering (IBS) limits the emittance and single-bunch current that
can be achieved in electron or positron storage ring colliders, damping rings,
and light sources. Much theoretical work on IBS exists, and while the theories
have been validated in hadron and ion machines, the presence of strong damping
makes IBS in lepton machines a different phenomenon. We present the results of
measurements at CesrTA of IBS dominated beams, and compare the data with
theory. The beams we study have parameters typical of those specified for the
next generation of wiggler dominated storage rings: low emittance, small bunch
length, and few GeV energy. Our measurements are in good agreement with IBS
theory, provided a tail-cut procedure is applied.
