Two-transmitter Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel with multiple
antennas at the transmitters, legitimate receiver and eavesdroppers is studied.
The existence of unknown number of eavesdroppers is assumed but with maximum
number of antennas at any eavesdropper limited to a known value $N_E$. The
channel matrices between the transmitters and the receiver is available
everywhere, while the legitimate the legitimate transmitters and the legitimate
receiver have no information about the eavesdroppers channels. A new upperbound
is established and A new achievable DoF bound is provided and meets the
upperbound. It is important to note that the same problem has been studied
recently with arbitrarily varying eavesdropper channels and an upperbound has
been derived. However, our achievable sum secure DoF exceeds their previously
derived upperbound. Consequently, we revisited the uppperbound derivation and
we re-derived a new mathematically robust upperbound.
