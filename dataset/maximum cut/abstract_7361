We study the effects of the initial conditions of turbulent molecular clouds
on the ionization structure in newly formed H_{ii} regions, using
three-dimensional, photon-conserving radiative transfer in a pre-computed
density field from three-dimensional compressible turbulence. Our results show
that the initial density structure of the gas cloud can play an important role
in the resulting structure of the H_{ii} region. The propagation of the
ionization fronts, the shape of the resulting H_{ii} region, and the total mass
ionized depend on the properties of the turbulent density field. Cuts through
the ionized regions generally show ``butterfly'' shapes rather than spherical
ones, while emission measure maps are more spherical if the turbulence is
driven on scales small compared to the size of the H_{ii} region. The
ionization structure can be described by an effective clumping factor $\zeta=<
n > \cdot < n^2>/< n>^2$, where $n$ is number density of the gas. The larger
the value of $\zeta$, the less mass is ionized, and the more irregular the
H_{ii} region shapes. Because we do not follow dynamics, our results apply only
to the early stage of ionization when the speed of the ionization fronts
remains much larger than the sound speed of the ionized gas, or Alfv\'en speed
in magnetized clouds if it is larger, so that the dynamical effects can be
negligible.
