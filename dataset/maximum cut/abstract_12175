The superconducting properties of a recently proposed phenomenological model
for a weakly doped antiferromagnet are analyzed, taking into account
fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter. In this model, we assume that
the doped charge carriers can't move out of the antiferromagnetic sublattice
they were introduced. This case corresponds to the free carrier spectra with
the maximum at ${\bf k}=(\pm \pi /2 ,\pm \pi /2)$, as it was observed in ARPES
experiments in some of the cuprates in the insulating state [1]. The doping
dependence of the superconducting gap and the temperature-carrier density phase
diagram of the model are studied in the case of the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ pairing
symmetry and different values of the effective coupling. A possible relevance
of the results to the experiments on high-temperature superconductors is
discussed.
