To assess its usefulness, the peak version of color intensity projections
(CIPs) was used to display a summary of the grayscale images composing a
renogram as a single color image. Method For each pixel in a renogram, the time
point with the maximum intensity was used to control the hue of the color of
the corresponding pixel in the CIPs image. The hue ranged over
red-yellow-green-light blue-blue with red representing the earliest time.
Results For subjects with normal appearing kidneys, the injection site shows up
in red, the kidneys in a red-yellow and the bladder in a green-blue. A late
fill kidney typically appeared greener or bluer than a normal kidney indicating
it reached its peak intensity at a later time point than normal. Conclusions
Having the time and intensity information summarized in a single image promises
to speed up the initial impression of patients by less experienced interpreters
and should also provide a valuable training tool.
