The maximum entropy and reverse Monte-Carlo methods are applied to the
computation of the phonon density of states (DOS) from heat capacity data. The
approach is introduced and the formalism is described. Simulated data is used
to test the method, and its sensitivity to noise. Heat capacity measurements
from diamond are used to demonstrate the use of the method with experimental
data. Comparison between maximum entropy and reverse Monte-Carlo results shows
the form of the entropy used here is correct, and that results are stable and
reliable. Major features of the DOS are picked out, and acoustic and optical
phonons can be treated with the same approach. The treatment set out in this
paper provides a cost-effective and reliable method for studies of the phonon
properties of materials.
