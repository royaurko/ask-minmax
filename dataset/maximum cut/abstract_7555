The large decay rate observed by Belle for $B^+\to\psi(3770)K^+$, which is
comparable to $B^+\to\psi(3686)K^+$, might indicate either an unexpectedly
large S-D mixing angle $|\theta|\approx 40^o$ or the leading role of the
color-octet mechanism in D-wave charmonium production in B decay. By
calculating the production rate of $\psi(3770)$ in the continuum $e^+e^-$
annihilation at $\sqrt{s}=10.6$ GeV with these two possible approaches (i.e.
the large S-D mixing and the color-octet mechanism), we show that the
measurement for this process at Belle and BaBar may provide a clear cut
clarification for the two approaches. In addition, the radiative E1 transition
ratio $\Gamma(\psi(3770)\to \gamma\chi_{c2})/\Gamma(\psi(3770)\to
\gamma\chi_{c1})$ may dramatically change from $\sim$ 0.04 (for $\theta\approx
0^o$) to $\sim$ 200 (for $\theta\approx -40^o$) due to the large S-D
interference effect, thus the E1 transition measurement of $\psi(3770)$ at BES
and CLEO-c will also be very useful in clarifying this issue.
