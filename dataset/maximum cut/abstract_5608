Possible anomalous (or nonstandard) top-quark interactions with the gluon and
those with the W boson induced by SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) gauge-invariant
dimension-6 effective operators are studied in p p -> t tbar X -> l^+ X' (l=e
or mu) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The final charged-lepton (l^+)
angular distribution is first computed for nonvanishing nonstandard top-gluon
and top-W couplings with a cut on its transverse momentum. The
optimal-observable procedure is then applied to this distribution in order to
estimate the expected statistical uncertainties in measurements of those
couplings that contribute to this process in the leading order.
