A new tetrad is introduced within the framework of geometrodynamics for
non-null electromagnetic fields. This tetrad diagonalizes the electromagnetic
stress-energy tensor and allows for maximum simplification of the expression of
the electromagnetic field. The Einstein-Maxwell equations will also be
simplified.
