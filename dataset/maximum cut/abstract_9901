In this paper we review, and extend to the non-isothermal case, the results
published in [L. Barletti, J. Math. Phys. 55, 083303 (2014)], concerning the
application of the maximum entropy closure technique to the derivation of
hydrodynamic equations for particles with spin-orbit interaction and
Fermi-Dirac statistics. In the second part of the paper we treat in more
details the case of electrons on a graphene sheet and investigate various
asymptotic regimes
