We find that the mean meridional motion of the spot groups varies
considerably on a time scale of about 5-20 years. The maximum amplitude of the
variation is about 10-15 m/s in both the Sun's northern and the southern
hemispheres. Variation in the mean motion is considerably different during
different solar cycles. At the maximum epoch (year 2000) of the current
cycle~23, the mean motion is relatively strong in the past 100 years and
northbound in both the northern and the southern hemispheres. The power
spectral analyses suggest the existence of approximate 3.2- and 4.3-year
periodicities in the mean motion of the spot groups in the southern hemisphere,
whereas a 13-16 year periodicity is found to exist in the mean motion of the
northern hemisphere. There is strong evidence for a latitude-time dependency in
the periodicities of the mean motion. The north-south difference in the mean
motion also varies by about 10 m/s. During the recent cycles, the north-south
difference is negligibly small. Approximate 12- and 22-year periodicities are
found to exist in the north-south difference.
