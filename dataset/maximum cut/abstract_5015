In 2000 Nicholas J. Mackintosh (2000) published an article in "Nature"
referring to the concept of general intelligence ("g") claiming that there is
clear empirical evidence for the existence of the g factor and psychologists
are "united in their support of g". Surprisingly, his view remained yet
unchallenged although this issue is by no means as clear-cut as Mackintosh
argues. Let us therefore attempt to clarify some common but unfortunately major
misconceptions about g, which Mackintosh, following Jensen's (1998) precedent,
recounted in his "Nature" article. The bottom line is that Spearman's g does
not exist, that this has been known and acknowledged by leading scholars
(Guttman, 1992; Thurstone, 1947) of factor analysis for decades so that the
task of objectively defining human intelligence remains unfinished.
