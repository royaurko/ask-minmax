We describe the Dedekind cuts explicitly in terms of non-standard rational
numbers. This leads to another construction of a Dedekind complete totally
ordered field or, equivalently, to another proof of the consistency of the
axioms of the real numbers. We believe that our construction is simpler and
shorter than the classical Dedekind construction and Cantor construction of
such fields assuming some basic familiarity with non-standard analysis.
