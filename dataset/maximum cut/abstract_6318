The instability in the cosmic-ray (CR) precursor of a SN shock is studied.
The level of turbulence in this region determines the maximum energy of
accelerated CRs. The consideration is not limited by the case of weak
turbulence. It is assumed that Kolmogorov type nonlinear wave interactions
together with the ion-neutral collisions restrict the amplitude of random
magnetic field. As a result, the maximum energy of accelerated particles
strongly depends on the age of a SNR. It can be as high as $10^{17}Z$ eV in
young SNR and falls down to about $10^{10}Z$ eV at the end of Sedov stage ($Z$
is the particle charge). This finding may explain why the SNRs with the age
more than a few thousand years are not prominent sources of very high energy
$\gamma $-rays. The averaged spectrum of ultrarelativistic CR injected in the
interstellar medium is close or somewhat steeper than $E^{-2}$.
