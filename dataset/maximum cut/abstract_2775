In [K-K], Keller and Kindler proved a quantitative version of the famous
Benjamini - Kalai-Schramm Theorem on noise sensitiviy of Boolean funtions. The
result was extented to the continuous Gaussian setting in [K-M-S2] by means of
a Central Limit Theorem argument. In this work, we present a direct approach to
these results, both in discrete and continuous settings. The proof relies on
semigroup decompositions together with a suitable cut-off argument allowing for
the efficient use of the classical hypercontractivity tool behind these
results. It extends to further models of interest such as log-concave measures.
