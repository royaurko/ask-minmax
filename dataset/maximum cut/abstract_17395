A smart navigation system (an Electronic Travel Aid) based on an object
detection mechanism has been designed to detect the presence of obstacles that
immediately impede the path, by means of real time video processing. The
algorithm can be used for any general purpose navigational aid. This paper is
discussed, keeping in mind the navigation of the visually impaired, and is not
limited to the same. A video camera feeds images of the surroundings to a Da-
Vinci Digital Media Processor, DM642, which works on the video, frame by frame.
The processor carries out image processing techniques whose result contains
information about the object in terms of image pixels. The algorithm aims to
select the object which, among all others, poses maximum threat to the
navigation. A database containing a total of three sounds is constructed.
Hence, each image translates to a beep, where every beep informs the navigator
of the obstacles directly in front of him. This paper implements an algorithm
that is more efficient as compared to its predecessors.
