According to modern developments in turbulence theory, the "dissipation"
scales (u.v. cut-offs) $\eta$ form a random field related to velocity
increments $\delta_{\eta}u$. In this work we, using Mellin's transform combined
with the Gaussain large -scale boundary condition, calculate probability
densities (PDFs) of velocity increments $P(\delta_{r}u,r)$ and the PDF of the
dissipation scales $Q(\eta, Re)$, where $Re$ is the large-scale Reynolds
number. The resulting expressions strongly deviate from the Log-normal PDF
$P_{L}(\delta_{r}u,r)$ often quoted in the literature. It is shown that the
probability density of the small-scale velocity fluctuations includes
information about the large (integral) scale dynamics which is responsible for
deviation of $P(\delta_{r}u,r)$ from $P_{L}(\delta_{r}u,r)$. A framework for
evaluation of the PDFs of various turbulence characteristics involving spatial
derivatives is developed. The exact relation, free of spurious Logarithms
recently discussed in Frisch et al (J. Fluid Mech. {\bf 542}, 97 (2005)), for
the multifractal probability density of velocity increments, not based on the
steepest descent evaluation of the integrals is obtained and the calculated
function $D(h)$ is close to experimental data. A novel derivation (Polyakov,
2005), of a well-known result of the multi-fractal theory [Frisch, "Turbulence.
{\it Legacy of A.N.Kolmogorov}", Cambridge University Press, 1995)), based on
the concepts described in this paper, is also presented.
