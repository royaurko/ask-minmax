The computation of the NLO-QCD corrections to the cross sections for W \gamma
\gamma production in hadronic collisions is presented. We consider the case of
real photons in the final state, but include full leptonic decays of the W.
Numerical results for the LHC and the Tevatron are obtained through a parton
level Monte Carlo based on the structure of the VBFNLO program, allowing an
easy implementation of general cuts and distributions. We show the dependence
on scale variations of the integrated cross sections and provide evidence of
the fact that NLO QCD corrections strongly modify the LO predictions for
observables at the LHC both in magnitude and in shape.
