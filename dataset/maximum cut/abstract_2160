The interplay of QCD in $\Delta S=1,2$ non-leptonic weak transitions can be
rigorously analyzed, at the inclusive level, by studying the 2--point functions
associated with the corresponding $\Delta S=1,2$ effective Hamiltonians. The
next-to-leading order calculation of these correlators shows a huge ($\gsim
100\%$) gluonic enhancement of the $|\Delta I|=1/2$ channel, providing a
qualitative understanding of the $|\Delta I|=1/2$ rule within QCD.
