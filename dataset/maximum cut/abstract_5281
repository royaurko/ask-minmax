We present the analysis of the broadened, flourescent iron Kalpha line in
simultaneous XMM-Newton and RXTE data from the black hole Cygnus X-1. The
XMM-Newton data were taken in a modified version of the timing mode of the
EPIC-pn camera. In this mode the lower energy threshold of the instrument is
increased to 2.8 keV to avoid telemetry drop outs due to the brightness of the
source, while at the same time preserving the signal-to-noise ratio in the Fe
Kalpha band. We find that the best-fit spectrum consists of the sum of an
exponentially cut off power-law and relativistically smeared, ionized
reflection. The shape of the broadened Fe Kalpha feature is due to strong
Compton broadening combined with relativistic broadening. Assuming a standard,
thin accretion disk, the black hole is close to rotating maximally.
