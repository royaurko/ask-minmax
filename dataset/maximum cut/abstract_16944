Consider a time-varying collection of n points on the positive real axis,
modeled as exponentials of n Brownian motions whose drift vector at every time
point is determined by the relative ranks of the coordinate processes at that
time. If at each time point we divide the points by their sum, under suitable
assumptions the rescaled point process converges to a stationary distribution
(depending on n and the vector of drifts) as time goes to infinity. This
stationary distribution can be exactly computed using a recent result of Pal
and Pitman. The model and the rescaled point process are both central objects
of study in models of equity markets introduced by Banner, Fernholz, and
Karatzas. In this paper, we look at the behavior of this point process under
the stationary measure as $n$ tends to infinity. Under a certain `continuity at
the edge' condition on the drifts, we show that one of the following must
happen: either (i) all points converge to zero, or (ii) the maximum goes to one
and the rest go to zero, or (iii) the processes converge in law to a
non-trivial Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. The proof employs, among other
things, techniques from Talagrand's analysis of the low temperature phase of
Derrida's Random Energy Model of spin glasses. The main result establishes a
universality property for the BFK models and aids in explicit asymptotic
computations using known results about the Poisson-Dirichlet law.
