The bootstrap condition is generalized to $n$ reggeized gluons. As a result it
is demonstrated that the intercept generated by $n$ reggeized gluons cannot be
lower than the one for $n=2$. Arguments are presented that in the limit
$N_{c}\rightarrow\infty$ the bootstrap condition reduces the $n$ gluon chain
with interacting neighbours to a single BFKL pomeron. In this limit the leading
contribution from $n$ gluons corresponds to $n/2$ non-interacting BFKL pomerons
(the $n/2$ pomeron cut). The sum over $n$ leads to a unitary
$\gamma^{\ast}\gamma$ amplitude of the eikonal form.
