A cycle cover of a graph is a set of cycles such that every vertex is part of
exactly one cycle. An L-cycle cover is a cycle cover in which the length of
every cycle is in the set L. The weight of a cycle cover of an edge-weighted
graph is the sum of the weights of its edges.
  We come close to settling the complexity and approximability of computing
L-cycle covers. On the one hand, we show that for almost all L, computing
L-cycle covers of maximum weight in directed and undirected graphs is APX-hard
and NP-hard. Most of our hardness results hold even if the edge weights are
restricted to zero and one.
  On the other hand, we show that the problem of computing L-cycle covers of
maximum weight can be approximated within a factor of 2 for undirected graphs
and within a factor of 8/3 in the case of directed graphs. This holds for
arbitrary sets L.
