The uncovering of the large-scale structure that is hidden in the Zone of
Avoidance is essential to our quest for the understanding of the dynamics of
the nearby universe. Dedicated and sophisticated observations of the Zone of
Avoidance have to be matched by equally sophisticated theoretical tools for the
reconstruction of the large-scale structure from sparse, noisy and very
incomplete data. A general approach for the estimation of cosmological
parameters and the reconstruction of the density and velocity fields is
presented here, based on maximum likelihood analysis, Wiener filtering and
constrained realizations. Radial velocity surveys and the IRAS 1.2 Jy redshift
survey are used to reconstruct the Zone of Avoidance.
