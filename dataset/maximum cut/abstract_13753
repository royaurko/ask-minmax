We describe the University of Sheffield system used in the TempEval-2
challenge, USFD2. The challenge requires the automatic identification of
temporal entities and relations in text. USFD2 identifies and anchors temporal
expressions, and also attempts two of the four temporal relation assignment
tasks. A rule-based system picks out and anchors temporal expressions, and a
maximum entropy classifier assigns temporal link labels, based on features that
include descriptions of associated temporal signal words. USFD2 identified
temporal expressions successfully, and correctly classified their type in 90%
of cases. Determining the relation between an event and time expression in the
same sentence was performed at 63% accuracy, the second highest score in this
part of the challenge.
