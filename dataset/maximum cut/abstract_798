Unitarity cuts are widely used in analytic computation of loop amplitudes in
gauge theories such as QCD. We expand upon the technique introduced in
hep-ph/0503132 to carry out any finite unitarity cut integral. This technique
naturally separates the contributions of bubble, triangle and box integrals in
one-loop amplitudes and is not constrained to any particular helicity
configurations. Loop momentum integration is reduced to a sequence of algebraic
operations. We discuss the extraction of the residues at higher-order poles.
Additionally, we offer concise algebraic formulas for expressing coefficients
of three-mass triangle integrals. As an application, we compute all remaining
coefficients of bubble and triangle integrals for nonsupersymmetric six-gluon
amplitudes.
