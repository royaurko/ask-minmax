We compute the chemical and thermal history of the intra-cluster medium in
rich and poor clusters under the assumption that supernovae (I, II) are the
major responsible both for the chemical enrichment and the heating of the
intra-cluster gas. We assume that only ellipticals and S0 galaxies contribute
to the enrichment and heating of the intra-cluster gas through supernova driven
winds and explore several prescriptions for describing the feed-back between
supernovae and the interstellar medium in galaxies. We integrate then the
chemical and energetical contributions from single cluster galaxies over the
cluster luminosity function and derive the variations of these quantities as
functions of the cosmic time. We reach the following conclusions: i) while type
II supernovae dominates the chemical enrichment and energetics inside the
galaxies, type Ia supernovae play a predominant role in the intra-cluster
medium, ii) galaxy models, which reproduce the observed chemical abundances and
abundance ratios in the intra-cluster medium, predict a maximum of 0.3-0.4 keV
per particle of energy input, a result obtained by assuming that type Ia
supernovae contribute 100% of their initial blast wave energy whereas type II
supernovae contribute only by a few percents of their initial energy.
