Filamentation of linear polarized ultrashort laser pulses in non-axisymmetric
optical schemes with preferential directions to the optical axis in dependence
on polarization orientation was experimentally studied. Our experiments
demonstrated strong influence of a laser beam polarization on self-focusing of
the beam and plasma generation during filamentation. Maximum of linear plasma
density generated by an astigmatic laser pulse was different in both meridional
and sagittal foci and depended on the beam polarization orientation. A
difference of linear plasma density was observed in the case of superposition
of two parts of the laser beam going through a two-hole diaphragm depending on
the beam polarization and through a slit for collinear and normal slit
orientation relative to the pulse polarization. Laser pulses in IR and UV
wavelength domains led to similar result.
