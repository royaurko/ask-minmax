Dynamic Monte Carlo simulations for the open coarse-grained model of MFI type
zeolite were used to study the dynamics of adsorption and diffusion of n-butane
in silicalite-1. We demonstrated the influence of the confinement of the
structure of zeolite channels on both the dynamics of the adsorption process
and the maximum loading of adsorbate. We showed that the confinement and
channel blocking limit the adsorption and desorption processes. Moreover, they
cause the maximum loading in the zeolite structure for moderate pressures to be
higher than the one redicted by the Langmuir model for a flat and homogeneous
system.
