We exploit a simple one-dimensional trapping model introduced before,
prompted by the problem of ion current across a biological membrane. The
voltage-sensitive channels are open or closed depending on the value taken by
an external potential that has two contributions: a deterministic periodic and
a stochastic one. Here we assume that the noise source is colored and non
Gaussian, with a $q$-dependent probability distribution (where $q$ is a
parameter indicating the departure from Gaussianity). We analyze the behavior
of the oscillation amplitude as a function of both $q$ and the noise
correlation time. The main result is that in addition to the resonant-like
maximum as a function of the noise intensity, there is a new resonant maximum
as a function of the parameter $q$.
