We present a new parton level Monte Carlo program for the calculation of jet
cross sections in Deep Inelastic Scattering based on Born and next-to-leading
order matrix elements. Using a class of invariant jet definition schemes, the
program allows for the calculation of differential distributions of jet cross
sections in the basic kinematical variables (like s, x, y, W^2, Q^2...) as well
as for total jet cross sections. Various kinematical cuts can be chosen from an
input file.
