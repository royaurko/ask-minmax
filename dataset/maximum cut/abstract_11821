Within the one-dimensional tight-binding minibands and on-site
 Coloumbic interaction approximation, the absorption spectrum and coherent
wavepacket time evolution in an optically excited semiconductor superlattice
driven by dc-ac electric fields are investigated using the semiconductor Bloch
equations.
 The dominating roles of the ratios of dc-Stark to external ac frequency, as
well as ac-Stark to external ac frequency, is emphasized. If the former is an
integer ${\cal N}$, then also ${\cal N}$ harmonics are present within one Stark
frequency, while the fractional case leads to the formation of excitonic
fractional ladders. The later ratio determines the size and profile of the
wavepacket. In the absence of excitonic interaction it controls the maximum
size wavepackets reach within one cycle, while the interaction produces a
strong anisotropy and tends to palliate the dynamic wavepacket localization.
