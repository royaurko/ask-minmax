Survival analysis was applied to fisheries catch at age data to develop
maximum likelihood estimators for stock assessment. This new method estimated
natural mortality, fishing mortality and catchability from typical catch at age
matrices. Monte Carlo simulations suggested estimates were unbiased and
provided a better fit than the traditional multinomial approach. Application to
a dataset from Queensland's sea mullet fishery (Australia) estimated natural
mortality to be equal to 0.319 $\pm$ 0.165 year$^{-1}$.
