The FASTSUM collaboration has initiated a detailed study of thermal QCD using
2+1 flavours of improved Wilson quarks on anisotropic lattices. Spatial volumes
of (3fm)^3 and (4fm)^3 are used at fixed cut-off with temperatures ranging from
40 to 350 MeV (corresponding to temporal lattice extents of 128 to 16 lattice
units). Results presented here include the deconfinement temperature and a
study of the restoration of chiral symmetry, together with a brief summary of
our collaboration's other results from these ensembles.
