Perovskites are mixed oxides with the general formula ABO3. Many different
compositions have been found to be possible and their number is growing rapidly
due to their characteristics that make them ideal for various applications,
such as fabrication of cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Oxide
powders of LaxSr1-xCo1-y-zFeyMnzO3-{\delta} (x=0.4, 0.6, 0.8, y=0.4, 0.8 and
z=0.1, 0.2), named LSCFM, were prepared by mixing commercial powders. The
powders have been investigated as a function of the stoichiometry and the
crystal structure parameters have been determined using Rietveld analysis. The
results of the structural analysis for each sintered sample, at low temperature
sintering (1100 {\omicron}C), have been obtained by considering two cubic
perovskite phases, for x=0.4 or one cubic and one orthorhombic phase for x=0.6,
0.8, respectively. Analysis of microstructure has shown a maximum grain size of
~0.63 {\mu}m. The annealed sample at 1100 {\omicron}C, an almost single phase
specimen, exhibited an electrical conductivity of 1.29\times103 ({\Omega} \cdot
cm)-1. The sintered sample at 1250 {\omicron}C has higher conductivity but
sharper curve close to the maximum. We suggest that low temperature sintering
reveal two phase system with broader curve maximum and high conductivity for
future applications in SOFCs.
