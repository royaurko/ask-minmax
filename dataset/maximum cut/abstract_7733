(abbrev.) Linear acceleration emission occurs when a charged particle is
accelerated parallel to its velocity. We evaluate the spectral and angular
distribution of this radiation for several special cases, including constant
acceleration (hyperbolic motion) of finite duration. Based on these results, we
find the following general properties of the emission from an electron in a
linear accelerator that can be characterized by an electric field E acting over
a distance L: (i) the spectrum extends to a cut-off photon energy ~ LE^2 MeV,
where E is in units of the Schwinger critical field and L in units of the
Compton wavelength of the electron. (ii) the total energy emitted by a particle
traversing the accelerator is in agreement with the standard Larmor formula
(iii) the low frequency spectrum is flat for hyperbolic trajectories, but in
general depends on the details of the accelerator. We also show that linear
acceleration emission complements curvature radiation in the strongly
magnetized pair formation regions in pulsar magnetospheres. It dominates when
the length L of the accelerator is less than the formation length of curvature
photons, which is given by the ratio of the radius of curvature of the magnetic
field lines to the Lorentz factor of the particle. In standard static models of
pair creating regions linear acceleration emission is negligible, but it is
important in more realistic dynamical models in which the accelerating field
fluctuates on a short length-scale.
