The Universe is modeled as consisting of pressureless baryonic matter and a
bulk viscous fluid which is supposed to represent a unified description of the
dark sector. In the homogeneous and isotropic background the \textit{total}
energy density of this mixture behaves as a generalized Chaplygin gas. The
perturbations of this energy density are intrinsically nonadiabatic and source
relative entropy perturbations. The resulting baryonic matter power spectrum is
shown to be compatible with the 2dFGRS and SDSS (DR7) data. A joint statistical
analysis, using also Hubble-function and supernovae Ia data, shows that,
different from other studies, there exists a maximum in the probability
distribution for a negative present value of the deceleration parameter.
Moreover, the unified model presented here favors a matter content that is of
the order of the baryonic matter abundance suggested by big-bang
nucleosynthesis. A problem of simple bulk viscous models, however, is the
behavior of the gravitational potential and the reproduction of the CMB power
spectrum.
