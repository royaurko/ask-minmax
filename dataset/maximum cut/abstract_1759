In this letter, the SNR value at which the error performance curve of a soft
decision maximum likelihood decoder reaches the slope corresponding to the code
minimum distance is determined for a random code. Based on this value, referred
to as the critical point, new insight about soft bounded distance decoding of
random-like codes (and particularly Reed-Solomon codes) is provided.
