By using a result from the numerical algebraic geometry package Bertini we
show that (up to high numerical accuracy) a specific set of degree 6 and degree
9 polynomials cut out the secant variety $\sigma_{4}(\mathbb{P}^{2}\times
\mathbb{P} ^{2} \times \mathbb{P} ^{3})$. This, combined with an argument
provided by Landsberg and Manivel (whose proof was corrected by Friedland),
implies set-theoretic defining equations in degrees 5, 6 and 9 for a much
larger set of secant varieties, including $\sigma_{4}(\mathbb{P}^{3}\times
\mathbb{P} ^{3} \times \mathbb{P} ^{3})$ which is of particular interest in
light of the salmon prize offered by E. Allman for the ideal-theoretic defining
equations.
