We study the sudden quench of a one-dimensional p-wave superconductor through
its topological signature in the entanglement spectrum. The long-time evolution
of the system and its topological characterization depend on a pseudomagnetic
field ${\bs R}_{\mbox{\text eff}}(k)$, which connects both the initial and the
final Hamiltonians, hence exhibiting a memory effect. In particular, we explore
the robustness of the Majorana zero-mode associated with the entanglement cut
in the topologically nontrivial phase and identify the parameter space in which
the mode can survive in the infinite-time limit.
