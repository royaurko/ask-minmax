Families of symmetric simple random walks on Cayley graphs of Abelian groups
with a bound on the number of generators are shown to never have sharp cut off
in the sense of Diaconis for the convergence to the stationary distribution in
the total variation norm. This is a situation of bounded degree and no
expansion. Sharp cut off or the cut off phenomenon has been shown to occur in
families such as random walks on a hypercube in which the degree is unbounded
as well as on a random regular graph where the degree is fixed, but there is
expansion. These examples agree with Peres' conjecture relating sharp cut off,
spectral gap and mixing time.
