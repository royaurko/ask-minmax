We present a generalization of the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton
predictor-corrector numerical integration methods to an adaptive grid. The step
size may be chosen dynamically in order to maintain a desired relative
magnitude of error in each step. We demonstrate that the methods remain
convergent to the expected degree, and apply various methods to the famous
problem of determining the maximum possible mass of a neutron star supported by
pure fermionic exclusion pressure. We reproduce the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
result of 0.71 solar masses using only 23 integration steps, and reproducing
both mass and radius within 1% requires 27. We also present various
optimizations and features of our implementation.
