We present the results from ASCA and OSSE simultaneous observations of the
Seyfert 1.5 galaxy MCG+8-11-11 performed in August-September 1995. The ASCA
observations indicate a modest flux increase (20%) in 3 days, possibly
correlated to a softening of the 0.6-9 keV spectrum. The spectrum is well
described by a hard power law (Gamma=1.64) absorbed by a column density
slightly larger than the Galactic value, with an iron line at 6.4 keV of EW=400
eV. The simultaneous OSSE data are characterized by a much softer power law
with photon index Gamma=3.0, strongly suggesting the presence of a spectral
break in the hard X/soft gamma-ray band. A joint fit to OSSE and ASCA data
clearly shows an exponential cut-off at about 300 keV, and strong reflection
component. MCG+8-11-11 features a spectral break in the underlying continuum
unambiguously. This, together with the inferred low compactness of this source,
favours thermal or quasi-thermal electron Comptonization in a structured Corona
as the leading process of high energy radiation production.
