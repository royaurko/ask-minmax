We report field- and current-induced domain wall (DW) depinning experiments
in Ta/Co20Fe60B20/MgO nanowires through a Hall cross geometry. While purely
field-induced depinning shows no angular dependence on in-plane fields, the
effect of the current depends crucially on the internal DW structure, which we
manipulate by an external magnetic in-plane field. We show for the first time
depinning measurements for a current sent parallel to the DW and compare its
depinning efficiency with the conventional case of current flowing
perpendicularly to the DW. We find that the maximum efficiency is similar for
both current directions within the error bars, which is in line with a
dominating damping-like spin-orbit torque (SOT) and indicates that no large
additional torques arise for currents parallel to the DW. Finally, we find a
varying dependence of the maximum depinning efficiency angle for different DWs
and pinning levels. This emphasizes the importance of our full angular scans
compared to previously used measurements for just two field directions
(parallel and perpendicular to the DW) and shows the sensitivity of the
spin-orbit torque to the precise DW structure and pinning sites.
