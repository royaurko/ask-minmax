This work is based on the first results from a systematic search for high
redshift Type Ia supernovae. Using filters in the R-band we discovered seven
such SNe, with redshift z = 0.3 - 0.5, before or at maximum light. Type Ia SNe
are known to be a homogeneous group of SNe, to first order, with very similar
light curves, spectra and peak luminosities. In this talk we report that the
light curves we observe are all broadened (time dilated) as expected from the
expanding universe hypothesis. Small variations from the expected 1+z
broadening of the light curve widths can be attributed to a width-brightness
correlation that has been observed for nearby SNe (z<0.1). We show in this talk
the first clear observation of the cosmological time dilation for macroscopic
objects.
