The point of this note is to prove that the secrecy function attains its
maximum at y=1 on all known extremal even unimodular lattices. This is a
special case of a conjecture by Belfiore and Sol\'e. Further, we will give a
very simple method to verify or disprove the conjecture on any given unimodular
lattice.
