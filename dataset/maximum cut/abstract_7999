Nucleon pole contribution in the $pp\to ppK^+K^-$ reaction below the
threshold of the production of the $\phi$ meson is studied within the effective
Lagrangian approach. It is assumed that the $K^- p$ final state originates from
the decay of the hyperons $\Lambda(1115)$ and $\Lambda(1405)$. In addition to
the $pp$ final state interaction (FSI) parametrized using the Jost function, we
have also considered the $K^+K^-$ FSI with the techniques of the chiral unitary
approach, where the scalar mesons $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ were dynamically
generated. Hence, the contributions from scalar mesons $f_0(980)$ and
$a_0(980)$ occur through the $K^+ K^-$ FSI. It is shown that the available
experimental data are well reproduced, especially the total cross sections and
the invariant mass distributions of $pp$ and $K^+K^-$. Furthermore, different
forms of the couplings (pseudoscalar and pseudovector) for the $\pi NN$
interaction and different strengths for the proton-proton FSI are also
investigated. It is found that the contributions from hyperon $\Lambda(1115)$
and $\Lambda(1405)$ are different between these two kinds of couplings. On the
other hand, the effects of the proton-proton FSI can be adjusted by the cut off
parameters used in the form factors.
