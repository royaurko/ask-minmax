Recent progress on scattering amplitudes has benefited from the mathematical
technology of symbols for efficiently handling the types of polylogarithm
functions which frequently appear in multi-loop computations. The symbol for
all two-loop MHV amplitudes in planar SYM theory is known, but explicit
analytic formulas for the amplitudes are hard to come by except in special
limits where things simplify, such as multi-Regge kinematics. By applying
symbology we obtain a formula for the leading behavior of the imaginary part
(the Mandelstam cut contribution) of this amplitude in multi-Regge kinematics
for any number of gluons. Our result predicts a simple recursive structure
which agrees with a direct BFKL computation carried out in a parallel
publication.
