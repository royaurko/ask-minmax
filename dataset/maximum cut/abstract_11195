In order to investigate non-uniformity in the luminosity evolution of Type Ia
supernovae, we fit the lightcurves with a multi-parameter empirical model. The
model provides a quantitative method of analyzing the lightcurves of Type I
supernovae and a convenient and continuous representation of the photometric
data. Using photometry of the well-observed event SN 1994D we demonstrate the
application of the model and construct a bolometric lightcurve. The rise time
of the bolometric light curve can be estimated and compared to current
theoretical models. By applying this model to a large number of SN Ia
lightcurves in various filters, we can explore the variations among individual
events and derive systematic correlations. We find that the initial decline
rate after maximum light correlates with the decline rate at late phases. Such
correlations can be used to constrain theoretical models.
