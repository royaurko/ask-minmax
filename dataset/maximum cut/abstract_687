For a semi-abelian variety over a global function field which is isogenous to
an isotrivial one, we show that on the product of local points of a subvariety
satisfying a minor condition, the topological closure of a finitely generated
subgroup of %the group of its global points cuts out exactly the global points
of the subvariety lying in this subgroup. As a corollary, on every
non-isotrivial super-singular curve of genus two over a global function field,
we conclude that the Brauer-Manin condition cuts out exactly the set of its
rational points.
