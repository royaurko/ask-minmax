We present a formalism for analyzing interferometric observations of Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy and polarization data. The formalism is
based upon the ell-space expansion of the angular power spectrum favoured in
recent years. Explicit discussions of maximum likelihood analysis, power
spectrum reconstruction, parameter estimation, imaging and polarization are
given. As an example, several calculations for the Degree Angular Scale
Interferometer (DASI) and Cosmic Background Interferometer (CBI) experiments
are presented.
