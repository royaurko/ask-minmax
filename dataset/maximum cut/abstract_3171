The global atmospheric temperature anomalies of Earth reached a maximum in
1998 which has not been exceeded during the subsequent 10 years. The global
anomalies are calculated from the average of climate effects occurring in the
tropical and the extratropical latitude bands. El Nino/La Nina effects in the
tropical band are shown to explain the 1998 maximum while variations in the
background of the global anomalies largely come from climate effects in the
northern extratropics. These effects do not have the signature associated with
CO2 climate forcing. However, the data show a small underlying positive trend
that is consistent with CO2 climate forcing with no-feedback.
