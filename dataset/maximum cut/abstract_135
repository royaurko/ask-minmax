Acoustic Emission (AE) data from single point turning machining are analysed
in this paper in order to gain a greater insight of the signal statistical
properties for Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) applications. A statistical
analysis of the time series data amplitude and root mean square (RMS) value at
various tool wear levels are performed, &#65533;nding that ageing features can
be revealed in all cases from the observed experimental histograms. In
particular, AE data amplitudes are shown to be distributed with a power-law
behaviour above a cross-over value. An analytic model for the RMS values
probability density function (pdf) is obtained resorting to the Jaynes' maximum
entropy principle (MEp); novel technique of constraining the modelling function
under few fractional moments, instead of a greater amount of ordinary moments,
leads to well-tailored functions for experimental histograms.
