P/As-substitution effects on the transport properties of polycrystalline
LaFeP$_{1-x}$As$_{x}$O$_{1-y}$F$_{y}$ with $x$ = 0 -- 1.0 and $y$ = 0 -- 0.1
have been studied. In the F-free samples ($y$ = 0), a new superconducting (SC)
dome with a maximum $T_{c}$ of 12 K is observed around $x$ = 0 -- 0.3. This is
separated from another SC dome with $T_{c}$ $\sim$10 K at $x$ = 0.6 -- 0.8 by
an antiferromagnetic region ($x$ = 0.3 -- 0.6), giving a two-dome feature in
the $T_{c}-x$ phase diagram. As $y$ increases, the two SC domes merge together,
changing to a double peak structure at $y$ = 0.05 and a single dome at $y$ =
0.1. This proves the presence of two different Fermi surface states in this
system.
