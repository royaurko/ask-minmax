Here we revisit the bag phenomenology of the deconfining phase transition to
replenish it by introducing systematically the bag surface tension. Comparing
the free energy of such bags and that one of the strings confining the static
quark-antiquark pair, we express the string tension in terms of the bag surface
tension and thermal pressure in order to estimate the bag characteristics using
the lattice QCD data. Our analysis of the bag entropy density demonstrates that
the surface tension coefficient is amazingly negative at the cross-over
(continuous transition). This approach allows us to naturally account for an
appearance of a very pronounced maximum (observed in the lattice QCD
simulations) of the entropy of the bound static quark-antiquark pair. The
vicinity of the (tri)critical endpoint is also analyzed to clarify the meaning
of vanishing surface tension coefficient.
