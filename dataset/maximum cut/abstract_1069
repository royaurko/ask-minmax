A gauge invariant flow equation is derived by applying a Wilsonian momentum
cut-off to gauge invariant field variables. The construction makes use of the
geometrical effective action for gauge theories in the Vilkovisky-DeWitt
framework. The approach leads to modified Nielsen identities that pose
non-trivial constraints on consistent truncations. We also evaluate the
relation of the present approach to gauge fixed formulations as well as
discussing possible applications.
