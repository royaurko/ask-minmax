The Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation is used to model surface waves in
wave tanks of hydrodynamic laboratories. Analysis of the linearized NLS
equation shows that its harmonic solutions with a small amplitude modulation
have a tendency to grow exponentially due to the so-called Benjamin-Feir
instability. To investigate this growth in detail, we relate the linearized
solution of the NLS equation to a fully nonlinear, exact solution, called
soliton on finite background. As a result, we find that in the range of
instability the maximum amplitude increase is finite and can be at most three
times the initial amplitude.
