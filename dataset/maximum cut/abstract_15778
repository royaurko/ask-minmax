We re-analyze constraints on the cosmological constant that can be obtained
by examining the statistics of strong gravitational lensing of distant quasars
by intervening galaxies, focusing on uncertainties in galaxy models (including
velocity dispersion, luminosity functions, core radii and magnification bias
effects) and on the parameters of the galaxy distribution and luminosity
functions. In the process we derive new results on magnification biasing for
galaxy lenses with non-zero core radii, and on how to infer the proper velocity
dispersions appropriate for use in lensing statistics. We argue that the
existing data do not disfavor a large cosmological constant. In fact, for a set
of reasonable parameter choices, using the results of 5 optical quasar lensing
surveys we find that a maximum likelihood analysis favors a value of $\om$ in
the range $ \approx 0.25$-0.55 in a flat universe. An open cosmology is not
favored by the same statistical analysis. Systematic uncertainties are likely
to be dominant, however, as these results are sensitive to uncertainties in our
understanding of galaxy luminosity functions, and dark matter velocity
dispersions, as well as the choice of lensing survey, and to a lesser extent
the existence of core radii. Further observational work will be required before
it is possible to definitively distinguish between cosmological models on the
basis of gravitational lensing statistics.
