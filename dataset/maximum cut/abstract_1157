We describe an algorithm, implemented in Python, which can enumerate any
permutation class with polynomial enumeration from a structural description of
the class. In particular, this allows us to find formulas for the number of
permutations of length n which can be obtained by a finite number of block
sorting operations (e.g., reversals, block transpositions, cut-and-paste
moves).
