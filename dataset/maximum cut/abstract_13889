The gas gain and energy resolution of single and double THGEM detectors
(5{\times}5cm2 effective area) with mini-rims (rim is less than 10{\mu}m) were
studied. The maximum gain can reach 5{\times}103 and 2{\times}105 for single
and double THGEM respectively, while the energy resolution of 5.9 keV X-ray
varied from 18% to 28% for both single and double THGEM detectors of different
hole sizes and thicknesses.All the experiments were investigated in mixture of
noble gases(argon,neon) and small content of other gases(iso-butane,methane) at
atmospheric pressure.
