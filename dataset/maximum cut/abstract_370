A method of cut-off regularization is proposed to evaluate vacuum corrections
in nuclear matter in the framework of the Hartree approximation. Bulk
properties of nuclear matter calculated by this method are a good agreement
with results analyzed by empirical values. The vacuum effect is quantitatively
evaluated through a cut-off parameter and its role for saturation property and
compressional properties is clarified.
