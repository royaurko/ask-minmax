We present results of observations at 47 and 95 microns from the Kuiper
Airborne Observatory of several ``Vega-like'' stars. Spatial cuts and aperture
photometry are presented for Beta Pictoris, Fomalhaut, and HD 135344, 139614,
142527, and 169142, four stars that had been suggested to possibly represent
more distant examples of the Vega phenomenon by Walker and Wolstencroft. We
have modelled the dust around beta Pic and Fomalhaut with a spatially and
optically thin disk to determine the constraints our new observations place on
the properites of the dust disks that are required to explain the infrared and
optical properties of these two stars. For beta Pic we find that models similar
to those proposed by Backman, Gillett, and Witteborn can fit our data quite
well. For Fomalhaut we find that very different models are required which have
much ``blacker'' dust with a much shallower density distribution, surface
density proportional to r^{-0.5}$, than for beta Pic. Our observations of the
four HD stars are consistent with their being spatially unresolved. Because of
their distance, this does not allow us to put any new constraints on their
circumstellar shells.
