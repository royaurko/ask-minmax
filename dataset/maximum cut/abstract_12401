We study the decay mode of top quark decaying into Wb in the TC2 model where
the top quark is distinguished from other fermions by participating in a strong
interaction. We find that the TC2 correction to the decay width $\Gamma (t \to
b W) $ is generally several percent and maximum value can reach 8% for the
currently allowed parameters. The magnitude of such correction is comparable
with QCD correction and larger than that of minimal supersymmetric model. Such
correction might be observable in the future colliders. We also study the TC2
correction to the branching ratio of top quark decay into the polarized W
bosons and find the correction is below $ 1 % $. After considering the TC2
correction, we find that our theoretical predictions about the decay branching
ratio are also consistent with the experimental data.
