The spin periods of the ten observed Anomalous X-ray Pulsars and Soft
Gamma-ray Repeaters lie in the very narrow range 6-12 s. We use a point
likelihood technique to assess the constraints this clustering imposes on the
birth period and on the final period of such systems. We consider a general law
for their spin evolution described by a constant braking index. We find that,
for positive values of the braking index, the observed clustering requires an
upper cut-off period that is very close to the maximum observed period of about
12 s. We also show that the constraint on the birth period depends very
strongly on the assumed value of the braking index n, ranging from a few
milliseconds for n>2 to a few seconds for n<2. We discuss the possible ways of
tightening these constraints based on similarities with the population of radio
pulsars and with future observations of such sources with current X-ray
observatories.
