Long-range beam-beam interactions (parasitic crossings) are one of the main
luminosity performance limitations for the Frascati e+e- Phi-factory DAFNE. In
particular, the parasitic crossings lead to a substantial lifetime reduction of
both beams in collision. This puts a limit on the maximum storable current and,
as a consequence, on the achievable peak and integrated luminosity. In order to
alleviate the problem numerical and experimental studies of the parasitic
crossings compensation with current-carrying wires have been performed at
DAFNE. Two such wires have been installed at both ends of the KLOE interaction
region. Switching on the wires in agreement with the numerical predictions,
improvement in the lifetime of the 'weak' beam (positrons) has been obtained at
the maximum current of the 'strong' one (electrons) without luminosity loss. In
this paper we describe the parasitic crossings effects in DAFNE, summarize the
results of numerical simulations on their compensation with the wires and
discuss the experimental measurements and observations.
