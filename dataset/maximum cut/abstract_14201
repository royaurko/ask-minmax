The Peking University Integral Split Ring Radio Frequency Quadrupole(ISR RFQ)
accelerator was constructed in 1999 with a high duty factor 16.7% and
repetition frequency 166Hz, and it was able to accelerate N+, O+,O-, C+ and He+
from 1.6kev/u to 65keV/u. It was later upgraded as an injector of the Separated
Function RFQ (SFRFQ). The experiments indicated that the maximum accelerated O+
beam current could exceed 3.2mA with energy 1.03MeV and an energy spread (FWHM)
3.1%. Then the beam transports through a 1m-long magnetic triplet to the
entrance of SFRFQ and is finally accelerated to 1.64MeV. The beam conditioning
of RFQ were carefully optimized to satisfy the requirements of the SFRFQ. The
combined accelerator eventually can deliver 0.53mA O+ beam with energy 1.65MeV,
which has sufficiently demonstrated the feasibility of the SFRFQ structure.
