We study tunneling conductance in ferromagnetic
semiconductor/insulator/s-wave superconductor junction where Rashba spin-orbit
interaction (RSOI) and exchange field are taken into account in the
ferromagnetic semiconductor. We show that normalized conductance at zero
voltage has a maximum as a function of RSOI for high transparent interface and
finite exchange field. This is because Andreev reflection probability shows a
nonmonotonic dependence on RSOI in the presence of the exchange field. On the
other hand, for intermediate transparent interface, normalized conductance at
zero voltage has a reentrant shape at zero or small exchange field with
increasing RSOI but is monotonically increasing by RSOI at large exchange
field.
