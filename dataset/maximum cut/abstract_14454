This paper summarizes some highlights from the Pierre Auger Observatory that
were presented at the ICRC 2011 in Beijing. The cumulative exposure has grown
by more than 60% since the previous ICRC to above 21000 km^2 sr yr. Besides
giving important updates on the energy spectrum, mass composition, arrival
directions, and photon- and neutrino upper limits, we present first
measurements of the energy spectrum down to 3 x 10^{17} eV, first distributions
of the shower maximum, X_max, together with new surface detector related
observables sensitive to X_max, and we present first measurements of the p-air
cross section at ~ 10^{18} eV. Serendipity observations such as of atmospheric
phenomena showing time evolutions of elves extend the breadth of the
astrophysics research program.
