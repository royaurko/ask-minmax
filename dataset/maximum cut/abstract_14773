We analyze the STM current through electronic resonances on a substrate as a
function of tip-surface distance. We show that when the tip approaches the
surface a Fano hybridization can occur between the electronic resonance on the
substrate and the continuum of conduction states in the STM tip. A maximum of
the density of states of the electronic resonance at some energy can then lead
to a dip of the STM signal $dI/dV$. Resonances in graphene, known as mid gap
states, are good candidates to produce this type of Fano interference. The mid
gap states can be produced by local defects or adsorbates and we analyze the
cases of top and hollow configurations of adsorbates.
