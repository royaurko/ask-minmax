An efficient decoder for the generalized first-order Reed-Muller code
RM_q(1,m) is essential for the decoding of various block-coding schemes for
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing with reduced peak-to-mean power
ratio. We present an efficient and simple maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm
for RM_q(1,m). It is shown that this algorithm has lower complexity than other
previously known maximum-likelihood decoders for RM_q(1,m).
