We study the hadron-quark phase transition at finite temperature in the
interior of protoneutron stars, combining the Dyson-Schwinger model for quark
matter with the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach for hadronic matter. We discuss
the dependence of the results on different nuclear three-body forces and on
details of the quark model. %Compared to the bag model, the transition from the
hadron phase %(without hyperons) to the quark phase appears at large density. A
maximum mass exceeding two solar masses can be obtained with a strong
three-body force and suitable parameter values in the Dyson-Schwinger model.
With a hybrid configuration, the maximum mass of protoneutron stars is larger
then that of cold neutron stars, such that a delayed collapse might be possible
in principle.
