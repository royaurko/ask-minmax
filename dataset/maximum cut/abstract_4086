We find that multifractal scaling is a robust property of a large class of
continuous stochastic processes, constructed as exponentials of long-memory
processes. The long memory is characterized by a power law kernel with tail
exponent $\phi+1/2$, where $\phi >0$. This generalizes previous studies
performed only with $\phi=0$ (with a truncation at an integral scale), by
showing that multifractality holds over a remarkably large range of
dimensionless scales for $\phi>0$. The intermittency multifractal coefficient
can be tuned continuously as a function of the deviation $\phi$ from 1/2 and of
another parameter $\sigma^2$ embodying information on the short-range amplitude
of the memory kernel, the ultra-violet cut-off (``viscous'') scale and the
variance of the white-noise innovations. In these processes, both a viscous
scale and an integral scale naturally appear, bracketing the ``inertial''
scaling regime. We exhibit a surprisingly good collapse of the multifractal
spectra $\zeta(q)$ on a universal scaling function, which enables us to derive
high-order multifractal exponents from the small-order values and also obtain a
given multifractal spectrum $\zeta(q)$ by different combinations of $\phi$ and
$\sigma^2$.
