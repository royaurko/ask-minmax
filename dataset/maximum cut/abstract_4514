The two-loop Euler-Heisenberg-type effective action for N = 1 supersymmetric
QED is computed within the background field approach. The background vector
multiplet is chosen to obey the constraints D_\a W_\b = D_{(\a} W_{\b)} =
const, but is otherwise completely arbitrary. Technically, this calculation
proves to be much more laborious as compared with that carried out in
hep-th/0308136 for N = 2 supersymmetric QED, due to a lesser amount of
supersymmetry. Similarly to Ritus' analysis for spinor and scalar QED, the
two-loop renormalisation is carried out using proper-time cut-off
regularisation. A closed-form expression is obtained for the holomorphic sector
of the two-loop effective action, which is singled out by imposing a relaxed
super self-duality condition.
