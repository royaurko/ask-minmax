The hadronic $\kt$-spectrum inside a high energy jet is determined including
corrections of relative magnitude $\cO{\sqrt{\alpha_s}}$ with respect to the
Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA), in the limiting spectrum
approximation (assuming an infrared cut-off $Q_0 =\lqcd$) and beyond
($Q_0\ne\lqcd$). The results in the limiting spectrum approximation are found
to be, after normalization, in impressive agreement with measurements by the
CDF collaboration. A new integral representation for the "hump-backed" plateau
is also reported.
