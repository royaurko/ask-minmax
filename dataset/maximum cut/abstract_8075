We present a radial velocity study of the RY Tau jet-disk system, designed to
determine whether a transfer of angular momentum from disk to jet can be
observed. Many recent studies report on the rotation of T Tauri disks, and on
what may be a signature of T Tauri jet rotation. However, due to observational
difficulties, few studies report on both disk and jet within the same system to
establish if the senses of rotation match and hence can be interpreted as a
transfer of angular momentum. We report a clear signature of Keplerian rotation
in the RY Tau disk, based on Plateau de Bure observations. We also report on
the transverse radial velocity profile of the RY Tau jet close to the star. We
identify two distinct profile shapes: a v-shape which appears near jet shock
positions, and a flat profile which appears between shocks. We do not detect a
rotation signature above 3 sigma uncertainty in any of our transverse cuts of
the jet. Nevertheless, if the jet is currently in steady-state, the errors
themselves provide a valuable upper limit on the jet toroidal velocity of 10
km/s, implying a launch radius of < 0.45 AU. However, possible contamination of
jet kinematics, via shocks or precession, prevents any firm constraint on the
jet launch point, since most of its angular momentum could be stored in
magnetic form rather than in rotation of matter.
