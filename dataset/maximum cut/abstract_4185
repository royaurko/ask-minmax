The production of photon pairs in $e^+e^-\rightarrow f \bar f \gamma\gamma$
processes is studied using exact helicity amplitudes at tree level. Total cross
sections, including initial state radiation effects, are given. They are
presented in the case of quarks as a function of $y_{\rm cut}$ in the JADE
algorithm. In the case of leptons we use cuts similar to the ones employed in a
recent L3 analysis. Masses of the final state fermions are taken into account
when appropriate. The cross section $e^+e^-\rightarrow \tau^+ \tau^-
\gamma\gamma$ is about 10\% larger when the $\tau$ mass is neglected. We
obtain, with a different method, results which are in good agreement with L3
Montecarlo simulation.
