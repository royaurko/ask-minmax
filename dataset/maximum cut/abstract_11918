Temperature-dependent Brillouin scattering studies have been carried out on
La_{0.77}Ca_{0.23}MnO_3 across the paramagnetic insulator - ferromagnetic metal
(I-M) transition. The spectra show a surface Rayleigh wave (SRW) and a high
velocity pseudo surface acoustic wave (HVPSAW) besides bulk acoustic waves
(BAW). The Brillouin shifts associated with SRW and HVPSAW show blue-shifts,
where as the frequencies of the BAW decrease below the I-M transition
temperature (T_C) of 230 K. These results can be understood based on the
temperature dependence of the elastic constants. We also observe a central peak
whose width is maximum at T_C.
