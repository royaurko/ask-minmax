We present PEANUT (ParallEl AligNment UTility), a highly parallel GPU-based
read mapper with several distinguishing features, including a novel q-gram
index (called the q-group index) with small memory footprint built on-the-fly
over the reads and the possibility to output both the best hits or all hits of
a read. Designing the algorithm particularly for the GPU architecture, we were
able to reach maximum core occupancy for several key steps. Our benchmarks show
that PEANUT outperforms other state-of- the-art mappers in terms of speed and
sensitivity. The software is available at http://peanut.readthedocs.org.
