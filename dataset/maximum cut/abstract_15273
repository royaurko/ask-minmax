We study the charmonium spectral functions at finite momentum and the
dispersion relation of $\eta_c$ at finite temperature. For the analysis of the
spectral function, we use an extended maximum entropy method (MEM). We perform
the MEM analysis for the product space of Euclidean correlators in different
channels or momenta to incorporate information encoded in correlations among
the Euclidean correlators in MEM. We find that this method can improve the
error of the reconstructed spectral images. To study the dispersion relation,
we introduce a definition of the peak position in the spectral image in which
the associated error can be estimated on the basis of MEM. We find that the
dispersion relation of $\eta_c$ at finite temperature follows the Lorentz
invariant form even near the dissociation temperature $T\simeq1.7T_c$.
