The superconducting state of LiFeAs single crystals with the maximum critical
temperature $T_c\,\approx\,17\,K$ in the 111 family has been studied in detail
by multiple Andreev reflections (MAR) spectroscopy implemented by the
break-junction technique. The three superconducting gaps, $\Delta_{\Gamma}\,=
(5.1-6.5)\,meV$, $\Delta_L\,= (3.8-4.8)\,meV$, and $\Delta_S\,= (0.9-1.9)\,meV$
(at $T\,<<\,T_c$), as well as their temperature dependences, have been directly
determined in a tunneling experiment with these samples. The anisotropy degrees
of the order parameters in the k-space have been estimated as $<\,8$%,
$\approx12$%, and $\approx20$%, respectively. Andreev spectra have been fitted
within the extended Kummel-Gunsenheimer-Nikolsky model with allowance for
anisotropy. The relative electron-boson coupling constants in LiFeAs have been
determined by approximating the ${\Delta}(T)$ dependences by the system of the
two-band Moskalenko and Suhl equations. It has been shown that the densities of
states in bands forming ${\Delta}_{\Gamma}$ and ${\Delta}_L$ are approximately
the same, intraband pairing dominates in this case, and the interband coupling
constants are related as
${\lambda}_{{\Gamma}L}\,\approx\,{\lambda}_{L{\Gamma}}\,<<
{\lambda}_{S{\Gamma}},\,{\lambda}_{SL}$.
