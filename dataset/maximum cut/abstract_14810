We report 138 spectral observations of the H-alpha emission line of the
radio- and gamma-ray-emitting Be/X-ray binary LSI+61303 obtained during the
period of September 1998 -- January 2013. From measuring various H-alpha
parameters, we found that the orbital modulation of the H-alpha is best visible
in the equivalent width ratio EW(B)/EW(R), the equivalent width of the blue
hump, and in the radial velocity of the central dip. The periodogram analysis
confirmed that the H-alpha emission is modulated with the orbital and
superorbital periods. For the past 20 years the radius of the circumstellar
disk is similar to the Roche lobe size at the periastron. It is probably
truncated by a 6:1 resonance. The orbital maximum of the equivalent width of
H-alpha emission peaks after the periastron and coincides on average with the
X-ray and gamma-ray maxima. All the spectra are available upon request from the
contributors and through the CDS.
