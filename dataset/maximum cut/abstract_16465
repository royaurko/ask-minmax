We present an analysis of the neutrino oscillation solutions of the solar
neutrino problem in the framework of four-neutrino mixing where a sterile
neutrino is added to the three standard ones. We perform a fit to the full data
set corresponding to the 825-day Super-Kamiokande data sample as well as to
Chlorine, GALLEX and SAGE and Kamiokande experiments. In our analysis we use
all measured total event rates as well as all Super-Kamiokande data on the
zenith angle dependence and the recoil electron energy spectrum. We consider
both transitions via the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) mechanism as well
as oscillations in vacuum (just-so) and find the allowed solutions for
different values of the additional mixing angles. This framework permits
transitions into active or sterile neutrinos controlled by the additional
parameter $\cos^2(\vartheta_{23}) \cos^2(\vartheta_{24})$ . We discuss the
maximum allowed values of this additional mixing parameter for the different
solutions.
