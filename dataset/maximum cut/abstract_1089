In this paper we propose an elementary topological approach which unifies and
extends various different results concerning fixed points and periodic points
for maps defined on sets homeomorphic to rectangles embedded in euclidean
spaces. We also investigate the associated discrete semidynamical systems in
view of detecting the presence of chaotic-like dynamics.
