A new algebraic method is developed to reduce the size of the transfer matrix
of Ising and three-state Potts ferromagnets, on strips of width r sites of
square and triangular lattices. This size reduction has been set up in such a
way that the maximum eigenvalues of both the reduced and original transfer
matrices became exactly the same. In this method we write the original transfer
matrix in a special blocked form in such a way that the sums of row elements of
a block of the original transfer matrix be the same. The reduced matrix is
obtained by replacing each block of the original transfer matrix with the sum
of the elements of one of its rows. Our method results in significant matrix
size reduction which is a crucial factor in determining the maximum eigenvalue.
