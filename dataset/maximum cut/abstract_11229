We have studied the statistical properties of the energy of individual
acoustic modes, extracted from 310 days of GOLF data near the solar minimum.
The exponential distribution of the energy of each mode is clearly seen. The
modes are found to be uncorrelated with a +-0.6 % accuracy, thus supporting the
hypothesis of stochastic excitation by the solar convection. Nevertheless, the
same analysis performed on the same modes just before the solar maximum, using
IPHIR data, rejects the hypothesis of no correlation at a 99.3 % confidence
level. A simple model suggests that 31.3 +-9.4 % of the energy of each mode is
coherent among the modes studied in IPHIR data, correponding to a mean
correlation of 10.7 +-5.9 %.
