We report, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, spectral phase
characterization and line-by-line pulse shaping of an optical frequency comb
generated by nonlinear wave mixing in a microring resonator. Through
programmable pulse shaping the comb is compressed into a train of
near-transform-limited pulses of \approx 300 fs duration (intensity full width
half maximum) at 595 GHz repetition rate. An additional, simple example of
optical arbitrary waveform generation is presented. The ability to characterize
and then stably compress the frequency comb provides new data on the stability
of the spectral phase and suggests that random relative frequency shifts due to
uncorrelated variations of frequency dependent phase are at or below the 100
microHertz level.
