Motivated by the narrow range of spin frequencies of nearly 20 accreting
neutron stars, Bildsten (1998) conjectured that their spin-up had been halted
by the emission of gravitational waves. He also pointed out that small
nonaxisymmetric temperature variations in the accreted crust will lead to
"wavy" electron capture layers, whose horizontal density variations naturally
create a mass quadrupole moment.
  We present a full calculation of the crust's elastic adjustment to these
density perturbations and find that the elastic response of the crust reduces
Bildsten's original estimate of the quadrupole moment in the thin outer crust
by a factor of 20-50. However, this basic picture, when applied to capture
layers in the deep inner crust, can generate quadrupoles in the necessary range
as long as there are ~5% lateral temperature variations in the inner crust. By
calculating the thermal flow throughout the core and the crust, we find that
temperature gradients this large are easily maintained by asymmetric heat
sources or lateral composition gradients in the crust.
  We also derive a general relation between the stresses and strains in the
crust and the maximum quadrupole moment they can generate. We show under quite
general conditions that maintaining a quadrupole of the magnitude necessary to
balance the accretion torque requires dimensionless strains close to 0.01 at
near-Eddington accretion rates, of order the breaking strain of conventional
materials.
