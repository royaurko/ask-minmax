Scaling relations between asteroseismic quantities and stellar parameters are
essential tools for studying stellar structure and evolution. We will address
two of them, namely, the relation between the large frequency separation
($\Delta \nu$) and the mean density ($\bar{\rho}$) as well as the relation
between the frequency of the maximum in the power spectrum of solar-like
oscillations ($\nu_{\rm max}$) and the cut-off frequency ($\nu_{\rm c}$).
  For the first relation, we will consider the possible sources of
uncertainties and explore them with the help of a grid of stellar models. For
the second one, we will show that the basic physical picture is understood and
that departure from the observed relation arises from the complexity of
non-adiabatic processes involving time-dependent treatment of convection. This
will be further discussed on the basis of a set of 3D hydrodynamical simulation
of surface convection.
