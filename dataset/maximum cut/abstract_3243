We prove an analogue of the weak Omori-Yau maximum principle and
Khas'minskii's criterion for graphs in the general setting of Keller and Lenz.
Our approach naturally gives the stability of stochastic incompleteness under
certain surgeries of graphs. It allows to develop a unified approach to all
known criteria of stochastic completeness/incompleteness, as well as to obtain
new criteria.
