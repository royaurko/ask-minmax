In this study, X-ray spectral and pulse timing analysis of the high mass
X-ray binary (HMXB) pulsar 4U 1907+09, based on the observations with RXTE are
presented. Spin rate measurements indicate a new spin-down episode with a rate
close to the previous steady spin-down rate. Orbital phase resolved
spectroscopy reveals that the Hydrogen column density varies through the orbit
reaching to its maximum value just after periastron. A slight spectral
softening with increasing luminosity is also observed.
