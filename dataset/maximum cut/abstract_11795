Monte Carlo simulations of a system consisting of a ferromagnetic layer
exchange coupled to a diluted antiferromagnetic layer described by a classical
spin model show a strong dependence of the exchange bias on the degree of
dilution in agreement with recent experimental observations on Co/CoO bilayers.
These simulations reveal that diluting the antiferromagnet leads to the
formation of domains in the volume of the antiferromagnet carrying a remanent
surplus magnetization which causes and controls exchange bias. To further
support this domain state model for exchange bias we study in the present paper
the dependence of the bias field on the thickness of the antiferromagnetic
layer. It is shown that the bias field strongly increases with increasing film
thickness and eventually goes over a maximum before it levels out for large
thicknesses. These findings are in full agreement with experiments.
