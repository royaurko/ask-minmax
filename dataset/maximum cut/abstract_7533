The study of the charge asymmetry of produced particles allows to investigate
the interference of different production mechanisms and to determine new
features of the corresponding amplitudes. In the process $e^- e^+ \to e^- e^+
\pi^+ \pi^-$ the two-pion system is produced via two mechanisms: two-photon
(C-even state) and bremsstrahlung (C-odd state) production. We study the charge
asymmetry of pions in a differential in the pion momenta cross section
originating from an interference between these two mechanisms. At low effective
mass of dipions this asymmetry is directly related to the s- and p-phases of
elastic $\pi\pi$ scattering. At higher energies it can give new information
about the $f_0$ meson family, $f_2(1270)$ meson, etc. The asymmetry is
expressed via the pion form factor $F_\pi$ and helicity amplitudes $M_{ab}$ for
the subprocess $\gamma^*\gamma\to \pi^+\pi^-$ as $\sum G_{ab}{\rm
Re}(F_\pi^*M_{ab})$ where we have calculated analytically the coefficients
$G_{ab}$ for the region giving the main contribution to the effect. Several
distributions of pions are presented performing a numerical analysis in a model
with point-like pions. In the region near the dipion threshold the asymmetry is
of the order of 1%. We show that with suitable cuts the signal to background
ratio can be increased up to about 10%.
