We present spectra of high-redshift supernovae (SNe) that were taken with the
Subaru low resolution optical spectrograph, FOCAS. These SNe were found in SN
surveys with Suprime-Cam on Subaru, the CFH12k camera on the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), and the Advanced Camera for Surveys
(ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These SN surveys specifically
targeted z>1 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). From the spectra of 39 candidates, we
obtain redshifts for 32 candidates and spectroscopically identify 7 active
candidates as probable SNe Ia, including one at z=1.35, which is the most
distant SN Ia to be spectroscopically confirmed with a ground-based telescope.
An additional 4 candidates are identified as likely SNe Ia from the
spectrophotometric properties of their host galaxies. Seven candidates are not
SNe Ia, either being SNe of another type or active galactic nuclei. When SNe Ia
are observed within a week of maximum light, we find that we can
spectroscopically identify most of them up to z=1.1. Beyond this redshift, very
few candidates were spectroscopically identified as SNe Ia. The current
generation of super red-sensitive, fringe-free CCDs will push this redshift
limit higher.
