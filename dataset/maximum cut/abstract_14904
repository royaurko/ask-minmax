The contradiction between physical and economical sciences concerning the
growth of the production/consumption mechanism is analyzed. It is then shown
that if one wishes to keep the security level stable or to enhance it in a
growing economy the cost of security grows faster than the gross wealth. The
result is a typical evolution in which the net wealth increases up to a
maximum, then abruptly collapses. Besides this, any system of relations based
on a growing volume of exchanges is bound to go progressively out of control.
The voluntary blindness of the ruling classes toward these facts is leading our
societies to a disaster. This fate is not inescapable provided we learn to
dismantle the myth of perpetual growth.
