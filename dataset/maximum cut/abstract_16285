$Pb_{0.4}Bi_{1.6}Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}$ ($Bi(Pb)-$2212) single crystal samples
were studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), $ab-$plane
($\rho_{ab}$) and $c-$axis ($\rho_c$) resistivity, and high resolution
angle-resolved ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (ARUPS). TEM reveals that
the modulation in the $b-$axis for $Pb(0.4)-$doped $Bi(Pb)-$2212 is dominantly
of $Pb-$type that is not sensitive to the oxygen content of the system, and the
system clearly shows a structure of orthorhombic symmetry. Oxygen annealed
samples exhibit a much lower $c-$axis resistivity and a resistivity minimum at
$80-130$K. He-annealed samples exhibit a much higher $c-$axis resistivity and
$d\rho_c/dT<0$ behavior below 300K. The Fermi surface (FS) of oxygen annealed
$Bi(Pb)-$2212 mapped out by ARUPS has a pocket in the FS around the $\bar{M}$
point and exhibits orthorhombic symmetry. There are flat, parallel sections of
the FS, about 60\% of the maximum possible along $k_x = k_y$, and about 30\%
along $k_x = - k_y$. The wavevectors connecting the flat sections are about
$0.72(\pi, \pi)$ along $k_x = k_y$, and about $0.80(\pi, \pi)$ along $k_x = -
k_y$, rather than $(\pi,\pi)$. The symmetry of the near-Fermi-energy dispersing
states in the normal state changes between oxygen-annealed and He-annealed
samples.
