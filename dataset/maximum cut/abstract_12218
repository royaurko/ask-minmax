We present three systems for surface natural language generation that are
trainable from annotated corpora. The first two systems, called NLG1 and NLG2,
require a corpus marked only with domain-specific semantic attributes, while
the last system, called NLG3, requires a corpus marked with both semantic
attributes and syntactic dependency information. All systems attempt to produce
a grammatical natural language phrase from a domain-specific semantic
representation. NLG1 serves a baseline system and uses phrase frequencies to
generate a whole phrase in one step, while NLG2 and NLG3 use maximum entropy
probability models to individually generate each word in the phrase. The
systems NLG2 and NLG3 learn to determine both the word choice and the word
order of the phrase. We present experiments in which we generate phrases to
describe flights in the air travel domain.
