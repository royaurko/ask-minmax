In biomimetic and biological systems, interactions between surfaces are often
mediated by adhesive molecules, nanoparticles, or colloids dispersed in the
surrounding solution. We present here a general, statistical-mechanical model
for two surfaces that interact via adhesive particles. The effective,
particle-mediated interaction potential of the surfaces is obtained by
integrating over the particles' degrees of freedom in the partition function.
Interestingly, the effective adhesion energy of the surfaces exhibits a maximum
at intermediate particle concentrations, and is considerably smaller both at
low and high concentrations. The effective adhesion energy corresponds to a
minimum in the interaction potential at surface separations slightly larger
than the particle diameter, while a secondary minimum at surface contact
reflects depletion interactions. Our results can be generalized to surfaces
with specific receptors for solute particles, and have direct implications for
the adhesion of biomembranes and for phase transitions in colloidal systems.
