We present the results of a program that monitored the near-IR spectroscopic
variability of a sample of 19 embedded protostars. Spectra were taken on time
intervals from 2 days to 3 years, over a wavelength range from 0.85 {\mu}m to
2.45 {\mu}m, for 4-9 epochs of observations per target. We found that the
spectra of all targets are variable, and that every emission feature observed
is also variable (although not for all targets). With one exception, there were
no drastic changes in the continua of the spectra, nor did any line completely
disappear, nor did any line appear that was not previously apparent. This
analysis focuses on understanding the connection between accretion (traced by H
Br $\gamma$ and CO) and the wind (traced by He I, [FeII], and sometimes H$_2$).
For both accretion and wind tracers, the median variability was constant versus
time interval between observations, however the maximum variability that we
observed increased with time interval between observations. Extinction is
observed to vary within the minimum sampling time of 2 days, suggesting
extinguishing material within a few stellar radii at high disk latitudes. The
variability of [FeII] and H$_2$ were correlated for most (but not all) of the 7
YSOs showing both features, and the amplitude of the variability depends on the
veiling. Although the occurrence of CO and Br $\gamma$ emission are connected,
their variability is uncorrelated, suggesting that these emissions originate in
separate regions near the protostar (e.g., disk and wind).
