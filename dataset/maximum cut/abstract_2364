The appearance of numbers enumerating alternating sign matrices in stationary
states of certain stochastic processes is reviewed. New conjectures concerning
nest distribution functions are presented as well as a bijection between
certain classes of alternating sign matrices and lozenge tilings of hexagons
with cut off corners.
