This article reports on development of a multichannel arbitrary waveform
generator (MAWG), which simultaneously generates arbitrary voltage waveforms on
24 independent channels with a dynamic update rate of up to 25 Msps. A
real-time execution of a single waveform and/or sequence of multiple waveforms
in succession, with a user programmable arbitrary sequence order is provided
under the control of a stand-alone sequencer circuit implemented using an FPGA.
The device is operated using an internal clock and can be synced to other
devices by means of the TTL pulses. The device can be used for output voltages
in the range of up to +-9 V with a drift rate below +-10 uV/min and a maximum
deviation less than +-300 uVpp over a period of two hours.
