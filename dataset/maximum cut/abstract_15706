The recent detection of microlensing of stars of LMC by compact objects in
the halo of our galaxy suggests that our galaxy is surrounded by a non-luminous
halo made of compact objects with mass of about $(0.03-0.5) \msun$. The rate of
detection could be consistent with the assumption that these halo objects are
distributed with a softened isothermal profile with a core radius of $(2-8)$Kpc
and asymptotic circular velocity of $220\kms$. Taken in isolation, this
observation is consistent with a universe having only baryonic dark matter
(BDM, hereafter) contributing $\Omega_b=\Omega_{total}\simeq0.06$ which will,
however, violently contradict several other large scale observations, notably
the COBE-DMR results. Alternatively one can assume that galaxies like ours are
surrounded by both BDM and non-baryonic dark matter (NBDM, hereafter). A model
with a single component for NBDM with, say,
$\Omega_b\simeq0.06,\Omega_{cdm}\simeq0.94$, is also ruled out if we demand
that: (i) at least thirty percent of the dark matter density within $100$ kpc
is baryonic and (ii) galactic structures should have collapsed by redshift of
$z=1$. Further if half or more of the dark matter within $100 kpc$ is baryonic
then the maximum value of $\Omega_{dm}$, contributed by NBDM clustered at
galactic scales, can only be about $\Omega_{max}\simeq0.29$. Models with C+HDM
cannot satisfy this constraint but $\Lambda$+ CDM models are still
