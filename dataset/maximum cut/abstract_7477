Transforming Penrose's intuitive picture of a strong cosmic censorship
principle, that generically forbids the appearance of locally naked space-time
singularities, into a formal mathematical proof, remains at present, one of the
most outstanding unsolved mathematical problems from the theory of
gravitational collapse. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that we do not
possess yet a clear-cut understanding of the hypothesis needed for the
establishment of some sort of strong cosmic censorship theorem. What we have is
a selected list of solutions, which at first sight seem to go against cosmic
censorship, but at the end they fail in some way. However, the space of
solutions of Einstein's field equations is vast. In this article, we plan to
increase one's intuition by establishing a link between certain inequalities
for Cauchy-horizon stability and a set of generic conditions, such as a
reasonable equation of state--which determines whether the space-time is
asymptotically flat or not, an energy condition, and an hypothesis over the
class of metrics on which Einstein's field equations ought to be solved to
ensure strong cosmic censorship inside black-holes. With these tools in hand we
examine the Cauchy-horizon stability of the theory created by Born and
Infeld--whose action principle has been used as a prototype in superstring
theory, and the singularity-free Bardeen's black-hole model.
