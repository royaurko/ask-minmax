The investigation of solar cells degradation and the prediction of its
end-of-life performance is of primary importance in the preparation of a space
mission. In the present work, we investigate the reduction of solar-cells'
maximum power resulting from irradiations with electrons and protons. Both GaAs
single junction and GaInP/GaAs/Ge triple junction solar cells were studied. The
results obtained indicate how i) the dominant radiation damaging mechanism is
due to atomic displacements, ii) the relative maximum power degradation is
almost independent of the type of incoming particle, i.e., iii) to a first
approximation, the fitted semi-empirical function expressing the decrease of
maximum power depends only on the absorbed NIEL dose, and iv) the actual
displacement threshold energy value (Ed=21 eV) accounts for annealing
treatments, mostly due to self-annealing induced effects. Thus, for a given
type of solar cell, a unique maximum power degradation curve can be determined
as a function of the absorbed NIEL dose. The latter expression allows one to
predict the performance of those solar cells in space radiation environment.
