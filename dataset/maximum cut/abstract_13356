We study random k-lifts of large, but otherwise arbitrary graphs G. We prove
that, with high probability, all eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the
lift that are not eigenvalues of G are of the order (D ln (kn))^{1/2}, where D
is the maximum degree of G. Similarly, and also with high probability, the
"new" eigenvalues of the Laplacian of the lift are all in an interval of length
(ln (nk)/d)^{1/2} around 1, where d is the minimum degree of G. We also prove
that, from the point of view of Spectral Graph Theory, there is very little
difference between a random k_1k_2 ... k_r-lift of a graph and a random
k_1-lift of a random k_2-lift of ... of a random k_r-lift of the same graph.
The main proof tool is a concentration inequality for sums of random matrices
that was recently introduced by the contributor.
