We extend the analysis of Gabor transforms on a Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) temperature map (Hansen, Gorski and Hivon 2002) to polarisation. We study
the temperature and polarisation power spectra on the cut sky, the so-called
pseudo power spectra. The transformation kernels relating the full-sky
polarisation power spectra and the polarisation pseudo power spectra are found
to be similar to the kernel for the temperature power spectrum. This fact is
used to construct a fast power spectrum estimation algorithm using the pseudo
power spectrum of temperature and polarisation as data vectors in a maximum
likelihood approach. Using the pseudo power spectra as input to the likelihood
analysis solves the problem of having to invert huge matrices which makes the
standard likelihood approach infeasible.
