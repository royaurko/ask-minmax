Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) interacting with the atmosphere
generate extensive air showers (EAS) of secondary particles. The depth
corresponding to the maximum development of the shower, $\Xmax$, is a
well-known observable for determining the nature of the primary cosmic ray
which initiated the cascade process. In this paper, we present an empirical
model to describe the distribution of $\Xmax$ for EAS initiated by nuclei, in
the energy range from $10^{17}$ eV up to $10^{21}$ eV, and by photons, in the
energy range from $10^{17}$ eV up to $10^{19.6}$ eV. Our model adopts the
generalized Gumbel distribution motivated by the relationship between the
generalized Gumbel statistics and the distribution of the sum of
non-identically distributed variables in dissipative stochastic systems. We
provide an analytical expression for describing the $\Xmax$ distribution for
photons and for nuclei, and for their first two statistical moments, namely
$\langle \Xmax\rangle$ and $\sigma^{2}(\Xmax)$. The impact of the hadronic
interaction model is investigated in detail, even in the case of the most
up-to-date models accounting for LHC observations. We also briefly discuss the
differences with a more classical approach and an application to the
experimental data based on information theory.
