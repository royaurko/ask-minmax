We study the probability distribution function of the ground-state energies
of the disordered one-dimensional Ising spin chain with power-law interactions
using a combination of parallel tempering Monte Carlo and branch, cut, and
price algorithms. By tuning the exponent of the power-law interactions we are
able to scan several universality classes. Our results suggest that mean-field
models have a non-Gaussian limiting distribution of the ground-state energies,
whereas non-mean-field models have a Gaussian limiting distribution. We compare
the results of the disordered one-dimensional Ising chain to results for a
disordered two-leg ladder, for which large system sizes can be studied, and
find a qualitative agreement between the disordered one-dimensional Ising chain
in the short-range universality class and the disordered two-leg ladder. We
show that the mean and the standard deviation of the ground-state energy
distributions scale with a power of the system size. In the mean-field
universality class the skewness does not follow a power-law behavior and
converges to a nonzero constant value. The data for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
model seem to be acceptably well fitted by a modified Gumbel distribution.
Finally, we discuss the distribution of the internal energy of the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model at finite temperatures and show that it behaves
similar to the ground-state energy of the system if the temperature is smaller
than the critical temperature.
