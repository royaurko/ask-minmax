The first order stable spline (SS-1) kernel is used extensively in
regularized system identification. In particular, the stable spline estimator
models the impulse response as a zero-mean Gaussian process whose covariance is
given by the SS-1 kernel. In this paper, we discuss the maximum entropy
properties of this prior. In particular, we formulate the exact maximum entropy
problem solved by the SS-1 kernel without Gaussian and uniform sampling
assumptions. Under general sampling schemes, we also explicitly derive the
special structure underlying the SS-1 kernel (e.g. characterizing the
tridiagonal nature of its inverse), also giving to it a maximum entropy
covariance completion interpretation. Along the way similar maximum entropy
properties of the Wiener kernel are also given.
