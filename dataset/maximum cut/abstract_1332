We discuss dispersion representations for the triangle diagram
$F(p_1^2,p_2^2,q^2)$, the single dispersion representation in $q^2$ and the
double dispersion representation in $p_1^2$ and $p_2^2$, with special emphasis
on the appearance of the anomalous singularities and the anomalous cuts in
these representations. For the double dispersion representation in $p_1^2$ and
$p_2^2$, the appearance of the anomalous cut in the region $q^2>0$ is
demonstrated, and a new derivation of the anomalous double spectral density is
given. We point out that the double spectral representation is particularly
suitable for applications in the region of $p_1^2$ and/or $p_2^2$ above the
two-particle thresholds. The dispersion representations for the triangle
diagram in the nonrelativistic limit are studied and compared with the triangle
diagram of the nonrelativistic field theory.
