We present a high-resolution (3.6'', 70pc) CO(1-0) mosaic of the molecular
gas in M 82 covering an area of 2.5' x 3.5' (2.8kpc x 3.9kpc) obtained with the
OVRO millimeter interferometer. The observations reveal the presence of huge
amounts of molecular gas (> 70% of the total molecular mass, M_tot=1.3 x 10^9
M_sun) outside the central 1 kpc disk. Molecular streamers are detected in and
below M82's disk out to distances from the center of 1.7 kpc. Some of these
streamers are well correlated with optical absorption features; they form the
basis of some of the prominent tidal HI features around M 82. This provides
evidence that the molecular gas within M 82's optical disk is disrupted by the
interaction with M 81. Molecular gas is found in M 82's outflow/halo, reaching
distances up to 1.2 kpc below the plane; CO line-splitting has been detected
for the first time in the outflow. The maximum outflow velocity is 230 km/s; we
derive an opening angle of 55 deg for the molecular outflow cone. The total
amount of gas in the outflow is >3 x 10^8 M_sun and its kinetic energy is of
order 10^55 erg, about one percent of the estimated total mechanical energy
input of M 82's starburst. Our study implies that extreme starburst
environments can move significant amounts of molecular gas in to a galaxy's
halo (and even to the intergalactic medium).
