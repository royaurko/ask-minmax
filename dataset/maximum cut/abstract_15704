The information content of the autocorrelation function (ACF) of intensity
fluctuations of the X-ray background (XRB) is analyzed. The tight upper limits
set by ROSAT deep survey data on the ACF at arcmin scales imply strong
constraints on clustering properties of X-ray sources at cosmological distances
and on their contribution to the soft XRB. If quasars have a clustering radius
r_0=12-20 Mpc (H_0=50), and their two point correlation function, is constant
in comoving coordinates as indicated by optical data, they cannot make up more
40-50% of the soft XRB (the maximum contribution may reach 80% in the case of
stable clustering, epsilon=0). Active Star-forming (ASF) galaxies clustered
like normal galaxies, with r_0=10-12 Mpc can yield up to 20% or up to 40% of
the soft XRB for epsilon=-1.2 or epsilon=0, respectively. The ACF on degree
scales essentially reflects the clustering properties of local sources and is
proportional to their volume emissivity. The upper limits on scales of a few
degrees imply that hard X-ray selected AGNs have r_0<25 Mpc if epsilon=0 or
r_0<20 Mpc if epsilon=-1.2. No significant constraints are set on clustering of
ASF galaxies, due to their low local volume emissivity. The possible signal on
scales >6 deg, if real, may be due to AGNs with r_0=20 Mpc; the contribution
from clusters of galaxies with r_0~50 Mpc is a factor 2 lower.
