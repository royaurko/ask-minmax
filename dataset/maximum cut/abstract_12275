We consider Gowdy spacetimes under the assumption that the spatial
hypersurfaces are diffeomorphic to the torus. The relevant equations are then
wave map equations with the hyperbolic space as a target. In an article by
Grubisic and Moncrief, a formal expansion of solutions in the direction toward
the singularity was proposed. Later, Kichenassamy and Rendall constructed a
family of real analytic solutions with the maximum number of free functions and
the desired asymptotics at the singularity. The condition of real analyticity
was subsequently removed by Rendall. In an article by the contributor, it was shown
that one can put a condition on initial data that leads to asymptotic
expansions. In this article, we show the following. By fixing a point in
hyperbolic space, we can consider the hyperbolic distance from this point to
the solution at a given spacetime point. If we fix a spatial point for the
solution, it is enough to put conditions on the rate at which the hyperbolic
distance tends to infinity as time tends to the singularity in order to
conclude that there are smooth expansions in a neighbourhood of the given
spatial point.
