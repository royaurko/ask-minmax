We present results of our simulations of QCD with two light dynamical quarks
on a 32^3 X 8 lattice at a current quark mass tuned to have the Goldstone pion
mass of about 230 MeV. Employing the Taylor expansion method we proposed
earlier, we estimate the radius of convergence of the series for the baryonic
susceptibility by using terms up to eighth order. Together with our earlier
results, corresponding to the same physical parameters but on coarser lattices
at respectively 1.33 times and twice the lattice cut-off (a), we were able to
attempt a march towards the continuum limit.
