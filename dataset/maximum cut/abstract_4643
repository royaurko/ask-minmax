We examine the soft-gluon resummation effects, including the exact spin
correlations among the final state particles, in the search of the Standard
Model Higgs boson, via the process $gg\to H\to WW/ZZ \to 4 leptons, at the
Tevatron and the LHC. A comparison between the resummation and the
Next-to-Leading order (NLO) calculation is performed after imposing various
kinematics cuts suggested in the literature for the Higgs boson search. For the
$H\to ZZ$ mode, the resummation effects increase the acceptance of the signal
events by about 25%, as compared to the NLO prediction, and dramatically alter
various kinematics distributions of the final state leptons. For the $H\to WW$
mode, the acceptance rates of the signal events predicted by the resummation
and NLO calculations are almost the same, but some of the predicted kinematical
distributions are quite different. Thus, to precisely determine the properties
of the Higgs boson at hadron colliders, the soft-gluon resummation effects have
to be taken into account.
