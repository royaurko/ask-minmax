In this work, early-time photometry of supernova (SN) 2014J is presented,
extending the AAVSO CCD database to prediscovery dates. The applicability of
NASA's small robotic MicroObservatory Network telescopes for photometric
measurements is evaluated. Prediscovery and postdiscovery photometry of SN
2014J is measured from images taken by two different telescopes of the network,
and is compared to measurements from the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope
and the Itagaki Observatory. In the early light-curve phase (which exhibits
stable spectral behavior with constant color indices), these data agree with
reasonably high accuracy (better than 0.05 mag around maximum brightness, and
0.15 mag at earlier times). Owing to the changing spectral energy distribution
of the SN and the different spectral characteristics of the systems used,
differences increase after maximum light. We augment light curves of SN 2014J
downloaded from the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO)
online database with these data, and consider the complete brightness evolution
of this important Type Ia SN. Furthermore, the first detection presented here
(Jan. 15.427, 2014) appears to be one of the earliest observations of SN 2014J
yet published, taken less than a day after the SN exploded.
