We investigate effects of consistent (conserving the number of degrees of
freedom) and inconsistent pion-nucleon-isobar couplings on the isobar
propagator in vacuum and in nuclear medium. Using the consistent coupling in
conjunction with a convenient basis leads to significant simplification of the
isobar vacuum and in-medium self energy and dressed propagator compared to the
case of inconsistent interaction. The higher-derivative nature of the
consistent interaction requires a suitable compensation by an additional
form-factor term or adjustment in the used cut-off values. This modification is
straightforward to perform and assures that the physical observables connected
to the spin-3/2 sector in vacuum and nuclear medium acquire values
indistinguishable from the ones obtained by using an inconsistent coupling.
