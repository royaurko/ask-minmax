We study a sample of 16 microlensed Galactic bulge main sequence turnoff
region stars for which high dispersion spectra have been obtained with detailed
abundance analyses. We demonstrate that there is a very strong and highly
statistically significant correlation between the maximum magnification of the
microlensed bulge star and the value of the [Fe/H] deduced from the high
resolution spectrum of each object. Physics demands that this correlation,
assuming it to be real, be the result of some sample bias. We suggest several
possible explanations, but are forced to reject them all,and are left puzzled.
To obtain a reliable metallicity distribution in the Galactic bulge based on
microlensed dwarf stars it will be necessary to resolve this issue through the
course of additional observations.
