We present the leading experimental constraints on supersymmetric models with
R-parity violation (RPV) and a long-lived lightest superpartner (LSP). We
consider both the well-motivated dynamical RPV scenario as well as the
conventional holomorphic RPV operators. Guided by naturalness, we study the
cases of stop, gluino, and higgsino LSPs with several possible leading decay
channels in each case. The CMS displaced dijet and the ATLAS multitrack
displaced vertex searches have been fully recast, with all cuts and vertex
reconstruction algorithms applied. Heavy charged stable particle searches by
CMS are also applied. In addition, we consider representative bounds for prompt
LSP decays that are directly applicable. Our main results are exclusion plots
in the $m_{\rm LSP}-\tau_{\rm LSP}$ plane for the various scenarios. We find
that the natural parameter space ($m_{\tilde{t}} <800$ GeV,
$m_{\tilde{g}}<1500$ GeV, $m_{\tilde{H}}<800$ GeV) is excluded for a long-lived
LSP ($\tau_{\rm LSP} \gtrsim 1$ mm).
