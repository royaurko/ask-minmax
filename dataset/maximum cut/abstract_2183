We study the high energy behaviour of elastic scattering amplitudes within
the leading logarithm approximation. In particular, we cast the amplitude in a
form which allows us to study the internal dynamics of the BFKL Pomeron for
general momentum transfer. We demonstrate that the momentum transfer acts as an
effective infrared cut-off which ensures that the dominant contribution arises
from short distance physics.
