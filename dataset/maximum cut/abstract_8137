We study graphons as a non-parametric generalization of stochastic block
models, and show how to obtain compactly represented estimators for sparse
networks in this framework. Our algorithms and analysis go beyond previous work
in several ways. First, we relax the usual boundedness assumption for the
generating graphon and instead treat arbitrary integrable graphons, so that we
can handle networks with long tails in their degree distributions. Second,
again motivated by real-world applications, we relax the usual assumption that
the graphon is defined on the unit interval, to allow latent position graphs
where the latent positions live in a more general space, and we characterize
identifiability for these graphons and their underlying position spaces.
  We analyze three algorithms. The first is a least squares algorithm, which
gives an approximation we prove to be consistent for all square-integrable
graphons, with errors expressed in terms of the best possible stochastic block
model approximation to the generating graphon. Next, we analyze a
generalization based on the cut norm, which works for any integrable graphon
(not necessarily square-integrable). Finally, we show that clustering based on
degrees works whenever the underlying degree distribution is absolutely
continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. Unlike the previous two
algorithms, this third one runs in polynomial time.
