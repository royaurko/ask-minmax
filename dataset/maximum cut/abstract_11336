We present a model which relates the width of the Broad Emission Lines of AGN
to the Keplerian velocity of an accretion disk at a critical distance from the
central black hole. This critical distance falls in a region bounded on the
inward side by the transition radius between the radiation pressure and the gas
pressure dominated region of the accretion disk and on the outward side by the
maximum radius below which a stabilizing, radially accreting and vertically
outflowing corona exists. We show that in the framework of this picture the
observed range of H$\beta$ FWHM from Broad Line to Narrow Line type 1 AGN is
well reproduced as a function of the accretion rate. This interval of
velocities is the only permitted range and goes from $\sim 20,000$ km s$^{-1}$
for sub-Eddington accretion rates, to $\sim 1,000$ km s$^{-1}$ for Eddington
accretion rates.
