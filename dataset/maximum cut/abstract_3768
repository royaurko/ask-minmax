In the previous paper (Part1), we have verified that the SK assumption on the
direction does not hold in the analysis of neutrino events occurred inside the
SK detector, which is the cornerstone for their analysis of zenith angle
distributions of neutrino events. Based on the correlation between L_nu and
L_mu (Figures~16 to 18 in Part1) and the correlation between E_nu and E_mu
(Figure19 in Part1), we have made four possible L/E analyses, namely L_nu/E_nu,
L_nu/E_mu, L_mu/E_mu and L_mu/E_nu. Among four kinds of L/E analyses, we have
shown that only L_nu/E_nu analysis can give the signature of maximum
oscillations clearly, not only the first maximum oscillation but also the
second and third maximum oscillation and etc., as they should be, while the
L_mu/E_mu analysis which are really done by Super-Kamiokande Collaboration
cannot give any maximum oscillation at all. It is thus concluded from those
results that the experiments with the use of the cosmic-ray beam for neutrino
oscillation, such as Super-Kamiokande type experiment, are unable to lead the
maximum oscillation from their L/E analysis, because the incident neutrino
cannot be observed due to its neutrality. Therefore, we would suggest
Super-Kamiokande Collaboration to re-analyze the zenith angle distribution of
the neutrino events which occur inside the detector carefully, since L_nu and
L_mu are alternative expressions of the cosine of the zenith angle for the
incident neutrino and that for the emitted muon, respectively.
