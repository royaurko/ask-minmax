We present TT2NE, a new algorithm to predict RNA secondary structures with
pseudoknots. The method is based on a classification of RNA structures
according to their topological genus. TT2NE guarantees to find the minimum free
energy structure irrespectively of pseudoknot topology. This unique proficiency
is obtained at the expense of the maximum length of sequence that can be
treated but comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms shows that TT2NE is a
very powerful tool within its limits. Analysis of TT2NE's wrong predictions
sheds light on the need to study how sterical constraints limit the range of
pseudoknotted structures that can be formed from a given sequence. An
implementation of TT2NE on a public server can be found at
