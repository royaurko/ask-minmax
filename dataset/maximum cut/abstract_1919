We use Floquet theory to study the maximum value of the stroboscopic group
velocity in a one-dimensional tight-binding model subjected to an on-site
staggered potential varying sinusoidally in time. The results obtained by
numerically diagonalizing the Floquet operator are analyzed using a variety of
analytical schemes. In the low frequency limit we use adiabatic theory, while
in the high frequency limit the Magnus expansion of the Floquet Hamiltonian
turns out to be appropriate. When the magnitude of the staggered potential is
much greater or much less than the hopping, we use degenerate Floquet
perturbation theory; we find that dynamical localization occurs in the former
case when the maximum group velocity vanishes. Finally, starting from an
"engineered" initial state where the particles (taken to be hard core bosons)
are localized in one part of the chain, we demonstrate that the existence of a
maximum stroboscopic group velocity manifests in a light cone like spreading of
the particles in real space.
