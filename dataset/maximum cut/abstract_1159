We get four quartered Aztec diamonds by dividing an Aztec diamond region by
two zigzag cuts passing its center. W. Jockusch and J. Propp (in an unpublished
work) found that the number of tilings of quartered Aztec diamonds is given by
simple product formulas. In this paper we present a simple proof for this
result.
