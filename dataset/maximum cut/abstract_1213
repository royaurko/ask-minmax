We discuss the gravitational lensing of gravitational waves from merging
neutron star binaries, in the context of advanced LIGO type gravitational wave
detectors. We consider properties of the expected observational data with cut
on the signal-to-noise ratio $\rho$, i.e., $\rho>\rho_0$. An advanced LIGO
should see unlensed inspiral events with a redshift distribution with cut-off
at a redshift $z_{\rm max} < 1$ for $h \leq 0.8$. Any inspiral events detected
at $z>z_{\rm max}$ should be lensed. We compute the expected total number of
events which are present due to gravitational lensing and their redshift
distribution for an advanced LIGO in a flat Universe. If the matter fraction in
compact lenses is close to 10\%, an advanced LIGO should see a few strongly
lensed events per year with $\rho >5$.
