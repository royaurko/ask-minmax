The density dependent hadron field (DDRH) theory, previously applied to
isospin nuclei and hypernuclei is used to describe $\beta$-stable matter and
neutron stars under consideration of the complete baryon octet. The
meson-hyperon vertices are derived from Dirac-Brueckner calculations of nuclear
matter and extended to hyperons. We examine properties of density dependent
interactions derived from the Bonn A and from the Groningen NN potential as
well as phenomenological interactions. The consistent treatment of the density
dependence introduces rearrangement terms in the expression for the baryon
chemical potential. This leads to a more complex condition for the
$\beta$-equilibrium compared to standard relativistic mean field (RMF)
approaches. We find a strong dependence of the equation of state and the
particle distribution on the choice of the vertex density dependence. Results
for neutron star masses and radii are presented. We find a good agreement with
other models for the maximum mass. Radii are smaller compared to RMF models and
indicate a closer agreement with results of non-relativistic Brueckner
calculations.
