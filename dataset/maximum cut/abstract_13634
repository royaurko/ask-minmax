We estimate the local density field in redshift shells to a maximum redshift
of z=0.3, using photometric redshifts for the 2MASS galaxy catalogue, matched
to optical data from the SuperCOSMOS galaxy catalogue. This density-field map
is used to predict the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) CMB anisotropies that
originate within the volume at z<0.3. We investigate the impact of this
estimated ISW foreground signal on large-scale anomalies in the WMAP CMB data.
We find that removal of the foreground ISW signal from WMAP data reduces the
significance of a number of reported large-scale anomalies in the CMB,
including the low quadrupole power and the apparent alignment between the CMB
quadrupole and octopole.
