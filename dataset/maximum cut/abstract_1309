In this talk we give a short review of forward jets and forward $W$-boson
production at hadron colliders, in view of the extraction of footprints of BFKL
physics. We argue that at Tevatron energies, dijet production at large rapidity
intervals is still subasymptotic with respect to the BFKL regime, thus the
cross section is strongly dependent on the various cuts applied in the
experimental setup. In addition, the choice of equal transverse momentum cuts
on the tagging jets makes the cross section dependent on large logarithms of
non-BFKL origin, and thus may spoil the BFKL analysis. For vector boson
production in association with two jets, we argue that the configurations that
are kinematically favoured tend to have the vector boson forward in rapidity.
Thus $W + 2$ jet production lends itself naturally to extensions to the
high-energy limit.
