We will use the factors obtained by correspondence analysis to find
biclustering of a contingency table such that the row-column cluster pairs are
regular, i.e., they have small discrepancy. In our main theorem, the constant
of the so-called volume-regularity is related to the SVD of the normalized
contingency table. Our result is applicable to two-way cuts when both the rows
and columns are divided into the same number of clusters, thus extending partly
the result of Butler estimating the discrepancy of a contingency table by the
second largest singular value of the normalized table (one-cluster, rectangular
case), and partly a former result of the contributor for estimating the constant of
volume-regularity by the structural eigenvalues and the distances of the
corresponding eigen-subspaces of the normalized modularity matrix of an
edge-weighted graph (several clusters, symmetric case).
