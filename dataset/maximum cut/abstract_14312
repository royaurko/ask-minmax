We performed first-principle calculations based on the supercell and cluster
approaches to investigate the neutral Al impurity in smoky quartz. Electron
paramagnetic resonance measurements suggest that the oxygens around the Al
center undergo a polaronic distortion which localizes the hole being on one of
the four oxygen atoms. We find that the screened exchange hybrid functional
successfully describes this localization and improves on standard local density
approaches or on hybrid functionals that do not include enough exact exchange
such as B3LYP. We find a defect level at about 2.5 eV above the valence band
maximum, corresponding to a localized hole in a O 2p orbital. The calculated
values of the g tensor and the hyperfine splittings are in excellent agreement
with experiment.
