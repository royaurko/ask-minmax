Using recent mathematical advances, a geometric approach to rare noise-driven
transition events in nonequilibrium systems is given, and an algorithm for
computing the maximum likelihood transition curve is generalized to the case of
state-dependent noise. It is applied to a model of electronic transport in
semiconductor superlattices to investigate transitions between metastable
electric field distributions. When the applied voltage $V$ is varied near a
saddle-node bifurcation at $V_th$, the mean life time $<T>$ of the initial
metastable state is shown to scale like $log<T> \propto |V_th - V|^{3/2}$ as
$V\to V_th$.
