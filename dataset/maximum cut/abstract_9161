If we compose a smooth function g with fractional Brownian motion B with
Hurst index H > 1/2, then the resulting change of variables formula [or It/^o-
formula] has the same form as if fractional Brownian motion would be a
continuous function with bounded variation. In this note we prove a new
integral representation formula for the running maximum of a continuous
function with bounded variation. Moreover we show that the analogue to
fractional Brownian motion fails.
