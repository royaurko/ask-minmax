Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of N,N'-dioctadecyl thiacyanine perchlorate (NK)
and octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (RhB18) and their mixtures in the presence
and absence of clay mineral layers were investigated by recording surface
pressure - area isotherms and by UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. The
isotherms of NK, RhB18 and their mixtures are characteristic for liquid
expanded state behaviour with repulsive interactions between the two cationic
dyes. In the presence of laponite the isotherms show liquid expanded and
condensed state behaviour. In laponite dispersions and in monolayers, NK has a
strong tendency to aggregate with formation of H- and J- aggregates. The
absorption and fluorescence maxima of the monomers in the films are at 435 nm
and at 480 nm; H-dimer have an absorption maximum around 410 nm and do not
fluoresce. J-dimers are present in all the films with absorption maximum at 461
nm and fluorescence at 463 nm. RhB18 is mainly present as monomers in the LB
films with an absorption maximum at 576 nm and fluorescence at 595 nm.
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer from NK to RhB18 has been observed in
clay dispersions and in films with and without laponite. The optimum condition
for NK RhB18 fluorescence energy transfer in the films is 90 mol% NK + 10 mol%
RhB18.
