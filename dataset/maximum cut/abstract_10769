Mapping our universe in 3D by imaging the redshifted 21 cm line from neutral
hydrogen has the potential to overtake the cosmic microwave background as our
most powerful cosmological probe, because it can map a much larger volume of
our Universe, shedding new light on the epoch of reionization, inflation, dark
matter, dark energy, and neutrino masses. We report on MITEoR, a pathfinder
low-frequency radio interferometer whose goal is to test technologies that
greatly reduce the cost of such 3D mapping for a given sensitivity. MITEoR
accomplishes this by using massive baseline redundancy both to enable automated
precision calibration and to cut the correlator cost scaling from N^2 to NlogN,
where N is the number of antennas. The success of MITEoR with its 64
dual-polarization elements bodes well for the more ambitious HERA project,
which would incorporate many identical or similar technologies using an order
of magnitude more antennas, each with dramatically larger collecting area.
