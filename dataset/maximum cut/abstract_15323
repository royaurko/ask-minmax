Suppose X and Y are two independent irreducible Markov chains on n states. We
consider the intersection time, which is the first time their trajectories
intersect. We show for reversible and lazy chains that the total variation
mixing time is always upper bounded by the expected intersection time taken
over the worst starting states. For random walks on trees we show the two
quantities are equivalent. We obtain an expression for the expected
intersection time in terms of the eigenvalues for reversible and transitive
chains. For such chains we also show that it is up to constants the geometric
mean of n and E[I], where I is the number of intersections up to the uniform
mixing time. Finally for random walks on regular graphs we obtain sharp
inequalities that relate the expected intersection time to maximum hitting time
and mixing time.
