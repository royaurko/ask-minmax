Recently Polchinski and Strassler reproduced the high energy QCD scaling at
fixed angles from a gauge string duality inspired in AdS/CFT correspondence. In
their approach a confining gauge theory is taken as approximately dual to an
AdS space with an IR cut off. Considering such an approximation (AdS slice) we
found a one to one holographic mapping between bulk and boundary scalar fields.
Associating the bulk fields with dilatons and the boundary fields with
glueballs of the confining gauge theory we also found the same high energy QCD
scaling. Here, using this holographic mapping we give a simple estimate for the
mass ratios of the glueballs assuming the AdS slice approximation to be valid
at low energies. We also compare these results to those coming from
supergravity and lattice QCD.
