SIMBOL-X is a high energy "mini" satellite class mission that is proposed by
a European collaboration for a launch in 2009. SIMBOL-X is making use of a
classical X-ray mirror, of ~600 cm2 maximum effective area, with a 30 m focal
length in order to cover energies up to several tens of keV. This focal length
will be achieved through the use of two spacecrafts in a formation flying
configuration. This will give to SIMBOL-X unprecedented spatial resolution (20
arcsec HEW) and sensitivity in the hard X-ray range. By its coverage, from 0.5
to 70 keV, and sensitivity, SIMBOL-X will be an excellent instrument for the
study of high energy processes in a large number of sources, both compact and
extended.
