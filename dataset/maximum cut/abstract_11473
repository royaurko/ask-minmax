GK Per is a unique cataclysmic variable star which has showed a nova
explosion as well as dwarf nova-type outbursts, and has the intermediate-polar
nature. We carried out V-band time-resolved photometry and B-band monitoring
during the 1996 outburst. This outburst lasted about 60 d and is divided into
three parts: the slow rise branch for 35 d, the gradual decay branch with a
decay rate of 20.0 d/mag for ~16 d, and the rapid decline branch with a rate of
5.6 d/mag for ~10 d. The $B-V$ color became bluest (B-V~0.18) about 10 d before
the outburst maximum, which supports an idea that the outburst in GK Per is of
the inside-out type. The spin pulse, 440-s quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs),
and ~5,000-s QPOs were detected in our light curve, as previously seen in X-ray
and optical observations. In addition, we report the discovery of ~300-s
periodicity, which is shorter than the spin period.
