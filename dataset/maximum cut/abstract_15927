We examine the claim by Oppenheimer et al. (2001) that the local halo density
of white dwarfs is an order of magnitude higher than previously thought. As it
stands, the observational data support the presence of a kinematically distinct
population of halo white dwarfs at the >99% confidence level. A
maximum-likelihood analysis gives a radial velocity dispersion of
sigma^h_U=150(+80/-40) km/s and an asymmetric drift of v_a^h=176(+102/-80)
km/s, for a Schwarzschild velocity distribution function with
sigma_U:sigma_V:sigma_W=1:2/3:1/2. Halo white dwarfs have a local number
density of 1.1(+2.1/-0.7)x10^-4 pc-3, which amounts to 0.8(+1.6/-0.5) per cent
of the nominal local dark-matter halo density and is 5.0(+9.5/-3.2) times
higher and thus only marginally in agreement with previous estimates (all
errors indicate the 90% C.L.). We discuss several direct consequences of this
white-dwarf population (e.g. microlensing) and postulate a potential mechanism
to eject young white dwarfs from the disc to the halo, through the orbital
instabilities in triple or multiple stellar systems.
