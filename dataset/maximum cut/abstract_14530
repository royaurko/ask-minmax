We first prove two new spectral properties for symmetric nonnegative tensors.
We prove a maximum property for the largest H-eigenvalue of a symmetric
nonnegative tensor, and establish some bounds for this eigenvalue via row sums
of that tensor. We show that if an eigenvalue of a symmetric nonnegative tensor
has a positive H-eigenvector, then this eigenvalue is the largest H-eigenvalue
of that tensor. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for this. We
then introduce copositive tensors. This concept extends the concept of
copositive matrices. Symmetric nonnegative tensors and positive semi-definite
tensors are examples of copositive tensors. The diagonal elements of a
copositive tensor must be nonnegative. We show that if each sum of a diagonal
element and all the negative off-diagonal elements in the same row of a real
symmetric tensor is nonnegative, then that tensor is a copositive tensor. Some
further properties of copositive tensors are discussed.
