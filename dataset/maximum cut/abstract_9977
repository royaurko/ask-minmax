We investigate the contribution of star formation to the growth of stellar
mass in galaxies over the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.1 by studying the redshift
evolution of the specific star formation rate (SSFR), defined as the star
formation rate per unit stellar mass. We use an I-band selected sample of 6180
field galaxies from the Munich Near-Infrared Cluster Survey (MUNICS) with
spectroscopically calibrated photometric redshifts. The SSFR decreases with
stellar mass at all redshifts. The low SSFRs of massive galaxies indicates that
star formation does not significantly change their stellar mass over this
redshift range: The majority of massive galaxies have assembled the bulk of
their mass before redshift unity. Furthermore, these highest mass galaxies
contain the oldest stellar populations at all redshifts. The line of maximum
SSFR runs parallel to lines of constant star formation rate. With increasing
redshift, the maximum SFR is generally increasing for all stellar masses, from
SFR ~ 5 M_sun/yr at z = 0.5 to SFR ~ 10 M_sun/yr at z = 1.1. We also show that
the large SSFRs of low-mass galaxies cannot be sustained over extended periods
of time. Finally, our results do not require a substantial contribution of
merging to the growth of stellar mass in massive galaxies over the redshift
range probed. We note that highly obscured galaxies which remain undetected in
our sample do not affect these findings for the bulk of the field galaxy
population.
