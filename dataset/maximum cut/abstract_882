The paper is a contribution both to the theoretical foundations and to the
actual construction of efficient automatizable proof procedures for
non-classical logics. We focus here on the case of finite-valued logics, and
exhibit: (i) a mechanism for producing a classic-like description of them in
terms of an effective variety of bivalent semantics; (ii) a mechanism for
extracting, from the bivalent semantics so obtained, uniform
(classically-labeled) cut-free standard analytic tableaux with possibly
branching invertible rules and paired with proof strategies designed to
guarantee termination of the associated proof procedure; (iii) a mechanism to
also provide, for the same logics, uniform cut-based tableau systems with
linear rules. The latter tableau systems are shown to be adequate even when
restricted to analytic cuts, and they are also shown to polynomially simulate
truth-tables, a feature that is not enjoyed by the former standard type of
tableau systems (not even in the 2-valued case). The results are based on
useful generalizations of the notions of analyticity and compositionality, and
illustrate a theory that applies to many other classes of non-classical logics.
