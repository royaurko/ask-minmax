Studies of the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) and other deep surveys have revealed
an apparent peak in the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity density, and therefore the
star-formation rate density, of the Universe at redshifts 1<z<2. We use
photometric redshifts of galaxies in the HDF to determine the comoving UV
luminosity density and find that, when errors (in particular, sampling error)
are properly accounted for, a flat distribution is statistically
indistinguishable from a distribution peaked at z~1.5. Furthermore, we examine
the effects of cosmological surface brightness (SB) dimming on these
measurements by applying a uniform SB cut to all galaxy fluxes after correcting
them to redshift z=5. We find that, comparing all galaxies at the same
intrinsic surface brightness sensitivity, the UV luminosity density contributed
by high intrinsic SB regions increases by almost two orders of magnitude from
z~0 to z~5. This suggests that there exists a population of objects with very
high star formation rates at high redshifts that apparently do not exist at low
redshifts. The peak of star formation, then, likely occurs somewhere beyond
z>2.
