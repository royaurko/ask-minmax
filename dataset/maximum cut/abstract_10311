The joint use of high-resolution data from PROBA2 and SDO satellites and
LASCO/SOHO coronographs enabled us to examine early stages of initiation and
propagation of six limb CMEs registered in June 2010 - June 2011. For five
events under consideration, the CME initiation is marked by filament
(prominence) eruption or by a loop-like structure having another nature.
Subsequently, several loop-like structures having higher brightness and
following each other at different velocities appear in the region of the CME
initiation. The CME frontal structure is formed by these loop-like structures.
The time-dependent velocities and acceleration of the ejection front have been
obtained for all CMEs under consideration. We have drawn a conclusion about the
possible existence of two CME types dependent on the time profile of their
velocity. The first CME type comprises the ejections whose velocity decreases
abruptly by more than 100 km/s after having reached the maximum; it thereupon
passes to slow deceleration/variation. The second CME type is formed by the
ejections whose velocity varies insignificantly after reaching the maximum. The
CME angular size is shown to increase up to threefold at the initial stage of
propagation; it increases twofold 3.5-11 minutes after the first measurement of
this parameter. When considering 3 CMEs, we see that their broadening exceeds
their extension in the longitudinal direction during a certain period of time
at the initial propagation stage.
