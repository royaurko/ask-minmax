Staircase and Poisson scaling are two typical patterns we observe for the
exclusive number of jets at high energy hadron colliders. We examine these
scaling properties for photon plus jets production at the LHC and find that
this channel is well suited to study these features. We illustrate and discuss
when to expect each of the two patterns, how to induce a transition through
kinematic cuts, and how photons are related to heavy gauge bosons. Measurements
of photon+jets production is therefore providing valuable information on
exclusive jet scaling, which is going to help to eventually understand the
theoretical origin of exclusive jet scaling properties in more detail.
