A fast and simple Monte Carlo program is presented that simulates single
Bremsstrahlung in Bhabha scattering, e+e- --> e+e-gamma, without constraints on
scattering angles. This allows the study of this process at arbitrarily small,
or even vanishing, scattering angles. Experimental cuts can be imposed on an
event-by-event basis, allowing for detailed studies of the process as a
limitation to beam lifetimes, or a luminosity-measuring device, in e+e- storage
rings. As an application, we show that the easy introduction of a cutoff
parameter, corresponding to the characteristic distance between particles in
the bunches, gives a reduced cross section that is in good agreement with
observation.
