We study noncommutative field theories, which are inherently nonlocal, using
a Poincar\'e-invariant regularisation scheme which yields an effective,
nonlocal theory for energies below a cut-off scale. After discussing the
general features and the peculiar advantages of this regularisation scheme for
theories defined in noncommutative spaces, we focus our attention onto the
particular case when the noncommutativity parameter is inversely proportional
to the square of the cut-off, via a dimensionless parameter $\eta$. We work out
the perturbative corrections at one-loop order for a scalar theory with quartic
interactions, where the signature of noncommutativity appears in
$\eta$-dependent terms. The implications of this approach, which avoids the
problems related to UV-IR mixing, are discussed from the perspective of the
Wilson renormalisation program. Finally, we remark about the generality of the
method, arguing that it may lead to phenomenologically relevant predictions,
when applied to realistic field theories.
