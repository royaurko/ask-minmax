Detailed numerical analysis of four charged leptons photoproduction in frame
of standard theory of electroweak interaction is presented. Total and
differential cross sections are obtained and investigated using the Monte-Carlo
method of numerical integration. Different energies of initial photons (60-2000
GeV in c.m.s.) as well as the definite and averaged spin states of interacting
particles are considered. A set of kinematical cuts of linear collider
experiments is discussed.
