We propose a model aimed at explaining jet quenching, large azimuthal
asymmetry and baryon/meson ratio at large transverse momenta pt=2-10 GeV
observed at RHIC. Its main point is that a QCD string can be cut by matter
quarks and/or diquarks before its natural breaking. We model the early
quark/diquark production via QCD sphalerons.
