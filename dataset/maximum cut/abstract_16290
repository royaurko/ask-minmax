The thermoelectric response of SND configuration is considered within the
generalized Ginzburg-Landau theory for a homogeneous admixture of s-wave and
d-wave superconductors. The resulting thermopower (TP) is found to strongly
depend on the relative phase \theta =\phi_s-\phi_d between the two
superconductors. Two independent mechanisms are shown to contribute to the TP.
One, based on the charge imbalance between the quasiparticles and Cooper pairs
(described by the corresponding chemical potentials) due to the normal metal
insert, results in a pronounced maximum of the peak near \theta =\pi/2 (the
so-called s+id mixed pairing state) for two identical superconductors with
T_{cd}=T_{cs}. This mechanism can be realized in a d-wave orthorhombic sample
(like YBCO) with twin boundaries represented by tetragonal regions of variable
width, with a reduced chemical potential. Another mechanism (not related to the
charge imbalance effects) occurs when two different superconductors with
T_{cd}>T_{cs} are used for SND junction. It can be realized via the junction
comprising an s-wave low-T_c superconductor (like Pb) and a d-wave high-T_c
superconductor (like orthorhombic YBCO). The experimental conditions under
which the predicted behavior of the induced differential thermopower can be
measured are discussed.
