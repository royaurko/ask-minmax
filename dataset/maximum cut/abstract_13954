Some known analytical solutions for a cascade shower were used for
determining the intensity of excess electrons' radio-emission. It is shown that
the energy spectrum has a sharp decline in the region of high frequencies. At a
usual root-mean-square radius of the disk within the Moon's regolith ~ 0.06m
the maximum of the spectrum is in the region ~ 0.5-0.6 GHz while in the range
2-2.5 GHz the pulse's amplitude drops by 5-6 orders. This fact is a consequence
of loss of coherence due to finite dimensions of the cascade disk and demands
conducting a significant correction of "radio-frequency window" for measuring
cosmic rays' flux with a radio telescope.
