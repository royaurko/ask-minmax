We utilize cross-phase modulation to observe all-optical switching in
microring resonators fabricated with hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H).
Using 2.7-ps pulses from a mode-locked fiber laser in the telecom C-band, we
observe optical switching of a cw telecom-band probe with full-width at
half-maximum switching times of 14.8 ps, using approximately 720 fJ of energy
deposited in the microring. In comparison with telecom-band optical switching
in undoped crystalline silicon microrings, a-Si:H exhibits substantially higher
switching speeds due to reduced impact of free-carrier processes.
