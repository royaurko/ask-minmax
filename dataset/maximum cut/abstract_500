We present a scale-invariant, template-based segmentation paradigm that sets
up a graph and performs a graph cut to separate an object from the background.
Typically graph-based schemes distribute the nodes of the graph uniformly and
equidistantly on the image, and use a regularizer to bias the cut towards a
particular shape. The strategy of uniform and equidistant nodes does not allow
the cut to prefer more complex structures, especially when areas of the object
are indistinguishable from the background. We propose a solution by introducing
the concept of a "template shape" of the target object in which the nodes are
sampled non-uniformly and non-equidistantly on the image. We evaluate it on
2D-images where the object's textures and backgrounds are similar, and large
areas of the object have the same gray level appearance as the background. We
also evaluate it in 3D on 60 brain tumor datasets for neurosurgical planning
purposes.
