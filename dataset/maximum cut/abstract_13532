We investigate the role of centrifugal acceleration of electrons in producing
the very high energy (VHE) radiation from the BL Lac object 1ES 0806+524,
recently detected by VERITAS. The efficiency of the inverse Compton scattering
(ICS) of the accretion disk thermal photons against rotationally accelerated
electrons is examined. By studying the dynamics of centrifugally induced
outflows and by taking into account a cooling process due to the ICS, we
estimate the maximum attainable Lorentz factors of particles and derive
corresponding energetic characteristics of the emission. Examining physically
reasonable parameters, by considering the narrow interval of inclination angles
(0.7^o-0.95^o) of magnetic field lines with respect to the rotation axis, it is
shown that the centrifugally accelerated electrons may lead to the
observational pattern of the VHE emission, if the density of electrons is in a
certain interval.
