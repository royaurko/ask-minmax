We establish some statistical properties of the hyperbolic times for a class
of nonuniformly expanding dynamical systems. The maps arise as factors of area
preserving maps of the unit square via a geometric Baker's map type
construction, exhibit intermittent dynamics, and have unbounded derivatives.
The geometric approach captures various examples from the literature over the
last thirty years. The statistics of these maps are controlled by the order of
tangency that a certain "cut function" makes with the boundary of the square.
Using a large deviations result of Melbourne and Nicol we obtain sharp
estimates on the distribution of first hyperbolic times. As shown by Alves,
Viana and others, knowledge of the tail of the distribution of first hyperbolic
times leads to estimates on the rate of decay of correlations and derivation of
a CLT. For our family of maps, we compare the estimates on correlation decay
rate and CLT derived via hyperbolic times with those derived by a direct Young
tower construction. The latter estimates are known to be sharp.
