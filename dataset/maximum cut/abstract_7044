Mapping the relativistic jets emanating from AGN requires the use of a
deconvolution algorithm to account for the effects of missing baseline
spacings. The CLEAN algorithm is the most commonly used algorithm in VLBI
imaging today and is suitable for imaging polarisation data. The Maximum
Entropy Method (MEM) is presented as an alternative with some advantages over
the CLEAN algorithm, including better spatial resolution and a more rigorous
and unbiased approach to deconvolution. We have developed a MEM code suitable
for deconvolving VLBI polarisation data. Monte Carlo simulations investigating
the performance of CLEAN and the MEM code on a variety of source types are
being carried out. Real polarisation (VLBA) data taken at multiple wavelengths
have also been deconvolved using MEM, and several of the resulting polarisation
and Faraday rotation maps are presented and discussed.
