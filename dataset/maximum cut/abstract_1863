The maximum power of Feynman's ratchet as a heat engine and the corresponding
efficiency ($\eta_\ast$) are investigated by optimizing both the internal
parameter and the external load. When a perfect ratchet device (no heat
exchange between the ratchet and the paw via kinetic energy) works between two
thermal baths at temperatures $T_1> T_2$, its efficiency at maximum power is
found to be $\eta_\ast =\eta_C^2 /[\eta_C-(1-\eta_C)\ln(1-\eta_C)]$, where
$\eta_C\equiv 1-T_2/T_1$. This efficiency is slightly higher than the value
$1-\sqrt{T_2/T_1}$ obtained by Curzon and Ahlborn [\textit{Am. J. Phys.}
\textbf{43} (1975) 22] for macroscopic heat engines. It is also slightly larger
than the result $\eta_{SS}\equiv 2\eta_C/(4-\eta_C)$ obtained by Schmiedl and
Seifert [\textit{EPL} \textbf{81} (2008) 20003] for stochastic heat engines
working at small temperature difference, while the evident deviation between
$\eta_\ast$ and $\eta_{SS}$ appears at large temperature difference. For an
imperfect ratchet device in which the heat exchange between the ratchet and the
paw via kinetic energy is non-vanishing, the efficiency at maximum power
decreases with increasing the heat conductivity.
