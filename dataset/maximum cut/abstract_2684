We present the full NLO QCD corrections to the production of a W^+W^- pair in
association with two jets in hadronic collisions, which is an important
background to New Physics and Higgs boson searches. We include leptonic decays
of the W-bosons with full spin correlations. We find NLO corrections of the
order of 10% for standard cuts at the LHC. The scale dependence is considerably
reduced by the NLO corrections.
