We calculate expressions for the state-dependent quasiparticle lifetime, the
thermal conductivity $\kappa$, the shear viscosity $\eta$, and discuss the spin
diffusion coefficient $D$ for Fermi-liquid films in two dimensions. The
expressions are valid for low temperatures and arbitrary polarization. The
low-temperature expressions for the transport coefficients are essentially
exact. We find that $\kappa^{-1} \sim T \ln{T}$, and $\eta^{-1} \sim T^{2}$ for
arbitrary polarizations $0 \le {\mathcal{P}} \le 1$. We note that the shear
viscosity requires a unique analysis. We utilize previously determined values
for the density and polarization dependent Landau parameters to calculate the
transition probabilities in the lowest order "$\ell = 0$ approximation," and
thus we obtain predictions for the density, temperature and polarization
dependence of the thermal conductivity, shear viscosity, and spin diffusion
coefficient for thin \he3 films. Results are shown for second layer \he3 films
on graphite, and thin \he3-\he4 superfluid mixtures. The density dependence is
discussed in detail. For $\kappa$ and $\eta$ we find roughly an order of
magnitude increase in magnitude from zero to full polarization. For $D$ a
simialr large increase is predicted from zero polarization to the polarization
where $D$ is a maximum ($\sim 0.74$). We discuss the applicability of \he3 thin
films to the question of the existence of a universal lower bound for the ratio
of the shear viscosity to the entropy density.
