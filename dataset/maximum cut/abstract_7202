Multivariate continuous-time ARMA(p,q) (MCARMA(p,q)) processes are the
continuous-time analog of the well-known vector ARMA(p,q) processes. They have
attracted interest over the last years. Methods to estimate the parameters of
an MCARMA process require an identifiable parametrization such as the Echelon
form with a fixed Kronecker index, which is in the one-dimensional case the
degree p of the autoregressive polynomial. Thus, the Kronecker index has to be
known in advance before the parameter estimation is done. When this is not the
case information criteria can be used to estimate the Kronecker index and the
degrees (p,q), respectively. In this paper we investigate information criteria
for MCARMA processes based on quasi maximum likelihood estimation. Therefore,
we first derive the asymptotic properties of quasi maximum likelihood
estimators for MCARMA processes in a misspecified parameter space. Then, we
present necessary and sufficient conditions for information criteria to be
strongly and weakly consistent, respectively. In particular, we study the
well-known Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) as special cases.
