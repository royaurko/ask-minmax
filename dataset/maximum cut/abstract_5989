Besides the fact of parity violation in weak interactions, based on evidences
from neutrino oscillation and tritium beta decay, a natural conjecture is that
neutrinos may be spacelike particles with a tiny proper mass. A Dirac-type
equation for spacelike neutrinos is further investigated and its solutions are
discussed. This equation can be written in two spinor equations coupled
together via nonzero proper mass while respecting maximum parity violation.
