We report the discovery of two new R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the MACHO project photometry database. The
identification of both stars has been confirmed spectroscopically. One is a
cool RCB star (T_eff about 5000 K) characterized by very strong Swan bands of
C_2 and violet bands of CN, and weak or absent Balmer lines, G-band and 12C-13C
bands. The second star is an example of a hot RCB star of which only 3 were
previously known to exist in the Galaxy and none in the LMC. Its spectrum is
characterized by several C II lines in emission. Both stars have shown deep
declines of Delta V > 4 mag in brightness. The new stars are significantly
fainter at maximum light than the three previously known LMC RCB stars. The
amount of reddening toward these stars is somewhat uncertain but both seem to
have absolute magnitudes, M_V, about half a magnitude fainter than the other
three stars. Estimates of M_Bol find that the hot RCB star lies in the range of
the other three stars while the cool RCB star is fainter. The two cool LMC RCB
stars are the faintest at M_Bol. The discovery of these two new stars brings to
five the number of known RCB stars in the LMC and demonstrates the utility of
the MACHO photometric database for the discovery of new RCB stars.
