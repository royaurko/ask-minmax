In this letter, we analyse the properties of a maximum likelihood channel
estimator based on the syndrome of a linear code. For the two examples of a
binary symmetric channel and a binary input additive white Gaussian noise
channel, we derive expressions for the bias and the mean squared error and
compare them to the Cram\'er-Rao bound. The analytical expressions show the
relationship between the estimator properties and the parameters of the linear
code, i.e., the number of check nodes and the check node degree.
