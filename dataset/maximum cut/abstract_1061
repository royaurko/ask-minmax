Hard scattering in a strongly absorptive regime requires a novel nonlinear
k_t -- factorization. Here we discuss two recent developments: firstly the
evaluation of radiative corrections to single particle spectra, and secondly an
extension of the formalism to address topological cross sections and unitarity
cutting rules.
