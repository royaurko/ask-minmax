Complex networks have been mostly characterized from the point of view of the
degree distribution of their nodes and a few other motifs (or modules), with a
special attention to triangles and cliques. The most exotic phenomena have been
observed when the exponent $\gamma$ of the associated power law
degree-distribution is sufficiently small. In particular, a zero percolation
threshold takes place for $\gamma<3$, and an anomalous critical behavior sets
in for $\gamma<5$. In this Letter we prove that in sparse scale-free networks
characterized by a cut-off scaling with the sistem size $N$, relative
fluctuations are actually never negligible: given a motif $\Gamma$, we analyze
the relative fluctuations $R_{\Gamma}$ of the associated density of $\Gamma$,
and we show that there exists an interval in $\gamma$, $[\gamma_1,\gamma_2]$,
where $R_{\Gamma}$ does not go to zero in the thermodynamic limit, where
$\gamma_1\approx k_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $\gamma_2\approx 2 k_{\mathrm{max}}$,
$k_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{max}}$ being the smallest and the largest
degree of $\Gamma$, respectively. Remarkably, in $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$
$R_{\Gamma}$ diverges, implying the instability of $\Gamma$ to small
perturbations.
