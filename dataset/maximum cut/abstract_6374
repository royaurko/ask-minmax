For two particles in a disordered chain of length $L$ with on-site
interaction $U$, a duality transformation maps the behavior at weak interaction
onto the behavior at strong interaction. Around the fixed point of this
transformation, the interaction yields a maximum mixing of the one body states.
When $L \approx L_1$ (the one particle localization length), this mixing
results in weak chaos accompanied by multifractal wave functions and critical
spectral statistics, as in the one particle problem at the mobility edge or in
certain pseudo-integrable billiards. In one dimension, a local interaction can
only yield this weak chaos but can never drive the two particle system to full
chaos with Wigner-Dyson statistics.
