Unitarity cutting rules for the multiplicity of cut Pomerons, or topological
cross sections, have been obtained within the framework of nonlinear k_t
factorisation. Proper account for the color coupled channel aspects of the
problem leads to the emergence of two types of cut Pomerons. This is
illustrated on the example of topological cross sections in deep inelastic
scattering on a nucleus.
