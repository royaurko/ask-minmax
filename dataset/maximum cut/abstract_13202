An important component of the Extragalactic Distance Database (EDD) at
http://edd.ifa.hawaii.edu is a group of catalogs related to the measurement of
HI line profile parameters. One of these is the All Digital HI catalog which
contains an amalgam of information from new data and old. The new data results
from observations with Arecibo and Parkes telescopes and with the Green Bank
Telescope (GBT), including continuing input since the award of the NRAO Cosmic
Flows Large Program. The old data has been collected from archives, wherever
available, particularly the Cornell University Digital HI Archive, the Nancay
Telescope extragalactic HI archive, and the Australia Telescope archive. The
catalog currently contains information on ~15,000 profiles relating to ~13,000
galaxies. The channel - flux per channel files, from whatever source, are
carried through a common pipeline. The derived parameter of greatest interest
is W_m50, the profile width at 50% of the mean flux. After appropriate
adjustment, the parameter W_mx is derived, the linewidth which statistically
approximates the peak to peak maximum rotation velocity before correction for
inclination, 2 V_max sin(i).
