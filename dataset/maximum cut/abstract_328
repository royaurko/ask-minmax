After 10 years of steadily increasing the experimental precision at LEP/SLC,
there is a strong demand on an update of existing programs for fermion pair
production. We present a rederivation of the O(alpha) Bremsstrahlung
corrections to e+e- --> f+f- for the semi-analytic program ZFITTER. We focus on
observables like total cross section and forward-backward asymmetry in the
leptonic case with combined cuts on acollinearity angle, acceptance angle, and
minimal energy of the fermions. The outcome of our analysis is a shift of the
predictions by ZFITTER at LEP 1 energies off-resonance of a few per mil while
at the Z resonance numerical changes can be neglected. Thus we obtain for cross
sections and asymmetries at LEP 1 a level of agreement with other programs of
better than per mil, like for the kinematically simpler s' cut option. A
preliminary analysis of ZFITTER, TOPAZ0, and other codes at LEP 2 energies
showing deviations of several per cent with acollinearity cuts enforce a future
examination of higher order effects with different cuts. The predictions by
LEP/SLC data, however, are not affected within the experimental errors.
