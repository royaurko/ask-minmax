In this paper we analyze the problem of glow discharge in low pressure plasma
in industrial plant, for chambers of different shapes and various working
parameters, like pressure and electric potential. The model described is based
upon a static approximation of the AC configuration with two electrodes and a
drift diffusion approximation for the current density of positive ions and
electrons. A detailed discussion of the boundary conditions imposed is given,
as well as the full description of the mathematical model. Numerical
simulations were performed for a simple 1D model and two different 2D models,
corresponding to two different settings of the industrial plant. The simpler
case consists of a radially symmetric chamber, with one central electrode
(cathode), based upon a DC generator. In this case, the steel chamber acts as
the anode. The second model concerns a two dimensional horizontal cut of the
most common plant configuration, with two electrodes connected to an AC
generator. The case is treated in a "quasi-static" approximation. The three
models show some common behaviours, particularly including the main expected
features, such as dark spaces, glow regions and a wide "plasma region".
Furthermore, the three shown models show some similarities with previously
published results concerning 1D and simplified 2D models, as well as with some
preliminary results of the full 3D case.
