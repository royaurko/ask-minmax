We propose precision measurements of the helicity-dependent and helicity
independent cross sections for the ep->epg reaction in Deeply Virtual Compton
Scattering (DVCS) kinematics. DVCS scaling is obtained in the limits
Q^2>>Lambda_{QCD}^2, x_Bj fixed, and -\Delta^2=-(q-q')^2<<Q^2. We consider the
specific kinematic range Q^2>2 GeV^2, W>2 GeV, and -\Delta^21 GeV^2. We will
use our successful technique from the 5.75 GeV Hall A DVCS experiment
(E00-110). With polarized 6.6, 8.8, and 11 GeV beams incident on the liquid
hydrogen target, we will detect the scattered electron in the Hall A HRS-L
spectrometer (maximum central momentum 4.3 GeV/c) and the emitted photon in a
slightly expanded PbF_2 calorimeter. In general, we will not detect the recoil
proton. The H(e,e'g)X missing mass resolution is sufficient to isolate the
exclusive channel with 3% systematic precision.
