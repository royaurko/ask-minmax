A simple, semi-analytical model is proposed for non-relativistic Coulomb
explosion of a uniformly charged spheroid. This model allows us to derive the
time-dependent particle energy distributions. Simple expressions are also given
for the characteristic explosion time and maximum particle energies in the
limits of extreme prolate and oblate spheroids as well as for the sphere.
Results of particle simulations are found to be in remarkably good agreement
with the model.
