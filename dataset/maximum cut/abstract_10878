Evidence of high-velocity features such as those seen in the near-maximum
spectra of some Type Ia Supernovae (eg SN 2000cx) has been searched for in the
available SNIa spectra observed earlier than one week before B maximum. Recent
observational efforts have doubled the number of SNeIa with very early spectra.
Remarkably, all SNeIa with early data (7 in our RTN sample and 10 from other
programmes) show signs of such features, to a greater or lesser degree, in CaII
IR, and some also in SiII 6255A line. High-velocity features may be interpreted
as abundance or density enhancements. Abundance enhancements would imply an
outer region dominated by Si and Ca. Density enhancements may result from the
sweeping up of circumstellar material by the highest velocity SN ejecta. In
this scenario, the high incidence of HVFs suggests that a thick disc and/or a
high-density companion wind surrounds the exploding white dwarf, as may be the
case in Single Degenerate systems. Large-scale angular fluctuations in the
radial density and abundance distribution may also be responsible: this could
originate in the explosion, and would suggest a deflagration as the more likely
explosion mechanism. CSM-interaction and surface fluctuations may coexist,
possibly leaving different signatures on the spectrum. In some SNe the HVFs are
narrowly confined in velocity, suggesting the ejection of blobs of burned
material.
