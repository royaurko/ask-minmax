We compare the Gibbs and Maxwell constructions for the hadron-quark phase
transition in neutron and protoneutron stars, including interacting hyperons in
the confined phase. We find that the hyperon populations are suppressed, and
that neutrino trapping shifts the onset of the phase transition. The effects on
the (proto)neutron star maximum mass are explored.
