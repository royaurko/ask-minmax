We model the effects of a large number of zero modes for $N_f$ species of
quarks at finite vacuum angle $\theta$, using a matrix model with gaussian
weights constrained by the topological susceptibility and compressibility. The
quenched free energy exhibits a cusp at $\theta <\pi$ that is sensitive to the
accuracy of the numerical analysis and the maximum density of winding modes.
Our results bear much in common with recent lattice simulations by Schierholtz
and others. The unquenched free energy exhibits similar sensitivities, but for
small quark masses or a large density of zero modes the results are in
agreement with those derived using chiral effective Lagrangians.
