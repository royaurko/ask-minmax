Two-jet cross sections in deep inelastic scattering at HERA are calculated in
next-to-leading order. The QCD corrections are implemented in a new
$ep\rightarrow n$ jets event generator, MEPJET, which allows to analyze
arbitrary jet definition schemes and general cuts in terms of parton 4-momenta.
First results are presented for the JADE, the cone and the $k_T$ schemes. For
the $W$-scheme, disagreement with previous results and large radiative
corrections and recombination scheme dependencies are traced to a common
origin.
