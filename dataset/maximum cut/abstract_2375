We prove for the Reidemeister-Turaev torsion of closed oriented
three-manifolds some finiteness properties in the sense of Goussarov and
Habiro, that is, with respect to some cut-and-paste operations which preserve
the homology type of the manifolds. In general, those properties require the
manifolds to come equipped with an Euler structure and a homological
parametrization.
