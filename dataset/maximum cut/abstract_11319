I describe a Tully-Fisher (TF) survey of galaxies in 15 Abell Clusters
distributed around the sky in the redshift range 9000-13,000 km/sec. The
observations were done between 1992 and 1995 at the Las Campanas (LCO) and
Palomar Observatories. The program is known as the LP10K survey. The basic data
set consists of R band CCD magnitudes and H-alpha rotation curves for over 200
spiral galaxies. The TF relation is found to have a mild but statistically
significant surface brightness dependence, v_{TF} ~ L^{0.28} I_e^{0.13}, and
the intrinsic TF scatter is found to be 0.28 +/- 0.07 mag. A maximum-likelihood
method is applied to the LP10K data set to test for large-scale bulk streaming.
A formal result of v_B=720 +/- 300 km/sec is found. However, this finding is in
disagreement with several results on smaller scales, including the Shellflow
result reported at the Cosmic Flows conference, which indicate convergence to
the CMB frame by ~ 6000 km/sec redshift.
