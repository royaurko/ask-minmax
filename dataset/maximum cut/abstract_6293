We present a maximum-entropy method (MEM) and `Mexican Hat' wavelet (MHW)
joint analysis to recover the different components of the microwave sky from
simulated observations by the ESA Planck satellite in a small patch of the sky.
This combined method allows one to improve the CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and
Galactic foregrounds separation achieved by the MEM technique alone. In
particular, the reconstructed CMB map is free from any bright point source
contamination. The joint analysis also produces point source catalogues at each
Planck frequency which are more complete and accurate than those obtained by
each method on its own. The results are especially improved at high frequencies
where infrared galaxies dominate the point source contribution. Although this
joint technique has been performed on simulated Planck data, it could be easily
applied to other multifrequency CMB experiments, such as the forthcoming NASA
MAP satellite or the recently performed Boomerang and MAXIMA experiments.
