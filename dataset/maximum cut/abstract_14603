An edge coloring of a tournament $T$ with colors $1,2,\dots,k$ is called \it
$k$-transitive \rm if the digraph $T(i)$ defined by the edges of color $i$ is
transitively oriented for each $1\le i \le k$. We explore a conjecture of the
second contributor: For each positive integer $k$ there exists a (least) $p(k)$ such
that every $k$-transitive tournament has a dominating set of at most $p(k)$
vertices.
  We show how this conjecture relates to other conjectures and results. For
example, it is a special case of a well-known conjecture of Erd\H os, Sands,
Sauer and Woodrow (so the conjecture is interesting even if false). We show
that the conjecture implies a stronger conjecture, a possible extension of a
result of B\'ar\'any and Lehel on covering point sets by boxes. The principle
used leads also to an upper bound $O(2^{2^{d-1}}d\log d)$ on the
$d$-dimensional box-cover number that is better than all previous bounds, in a
sense close to best possible. We also improve the best bound known in
3-dimensions from $3^{14}$ to 64 and propose possible further improvements
through finding the maximum domination number over parity tournaments.
