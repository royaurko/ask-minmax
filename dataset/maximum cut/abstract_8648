We study mass spectra of a meson-meson system involving two light and two
heavy quarks on an anisotropic lattice. The heavy quarks are treated in the
static approximation. The dependence of the spectrum on the relative distance
of the heavy quarks is extracted from the lattice simulation using the maximum
entropy method (MEM). A correlation matrix of meson-meson operators emphasizing
quark and gluon exchange degrees of freedom is employed in an attempt to learn
about aspects of mechanisms of hadronic interaction.
