The well-known "splitting necklace theorem" of Noga Alon says that each
"necklace" having beads of n different colors can be fairly divided between k
"thieves" by at most n(k-1) cuts. We demonstrate that Alon's result is a
special case of a multidimensional, consensus division theorem for n continuous
probability measures on a d-cube [0,1]^d. The dissection is performed by
m_1+...+ m_d=n(k-1) hyperplanes parallel to the sides of [0,1]^d dividing the
cube into m_1 x m_2 x ... x m_d elementary parallelepipeds where the integers
m_i are prescribed in advance.
