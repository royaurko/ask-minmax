Measurements of the superconducting transition temperature, T_c, under
hydrostatic pressure via bulk AC susceptibility were carried out on several
concentrations of phosphorous substitution in BaFe_2(As_{1-x}P_x)_2. The
pressure dependence of unsubstituted BaFe_2As_2, phosphorous concentration
dependence of BaFe_2(As_{1-x}P_x)_2, as well as the pressure dependence of
BaFe_2(As_{1-x}P_x)_2 all point towards an identical maximum T_c of 31 K. This
demonstrates that phosphorous substitution and physical pressure result in
similar superconducting phase diagrams, and that phosphorous substitution does
not induce substantial impurity scattering.
