We present the discovery of the common proper motion M9 + L0 binary DENIS
J220002.05-303832.9AB, identified serendipitously with the SpeX near infrared
imager/spectrograph. Spectral types are derived from resolved near infrared
spectroscopy of the well-separated (1"09+/-0"06) components and comparison to
equivalent data for M and L dwarf spectral standards. Physical association is
deduced from the angular proximity of the sources, their common proper motion
and their similar spectrophotometric distances (35+/-2 pc). The estimated
distance of this pair implies a projected separation of 38+/-3 AU, wider than
typical separations for other M dwarf/L dwarf binaries, but consistent with the
maximum separation/total system mass trend previously identified by Burgasser
et al. (2003). We discuss the DENIS 2200-3038AB system in context with other
low mass binaries, and its role in studying dust formation processes and
activity trends across the transition between the M and L dwarf spectral
classes.
