Continuously indexed datasets with multiple variables have become ubiquitous
in the geophysical, ecological, environmental and climate sciences, and pose
substantial analysis challenges to scientists and statisticians. For many
years, scientists developed models that aimed at capturing the spatial behavior
for an individual process; only within the last few decades has it become
commonplace to model multiple processes jointly. The key difficulty is in
specifying the cross-covariance function, that is, the function responsible for
the relationship between distinct variables. Indeed, these cross-covariance
functions must be chosen to be consistent with marginal covariance functions in
such a way that the second-order structure always yields a nonnegative definite
covariance matrix. We review the main approaches to building cross-covariance
models, including the linear model of coregionalization, convolution methods,
the multivariate Mat\'{e}rn and nonstationary and space-time extensions of
these among others. We additionally cover specialized constructions, including
those designed for asymmetry, compact support and spherical domains, with a
review of physics-constrained models. We illustrate select models on a
bivariate regional climate model output example for temperature and pressure,
along with a bivariate minimum and maximum temperature observational dataset;
we compare models by likelihood value as well as via cross-validation
co-kriging studies. The article closes with a discussion of unsolved problems.
