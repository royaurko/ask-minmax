We revisit the radiation mechanism of relativistic electrons in the
stochastic magnetic field and apply it to the high-energy emissions of
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We confirm that jitter radiation is a possible
explanation for GRB prompt emission in the condition of a large electron
deflection angle. In the turbulent scenario, the radiative spectral property of
GRB prompt emission is decided by the kinetic energy spectrum of turbulence.
The intensity of the random and small-scale magnetic field is determined by the
viscous scale of the turbulent eddy. The microphysical parameters $\epsilon_e$
and $\epsilon_B$ can be obtained. The acceleration and cooling timescales are
estimated as well. Due to particle acceleration in magnetized filamentary
turbulence, the maximum energy released from the relativistic electrons can
reach a value of about $10^{14}$ eV. The GeV GRBs are possible sources of
high-energy cosmic-ray.
