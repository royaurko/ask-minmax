We present an outline of the theory of certain L\'evy-driven, multivariate
stochastic processes, where the processes are represented by rational transfer
functions (Continuous-time AutoRegressive Moving Average or CARMA models) and
their applications in non-Gaussian time series modelling. We discuss in detail
their definition, their spectral representation, the equivalence to linear
state space models and further properties like the second order structure and
the tail behaviour under a heavy-tailed input. Furthermore, we study the
estimation of the parameters using quasi-maximum likelihood estimates for the
auto-regressive and moving average parameters, as well as how to estimate the
driving L\'evy process.
