The presented results are the first measurements at RHIC for direct
$\gamma$-charged hadron azimuthal correlations in heavy ion collisions. We use
these correlations to study the color charge density of the medium through the
medium-induced modification of high-p$_T$ parton fragmentation. Azimuthal
correlations of direct photons at high transverse energy (8 $<$ p$_T$ $<$ 16
GeV) with away-side charged hadrons of transverse momentum (3 $<$ p$_T$ $<$ 6
GeV/c) have been measured over a broad range of centrality for $Au+Au$
collisions and $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV in the STAR
experiment. A transverse shower shape analysis in the STAR Barrel
Electromagnetic Calorimeter Shower Maximum Detector is used to discriminate
between the direct photons and photons from the decays of high p$_T$ $\pi^{0}$.
The per-trigger away-side yield of direct $\gamma$ is smaller than from
$\pi^{0}$ trigger at the same centrality class. Within the current uncertainty
the I$_{CP}$ of direct $\gamma$ and $\pi^{0}$ are similar.
