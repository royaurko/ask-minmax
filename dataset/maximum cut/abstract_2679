Leptogenesis may be induced by the mixing of extra Higgs doublets with
experimentally accessible masses. This mechanism relies on diagrammatic cuts
that are kinematically forbidden in the vacuum but contribute at finite
temperature. A resonant enhancement of the asymmetry occurs generically
provided the dimensionless Yukawa and self-interactions are suppressed compared
to those of the Standard Model Higgs field. This is in contrast to typical
scenarios of Resonant Leptogenesis, where the asymmetry is enhanced by imposing
a degeneracy of singlet neutrino masses.
