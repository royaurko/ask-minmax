By using scattering in near field techniques, a microscope can be easily
turned into a device measuring static and dynamic light scattering, very useful
for the characterization of nanoparticle dispersions. Up to now, microscopy
based techniques have been limited to forward scattering, up to a maximum of 30
degrees. In this paper we present a novel optical scheme that overcomes this
limitation, extending the detection range to angles larger than 90 degrees
(back-scattering). Our optical scheme is based on a microscope, a wide
numerical aperture objective, and a laser illumination, with the collimated
beam positioned at a large angle with respect to the optical axis of the
objective (Tilted Laser Microscopy, TLM). We present here an extension of the
theory for near field scattering, which usually applies only to paraxial
scattering, to our strongly out-of-axis s ituation. We tested our instrument
and our calculations with calibrated spherical nanoparticles of several
different diameters, performing static and dynamic scattering measurements up
to 110 degrees. The measured static spectra and decay times are compatible with
the Mie theory and the diffusion coefficients provided by the Stokes-Einstein
equation. The ability of performing backscattering measurements with this
modified microscope opens the way to new applications of scattering in near
field techniques to the measurement of systems with strongly angle dependent
scattering.
