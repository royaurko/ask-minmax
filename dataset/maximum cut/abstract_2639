We construct traversable thin-shell wormholes in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati
theory with cylindrical symmetry applying the cut and paste procedure to a flat
black string solution of the five-dimensional vacuum Einstein field equations.
In contrast to general relativity case, where thin-shell wormholes violate both
weak and null energy conditions, we show that static wormholes are supported by
normal matter while vacuum wormholes do not exist.
