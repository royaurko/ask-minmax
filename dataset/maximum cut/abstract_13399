The statistical system of pions with zero total isospin is studied. The
suppression effects for the average yields due to isospin conservation are the
same for $\pi^0$, $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$. However, a behavior of the corresponding
particle number fluctuations are different. For neutral pions there is the
enhancement of the fluctuations, whereas for charged pions the isospin
conservation suppresses fluctuations. The correlations between the numbers of
charged and neutral pions are observed for finite systems. This causes a
maximum of the total pion number fluctuations for small systems. The
thermodynamic limit values for the scaled variances of neutral and charged
pions are calculated. The enhancements of the fluctuations due to Bose
statistics are found and discussed.
