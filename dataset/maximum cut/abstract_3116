Elastic and inelastic Coulomb form factors of 6Li and 7Li nuclei are
considered on the basis of 4He2H and 3He3H cluster models. Potentials
containing forbidden states, which describe main characteristics of bound
states and phase shifts of elastic scattering at low energies, are used as
intercluster potentials. It is obtained a good description of elastic form
factors for momenta up to 4 Fm-1 as well as the second maximum at 3 - 4 Fm-1 in
the calculated elastic form factors. The amplitude of this maximum for
inelastic form factors is smaller than the experimental value.
