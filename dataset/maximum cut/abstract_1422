We present a next-to-leading order QCD calculation for e+ nu_e mu+ nu_mu jj
and e- nubar_e mu- nubar_mu jj production via weak boson fusion at a hadron
collider in the form of a fully-flexible parton-level Monte Carlo program,
which allows for the calculation of experimentally accessible observables
within realistic selection cuts. The QCD corrections to the integrated cross
sections are found to be modest, while the shapes of some kinematical
distributions change appreciably compared to leading order. The residual scale
uncertainties of the next-to-leading order results are at the few-percent
level.
