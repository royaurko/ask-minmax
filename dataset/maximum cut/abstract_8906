We analyze a single-spin measurement using a transient process in magnetic
force microscopy (MFM) which could increase the maximum operating temperature
by a factor of Q (the quality factor of the cantilever) in comparison with the
static Stern-Gerlach effect. We obtain an exact solution of the master
equation, which confirms this result. We also discuss the conditions required
to create a macroscopic Schrodinger cat state in the cantilever.
