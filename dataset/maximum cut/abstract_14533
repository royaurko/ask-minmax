Atmospheric 14C production is a potential window into the energy of solar
proton and other cosmic ray events. It was previously concluded that results
from AD 774-775 are orders of magnitude greater than known solar events. We
find that the coronal mass ejection energy based on 14C production is much
smaller than claimed, but still substantially larger than the maximum
historical Carrington Event of 1859. Such an event would cause great damage to
modern technology, and in view of recent confirmation of superflares on
solar-type stars, this issue merits attention.
