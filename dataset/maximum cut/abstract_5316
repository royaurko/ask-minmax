We derive a compact expression for the three-point MHV form factors of
half-BPS operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills at two loops. The main tools of our
calculation are generalised unitarity applied at the form factor level, and the
compact expressions for supersymmetric tree-level form factors and amplitudes
entering the cuts. We confirm that infrared divergences exponentiate as
expected, and that collinear factorisation is entirely captured by an ABDK/BDS
ansatz. Next, we construct the two-loop remainder function obtained by
subtracting this ansatz from the full two-loop form factor and compute it
numerically. Using symbology, combined with various physical constraints and
symmetries, we find a unique solution for its symbol. With this input we
construct a remarkably compact analytic expression for the remainder function,
which contains only classical polylogarithms, and compare it to our numerical
results. Furthermore, we make the surprising observation that our remainder is
equal to the maximally transcendental piece of a closely related two-loop
amplitude in QCD.
