Using simple conditions drawn from the stability of the cosmos in terms of
vacuum energy density, the cut-off momentum of entanglement is related to the
planckian mass. In so doing the black hole entropy is shown to be independent
of the number of field species that contribute to vacuum fluctuations. And this
is in spite of the fact that the number of field species is a linear
multiplicand of the entanglement entropy when this latter is expressed in terms
of the fundamental momentum cut-off of all fields.
