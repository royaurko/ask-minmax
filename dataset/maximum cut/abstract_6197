Let G be a subgraph-closed graph class with bounded maximum degree. We show
that if G has balanced separators whose size is smaller than linear by a
polynomial factor, then G has subexponential expansion. This gives a partial
converse to a result of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez. As an
intermediate step, the proof uses a new kind of graph decompositions.
