We review the successes and challenges of the holographic approach to
cosmology. The model predicts an exactly scale invariant fluctuation spectrum
with long and short distance cut-offs. It can account for the observed
fluctuations in the CMB and might explain the low power at large scales. We
outline various cosmological histories compatible with holographic initial
conditions. This paper is based on talks given by the contributors at Cosmo 04 in
Toronto, and the 2004 Tamura Symposium in Austin
