We have proposed that the first phase of stellar evolution in the history of
the Universe may be Dark Stars (DS), powered by dark matter heating rather than
by nuclear fusion. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, which may be their own
antipartners, collect inside the first stars and annihilate to produce a heat
source that can power the stars. A new stellar phase results, a Dark Star,
powered by dark matter annihilation as long as there is dark matter fuel, with
lifetimes from millions to billions of years. We find that the first stars are
very bright ($\sim 10^6 L_\odot$) and cool ($T_{surf} < 10,000$K) during the DS
phase, and grow to be very massive (500-1000 times as massive as the Sun).
These results differ markedly from the standard picture in the absence of DM
heating, in which the maximum mass is about 140$M_\odot$ and the temperatures
are much hotter ($T_{surf} > 50,000$K); hence DS should be observationally
distinct from standard Pop III stars. Once the dark matter fuel is exhausted,
the DS becomes a heavy main sequence star; these stars eventually collapse to
form massive black holes that may provide seeds for supermassive black holes
observed at early times as well as explanations for recent ARCADE data and for
intermediate black holes.
