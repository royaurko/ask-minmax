Results of a next-to-leading order calculation of the inclusive cross section
for a photon and a heavy quark (charm or bottom), $p \bar p / pp \to \gamma +Q
+X$, are presented. Pointlike photon subprocesses through ${\cal
O}(\alpha\alpha_{s}^2)$ and fragmentation subprocesses through ${\cal
O}(\alpha_{s}^3)$ are included. The calculation is performed using a phase
space slicing technique so that the effects of experimental cuts can be
included. Results for the ratios of the charm and bottom cross sections are
presented and the systematics of the various subprocesses for both the Tevatron
and the LHC are compared and contrasted.
