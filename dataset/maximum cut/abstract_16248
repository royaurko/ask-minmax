In order to complete our HI survey of galaxies in the Sculptor group area,
VLA observations of NGC 24 and NGC 45 are presented. These two galaxies of
similar magnitude M_B ~ -17.4 lie in the background of the Sculptor group and
are low surface brightness galaxies, especially NGC 45. The HI distribution and
kinematics are regular for NGC 24 while NGC 45 exhibits a kinematical twist of
its major axis. A tilted-ring model shows that the position angle of the major
axis changes by ~25 degrees. A best-fit model of their mass distribution gives
mass-to-light ratios for the stellar disk of 2.5 and 5.2 for NGC 24 and NGC 45
respectively. These values are higher than the ones expected from stellar
population synthesis models. Despite the large dark matter contribution, the
galaxy mass is still dominated by the stellar component in their very inner
regions. These high mass-to-light ratios are typical of what is seen in low
surface brightness galaxies and may indicate that, in those galaxies, disks are
far from the maximum disk case. The halo parameters derived from the best-fit
models are thus lower limits.
