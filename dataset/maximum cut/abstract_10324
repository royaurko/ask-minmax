We have used data obtained with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space
Telescope to derive precise astrometric parallaxes for four classical novae:
V603 Aql, DQ Her, GK Per, and RR Pic. All four objects exceeded the Eddington
limit at visual maximum. Re-examination of the original light curve data for
V603 Aql and GK Per has led us to conclude that their visual maxima were
slightly brighter than commonly assumed. With known distances, we examine the
various maximum magnitude--rate of decline (MMRD) relationships that have been
established for classical novae. We find that these four objects show a similar
level of scatter about these relationships as seen in larger samples of novae
whose distances were determined using indirect techniques. We also examine the
nebular expansion parallax method, and find that it fails for three of the four
objects. In each case it was possible to find an explanation for the failure of
that technique to give precise distance estimates. DQ Her appears to suffer
from an anomalously high extinction when compared to field stars on its sight
line. We suggest that this is likely due to local material, which may also be
the source of the IRAS detections of this object.
