The observed stellar velocity dispersions of galactic discs show that the
maximum rotation of a disc is on average 63% of the observed maximum rotation.
This criterion can, however, not be applied to small or low surface brightness
(LSB) galaxies because such systems show, in general, a continuously rising
rotation curve until the outermost measured radial position. That is why a
general relation has been derived, giving the maximum rotation for a disc
depending on the luminosity, surface brightness, and colour of the disc. As a
physical basis of this relation serves an adopted fixed mass-to-light ratio as
a function of colour. That functionality is consistent with results from
population synthesis models and its absolute value is determined from the
observed stellar velocity dispersions. The derived maximum disc rotation is
compared with a number of observed maximum rotations, clearly demonstrating the
need for appreciable amounts of dark matter in the disc region and even more so
for LSB galaxies. Matters have been illustrated for two examples; the galaxy
NGC 6503 and LSB galaxy NGC 1560.
