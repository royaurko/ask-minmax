We provide a set of microlensing event rate maps for M31, the Andromeda
Galaxy. Rates for M31 microlensing were calculated on the basis of a four
component model of the lens and source populations: disk and bulge sources
lensed by bulge, disk, M31 halo and Galactic halo lenses. We confirm the high
rate gradient along the minor axis of M31 due to a dark halo of lenses.
Furthermore, we compute the timescale distributions of events, for both
Einstein times and full-width at half-maximum times. We explore how the rate
contours and the timescale distributions can be used to measure the shape and
extent of the microlensing halo. With one year of twice--weekly sampling, or
three observing seasons, a halo MACHO fraction as small as 5% can be detected
with modest ground based telescopes.
