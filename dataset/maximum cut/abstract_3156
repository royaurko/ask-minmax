Strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the Quasi-Maximum Likelihood
Estimator (QMLE) are given for a general class of multidimensional causal
processes. For particular cases already studied in the literature (for instance
univariate or multivariate GARCH, ARCH, ARMA-GARCH processes) the assumptions
required for establishing these results are often weaker than existing
conditions. The QMLE asymptotic behavior is also given for numerous new
examples of univariate or multivariate processes (for instance TARCH or NLARCH
processes).
