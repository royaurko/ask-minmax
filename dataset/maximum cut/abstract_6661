We consider a relay channel for which the following assumptions are made. (1)
The source-destination and relay-destination channels are orthogonal (frequency
division relay channel). (2) The relay implements the decode-and-forward
protocol. (3) The source and relay implement the same channel encoder, namely,
a onvolutional encoder. (4) They can use arbitrary and possibly different
modulations. In this framework, we derive the best combiner in the sense of the
maximum likelihood (ML) at the destination and the branch metrics of the
trellis associated with its channel decoder for the ML combiner and also for
the maximum ratio combiner (MRC), cooperative-MRC (C-MRC), and the minimum
mean-square error (MMSE) combiner.
