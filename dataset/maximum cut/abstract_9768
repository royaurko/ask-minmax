We obtain new oscillation and gradient bounds for the viscosity solutions of
fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations where the Hamiltonian is a sum of
a sublinear and a superlinear part in the sense of Barles and Souganidis
(2001). We use these bounds to study the asymptotic behavior of weakly coupled
systems of fully nonlinear parabolic equations. Our results apply to some
"asymmetric systems" where some equations contain a sublinear Hamiltonian
whereas the others contain a superlinear one. Moreover, we can deal with some
particular case of systems containing some degenerate equations using a
generalization of the strong maximum principle for systems.
