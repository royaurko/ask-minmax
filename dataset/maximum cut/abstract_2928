We use the recently released OGLE-III catalog of 17692 fundamental mode RR
Lyr (RRab) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to investigate the
structure of its stellar halo. We apply conservative cuts in period, amplitude
and magnitude to remove blends and other contamination. We use
period--luminosity and period--color relations to determine distance and
extinction of every star in our final sample of 9393 stars. In order to
determine the scatter of our method, we compare the distributions of distances
in two regions at the edges of the covered area with a central region. We
determine the intrinsic line-of-sight dispersion in the center to be 0.135 mag
or 3.21 kpc (FWHM of 0.318 mag or 7.56 kpc), assuming zero depth in one of the
edge regions. The conservative cuts we apply reduce the derived depth
significantly. Furthermore, we find that the distribution of RRab stars is
deformed in the sense that stars on the Eastern side are closer than on the
Western side. We model the RRab distribution as a triaxial ellipsoid and
determine its axes ratios to be 1:2.00:3.50 with the longest axis inclined by 6
degrees from the line of sight. Another result of our analysis is an extinction
map of the LMC and a map of internal reddening, which we make publicly
available.
