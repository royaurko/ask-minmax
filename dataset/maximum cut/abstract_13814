The polarization dependences of the G, D, and 2D (G$'$) bands in Raman
spectra at graphene bulk and edge are examined theoretically. The 2D and D
bands have different selection rules at bulk and edge. At bulk, the 2D band
intensity is maximum when the polarization of the scattered light is parallel
to that of incident light, whereas the D band intensity does not have a
polarization dependence. At edge, the 2D and D bands exhibit a selection rule
similar to that of the G band proposed in a previous paper. We suggest that a
constraint equation on the axial velocity caused by the graphene edge is
essential for the dependence of the G band on the crystallographic orientation
observed in the bulk of strained graphene. This is indicative of that the
pseudospin and valleyspin in the bulk of graphene can not be completely free
from the effect of surrounding edge. The status of the experiments on the G and
D bands at the graphene edge is mentioned.
