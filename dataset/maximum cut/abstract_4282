The Dualized Standard Model which gives explanations for both fermion
generations and Higgs fields has already been used to calculate fermion mass
and mixing parameters with success. In this paper, we extend its application to
low energy FCNC effects deriving bounds for various processes in terms of one
single mass scale. Using then experimental information from K_L - K_S mass
difference and air showers beyond the GZK cut-off, these bounds are converted
into rough, order-of-magnitude predictions. In particular, the estimates for
the decay K_L \to e^\pm \mu^\mp and for the mass difference between the neutral
D-mesons seem accessible to experiment in the near future.
