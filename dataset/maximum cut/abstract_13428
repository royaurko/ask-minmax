Previous numerical studies have identified "phase mixing" of low-frequency
Alfven waves as a mean of parallel electric field amplification and
acceleration of electrons in a collisionless plasma. Theoretical explanations
are given of how this produces an amplification of the parallel electric field,
and as a consequence, also leads to enhanced collisionless damping of the wave
by energy transfer to the electrons. Our results are based on the properties of
the Alfven waves in a warm plasma which are obtained from drift-kinetic theory,
in particular, the rate of their electron Landau damping. Phase mixing in a
collisionless low-$\beta$ plasma proceeds in a manner very similar to the
visco-resistive case, except for the fact that electron Landau damping is the
primary energy dissipation channel. The time and length scales involved are
evaluated. We also focus on the evolution of the parallel electric field and
calculate its maximum value in the course of its amplification.
