We analyze the interplay of topological objects in four dimensional QCD. The
distributions of color magnetic monopoles obtained in the maximum abelian gauge
are computed around instantons in both pure and full QCD. We find an enhanced
probability of encountering monopoles inside the core of an instanton on gauge
field average. For specific gauge field configurations we visualize the
situation graphically. Moreover we investigate how monopole loops and
instantons are locally correlated with the chiral condensate.
