We have made very thin films of LaAlO3 on TiO2 terminated SrTiO3 and have
measured the properties of the resulting interface in various ways. Transport
measurements show a maximum sheet carrier density of 1016 cm-2 and a mobility
around 104 cm2 V-1 s-1. In situ ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)
indicates that for these samples a finite density of states exists at the Fermi
level. From the oxygen pressure dependence measured in both transport as well
as the UPS, we detail, as reported previously by us, that oxygen vacancies play
an important role in the creation of the charge carriers and that these
vacancies are introduced by the pulsed laser deposition process used to make
the heterointerfaces. Under the conditions studied the effect of LaAlO3 on the
carrier density is found to be minimal.
