Let $X$ be a fractional Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^d$. For any Borel
function $f:[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^d$, we express the Hausdorff dimension of the
image and the graph of $X+f$ in terms of $f$. This is new even for the case of
Brownian motion and continuous $f$, where it was known that this dimension is
almost surely constant. The expression involves an adaptation of the parabolic
dimension previously used by Taylor and Watson to characterize polarity for the
heat equation. In the case when the graph of $f$ is a self-affine
McMullen-Bedford carpet, we obtain an explicit formula for the dimension of the
graph of $X+f$ in terms of the generating pattern. In particular, we show that
it can be strictly bigger than the maximum of the Hausdorff dimension of the
graph of $f$ and that of $X$. Despite the random perturbation, the Minkowski
and Hausdorff dimension of the graph of $X+f$ can disagree.
