Following the recently accumulated information on the vibrational properties
of the Cu(001) surface acquired through single- and multiphonon He atom
scattering experiments and the concomitant theoretical investigations, we have
reexamined the properties of the Debye-Waller factor (DWF) characteristic of
the He \to Cu(001) collisions using the recently developed fully quantal and
three-dimensional model of inelastic He atom scattering from surfaces. We have
focused our attention on the role which the various He-surface model potentials
with their characteristic interaction parameters (range of the interaction,
momentum and energy transfer cut-offs etc.) employed in the interpretation of
the scattering data may play in determining the magnitude of the DWF. By
combining the He-Cu(001) potential whose repulsive and attractive components
are both allowed to vibrate with the substrate phonon density of states
encompassing anharmonic effects, we obtain the values of the DWF which agree
nicely with the experimental data without invoking additional fitting
parameters. On the other hand, by taking the phonon momentum transfer cut-off
Q_c as an adjustable parameter, as has been frequently exploited in the
literature, all the considered potentials can produce agreement with
experiments by varying Q_c. The magnitudes of such best fit Q_c values are
compared with those available in the literature and their physical significance
is discussed.
