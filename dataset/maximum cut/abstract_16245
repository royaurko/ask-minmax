We present optical and near-infrared spectral evolution of the Galactic nova
V5114 Sgr (2004) during few months after the outburst. We use multi-band
photometry and line intensities derived from spectroscopy to put constrains on
the distance and the physical conditions of the ejecta of V5114 Sgr. The nova
showed a fast decline (t_2 \simeq 11 days) and spectral features of FeII
spectroscopic class. It reached M_V = -8.7 \pm 0.2 mag at maximum light, from
which we derive a distance of 7700 \pm 700 kpc and a distance from the galactic
plane of about 800 pc. Hydrogen and Oxygen mass of the ejecta are measured from
emission lines, leading to 10^{-6} and 10^{-7} M_\odot, respectively. We
compute the filling factor of the ejecta to be in the range 0.1 -- 10^{-3} . We
found the value of the filling factor to decrease with time. The same is also
observed in other novae, then giving support to the idea that nova shells are
not homogeneously filled in, rather being the material clumped in relatively
higher density blobs less affected by the general expanding motion of the
ejecta.
