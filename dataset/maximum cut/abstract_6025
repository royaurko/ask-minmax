By using the maximum entropy principle with Tsallis entropy and under the
assumption that the gouge plays an active role in the triggering of
earthquakes, we obtain a functional dependence for energy distribution function
for earthquakes which fits very well with observations in the region of small
energies. This distribution function is related to the size distribution
function of fragments in the gouge.
