I propose that some of the most luminous planetary nebulae (PNs) are actually
proto-PNs, where a companion white dwarf (WD) accretes mass at a relatively
high rate from the post-asymptotic giant branch star that blew the nebula. The
WD sustains a continuous nuclear burning and ionizes the nebula. The WD is
luminous enough to make the dense nebula luminous in the [O III]5007 line, In
young stellar populations these WD accreting systems account for a small
fraction of [O III]-luminous PNs, but in old stellar populations these binaries
might account for most, or even all, of the [OIII]-luminous PNs. This might
explain the puzzling constant cutoff (maximum) [O III]5007 luminosity of the
planetary nebula luminosity function across different galaxy types.
