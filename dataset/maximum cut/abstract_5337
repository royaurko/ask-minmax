Transform Invariant Low-rank Textures (TILT) is a novel and powerful tool
that can effectively rectify a rich class of low-rank textures in 3D scenes
from 2D images despite significant deformation and corruption. The existing
algorithm for solving TILT is based on the alternating direction method (ADM).
It suffers from high computational cost and is not theoretically guaranteed to
converge to a correct solution. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to
speed up solving TILT, with guaranteed convergence. Our method is based on the
recently proposed linearized alternating direction method with adaptive penalty
(LADMAP). To further reduce computation, warm starts are also introduced to
initialize the variables better and cut the cost on singular value
decomposition. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real data
demonstrate that this new algorithm works much more efficiently and robustly
than the existing algorithm. It could be at least five times faster than the
previous method.
