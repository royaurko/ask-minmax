We present a first computation of the NNLO QCD cross section at the LHC for
the production of four leptons from a Higgs boson decaying into W bosons. We
study the cross section for a Higgs boson mass Mh = 165 GeV; around this value
a Standard Model Higgs boson decays almost exclusively into W-pairs. We apply
all nominal experimental cuts on the final state leptons and the associated jet
activity and study the magnitude of higher-order effects up to NNLO on all
kinematic variables which are constrained by experimental cuts. We find that
the magnitude of the higher-order corrections varies significantly with the
signal selection cuts. As a main result we give the value of the cross section
at NNLO with all selection cuts envisaged for the search for the Higgs boson.
