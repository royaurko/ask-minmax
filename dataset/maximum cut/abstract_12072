We study transport in normal metals in an external magnetic field. This
system exhibits an interplay between a transverse spin imbalance (spin Hall
effect) caused by the spin-orbit interaction, a Hall effect via the Lorentz
force, and spin precession due to the Zeeman effect. Diffusion equations for
spin and charge flow are derived. The spin and charge accumulations are
computed numerically in experimentally relevant thin film geometries. The
out-of-plane spin Hall potential is suppressed when the Larmor frequency is
larger than the spin-flip scattering rate. The in-plane spin Hall potential
vanishes at zero magnetic field and attains its maximum at a finite magnetic
field before spin precession starts to dominate. Spin-injection via
ferromagnetic contacts creates a transverse charge Hall effect that decays in a
finite magnetic field due to spin precession.
