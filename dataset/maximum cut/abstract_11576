Two classes of Gamma Ray Bursts have been identified so far, characterized by
T90 durations shorter and longer than approximately 2 seconds. It was shown
that the BATSE 3B data allow a good fit with three Gaussian distributions in
log T90. In the same Volume in ApJ. another paper suggested that the third
class of GRBs is may exist. Using the full BATSE catalog here we present the
maximum likelihood estimation, which gives us 0.5% probability to having only
two subclasses. The MC simulation confirms this probability.
