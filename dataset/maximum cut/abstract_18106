It is our conjecture that the variability of colors in a pathology image
effects the interpretation of pathology cases, whether it is diagnostic
accuracy, diagnostic confidence, or workflow efficiency. In this paper, digital
pathology images are analyzed to quantify the perceived difference in color
that occurs due to display aging, in particular a change in the maximum
luminance, white point, and color gamut. The digital pathology images studied
include diagnostically important features, such as the conspicuity of nuclei.
Three different display aging models are applied to images: aging of luminance
& chrominance, aging of chrominance only, and a stabilized luminance &
chrominance (i.e., no aging). These display models and images are then used to
compare conspicuity of nuclei using CIE deltaE2000, a perceptual color
difference metric. The effect of display aging using these display models and
images is further analyzed through a human reader study designed to quantify
the effects from a clinical perspective. Results from our reader study indicate
significant impact of aged displays on workflow as well as diagnosis as follow.
As compared to the originals (no-aging), slides with the effect of aging
simulated were significantly more difficult to read (p-value of 0.0005) and
took longer to score (p-value of 0.02). Moreover, luminance+chrominance aging
significantly reduced inter-session percent agreement of diagnostic scores
(p-value of 0.0418).
