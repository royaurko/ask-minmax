The radio-loud quasar PMN J0134-0931 was discovered to have an unusual
morphology during our search for gravitational lenses. In VLA and MERLIN
images, there are 5 compact components with maximum separation 681
millarcseconds. All of these components have the same spectral index from 5 GHz
to 43 GHz. In a VLBA image at 1.7 GHz, a curved arc of extended emission joins
two of the components in a manner suggestive of gravitational lensing. At least
two of the radio components have near-infrared counterparts. We argue that this
evidence implies that J0134-0931 is a gravitational lens, although we have not
been able to devise a plausible model for the foreground gravitational
potential. Like several other radio-loud lenses, the background source has an
extraordinarily red optical counterpart.
