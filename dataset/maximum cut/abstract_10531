The massive star formation properties of 55 Virgo Cluster and 29 isolated
S0-Scd bright (M(B) < -18) spiral galaxies are compared via analyses of R and
Halpha surface photometry and integrated fluxes as functions of Hubble type and
central R light concentration (bulge-to-disk ratio). In the median, the total
normalized massive star formation rates (NMSFRs) in Virgo Cluster spirals are
reduced by factors up to 2.5 compared to isolated spiral galaxies of the same
type or concentration, with a range from enhanced (up to 2.5 times) to strongly
reduced (up to 10 times). Within the inner 30% of the optical disk, Virgo
Cluster and isolated spirals have similar ranges in NMSFRs, with similar to
enhanced median NMSFRs for Virgo galaxies. NMSFRs in the outer 70% of the
optical disk are reduced in the median by factors up to 9 for Virgo Cluster
spirals, with more severely reduced star formation at progressively larger disk
radii. Thus the reduction in total star formation of Virgo Cluster spirals is
caused primarily by spatial truncation of the star-forming disks. The
correlation between HI deficiency and R light central concentration is much
weaker than the correlation between HI deficiency and Hubble type. ICM-ISM
stripping of the gas from spiral galaxies is likely responsible for the
truncated star-forming disks of Virgo Cluster spirals. This effect may be
responsible for a significant part of the morphology-density relationship.
