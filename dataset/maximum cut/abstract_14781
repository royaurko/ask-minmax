Let $G$ be a plane graph. A vertex-colouring $\varphi$ of $G$ is called {\em
facial non-repetitive} if for no sequence $r_1 r_2 \dots r_{2n}$, $n\geq 1$, of
consecutive vertex colours of any facial path it holds $r_i=r_{n+i}$ for all
$i=1,2,\dots,n$. A plane graph $G$ is {\em facial non-repetitively
$l$-choosable} if for every list assignment $L:V\rightarrow 2\sp{\mathbb{N}}$
with minimum list size at least $l$ there is a facial non-repetitive
vertex-colouring $\varphi$ with colours from the associated lists. The {\em
facial Thue choice number}, $\pi_{fl}(G)$, of a plane graph $G$ is the minimum
number $l$ such that $G$ is facial non-repetitively $l$-choosable. %In this
article we We use the so-called entropy compression method to show that
$\pi_{fl} (G)\le c \Delta$ for some absolute constant $c$ and $G$ a plane graph
with maximum degree $\Delta$. Moreover, we give some better (constant) upper
bounds on $\pi_{fl} (G)$ for special classes of plane graphs.
