This report concerns the energy of neutron-matter for densities below $0.15
fm^{-3}$ and temperatures at and below $10 MeV$. Separable NN-interactions are
obtained by inverse scattering from the experimental phase-shifts with
specified momentum cut-offs $\Lambda$. Results of Brueckner-Bloch-DeDomicis as
well as finite temperature Green's function calculations show independence of
cut-off for $\Lambda \geq 3$. Agreement with the low-density virial expansion
is found. Results of Hartree-Fock as well as second order calculations show
considerable $\Lambda$-dependence and the agreement with the virial expansion
is lost. The "best" first-order choice of $\Lambda$ is found to be $\sim 2.5
fm^{-1}$, which agrees with $V_{low k}$ studies. Reasonable agreement between
the second order and the Brueckner results is also found for this value of
$\Lambda$ except at low density. Only 2-body forces are used in this study.
