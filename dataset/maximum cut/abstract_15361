Based on the Weibull-G class (Bourguignon et al., 2014), we introduce and
study a new four-parameter continuous model called the Weibull
Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. We derive, various mathematical properties of
the new distribution including expansions for the density function, hazard
function, explicit expressions for the moments, moment generating function,
quantile function, order statistics and their moments, mean deviations and
reliability. We estimate the model parameters using the maximum likelihood
method of estimation and determine the observed information matrix. By means of
two real data sets, we illustrate the usefulness of the new distribution. For
these data, the new model provides a better fits than the beta
Birnbaum-Saunders, McDonald Birnbaum-Saunders, Kumaraswamy Birnbaum-Saunders,
exponentiated Birnbaum-Saunders and Birnbaum-Saunders models.
