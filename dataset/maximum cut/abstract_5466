Using the well-known ``displace, cut and reflect'' method we construct thin
disks made of a perfect fluid in presence of a magnetic field. The models are
based in a magnetic Reissner-Nordstrom metric of Einstein-Maxwell equations for
a conformastatic spacetime. The influence of the magnetic field on the matter
properties of the disk are analyzed. We also study the motion of charged test
particles around the disks. We construct models of perfect fluid disks
satisfying all the energy conditions.
