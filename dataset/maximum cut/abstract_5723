Attempts to extend the capillary-wave theory of fluid interfacial
fluctuations to microscopic wavelengths, by introducing an effective
wave-vector ($q$) dependent surface tension $\sigma_\text{eff}(q)$, have
encountered difficulties. There is no consensus as to even the shape of
$\sigma_\text{eff}(q)$. By analysing a simple density functional model of the
liquid-gas interface, we identify different schemes for separating microscopic
observables into background and interfacial contributions. In order for the
backgrounds of the density-density correlation function and local structure
factor to have a consistent and physically meaningful interpretation in terms
of weighted bulk gas and liquid contributions, the background of the total
structure factor must be characterised by a microscopic $q$-dependent length
$\zeta(q)$ not identified previously. The necessity of including the $q$
dependence of $\zeta(q)$ is illustrated explicitly in our model and has wider
implications, i.e. in typical experimental and simulation studies, an
indeterminacy in $\zeta(q)$ will always be present, reminiscent of the cut-off
used in capillary-wave theory. This leads inevitably to a large uncertainty in
the $q$ dependence of $\sigma_\text{eff}(q)$.
