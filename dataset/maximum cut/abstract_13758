We report evidence of nonequilibrium hot carriers extraction from graphene by
gate-dependent photocurrent study. Scanning photocurrent excited by femtosecond
pulse laser shows unusual gate dependence compared with continuous wave (CW)
laser excitation. Power dependence studies further confirm that the
photocarriers extracted at the metal/graphene contact are nonequilibrium hot
carriers. Hot carrier extraction is found to be most efficient near the Dirac
point where carrier lifetime reaches maximum. These observations not only
provide evidence of hot carrier extraction from graphene, but also open the
door for graphene based hot carrier optoelectronics.
