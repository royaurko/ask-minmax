Mutually unbiased weighing matrices (MUWM) are closely related to an
antipodal spherical code with 4 angles. In the present paper, we clarify the
relationship between MUWM and the spherical sets, and give the complete
solution about the maximum size of a set of MUWM of weight 4 for any order.
Moreover we describe some natural generalization of a set of MUWM from the
viewpoint of spherical codes, and determine several maximum sizes of the
generalized sets. They include an affirmative answer of the problem of Best,
Kharaghani, and Ramp.
