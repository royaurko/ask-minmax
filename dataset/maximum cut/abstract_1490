We prove the cut-off phenomenon in total variation distance for the Brownian
motions traced on the classical symmetric spaces of compact type, that is to
say: (1) the classical simple compact Lie groups: special orthogonal groups,
special unitary groups and compact symplectic groups; (2) the real, complex and
quaternionic Grassmannian varieties (including the real spheres and complex or
quaternionic projective spaces); (3) the spaces of structures: SU(n)/SO(n),
SO(2n)/U(n), SU(2n)/USp(n), and USp(n)/U(n). In each case, we give explicit
lower bounds for the total variation distance DTV(mu_t,Haar) if t < tcut-off =
a log n, and explicit upper bounds if t > tcut-off. This gives in particular an
answer to a question raised in recent papers by Chen and Saloff-Coste.
