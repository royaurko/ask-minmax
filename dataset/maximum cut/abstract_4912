Based on BHHRS and further sharpened by discussions with Gerry Brown that I
had in October 2008, we arrive at the present assessment of the dilepton saga,
namely, that dileptons become "blind" to changes in the vacuum structure of
chiral symmetry (such as, e.g., BR scaling at high temperature and/or at high
density and hence are {\em not} an appropriate probe for a signal for partial
or complete chiral restoration, contrary to what has been widely believed.
There, however, are a variety of indirect indications that the scaling notion
is qualitatively, if not quantitatively, valid and should work in various
low-energy nuclear phenomena, and it is fair to conclude that while there is no
direct evidence for the scaling notion, there is {\em none against} it either,
in a strong disagreement with what was claimed in CERN Courier November 2009. I
will touch briefly on certain observables that could give a clear-cut litmus
signal for the vacuum structure of chiral symmetry modified by temperature
and/or density.
