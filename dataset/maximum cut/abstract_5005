The article traces the way Einstein formulated the relation between energy
and mass in his work from 1905 to 1955. Einstein emphasized quite often that
the mass $m$ of a body is equivalent to its rest energy $E_0$. At the same time
he frequently resorted to the less clear-cut statement of equivalence of energy
and mass. As a result, Einstein's formula $E_0=mc^2$ still remains much less
known than its popular form, $E=mc^2$, in which $E$ is the total energy equal
to the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy of a freely moving body.
One of the consequences of this is the widespread fallacy that the mass of a
body increases when its velocity increases and even that this is an
experimental fact. As wrote the playwright A N Ostrovsky "Something must exist
for people, something so austere, so lofty, so sacrosanct that it would make
profaning it unthinkable."
