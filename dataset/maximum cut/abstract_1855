It is shown that the ratio of strange to non-strange particle production in
relativistic heavy ion collisions is expected to reach a maximum at beam
energies around 30 A.GeV in the lab frame. This maximum is unique to heavy ion
collisions, and has no equivalent in elementary particle collisions.
 The appearance of the maximum is due to the energy dependence of the chemical
freeze-out parameters and is clearly seen as a pronounced peak in the
Wroblewski factor as a function of the incident energy as well as in the
behavior of the K+/pi+ ratio. Below 30 A.GeV strange baryons contribute
strongly because of the very large value of the chemical potential muB.
 As the energy increases, the decrease of the baryon chemical potential coupled
with only moderate increases in the associated temperature causes a decline in
the relative number of strange baryons above energies of about 30 A.GeV leading
to very pronounced maxima in the Lambda/pi+ and Xi-/pi+ ratios.
