In this paper we study the isotropic realizability of a given regular
gradient field $\nabla u$ as an electric field, namely when $\nabla u$ is
solution of the equation $\div\left(\si\nabla u\right)=0$ for some isotropic
conductivity $\si>0$. The case of a function $u$ without critical point was
investigated in \cite{BMT} thanks to a gradient flow approach. The presence of
a critical point needs a specific treatment according to the behavior of the
dynamical system around the point. The case of a saddle point is the most
favorable and leads us to a characterization of the local isotropic
realizability through some boundedness condition involving the laplacian of $u$
along the gradient flow. The case of a sink or a source implies a strong
maximum principle under the same boundedness condition. However, when the
critical point is not hyperbolic the isotropic realizability is not generally
satisfied even piecewisely in the neighborhood of the point. The isotropic
realizability in the torus for periodic gradient fields is also discussed in
particular when the trajectories of the gradient system are bounded.
