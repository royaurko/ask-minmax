Hard spheres interacting through a square-well potential were simulated using
two different methods: Brownian Cluster Dynamics (BCD) and Event Driven
Brownian Dynamics (EDBD). The structure of the equilibrium states obtained by
both methods were compared and found to be almost the identical. Self diffusion
coefficients ($D$) were determined as a function of the interaction strength.
The same values were found using BCD or EDBD. Contrary the EDBD, BCD allows one
to study the effect of bond rigidity and hydrodynamic interaction within the
clusters. When the bonds are flexible the effect of attraction on $D$ is
relatively weak compared to systems with rigid bonds. $D$ increases first with
increasing attraction strength, and then decreases for stronger interaction.
Introducing intra-cluster hydrodynamic interaction weakly increases $D$ for a
given interaction strength. Introducing bond rigidity causes a strong decrease
of $D$ which no longer shows a maximum as function of the attraction strength.
