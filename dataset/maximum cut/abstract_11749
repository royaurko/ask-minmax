We report for the first time enhancement of the supercurrent by means of
injection in a mesoscopic three terminal planar SNSNS device made of Al on
GaAs. When a current is injected from one of the superconducting Al electrodes
at an injection bias $V=\Delta(T)/e$, the DC Josephson current between the
other two superconducting electrodes has a maximum, giving evidence for an
enhancement due to a non-equilibrium injection into bound Andreev states of the
underlying semiconductor. The effect persists to temperatures where the
equilibrium supercurrent has vanished.
