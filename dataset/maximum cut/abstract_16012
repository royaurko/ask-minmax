The unusual eruptive variable discovered in Monoceros in 2002 January
underwent dramatic photometric and spectroscopic changes in the months prior to
its 2002 June-August conjunction with the Sun. Optical and infrared (IR)
photometry obtained at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO)
between 2002 January and June (JD 2452280-440) is presented here in an analysis
of the star's post-outburst behaviour. The light curve indicated 3 eruptions
took place in 2002 January, February and March. SAAO echelle spectra obtained
in the week prior to the March maximum indicated the ejection of a new shell of
material. JHKL photometry obtained during 2002 April showed the development of
an IR excess due to the formation of a dust shell. The shell appears to be
largely responsible for the rapid fade in the optical flux during 2002
April-May (Delta V > 6 mag within 3 weeks). Blueing of the optical colours
during the decline is likely due either to the revealing of an emission line
region surrounding V838 Mon, or the unveiling of the progenitor or a
spatially-close early-type star.
