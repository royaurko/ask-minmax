In this paper, contributor uses set theory to construct a logic model of abstract
figure from binary relation. Based on the uniform quantified structure, contributor
gives two logic system for graph traversal and graph coloring respectively,
moreover shows a new method of cutting graph. Around this model, there are six
algorithms in this paper including exact graph traversal, Algebra calculation
of natural number, graph partition and graph coloring.
