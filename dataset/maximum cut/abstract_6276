We report on the R-band eclipse mapping analysis of high-speed photometry of
the dwarf nova EX Dra on the rise to the maximum of the November 1995 outburst.
The eclipse map shows a one-armed spiral structure of ~180 degrees in azimuth,
extending in radius from R ~0.2 to 0.43 R_{L1} (where R_{L1} is the distance
from the disk center to the inner Lagrangian point), that contributes about 22
per cent of the total flux of the eclipse map. The spiral structure is
stationary in a reference frame co-rotating with the binary and is stable for a
timescale of at least 5 binary orbits. The comparison of the eclipse maps on
the rise and in quiescence suggests that the outbursts of EX Dra may be driven
by episodes of enhanced mass-transfer from the secondary star. Possible
explanations for the nature of the spiral structure are discussed.
