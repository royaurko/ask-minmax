In this paper a reduced set of the partial differential wave equations valid
in the conversion layer close to O-mode cutoff surface and accounting for the
magnetic field 2D inhomogeneity with no restriction to an angle between the
toroidal direction and the magnetic field direction is derived. An integral
representation of a solution to the derived set of equation is given. For the
particular case of small angle between O mode cut-off surface and X mode
cut-off surface an explicit expressions for both the electric field components
and the conversion coefficients are obtained and its properties are considered
in details.
