The program {\tt TOPAZ0} is designed for computing $Z^0$ parameters,
de-convoluted and QED-dressed cross sections and forward-backward asymmetries
of $e^+ e^-$ annihilation into fermion pairs and of Bhabha scattering around
the $Z^0$ peak, over both a completely inclusive experimental set-up and a
realistic one, i.e. with cuts on acollinearity, energy or invariant mass and
angular acceptance of the outgoing fermions. The new version, 2.0, offers the
possibility of imposing different experimental cuts on cross sections and
forward-backward asymmetries in a single run, and includes radiative
corrections whose effect can become relevant in view of the present and
foreseen experimental accuracy. Moreover, an additional option is included,
which allows an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty due to unknown
higher-order effects, both of electroweak and QCD origin. With respect to the
version 1.0, the code is available in the form of {\tt SUBROUTINE}, in order to
render more viable the use of the program for aims not planned by the {\tt
TOPAZ0} package itself.
