Problem of finding an optimal upper bound for {\chi} of (3 Times K1)-free
graphs is still open and pretty hard. It was proved by Choudum et al that upper
bound on the {\chi} of {3 Times K1, {2 Times K1 + (K2 UNION K1)}-free graphs is
2{\omega}. We improve this by proving that if G is {3 Times K1, {2 Times K1 +
(K2 UNION K1)}-free, then {\chi} less than or equal to 3{\omega} divided by 2
for {\omega} not equal to 5, and {\chi} less than or equal to 8 for {\omega} =
5 where {\omega} is the size of a maximum clique in G. We also give examples of
extremal graphs.
