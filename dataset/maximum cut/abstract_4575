We apply the method of unitary transformations to a model two-nucleon
potential and construct from it an effective potential in a subspace of momenta
below a given cut-off $\Lambda$. The S-matrices in the full space and in the
subspace are shown to be identical. We solve numerically the Schr\"odinger
equation in the small momentum space and recover exactly the bound and
scattering states of the full theory. We then expand the heavy repulsive meson
exchange of the effective potential in a series of local contact terms and
discuss the question of naturalness of the corresponding coupling constants.
Using our exact effective theory we address further issues related to the
chiral perturbation theory approach of the two-nucleon system. The coordinate
space representation of the effective potential is also considered.
