An holographic f(R) gravity model of dark energy is proposed. The
correspondence between the f(R) geometrical effective energy density with the
holographic density, allows the reconstruction of the f(R) gravity in flat FRW
background in the Einstein frame. The proposed infrared cut-off for the
holographic energy density depends on two parameters which are fit using the
luminosity versus redshift data, allowing a suitable reconstruction in two
representative cases of the EoS parameter: for $\omega>-1$ and $\omega<-1$.
