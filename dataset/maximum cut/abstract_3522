Two high-resolution optical spectra of the R Coronae Borealis star UW Cen in
decline are discussed. A spectrum from mid-1992 when the star had faded by
three magnitudes shows just a few differences with the spectrum at maximum
light. The ubiquitous sharp emission lines seen in R CrB at a similar drop
below maximum light are absent. In contrast, a spectrum from mid-2002 when the
star was five magnitudes below maximum light shows an array of sharp emission
lines and a collection of broad emission lines. Comparisons are made with
spectra of R CrB obtained during the deep 1995-1996 minimum. The many common
features are discussed in terms of a torus-jet geometry.
