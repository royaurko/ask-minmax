We investigate charged tracks signals of a supersymmetric scenario, where the
lighter stop is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). It is
found that such an NLSP is stable on the scale of the detector at the LHC if
one has a right-chiral sneutrino as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP).
After identifying some benchmark points in the parameter space of a
supergravity scenario with non-universal scalar masses, we study a few specific
classes of signals, namely, stop pair production and gluino pair production
followed by each decaying into a stop and a top. It is shown that proper
kinematic cuts remove the backgrounds in each case, and, while a few months'
worth of data is sufficient to have copious events in the first case, one may
require 300 $fb^{-1}$ for the other. One can also aspire to reconstruct the
gluino mass, using the `visible' stable NLSP tracks.
