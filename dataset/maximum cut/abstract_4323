The discovery potential of the LHC is investigated for the minimal
anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (mAMSB) scenario, using the ATLAS fast
detector simulator, including track reconstruction and particle identification.
Generic supersymmetry search cuts are used to map the 5-sigma (and >=10 event)
discovery contours in the m_0 - m_3/2 plane. With 100 inverse fb of integrated
luminosity the search will reach up to 2.8 TeV in the squark mass and 2.1 TeV
in the gluino mass. We generalise a kinematical variable and demonstrate that
it is sensitive to the small chargino-LSP mass splitting characteristic of AMSB
models. By identifying tracks from chargino decays we show that the Wino-like
nature of the LSP can be determined for a wide range of chargino lifetimes.
