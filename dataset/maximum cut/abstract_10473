In this paper, the self-propelled motion of Leidenfrost droplets on ratchet
surfaces is numerically investigated with a thermal multiphase lattice
Boltzmann model with liquid-vapor phase change. The capability of the model for
simulating evaporation is validated via the D2 law. Using the model, we first
study the performances of Leidenfrost droplets on horizontal ratchet surfaces.
It is numerically shown that the motion of self-propelled Leidenfrost droplets
on ratchet surfaces is owing to the asymmetry of the ratchets and the vapor
flows beneath the droplets. It is found that the Leidenfrost droplets move in
the direction toward the slowly inclined side from the ratchet peaks, which
agrees with the direction of droplet motion in experiments [Linke et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett., 2006, 96, 154502]. Moreover, the influences of the ratchet aspect
ratio are investigated. For the considered ratchet surfaces, a critical value
of the ratchet aspect ratio is approximately found, which corresponds to the
maximum droplet moving velocity. Furthermore, the processes that the
Leidenfrost droplets climb uphill on inclined ratchet surfaces are also
studied. Numerical results show that the maximum inclination angle at which a
Leidenfrost droplet can still climb uphill successfully is affected by the
initial radius of the droplet.
