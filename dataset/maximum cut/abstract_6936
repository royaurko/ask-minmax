An unbinned maximum likelihood analysis of CDMS low-energy data reveals a
strong preference (5.7 sigma C.L.) for a model containing an exponential excess
of events in the nuclear recoil band, when compared to the null hypothesis. We
comment on the possible origin of such an excess, establishing a comparison
with anomalies in other dark matter experiments. A recent annual modulation
search in CDMS data is shown to be insufficiently sensitive to test a dark
matter origin for this excess.
