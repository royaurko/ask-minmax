We present a numerical study of solutions to the generalized
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations with critical and supercritical nonlinearity
for localized initial data with a single minimum and single maximum. In the
cases with blow-up, we use a dynamic rescaling to identify the type of the
singularity. We present a discussion of the observed blow-up scenarios.
