We report on RXTE observations of the microquasar XTE J1550-564 during a ~70
day outburst in April-June 2000. We study the evolution of the PCA+HEXTE
spectra over the outburst. The source transited from an initial Low Hard State
(LS), to an Intermediate State (IS), and then back to the LS. The source shows
an hysteresis effect similar to what is observed in other sources, favoring a
common origin for the state transitions in soft X-ray transients. The first
transition occurs at a ~ constant 2-200 keV flux, which probably indicates a
change in the relative importance of the emitting media. The second transition
is more likely driven by a drop in the mass accretion rate.
 In both LS, the spectra are characterized by the presence of a strong
power-law tail (Compton corona) with a variable high energy cut-off. During the
IS, the spectra show the presence of a ~0.8 keV thermal component (accretion
disk). We discuss the apparently independent evolution of the two media, and
show that right after the X-ray maximum on MJD 51662, the decrease of the
source luminosity is due to a decrease of the power-law luminosity, at a
constant disk luminosity. This, together with the detection of radio emission
(with a spectrum typical of optically thin synchrotron emission), may suggest
that the corona is ejected and further detected as a discrete radio ejection.
