We review techniques for more efficient computation of perturbative
scattering amplitudes in gauge theory, in particular tree and one-loop
multi-parton amplitudes in QCD. We emphasize the advantages of (1) using color
and helicity information to decompose amplitudes into smaller gauge-invariant
pieces, and (2) exploiting the analytic properties of these pieces, namely
their cuts and poles. Other useful tools include recursion relations, special
gauges and supersymmetric rearrangements.
