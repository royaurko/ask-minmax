We present numerical simulations of high field transport in both suspended
and deposited armchair graphene nanoribbon (A-GNR) on HfO2 substrate. Drift
velocity in suspended GNR does not saturate at high electric field (F), but
rather decreases, showing a maximum for F=10 kV/cm. Deposition on HfO2 strongly
degrades the drift velocity by up to a factor of 10 with respect to suspended
GNRs in the low-field regime, whereas at high fields drift velocity approaches
the intrinsic value expected in suspended GNRs. Even in the assumption of
perfect edges, the obtained mobility is far behind what expected in
two-dimensional graphene, and is further reduced by surface optical phonons.
