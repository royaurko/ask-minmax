Experimental prospects for studying at the LHC photon-proton interactions at
center of mass energies up to and above 1 TeV are discussed. Cross sections are
presented for many electroweak and beyond the Standard Model processes.
Selection strategies based on photon interaction tagging techniques are
discussed. Assuming a typical LHC multipurpose detector, the production of
single top associated to a W, and anomalous top signals and their irreducible
backgrounds are presented after applying detector acceptance cuts. The
associated photoproduction of Higgs and W bosons has a typical cross section of
20 fb. The possibility of observing this reaction is investigated for
topologies with signal-to-noise ratio close to unity.
