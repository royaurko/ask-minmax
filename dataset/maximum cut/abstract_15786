In June-July,1998 the Konus-Wind burst spectrometer observed a series of
bursts from the new soft gamma repeater SGR1627-41. Time histories and energy
spectra of the bursts have been studied, revealing fluences and peak fluxes in
the ranges of 3x10^{-7} - 7.5x10^{-6} erg cm^{-2} and 10^{-5} - 10^{-4}erg
cm^{-2}/s respectively. One event, 18 June 6153.5sUT stands out dramatically
from this series. Its fluence is ~7x10^{-4} erg cm^{-2} and peak flux
~2x10^{-2} erg cm^{-2}/s. These values from a source at a distance of 5.8 kpc
yield an energy output of ~3x10^{42}erg and maximum luminosity of ~8x10^{43}
erg/s, similar to the values for the famous March 5, 1979 and August27,1998
events. In terms of energy, this event is another giant outburst seen in a
third SGR! However, this very energetic burst differs significantly from the
other giant outbursts. It exhibits no separate initial pulse with a fast rise
time, no extended tail, and no pulsations. It is rather similar to ordinary
repeated bursts but is a few hundred times stronger in intensity. According to
the magnetar model by Thompson and Duncan (1995) such a burst may be initiated
by a strong starquake when a crust fracture propagates over the whole surface
of a neutron star.
