In this paper we introduce a new flexible class of distributions with bounded
support, called reflected Generalized Topp-Leone Power Series (rGTL-PS),
obtained by compounding the reflected Generalized Topp-Leone (van Drop and
Kotz, 2006) and the family of Power Series distributions. The proposed class
includes, as special cases, some new distributions with limited support such as
the rGTL-Logarithmic, the rGTL-Geometric, the rGTL-Poisson and rGTL-Binomial.
This work is an attempt to partially fill a gap regarding the presence, in the
literature, of continuous distributions with bounded support, which instead
appear to be very useful in many real contexts, included the reliability. Some
properties of the class, including moments, hazard rate and quantile are
investigated. Moreover, the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters are
examined and the observed Fisher information matrix provided. Finally, in order
to show the usefulness of the new class, some applications to real data are
reported.
