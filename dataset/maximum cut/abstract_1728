The semiregular variable Z UMa experienced a particularly deep minimum at the
end of March 2014 followed by a three month rise to maximum. The rise and
subsequent decline were followed with low resolution (R~1000) spectroscopy,
possibly for the first time. The spectral type of Z UMa varied between M7III at
minimum and M4III at maximum while the bright hydrogen emission lines reported
by observers during the last century now appear relatively weak and transitory.
