We compute the spectrum of relic gravitons in a model of string cosmology. In
the low- and in the high-frequency limits we reproduce known results. The full
spectrum, however, also displays a series of oscillations which could give a
characteristic signature at the planned LIGO/VIRGO detectors. For special
values of the parameters of the model the signal reaches its maximum already at
frequencies accessible to LIGO and VIRGO and it is close to the sensitivity of
first generation experiments.
