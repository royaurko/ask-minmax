We study a model for the gel degradation by an enzyme, where the gel is
schematized as a cubic lattice, and the enzyme as a random walker, that cuts
the bonds over which it passes. The model undergoes a (reverse) percolation
transition, which for low density of enzymes falls in a universality class
different from random percolation. In particular we have measured a gel
fraction critical exponent beta=1.0+-0.1, in excellent agreement with
experiments made on the real system.
