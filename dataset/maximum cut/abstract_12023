We report on magnetic and electrical transport properties of Sb2-xCrxTe3
single crystals with 0 <= x <= 0.095 over temperatures from 2 K to 300 K. A
ferromagnetic state develops in these crystals at low temperatures with Curie
temperatures that are proportional to x (for x > 0.014), attaining a maximum
value of 20 K for x = 0.095. Hysteresis below TC for applied field parallel to
the c-axis is observed in both magnetization and Hall effect measurements.
Magnetic as well as transport data indicate that Cr takes the 3+ (3d3) valence
state, substituting for antimony in the host lattice structure, and does not
significantly affect the background hole concentration. Analysis of the
anomalous Hall effect reveals that skew scattering is responsible for its
presence. These results broaden the scope of ferromagnetism in the V2-VI3
diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) and in ferromagnetic DMS structures
generally
