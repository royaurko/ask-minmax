In this paper we discuss the broad-band X-ray characteristics of a complete
sample of 36 type 1 AGN, detected by INTEGRAL in the 20-40 keV band above the
5.5sigma level. We present, for all the objects in the sample, the broad-band
(1-110 keV) spectral analysis obtained by using INTEGRAL/Swift-BAT observations
together with XMM-Newton, Chandra, ASCA and Swift/XRT data. We also present the
general average properties of the sample, i.e. the distribution of photon
indices, high energy cut-offs, reflection fractions and absorption properties,
together with an in-depth analysis of their parameter space. We find that the
average Seyfert 1 power law has an index of 1.7 with a dispersion of 0.2. The
mean cut-off energy is at around 100 keV, with most objects displaying Ec in
the range 50-150 keV; the average amount of Compton reflection is 1.5 with a
typical dispersion of 0.7. We do not find any convincing correlation between
the various parameters, an indication that our analysis is not strongly
dependent by the interplay between them. Finally, we investigate how the
results presented in this work fit into current frameworks for AGN spectral
modeling and Cosmic Diffuse X-ray Background synthesis models.
