[ABRIDGED] We report the results of a 944-epoch survey for transient sources
with archival data from the Very Large Array spanning 22 years with a typical
epoch separation of 7 days. Observations were obtained at 5 or 8.4 GHz for a
single field of view with a full-width at half-maximum of 8.6' and 5.1',
respectively, and achieved a typical point-source detection threshold at the
beam center of ~300 microJy per epoch. Ten transient sources were detected with
a significance threshold such that only one false positive would be expected.
Of these transients, eight were detected in only a single epoch. Two transients
were too faint to be detected in individual epochs but were detected in
two-month averages. None of the ten transients was detected in longer-term
averages or associated with persistent emission in the deep image produced from
the combination of all epochs. The cumulative rate for the short timescale
radio transients above 370 microJy at 5 and 8.4 GHz is 0.07 < R < 40 deg^-2
yr^-1, where the uncertainty is due to the unknown duration of the transients,
20 min < t_char < 7 days. A two-epoch survey for transients will detect 1.5 +/-
0.4 transient per square degrees above a flux density of 370 microJy. Two
transients are associated with galaxies at z=0.040 and z=0.249. These may be
similar to the peculiar Type Ib/c radio supernova SN 1998bw associated with GRB
980428. Six transients have no counterparts in the optical or infrared (R=27,
Ks=18). The hosts and progenitors of these transients are unknown.
