We give an effective method for controlling the maximum number of limit
cycles of some planar polynomial systems. It is based on a suitable choice of a
Dulac function and the application of the well-known Bendixson-Dulac Criterion
for multiple connected regions. The key point is a new approach to control the
sign of the functions involved in the criterion. The method is applied to
several examples.
