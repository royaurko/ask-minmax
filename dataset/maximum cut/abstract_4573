The cross sections of the reaction $pp \to N K Y$ for $K^+$ or $K^0$ mesons
and $\Lambda$ or $\Sigma$ hyperons are calculated within the boson exchange
model including pion and kaon exchange diagrams. We analyze the dependence of
the results on the accuracy of the input $\pi N$ amplitude. By fixing the $\pi
NN $ coupling constant and the cut-off parameter ${\Lambda}_{\pi}$ at the $\pi
NN$ vertex we calculate the contribution from the kaon exchange diagram and
obtain the ratio of the $KN \Lambda $ and $KN \Sigma $ coupling constants by a
fit to the experimental data. This ratio is in a good agreement with the SU(6)
prediction. Our calculated total cross sections for the different reaction
channels are fitted by simple expressions and compared with other
parameterizations used in the literature. Furthermore, the gross features of
the production cross section close to threshold are discussed.
