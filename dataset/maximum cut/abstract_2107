We show that at arbitrary value of the scalar self coupling and small Yukawa
coupling $y$ the 2d Higgs-Yukawa model with Z(2) symmetry remains in the broken
phase and the model is asymptotically free: $y \to 0$ as the cut-off $\Lambda
\to \infty$. This is in agreement with a recent conjecture based on numerical
simulation results.
