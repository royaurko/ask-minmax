It is demonstrated that the US economy has on the long-term in reality been
governed by the Keynesian approach to economics independent of the current
official economical policy. This is done by calculating the two-point
correlation function between the fluctuations of the DJIA and the US public
debt. We find that the origin of this condition is mainly related to the wars
that the USA has fought during the time period investigated. Wars mean a large
influx of public money into the economy, thus as a consequence creating a
significant economical upturn in the DJIA. A reason for this straight-cut
result of our analysis, is that very few wars have been fought on US-territory
and those that have, were in the 18th century, when the partial destruction of
cities, factories, railways and so on, was more limited and with less effect on
the over-all economy.
