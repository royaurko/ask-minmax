In 1967, Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal asked the question: Does there exist a
$K_4$-free graph that is not the union of two triangle-free graphs? Finding
such a graph involves solving a special case of the classical Ramsey arrowing
operation. Folkman proved the existence of these graphs in 1970, and they are
now called Folkman graphs. Erd\H{o}s offered \$100 for deciding if one exists
with less than $10^{10}$ vertices. This problem remained open until 1988 when
Spencer, in a seminal paper using probabilistic techniques, proved the
existence of a Folkman graph of order $3\times 10^9$ (after an erratum),
without explicitly constructing it. In 2008, Dudek and R\"{o}dl developed a
strategy to construct new Folkman graphs by approximating the maximum cut of a
related graph, and used it to improve the upper bound to 941. We improve this
bound first to 860 using their approximation technique and then further to 786
with the MAX-CUT semidefinite programming relaxation as used in the
Goemans-Williamson algorithm.
