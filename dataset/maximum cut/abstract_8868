A computational method is developed to work on an inverse equilibrium problem
with an interest towards applications with protein folding. In general, we are
given a set of equilibrium confgiurations and want to derive the most probable
potential function that results in these configurations. The method is applied
to polymer simulations and a simple model of proteins using protein structures
obtained from the Protein Data Bank http://www.rcsb.org/pdb The resulting
energy function is tested on a few decoy sets with limited success.
