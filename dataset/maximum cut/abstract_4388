We derive analytical expressions for the shape of the invariant mass
distributions of massless Standard Model endproducts in cascade decays
involving massive New Physics (NP) particles, D -> Cc -> Bbc -> Aabc, where the
final NP particle A in the cascade is unobserved and where two of the particles
a, b, c may be indistinguishable. Knowledge of these expressions can improve
the determination of NP parameters at the LHC. The shape formulas are
composite, but contain nothing more complicated than logarithms of simple
expressions. We study the effects of cuts, final state radiation and detector
effects on the distributions through Monte Carlo simulations, using a
supersymmetric model as an example. We also consider how one can deal with the
width of NP particles and with combinatorics from the misidentification of
final state particles. The possible mismeasurements of NP masses through `feet'
in the distributions are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate how the effects of
different spin configurations can be included in the distributions.
