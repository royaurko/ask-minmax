We study the continuity of the maximum-entropy inference map for two
observables in finite dimensions. We prove that the continuity is equivalent to
the strong continuity of the set-valued inverse numerical range map. This gives
a continuity condition in terms of analytic eigenvalue functions which implies
that discontinuities are very rare. It shows also that the continuity of the
MaxEnt inference method is independent of the prior state.
