Global SLS-resolution and SLG-resolution are two representative mechanisms
for top-down evaluation of the well-founded semantics of general logic
programs. Global SLS-resolution is linear for query evaluation but suffers from
infinite loops and redundant computations. In contrast, SLG-resolution resolves
infinite loops and redundant computations by means of tabling, but it is not
linear. The principal disadvantage of a non-linear approach is that it cannot
be implemented using a simple, efficient stack-based memory structure nor can
it be easily extended to handle some strictly sequential operators such as cuts
in Prolog.
  In this paper, we present a linear tabling method, called SLT-resolution, for
top-down evaluation of the well-founded semantics. SLT-resolution is a
substantial extension of SLDNF-resolution with tabling. Its main features
include: (1) It resolves infinite loops and redundant computations while
preserving the linearity. (2) It is terminating, and sound and complete w.r.t.
the well-founded semantics for programs with the bounded-term-size property
with non-floundering queries. Its time complexity is comparable with
SLG-resolution and polynomial for function-free logic programs. (3) Because of
its linearity for query evaluation, SLT-resolution bridges the gap between the
well-founded semantics and standard Prolog implementation techniques. It can be
implemented by an extension to any existing Prolog abstract machines such as
WAM or ATOAM.
