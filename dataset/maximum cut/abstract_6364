The phase diagram of the unconstrained $t-J$ model is calculated using the
random phase approximation. It is found that the extended $s$ and the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-channels are {\em not} degenerate near half filling. Extended
$s$-pairing with a low $T_c$ occurs only for a band containing less then 0.4
electrons or holes per unit cell, whereas in a large region around half-filling
$d$-wave pairing is the only stable superconducting solution. At half filling
superconductivity is suppressed due to the formation of the anti-ferromagnetic
Mott-Hubbard insulating state. By extending the analysis to the unconstrained
$t-t'-J$ model, it is proven that, if a Fermi surface is assumed similar to the
one that is known to exist in cuprous oxide superconductors, the highest
superconducting $T_c$ is reached for about $0.7$ electron per site, whereas the
anti-ferromagnetic solution still occurs for $1$ electron per site. It is
shown, that the maximum $d$-wave superconducting mean field transition
temperature is half the maximum value that the Ne\`el temperature can have in
the Mott-insulating state.
