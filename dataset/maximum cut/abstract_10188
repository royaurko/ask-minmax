Following the spirit of a recent work of one of the contributors (J. Phys. A:
Math. Theor. 44 (2011) 045301), the essential structure of the generalized
Pauli group of a qubit-qu$d$it, where $d = 2^{k}$ and an integer $k \geq 2$, is
recast in the language of a finite geometry. A point of such geometry is
represented by the maximum set of mutually commuting elements of the group and
two distinct points are regarded as collinear if the corresponding sets have
exactly $2^{k} - 1$ elements in common. The geometry comprises $2^{k} - 1$
copies of the generalized quadrangle of order two ("the doily") that form
$2^{k-1} - 1$ pencils arranged into a remarkable nested configuration. This
nested structure reflects the fact that maximum sets of mutually commuting
elements are of two different kinds (ordinary and exceptional) and exhibits an
intriguing alternating pattern: the subgeometry of the exceptional points of
the $(k+2)$-case is found to be isomorphic to the full geometry of the
$k$-case. It should be stressed, however, that these generic properties of the
qubit-qudit geometry were inferred from purely computer-handled cases of $k =
2, 3, 4$ and 5 only and, therefore, their rigorous, computer-free proof for $k
\geq 6$ still remains a mathematical challenge.
