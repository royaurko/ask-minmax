The depth of maximum for extensive air showers measured by Fly's Eye and
Yakutsk experiments is analysed. The analysis depends on the hadronic
interaction model that determine cascade development. The novel feature found
in the cascading process for nucleus-nucleus collisions at high energies leads
to a fast increase of the inelasticity in heavy nuclei interactions without
changing the hadron-hadron interaction properties. This effects the development
of the extensive air showers initiated by heavy primaries. The detailed
calculations were performed using the recently developed geometrical multichain
model and the CORSIKA simulation code. The agreement with data on average depth
of shower maxima, the falling slope of the maxima distribution, and these
distribution widths are found for the very heavy cosmic ray mass spectrum
(slightly heavier than expected in the diffusion model at about 3*10**17 eV and
similar to the Fly's Eye composition at this energy).
