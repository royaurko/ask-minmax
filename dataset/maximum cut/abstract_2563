We use the "closed point sieve" to prove a variant of a Bertini theorem over
finite fields. Specifically, given a smooth quasi-projective subscheme X of P^n
of dimension m over F_q, and a closed subscheme Z in P^n such that Z intersect
X is smooth of dimension l, we compute the fraction of homogeneous polynomials
vanishing on Z that cut out a smooth subvariety of X. The fraction is positive
if m>2l.
