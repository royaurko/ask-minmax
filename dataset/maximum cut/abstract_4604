The feasibility to study the in-medium properties of the omega meson in
photon induced reactions on nuclei is investigated by means of a semiclassical
transport model. The calculations are dedicated to an experiment presently
being analyzed by the TAPS/Crystal Barrel collaborations. A full
coupled-channel treatment of final state interactions allows a quantitative
analysis of the influence of absorption and elastic scattering of the produced
hadrons and likewise the application of kinematic cuts on the observables.
Within the scope of our calculations, the preliminary data by the TAPS/Crystal
Barrel collaborations indeed seem to indicate a modification of the isoscalar
spectral density in the strongly interacting environment.
