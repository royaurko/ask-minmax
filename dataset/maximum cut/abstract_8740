We consider tunneling processes in QFT induced by collisions of elementary
particles. We propose a semiclassical method for estimating the probability of
these processes in the limit of very high collision energy. As an illustration,
we evaluate the maximum probability of induced tunneling between different
vacua in a (1+1)-dimensional scalar model with boundary interaction.
