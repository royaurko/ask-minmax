We have performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations to study noise
power spectra of density and potential energy fluctuations of a Lennard-Jones
model of a fluid in the supercritical region. Emanating from the liquid-vapor
critical point, there is a locus of isobaric specific heat maxima, called the
Widom line, which is often regarded as an extension of the liquid-vapor
coexistence line. Our simulation results show that the noise power spectrum of
the density fluctuations on the Widom line of the liquid-vapor transition
exhibits three distinct $1/f^{\gamma}$ behaviors with exponents $\gamma$= 0,
1.2 and 2, depending on the frequency $f$. We find that the intermediate
frequency region with an exponent $\gamma \sim$ 1 appears as the temperature
approaches the Widom temperature from above or below. On the other hand, we do
not find three distinct regions of $1/f^{\gamma}$ in the power spectrum of the
potential energy fluctuations on the Widom line. Furthermore, we find that the
power spectra of both the density and potential energy fluctuations at low
frequency have a maximum on the Widom line, suggesting that the noise power can
provide an alternative signature of the Widom line.
