Probabilistic approaches for tensor factorization aim to extract meaningful
structure from incomplete data by postulating low rank constraints. Recently,
variational Bayesian (VB) inference techniques have successfully been applied
to large scale models. This paper presents full Bayesian inference via VB on
both single and coupled tensor factorization models. Our method can be run even
for very large models and is easily implemented. It exhibits better prediction
performance than existing approaches based on maximum likelihood on several
real-world datasets for missing link prediction problem.
