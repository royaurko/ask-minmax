A new type of field emission display(FED) based on an edge-enhance electron
emission from metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) thin film structure is
proposed. The electrons produced by an avalanche breakdown in the semiconductor
near the edge of a top metal electrode are initially injected to the thin film
of an insulator with a negative electron affinity (NEA), and then are injected
into vacuum in proximity to the top electrode edge. The condition for the
deep-depletition breakdown near the edge of the top metal electrode is
analytically found in terms of ratio of the insulator thickness to the maximum
(breakdown) width of the semiconductor depletition region: this ratio should be
less than 2/(3 \pi - 2) = 0.27. The influence of a neighboring metal electrode
and an electrode thickness on this condition are analyzed. Different practical
schemes of the proposed display with a special reference to M/CaF_2/Si
structure are considered.
