We present empirical relations that connect the dimensionless ratios of
fermion masses for the charged lepton, up-type quark and down-type quark
sectors. Explaining these relations from first principles imposes strong
constraints on the search for the theory of flavor. We present a simple set of
normalized Yukawa matrices, with only two real parameters and one complex
phase, which accounts with precision for these mass relations and for the CKM
matrix elements and also suggests a simpler parametrization of the CKM matrix.
The proposed Yukawa matrices accommodate the measured CP-violation, giving a
particular relation between standard model CP-violating phases, beta=Arg(2 -
exp^{-i*gamma}). According to this relation, the measured value of beta is
close to the maximum value that can be reached. Finally, the particular mass
relations with the charged lepton sector find their simplest explanation in the
context of grand unified models through the use of the Georgi-Jarlskog factor.
