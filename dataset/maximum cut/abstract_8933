The holographic upper bound on entropy is applied to the gravitational action
associated with the non-relativistic contraction of a nebula. A critical radius
is identified, as a function of the initial radius and mass, for which the
number of bits associated with the action would equal the maximum number of
bits allowed to the body. The gravitational action of a typical star
approximately saturates the holographic bound, perhaps suggesting a physical
link between holographic principles and astrophysical processes.
