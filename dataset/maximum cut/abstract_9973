We report observations of SN 2004dt obtained with the Very Large Telescope of
the European Southern Observatory on August 13.30, 2004 when the supernova was
more than a week before optical maximum. SN 2004dt showed strong lines of
\ion{O}{1}, \ion{Mg}{2}, \ion{Si}{2}, and \ion{Ca}{2} with typical velocities
of absorption minimum around 17,000 \kms. The line profiles show material
moving at velocities as high as 25,000 \kms in these lines. The observations
also reveal absorption lines from \ion{S}{2} and \ion{Si}{3} with a velocity of
only 11,000 \kms. The highest velocity in the \ion{S}{2} features can be traced
no higher than 15,000 \kms, much lower than those of O, Mg, Si, and Ca. SN
2004dt has a polarization spectrum unlike any previously observed. The
variation of the polarization across some \ion{Si}{2} lines approaches 2%,
making SN 2004dt the most highly polarized SN Ia ever observed. In contrast,
the strong line of O I at 777.4 nm shows little or no polarization signature.
The degree of polarization points to a richly-structured partially burned
silicon layer with substantial departure from spherical symmetry. A geometry
that would account for the observations is one in which the distribution of
oxygen is essentially spherically symmetric, but with bubbles of
intermediate-mass elements with significant opacity within the oxygen
substrate.
