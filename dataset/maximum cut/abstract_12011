The inelastic scattering intensities of glasses and amorphous materials has a
maximum at a low frequency, the so called Boson peak. Under applied hydrostatic
pressure, $P$, the Boson peak frequency, $\omega_{\rm b}$, is shifted upwards.
We have shown previously that the Boson peak is created as a result of a
vibrational instability due to the interaction of harmonic quasi localized
vibrations (QLV). Applying pressure one exerts forces on the QLV. These shift
the low frequency part of the excess spectrum to higher frequencies. For low
pressures we find a shift of the Boson peak linear in $P$, whereas for high
pressures the shift is $\propto P^{1/3}$. Our analytics is supported by
simulation. The results are in agreement with the existing experiments.
