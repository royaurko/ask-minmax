The time decay of the thermo-remanent magnetization (TRM) in Fe-Cr giant
magnetoresistive (GMR) multilayers has been investigated. The magnetization in
these multilayers relaxes as a function of time after being cooled in a small
magnetic field of 100 Oe to a low temperature and then the magnetic field is
switched off. Low-field ($<$ 500 Oe) magnetization studies of these samples
have shown hysteresis. This spin-glass-like behavior may originate from
structural imperfections at the interfaces and in the bulk. We find that the
magnetization relaxation is logarithmic. Here the magnetic viscosity is found
to increase first with increasing temperature, then it reaches a maximum around
T$_g$, and then it decreases with increasing temperature. This behavior is
different from that of conventional spin glasses where the logarithmic creep
rate is observed to increase with temperature. Power law also gives good fits
and it is better than the logarithmic fit at higher temperatures. The dynamical
effects of these multilayers are related to the relaxation of thermally blocked
superparamagnetic grains and magnetic domains in the film layers.
