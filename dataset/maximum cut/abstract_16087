Close-in extrasolar planets experience extreme tidal interactions with their
host stars. This may lead to a reduction of the planetary orbit and a spin-up
of stellar rotation. Tidal interactions have been computed for a number of
extrasolar planets in circular orbits within 0.06 AU, namely for OGLE-TR-56 b.
We compare our range of the tidal dissipation value with two dissipation models
from Sasselov (2003) and conclude that our choices are equivalent to these
models. However, applied to the planet OGLE-TR-56 b, we find in contrast to
Sasselov (2003) that this planet will spiral-in toward the host star in a few
billion years. We show that the average and maximum value of our range of
dissipation are equivalent to the linear and quadratic dissipation models of
Sasselov (2003). Due to limitations in the observational techniques, we do not
see a possibility to distinguish between the two dissipation models as outlined
by Sasselov (2003). OGLE-TR-56 b may therefore not serve as a test case for
dissipation models. The probable existence of OGLE-TR-3 b at 0.02 AU and the
discovery of OGLE-TR-113 b at 0.023 AU and OGLE-TR-132 b at 0.03 AU may also
counter Sasselovs (2003) assumption of a pile-up stopping boundary at 0.04 AU.
