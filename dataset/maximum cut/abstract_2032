We generalize the model of Hatsugai and Kohmoto [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn, 61, 2056
(1992)] and find ground states which do not show the properties of Fermi
liquids. We work in two space dimensions, but it is straightforward to
generalize to higher dimensions. The ground state is highly degenerate and
there is no discontinuity in the momentum distribution; i.e., there is no
Fermi surface. The Green's function generically has a branch cut.
