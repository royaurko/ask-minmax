Complex network theory is a useful way to study many real systems. In this
paper, an anti-attack model based on complex network theory is introduced. The
mechanism of this model is based on dynamic compensation process and reverse
percolation process in P2P networks. The main purpose of the paper is: (i) a
dynamic compensation process can turn an attacked P2P network into a power-law
(PL) network with exponential cutoff; (ii) a local healing process can restore
the maximum degree of peers in an attacked P2P network to a normal level; (iii)
a restoring process based on reverse percolation theory connects the
fragmentary peers of an attacked P2P network together into a giant connected
component. In this way, the model based on complex network theory can be
effectively utilized for anti-attack and protection purposes in P2P networks.
