The experimental results of studying the resistivity and magnetic
susceptibility are presented for the single crystal La(1-x)Sr(x)MnO(3)
(x=0.15;0.175) and CaMnO(3-d). We revealed the temperature dependence of the
magnetic component of activation energy of hopping conductivity (Em) in
paramagnetic phase: Em=Em0(+ or -)a/T, where the "+" sign corresponds to
antiferromagnetic manganite CaMnO(3-d), and the "-" sign to ferromagnetic
manganites La(1-x)Sr(x)MnO(3). It has been shown that for antiferromagnetic
that temperature dependence of activation energy has a maximum coinciding with
a maximum of magnetic susceptibility. For ferromagnetic sample
La(0.85)Sr(0.15)MnO(3) the minimum of activation energy and maximum of magnetic
susceptibility also coincide. The results obtained are explained on the basic
of the model proposed in Gor'kov's works.
