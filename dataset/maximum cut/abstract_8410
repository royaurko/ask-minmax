Transition temperature data obtained as a function of particle density in the
$^4$He-Vycor system are compared with recent theoretical calculations for 3D
Bose condensed systems. In the low density dilute Bose gas regime we find, in
agreement with theory, a positive shift in the transition temperature of the
form $\Delta T/T_0 = \gamma(na^{3})^{1/3}$. At higher densities a maximum is
found in the ratio of $T_c /T_0$ for a value of the interaction parameter,
na$^3$, that is in agreement with path-integral Monte Carlo calculations.
