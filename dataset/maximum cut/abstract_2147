The possibility of discovering heavy Majorana neutrinos and lepton number
violation via the like sign dilepton signal at hadron super- colliders is
investigated. The cross-sections for the production of these neutrinos singly
as well as in pairs are computed both in three and four generation scenarios
within the framework of the gauge group $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$ and the
dominant processes are identified. The suppression of the Standard model
background by suitable kinematical cuts is also discussed.
