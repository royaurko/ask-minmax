The size distributions of 2D and 3D Voronoi cells and of cells of
$V_p(2,3)$,--2D cut of 3D Voronoi diagram--are explored, with the
single-parameter (re-scaled) gamma distribution playing a central role in the
analytical fitting. Observational evidence for a cellular universe is briefly
reviewed. A simulated $V_p(2,3)$ map with galaxies lying on the cell boundaries
is constructed to compare, as regards general appearance, with the observed CFA
map of galaxies and voids, the parameters of the simulation being so chosen as
to reproduce the largest observed void size.
