We numerically study the implementation of a NOT gate by laser pulses in a
model molecular system presenting two electronic surfaces coupled by non
adiabatic interactions. The two states of the bit are the fundamental states of
the cis-trans isomers of the molecule. The gate is classical in the sense that
it involves a one-qubit flip so that the encoding of the outputs is based on
population analysis which does not take the phases into account. This gate can
also be viewed as a double photo-switch process with the property that the same
electric field controls the two isomerizations. As an example, we consider
one-dimensional cuts in a model of the retinal in rhodopsin already proposed in
the literature. The laser pulses are computed by the Multi Target Optimal
Control Theory with chirped pulses as trial fields. Very high fidelities are
obtained. We also examine the stability of the control when the system is
coupled to a bath of oscillators modelled by an Ohmic spectral density. The
bath correlation time scale being smaller than the pulse duration the dynamics
is carried out in the Markovian approximation.
