If star formation depends strongly on the global properties of the
environment in which they form, the slope of the IMF as well as the upper and
lower mass cut-offs would be expected to vary significantly between violent
starbursts and more quiescent star forming regions. To test this hypothesis we
observed the stellar content of the two closest massive star forming regions,
30Doradus and NGC3603 with HST/NICMOS and VLT/ISAAC. Our observations are the
most sensitive observations made to date of dense starburst cores, allowing us
to investigate its low-mass stellar population with unprecedented quality. The
NIR luminosity function of 30Doradus shows no evidence for a truncation down to
at least 1 M_o, its stellar core R136 is populated in low-mass stars to at
least 2 M_o and NGC3603, which is very similar to R136, down to 0.1 M_o. Our
observations clearly show that low-mass stars do form in massive starbursts.
