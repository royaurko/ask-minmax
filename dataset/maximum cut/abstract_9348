We introduce the concept of controlling the nonlinear response of the
metamaterial by altering its internal structure. We experimentally demonstrate
tuning of the nonlinear response of two coupled split-ring resonators by
changing their mutual position. This effect is achieved through modification of
the structure of the coupled resonant modes, and their interaction with the
incident field. By offsetting the resonators we control the maximum currents
through the nonlinear driving elements, which affects the nonlinear response of
the system.
