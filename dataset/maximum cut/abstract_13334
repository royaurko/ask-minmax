We present results from the first on-sky demonstration of a prototype
astronomical integrated photonic spectrograph (IPS) using the Anglo-Australian
Telescope near-infrared imaging spectrometer (IRIS2) at Siding Spring
Observatory to observe atmospheric molecular OH emission lines. We have
succeeded in detecting upwards of 27 lines, and demonstrated the practicality
of the IPS device for astronomy. Furthermore, we present a laboratory
characterization of the device, which is a modified version of a commercial
arrayed-waveguide grating multiplexer. We measure the spectral resolution
full-width-half-maximum to be 0.75+/-0.05nm (giving R = 2100+/-150 at 1500nm).
We find the free spectral range to be 57.4+/-0.6nm and the peak total
efficiency to be ~65%. Finally, we briefly discuss the future steps required to
realize an astronomical instrument based on this technology concept.
