Maximum Clique Problem(MCP) is one of the 21 original NP--complete problems
enumerated by Karp in 1972. In recent years a large number of exact methods to
solve MCP have been appeared(Babel, Wood, Kumlander, Fahle, Li, Tomita and
etc). Most of them are branch and bound algorithms that use branching rule
introduced by Balas and Yu and based on coloring heuristics to establish an
upper bound on the clique number. They differ from each other primarily in
vertex preordering and vertex coloring methods. Current methods of worst case
running time analysis for branch and bound algorithms do not allow to provide
tight upper bounds. This motivates the study of lower bounds for such
algorithms. We prove 2^(n\5) lower bound for group of MCP algorithms based on
usage of coloring heuristics.
