The Maximum Depth was the first attempt to use data depths instead of
multivariate raw data to construct a classification rule. Recently, the
DD-classifier has solved several serious limitations of the Maximum Depth
classifier but some issues still remain. This paper is devoted to extending the
DD-classifier in the following ways: first, to surpass the limitation of the
DD-classifier when more than two groups are involved. Second to apply regular
classification methods (like $k$NN, linear or quadratic classifiers, recursive
partitioning,...) to DD-plots to obtain useful insights through the diagnostics
of these methods. And third, to integrate different sources of information
(data depths or multivariate functional data) in a unified way in the
classification procedure. Besides, as the DD-classifier trick is especially
useful in the functional framework, an enhanced revision of several functional
data depths is done in the paper. A simulation study and applications to some
classical real datasets are also provided showing the power of the new
proposal.
