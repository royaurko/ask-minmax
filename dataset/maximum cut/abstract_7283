We have carried out high-resolution observations along one-dimensional cuts
through the three Galactic supershells GS 064-01-97, GS 090-28-17, and GS
174+02-64 in the HI 21 cm and CO J=1-0 lines. By comparing the HI data with
IRAS data, we have derived the distributions of the I_100 and tau_100 excesses,
which are, respectively, the 100 mum intensity and 100 mum optical depth in
excess of what would be expected from HI emission. We have found that both the
I_100 and tau_100 excesses have good correlations with the CO integrated
intensity W_CO in all three supershells. But the I_100 excess appears to
underestimate H_2 column density N(H_2) by factors of 1.5-3.8. This factor is
the ratio of atomic to molecular infrared emissivities, and we show that it can
be roughly determined from the HI and IRAS data. By comparing the tau_100
excess with W_CO, we derive the conversion factor X = N(H_2)/W_CO = 0.26-0.66
in the three supershells. In GS 090-28-17, which is a very diffuse shell, our
result suggests that the region with N(H_2) < 3*10^20 cm^-2 does not have
observable CO emission, which appears to be consistent with previous results
indicating that diffuse molecular gas is not observable in CO. Our results show
that the molecular gas has a 60/100 mum color temperature T_d lower than the
atomic gas. The low value of T_d might be due either to the low equilibrium
temperature or to the lower abundance of small grains, or a combination of
both.
