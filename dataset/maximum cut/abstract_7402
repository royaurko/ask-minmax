We present deep radio observations of the most distant complete quasar sample
drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Combining our new data with those from
literature we obtain a sample which is ~100 per cent complete down to S_1.4GHz
= 60 \mu Jy over the redshift range 3.8 < z < 5. The fraction of radio
detections is relatively high (~43 per cent), similar to what observed locally
in bright optical surveys. Even though the combined radio and optical
properties of quasars remain overall unchanged from z ~ 5 to the local
Universe, there is some evidence for a slight over-abundance of radio-loud
sources at the highest redshifts when compared with the lower-z regime.
  Exploiting the deep radio VLA observations we present the first attempt to
directly derive the radio luminosity function of bright quasars at z ~ 4. The
unique depth -- both in radio and optical -- allows us to thoroughly explore
the population of optically bright FR~II quasars up to z ~ 5 and opens a window
on the behaviour of the brightest FR~I sources. A close investigation of the
space density of radio loud quasars also suggests a differential evolution,
with the more luminous sources showing a less pronounced cut-off at high z when
compared with the less luminous ones.
