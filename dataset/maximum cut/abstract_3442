The Earth, like other planets with a relatively thick atmosphere, is not
locally in radiative equilibrium and the transport of energy by the geophysical
fluids (atmosphere and ocean) plays a fundamental role in determining its
climate. Using simple energy-balance models, it was suggested a few decades ago
that the meridional energy fluxes might follow a thermodynamic Maximum Entropy
Production (MEP) principle. In the present study, we assess the MEP hypothesis
in the framework of a minimal climate model based solely on a robust radiative
scheme and the MEP principle, with no extra assumptions. Specifically, we show
that by choosing an adequate radiative exchange formulation, the Net Exchange
Formulation, a rigorous derivation of all the physical parameters can be
performed. The MEP principle is also extended to surface energy fluxes, in
addition to meridional energy fluxes. The climate model presented here is
extremely fast, needs very little empirical data and does not rely on ad hoc
parameterizations. We investigate its range of validity by comparing its
performances for pre-industrial climate and Last Glacial Maximum climate with
corresponding simulations with the IPSL coupled atmosphere-ocean General
Circulation Model IPSL_CM4, finding reasonable agreement. Beyond the practical
interest of this result for climate modelling, it supports the idea that, to a
certain extent, climate can be characterized with macroscale features with no
need to compute the underlying microscale dynamics.
