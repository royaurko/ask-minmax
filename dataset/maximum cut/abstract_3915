RX J1826.2-1450/LS 5039 has been recently proposed to be a radio emitting
high mass X-ray binary. In this paper, we present an analysis of its X-ray
timing and spectroscopic properties using different instruments on board the
RXTE satellite. The timing analysis indicates the absence of pulsed or periodic
emission on time scales of 0.02-2000 s and 2-200 d, respectively. The source
spectrum is well represented by a power-law model, plus a Gaussian component
describing a strong iron line at 6.6 keV. Significant emission is seen up to 30
keV, and no exponential cut-off at high energy is required. We also study the
radio properties of the system according to the GBI-NASA Monitoring Program. RX
J1826.2-1450/LS 5039 continues to display moderate radio variability with a
clearly non-thermal spectral index. No strong radio outbursts have been
detected after several months.
