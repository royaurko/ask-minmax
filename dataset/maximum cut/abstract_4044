We expand upon a new theoretical framework for Diffusion Limited Aggregation
and associated Dielectric Breakdown Models in two dimensions [R. C. Ball and E.
Somfai, Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 135503 (2002)]. Key steps are understanding how
these models interrelate when the ultra-violet cut-off strategy is changed, the
analogy with turbulence and the use of logarithmic field variables. Within the
simplest, Gaussian, truncation of mode-mode coupling, all properties can be
calculated. The agreement with prior knowledge from simulations is encouraging,
and a new superuniversality of the tip scaling exponent is discussed. We find
angular resonances relatable to the cone angle theory, and we are led to
predict a new Screening Transition in the DBM at large eta.
