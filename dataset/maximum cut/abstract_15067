In this paper, we study testing the population mean vector of high
dimensional multivariate data for both one-sample and two-sample problems. The
proposed simulation-based testing procedures employ maximum-type statistics and
use the Gaussian approximation techniques to obtain corresponding critical
values. Different from peer tests that heavily rely on the structural
conditions on the unknown covariance matrices, the proposed tests allow very
general forms of the covariance structures of data and therefore enjoy wide
scope of applicability in practice. To enhance powers of the tests against
sparse alternatives, we further propose two-step procedures with a preliminary
feature screening step. Theoretical properties of the proposed tests are
investigated. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic datasets and
empirical applications on identifying diseases-associated gene-sets are
provided to support the theoretical results. The proposed tests are easily
implemented and computationally efficient in practice.
