LS I+61 303 has been detected by the Cherenkov telescope MAGIC at very high
energies, presenting a variable flux along the orbital motion with a maximum
clearly separated from the periastron passage. In the light of the new
observational constraints, we revisit the discussion of the production of
high-energy gamma rays from particle interactions in the inner jet of this
system. The hadronic contribution could represent a major fraction of the TeV
emission detected from this source. The spectral energy distribution resulting
from p-p interactions is recalculated. Opacity effects introduced by the photon
fields of the primary star and the stellar decretion disk are shown to be
essential in shaping the high-energy gamma-ray light curve at energies close to
200 GeV. We also present results of Monte Carlo simulations of the
electromagnetic cascades developed very close to the periastron passage. We
conclude that a hadronic microquasar model for the gamma-ray emission in LS I
+61 303 can reproduce the main features of its observed high-energy gamma-ray
flux.
