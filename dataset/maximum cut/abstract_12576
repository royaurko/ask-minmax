In this paper we present recent results from the NA49 experiment for
$\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons produced in central Pb+Pb collisions at
40, 80 and 158 A$\cdot$GeV. Transverse mass spectra and rapidity distributions
for $\Lambda$ are shown for all three energies. The shape of the rapidity
distribution becomes flatter with increasing beam energy. The multiplicities at
mid-rapidity as well as the total yields are studied as a function of collision
energy including AGS measurements. The ratio $\Lambda/\pi$ at mid-rapidity and
in 4$\pi$ has a maximum around 40 A$\cdot$GeV. In addition, $\bar{\Lambda}$
rapidity distributions have been measured at 40 and 80 A$\cdot$GeV, which
allows to study the $\bar{\Lambda}$/$\Lambda$ ratio.
