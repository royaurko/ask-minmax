In a simple holographic model for QCD in which the Chern-Simons term is
incorporated to take into account the QCD chiral anomaly, we show that baryons
arise as stable solitons which are the 5D analogs of 4D skyrmions. Contrary to
4D skyrmions and previously considered holographic scenarios, these solitons
have sizes larger than the inverse cut-off of the model, and therefore they are
predictable within our effective field theory approach. We perform a numerical
determination of several static properties of the nucleons and find a
satisfactory agreement with data. We also calculate the amplitudes of
``anomalous'' processes induced by the Chern-Simons term in the meson sector,
such as omega -> pi gamma and omega -> 3pi. A combined fit to baryonic and
mesonic observables leads to an agreement with experiments within 16%.
