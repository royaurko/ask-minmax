Synthesis in 1% oxygen at 930C leads to non-superconducting RuSr2GdCu2O8 in
which superconductivity subsequently can be induced with oxygen annealings
without observable stoichiometric changes. Detailed ac susceptibility and
zero-field muon spin rotation experiments reveal that the superconducting
compounds always exhibit a lower temperature of the magnetic transition and
larger values of the internal magnetic field in the ordered state of the Ru
sublattice. The same annealings in oxygen, however, lead to non-superconducting
RuSr2EuCu2O8. The magnetic properties of a newly discovered series of
Ru1-xSr2GdCu2+xO8-y superconductors (maximum Tc=72 K for x=0.4) are reported.
Low temperature behavior of the magnetization shows a significant contribution
of the paramagnetic system of Gd ions to the magnetic response below the
superconducting transition. Muon-spin rotation experiments reveal the presence
of bulk magnetic transitions at low temperature for compounds with x<=0.4.
XANES Cu-K absorption edge data show an increase in Cu valence with x.
