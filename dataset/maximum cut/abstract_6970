Using molecular dynamic simulations we study a waterlike model confined
between two fixed hydrophobic plates. The system is tested for density,
diffusion and structural anomalous behavior and compared with the bulk results.
Within the range of confining distances we had explored we observe that in the
pressure-temperature phase diagram the temperature of maximum density (TMD
line), the temperature of maximum and minimum diffusion occur at lower
temperatures when compared with the bulk values. For distances between the two
layers below a certain threshold ,$d\le d_c$, only two layers of particles are
formed, for $d\ge d_c$ three or more layers are formed. In the case of three
layers the central layer stays liquid while the contact layers crystallize.
This result is in agreement with simulations for atomistic models.
