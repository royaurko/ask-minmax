It has long been known that QCD undergoes a deconfining phase transition at
high temperature. One of the consequent features of this new, quark-gluon phase
is that hadrons become unbounded. In this talk meson correlation functions at
non-zero momentum are studied in the deconfined phase using the Maximum Entropy
Method.
