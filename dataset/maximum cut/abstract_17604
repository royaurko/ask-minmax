We present multi-wavelength (VRIJHK) observations of KH 15D obtained in
2012/13, as well as a master table of standard photometry spanning the years
1967 to 2013. The system is a close, eccentric T Tauri binary embedded in an
inclined precessing circumbinary (CB) ring. The most recent data show the
continued rise of star B with respect to the trailing edge of the occulting
horizon as the system's maximum brightness steadily increases. The wealth of
data in time and wavelength domains allows us to track the long-term CCD color
evolution of KH 15D. We find that the V-I behavior is consistent with direct
and scattered light from the composite color of two stars with slightly
different temperatures. There is no evidence for any reddening or bluing
associated with extinction or scattering by ISM-sized dust grains. Furthermore,
we probe the system's faint phase behavior at near-infrared wavelengths in
order to investigate extinction properties of the ring and signatures of a
possible shepherding planet sometimes invoked to confine the CB ring at ~ 5 AU.
The wavelength independence of eclipse depth at second contact is consistent
with the ring material being fully opaque to 2.2 microns. The color-magnitude
diagrams demonstrate excess flux in J and H at low light levels, which may be
due to the presence of a hot, young Jupiter-mass planet.
