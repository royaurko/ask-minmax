I look for a dijet resonance produced by an excited quark q* in a simulated
sample corresponding to 3 ab^{-1} of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 100$ TeV.
Using a cut and count analysis approach I demonstrate the potential to explore
q* masses up to 50 TeV, corresponding to a length scale of around 4 am.
