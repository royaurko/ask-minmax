The static and high-frequency differential conductivity of a one-dimensional
superlattice with parabolic miniband, in which the dispersion law is assumed to
be parabolic up to the Brillouin zone edge, are investigated theoretically.
Unlike the earlier published works, devoted to this problem, the novel formula
for the static current density contains temperature dependence, which leads to
the current maximum shift to the low field side with increasing temperature.
The high-frequency differential conductivity response properties including the
temperature dependence is examined and opportunities of creating a terahertz
oscillator on Bloch electron oscillations in such superlattices are discussed.
Analysis shows that superlattices with parabolic miniband dispersion law may be
used for generation and amplification of terahertz fields only at very low
temperatures.
