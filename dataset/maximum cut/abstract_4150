Sub-MeV solar neutrino experiments and long-baseline reactor oscillation
experiments toe the cutting edge of neutrino research. The upcoming experiments
KamLAND and BOREXINO, currently in their startup and final construction phase
respectively, will provide essential information on neutrino properties as well
as on solar physics. Future projects, at present under development, will
measure the primary solar neutrino fluxes via electron scattering and neutrino
capture in real time. High precision data for lepton mixing as well as for
stellar evolution theory will become available in the future. This paper aims
to give an overview of the upcoming experiments and of the projects under
development.
