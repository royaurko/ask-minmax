Superregular matrices are a class of lower triangular Toeplitz matrices that
arise in the context of constructing convolutional codes having a maximum
distance profile. These matrices are characterized by the property that no
submatrix has a zero determinant unless it is trivially zero due to the lower
triangular structure. In this paper, we discuss how superregular matrices may
be used to construct codes having a maximum distance profile. We also introduce
group actions that preserve the superregularity property and present an upper
bound on the minimum size a finite field must have in order that a superregular
matrix of a given size can exist over that field.
