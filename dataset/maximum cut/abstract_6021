We study the mechanism of transverse energy (E_T) production in Au+Au
collisions at RHIC. The time evolution starting from the initial energy loss to
the final E_T production is closely examined in transport models. The
relationship between the experimentally measured E_T distribution and the
maximum energy density achieved is discussed.
