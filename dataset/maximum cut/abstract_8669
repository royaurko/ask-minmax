Predictions from a new next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation for direct and
resolved photoproduction of one and two jets are compared to simulated HERA
data. We propose a method to match experimental and theoretical jet definitions
and observe a reduced dependence on jet definitions and hadronization
corrections at larger transverse energies. From the irreducible uncertainty, we
estimate the maximum benefit that can be obtained from increased luminosity to
constrain the structure of the photon and the proton.
