In this paper we study processes which are constructed by a convolution of a
deterministic kernel with a martingale. A special emphasis is put on the case
where the driving martingale is a centred L\'evy process, which covers the
popular class of fractional L\'evy processes. As a main result we show that,
under appropriate assumptions on the kernel and the martingale, the maximum
process of the corresponding `convoluted martingale' is $p$-integrable and we
derive maximal inequalities in terms of the kernel and of the moments of the
driving martingale.
