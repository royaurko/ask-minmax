The coherent states are viewed as a powerful tool in differential geometry.
It is shown that some objects in differential geometry can be expressed using
quantities which appear in the construction of the coherent states. The
following subjects are discussed via the coherent states: the geodesics, the
conjugate locus and the cut locus; the divisors; the Calabi's diastasis and its
domain of definition; the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic of the manifold, the
number of Borel-Morse cells, Kodaira embeding theorem....
