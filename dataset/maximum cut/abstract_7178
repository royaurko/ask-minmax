We present a Bayesian approach to adapting parameters of a well-trained
context-dependent, deep-neural-network, hidden Markov model (CD-DNN-HMM) to
improve automatic speech recognition performance. Given an abundance of DNN
parameters but with only a limited amount of data, the effectiveness of the
adapted DNN model can often be compromised. We formulate maximum a posteriori
(MAP) adaptation of parameters of a specially designed CD-DNN-HMM with an
augmented linear hidden networks connected to the output tied states, or
senones, and compare it to feature space MAP linear regression previously
proposed. Experimental evidences on the 20,000-word open vocabulary Wall Street
Journal task demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework. In
supervised adaptation, the proposed MAP adaptation approach provides more than
10% relative error reduction and consistently outperforms the conventional
transformation based methods. Furthermore, we present an initial attempt to
generate hierarchical priors to improve adaptation efficiency and effectiveness
with limited adaptation data by exploiting similarities among senones.
