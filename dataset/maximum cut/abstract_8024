Let $F$ be an $n$-vertex forest. We say that an edge $e\notin F$ is in the
shadow of $F$ if $F\cup\{e\}$ contains a cycle. It is easy to see that if $F$
is "almost a tree", that is, it has $n-2$ edges, then at least
$\lfloor\frac{n^2}{4}\rfloor$ edges are in its shadow and this is tight.
Equivalently, the largest number of edges an $n$-vertex cut can have is
$\lfloor\frac{n^2}{4}\rfloor$. These notions have natural analogs in higher
$d$-dimensional simplicial complexes, graphs being the case $d=1$. As it turns
out in dimension $d>1$ the corresponding bounds depend on the underlying field
of coefficients $\mathbb F$. We solve these questions in full for $d=2$ and for
$\mathbb F=\mathbb Q$ and $\mathbb F_2$. The higher-dimensional results
remarkably differ from the case in graphs. Thus we construct $2$-dimensional
"almost-hypertrees" (properly defined below) with an empty shadow for $\mathbb
F=\mathbb Q$. For $\mathbb F=\mathbb F_2$ we determine the least possible
density of the shadow which turns out to be vanishingly small but positive. We
also study the least possible size of hypercuts and $k$-hypercuts in
$d$-dimensional complexes. Finally, we mention several intriguing open
questions.
