A comparison of the ratio of the depths of two absorption features in the
spectra of TypeIa supernovae (SNe Ia) near the time of maximum brightness with
the blueshift of the deep red Si II absorption feature 10 days after maximum
shows that the spectroscopic diversity of SNe Ia is multi-dimensional. There is
a substantial range of blueshifts at a given value of the depth ratio. We also
find that the spectra of a sample of SNe Ia obtained a week before maximum
brightness can be arranged in a ``blueshift sequence'' that mimics the time
evolution of the pre-maximum-light spectra of an individual SN Ia, the well
observed SN 1994D. Within the context of current SN Ia explosion models, we
suggest that some of the SNe Ia in our sample were delayed-detonations while
others were plain deflagrations.
