We study families of one-dimensional matter-wave bright solitons supported by
the competition of contact and dipole-dipole (DD) interactions of opposite
signs. Soliton families are found, and their stability is investigated in the
free space, and in the presence of an optical lattice (OL). Free-space solitons
may exist with an arbitrarily weak local attraction if the strength of the DD
repulsion is fixed. In the case of the DD attraction, solitons do not exist
beyond a maximum value of the local-repulsion strength. In the system which
includes the OL, a stability region for \textit{subfundamental solitons} (SFSs)
is found in the second finite bandgap. For the existence of gap solitons (GSs)
under the attractive DD interaction, the contact repulsion must be strong
enough. In the opposite case of the DD repulsion, GSs exist if the contact
attraction is not too strong. Collisions between solitons in the free space are
studied too. In the case of the local attraction, they merge or pass through
each other at small and large velocities, respectively. In the presence of the
local repulsion, slowly moving solitons bounce from each other.
