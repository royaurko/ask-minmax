Spin correlations in the pyrochlore antiferromagnet Y_2Ru_2O_7 with
Curie-Weiss temperature $\Theta_{CW}=-1100$ K and critical temperature T_N=77 K
were examined through neutron scattering. For $T_N<T<\Theta_{CW}/3$ the data
show spin relaxation with a rate $\hbar\Gamma= 1.17(9)k_BT$. For T<T_N spectral
weight moves to higher energies with substantial changes up to $4\times
k_BT_N$. For T<<T_N there is a $\Delta=11(1)$ meV energy gap and a pronounced
spectral maximum at 19.7 meV. Throughout the temperature range examined the
wave vector dependence of inelastic scattering exhibits a broad peak for
$Qd\approx 3.8$ (d is Ru-Ru spacing) consistent with dipolar spin correlations.
