We study the maximum of a Brownian motion with a parabolic drift; this is a
random variable that often occurs as a limit of the maximum of discrete
processes whose expectations have a maximum at an interior point. We give
series expansions and integral formulas for the distribution and the first two
moments, together with numerical values to high precision.
