We consider the NJL model as an effective quark theory to describe the
interaction which is responsible for the quark flavor dynamics at intermediate
energies. In addition to the usual ultraviolet cut-off which is necessary since
the model is non-renormalizable, we also introduce an infrared cut-off which
drops off the unknown confinement part of the quark interaction, which is
believed to be less important for the flavor dynamics. The infrared cut-off
eliminates all q-qbar thresholds, which plague the application of the usual NJL
model beyond low-energy pion physics. We apply this two-cut-off prescription to
the extended NJL model with chiral and heavy quark symmetries proposed recently
by us. We find a satisfactoring description even of the heavy mesons with
spin/parity J/P = (0+, 1+). Furthermore, the shape-parameters of the Isgur-Wise
function are studied as a function of the residual heavy meson mass.
