We review the detectability of gravitational waves generated by oscillations
excited during a phase transition from hadronic matter to deconfined
quark-gluon matter in the core of a neutron star. Neutron star properties were
computed using a Boguta and Bodmer's based model and the MIT bag model. The
maximum energy available to excite mechanical oscillations into the star is
estimated by energy difference between the configurations with and without a
quark-gluon matter core. On basis of the planned sensitivity of present laser
interferometers (VIRGO or LIGO I) and those of the next generation (LIGO II),
the maximum volume to be proped by these experiments is determined. These
results are used as an indication of the potential detectability of neutron
stars as sources of gravitational waves. Our results indicate that the maximum
distance probed by the detectors of the first generation is well beyond M31,
whereas the second generation detectors will probably see phase transitions
events at distances two times longer, but certanly not yet attaining the Virgo
cluster.
