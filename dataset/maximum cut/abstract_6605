The so called "globalization" process (i.e. the inexorable integration of
markets, currencies, nation-states, technologies and the intensification of
consciousness of the world as a whole) has a behavior exactly equivalent to a
system that is tending to a maximum entropy state. This globalization process
obeys a collective welfare principle in where the maximum payoff is given by
the equilibrium of the system and its stability by the maximization of the
welfare of the collective besides the individual welfare. This let us predict
the apparition of big common markets and strong common currencies. They will
reach the "equilibrium" by decreasing its number until they reach a state
characterized by only one common currency and only one big common community
around the world.
