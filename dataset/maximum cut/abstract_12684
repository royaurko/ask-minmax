Rf plasma production in Whistler waves range of frequency f/fci >1 is applied
on the compact helical system (CHS) in a steady state operation with low
toroidal magnetic field strength, where f and fci are rf and ion cyclotron
frequencies, respectively. Maximum rf power and pulse width are is170kW and 10
msec at 9MHz, respectively. The line averaged plasma density <ne> as high as
2x10^18 m-3 (He plasma) is produced in the region of toroidal magnetic field
strength on magnetic axis B=100G~1.5kG and the electron temperature measured at
plasma periphery is about 20eV. The wave magnetic field strength measured at
the plasma periphery showed the evidence of the toroidal eigen modes of the
Whistler waves. The additional long pulse microwave heating of 2.45GHz
(>200msec) is applied and it sustains the plasmas while the microwave itself
can not ignite plasmas when B<600G.
