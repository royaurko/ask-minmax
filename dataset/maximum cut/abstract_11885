We construct a model of speciation from evolution in an ecosystem consisting
of a limited amount of energy recources. The species posses genetic
information, which is inherited according to the rules of the Penna model of
genetic evolution. The increase in number of the individuals of each species
depends on the quality of their genotypes and the available energy resources.
The decrease in number of the individuals results from the genetic death or
reaching the maximum age by the individual. The amount of energy resources is
represented by a solution of the differential logistic equation, where the
growth rate of the amount of the energy resources has been modified to include
the number of individuals from all species in the ecosystem under
consideration. We observe that small evolutionary changes of the inherited
genetic information lead to spontaneous bursts of the evolutionary activity
when many new species may appear in a short period.
