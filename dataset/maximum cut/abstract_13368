The forward and inverse wavelet transform using the continuous Morlet basis
may be symmetrized by using an appropriate normalization factor. The loss of
response due to wavelet truncation is addressed through a renormalization of
the wavelet based on power. The spectral density has physical units which may
be related to the squared amplitude of the signal, as do its margins the mean
wavelet power and the integrated instant power, giving a quantitative estimate
of the power density with temporal resolution. Deconvolution with the wavelet
response matrix reduces the spectral leakage and produces an enhanced wavelet
spectrum providing maximum resolution of the harmonic content of a signal.
Applications to data analysis are discussed.
