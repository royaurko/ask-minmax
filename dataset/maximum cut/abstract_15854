We discuss the properties of the hyper-energetic Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic)
1998bw and 1997ef and Type IIn supernova (SN IIn) 1997cy. SNe Ic 1998bw and
1997ef are characterized by their large luminosity and the very broad spectral
features. Their observed properties can be explained if they are very energetic
SN explosions with the kinetic energy of $E_{\rm K} \gsim 1\times10^{52}$ erg,
originating probably from the core collapse of the bare C+O cores of massive
stars ($\sim 30-40$M$_\odot$). At late times, both the light curves and the
spectra suggest that the explosions may have been asymmetric; this may help us
understand the claimed connection with GRB's. The Type IIn SN 1997cy is even
more luminous than SN 1998bw and the light curve declines more slowly than
$^{56}$Co decay. We model such a light curve with circumstellar interaction,
which requires the explosion energy of $\sim 5 \times 10^{52}$ erg. Because
these kinetic energies of explosion are much larger than in normal
core-collapse SNe, we call objects like these SNe "hypernovae". The mass of
$^{56}$Ni in SN 1998bw is estimated to be as large as 0.5 - 0.7 $M_\odot$ from
both the maximum brightness and late time emission spectra, which suggests that
the asymmetry may not be extreme.
