The cross sections for isolated and non-isolated prompt photon production
with unpolarized hadron beams are studied at order $\alpha\alpha_s^2$. Two
methods of performing the calculations are compared. One uses purely analytic
techniques and the second uses a combination of analytic and Monte Carlo
techniques to perform the phase-space integrations. The results of the analytic
and Monte Carlo methods are compared both before and after isolation cuts are
placed on the photon. Fragmentation contributions are included at
next-to-leading order in the analytic case, and the question of the infrared
sensitivity of this contribution once isolation is implemented is addressed.
Numerical results are presented and compared with the latest CDF data for
$p\bar{p} \to \gamma+X$ using the latest parton densities for the proton.
