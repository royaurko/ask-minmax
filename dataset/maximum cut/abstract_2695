We propose a special solution of Einstein equations in the general Vaidya
form representing a dynamical black hole having horizon cross-sections with
toroidal topology. The concrete model enables us to study for the first time
dynamical horizons with toroidal topology, its area law, and the question of
matter flux inside the horizon, without using a cut-and-paste technology to
construct the solution.
