We construct model-independent parametrizations of the individual QCD form
factors relevant to Lambda_b --> Lambda_c l nu decays. These results follow
from dispersion relations and analyticity, and incorporate an improvement in
the technique that reduces the number of necessary parameters. To describe most
form factors with 5%--10% accuracy over the entire kinematic range, three
parameters are necessary, one of which is its normalization at zero recoil. We
also apply the improvement to meson decays, and find, using the heavy quark
form factor normalization, that almost every B --> D l nu and B --> D^* l nu
form factor is well-described by a single-variable parametrization. B --> pi l
nu requires a total of only 3 to 5 parameters, depending on the desired
accuracy.
