We consider the problem of multifrequency VLBA image synthesis and
spectral-index mapping for active galactic nuclei related to the necessity of
taking into account the frequency-dependent image shift. We describe our
generalized multifrequency synthesis algorithm with a spectral correction based
on the maximum entropy method. The results of our processing of multifrequency
VLBI data for the radio sources J2202+4216, J0336+3218, and J1419+5423 are
presented.
