The pressure dependence of the resistivity and structure of
La0.60Y0.07Ca0.33MnO3 has been explored in the pressure range from 1 atm to ~7
GPa. The metal to insulator transition temperature (TMI) was found to reach a
maximum and the resistivity achieves a minimum at ~3.8 GPa. Beyond this
pressure, TMI is reduced with a concomitant increase in the resistivity.
Structural measurements at room temperature show that at low pressure (below 2
GPa) the Mn-O bond lengths are compressed. Between ~2 and ~4 GPa, a pressure
induced enhancement of the Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion occurs in parallel with
an increase in Mn-O1-Mn bond angle to ~180 (degree). Above ~4 GPa, the Mn-O1-Mn
bond angle is reduced while the JT distortion appears to remain unchanged. The
resistivity above TMI is well modeled by variable range hopping. The pressure
dependence of the localization length follows the behavior of TMI.
