We consider a sparse random subraph of the $n$-cube where each edge appears
independently with small probability $p(n) =O(n^{-1+o(1)})$. In the most
interesting regime when $p(n)$ is not exponentially small we prove that the
largest eigenvalue of the graph is asymtotically equal to the square root of
the maximum degree.
