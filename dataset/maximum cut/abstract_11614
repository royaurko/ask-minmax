Spectral synthesis in 3-dimensional (3D) space for the earliest spectra of
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is presented. In particular, the high velocity
absorption features that are commonly seen at the earliest epochs ($\sim 10$
days before maximum light) are investigated by means of a 3D Monte Carlo
spectral synthesis code. The increasing number of early spectra available
allows statistical study of the geometry of the ejecta. The observed diversity
in strength of the high velocity features (HVFs) can be explained in terms of a
``covering factor'', which represents the fraction of the projected photosphere
that is concealed by high velocity material. Various geometrical models
involving high velocity material with a clumpy structure or a thick torus can
naturally account for the observed statistics of HVFs. HVFs may be formed by a
combination of density and abundance enhancements. Such enhancements may be
produced in the explosion itself or may be the result of interaction with
circumstellar material or an accretion disk. Models with 1 or 2 blobs, as well
as a thin torus or disk-like enhancement are unlikely as a standard situation.
