The notion of a local fractional derivative (LFD) was introduced recently for
functions of a single variable. LFD was shown to be useful in studying
fractional differentiability properties of fractal and multifractal functions.
It was demonstrated that the local Holder exponent/ dimension was directly
related to the maximum order for which LFD existed. We have extended this
definition to directional-LFD for functions of many variables and demonstrated
its utility with the help of simple examples.
