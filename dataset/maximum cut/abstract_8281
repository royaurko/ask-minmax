We study the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic ray nuclei through the
background of cosmic microwave and intergalactic infrared photons, using recent
re-estimates for the density of the last ones. We perform a detailed Monte
Carlo simulation to follow the disintegration histories of nuclei starting as
Fe and reaching the Earth from extragalactic sources. We obtain the maximum
energies of the arriving nuclear fragments as well as the mass composition as a
function of the distance traveled. Cosmic rays with energies in excess of
$2\times 10^{20}$ eV cannot originate from Fe nuclei produced in sources beyond
10 Mpc.
