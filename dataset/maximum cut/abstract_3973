Using a variety of quantitative implementations of Occam's razor we examine
the low quadrupole, the ``axis of evil'' effect and other detections recently
made appealing to the excellent WMAP data. We find that some razors {\it fully}
demolish the much lauded claims for departures from scale-invariance. They all
reduce to pathetic levels the evidence for a low quadrupole (or any other low
$\ell$ cut-off), both in the first and third year WMAP releases. The ``axis of
evil'' effect is the only anomaly examined here that survives the humiliations
of Occam's razor, and even then in the category of ``strong'' rather than
``decisive'' evidence. Statistical considerations aside, differences between
the various renditions of the datasets remain worrying.
