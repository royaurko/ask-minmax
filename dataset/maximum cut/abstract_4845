Photoassociation of ultracold rubidium atoms with femtosecond laser pulses is
studied theoretically. The spectrum of the pulses is cut off in order to
suppress pulse amplitude at and close to the atomic resonance frequency. This
leads to long tails of the laser pulse as a function of time giving rise to
coherent transients in the photoassociation dynamics. They are studied as a
function of cutoff position and chirp of the pulse. Molecule formation in the
electronically excited state is attributed to off-resonant excitation in the
strong-field regime.
