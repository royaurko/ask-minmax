In this letter, we exploit generalised unitarity in order to calculate the
cut-constructible part of one-loop amplitudes in non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory. In particular, we rederive the n-gluon MHV amplitudes for both the
adjacent and non-adjacent gluon helicity configurations from 3- and 4-particle
cuts alone.
