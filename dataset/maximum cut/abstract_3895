An inhomogeneous cosmological magnetic field will create Alfven-wave modes
that induce a small rotational velocity perturbation on the last scattering
surface of the microwave background radiation. The Alfven-wave mode survives
Silk damping on much smaller scales than the compressional modes. This, in
combination with its rotational nature, ensures that there will be no sharp
cut-off in anisotropy on arc-minute scales. We estimate that a magnetic field
which redshifts to a present value of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Gauss produces
temperature anisotropies at the 10 micro Kelvin level at and below 10 arc-min
scales. A tangled magnetic field, which is large enough to influence the
formation of large scale structure is therefore potentially detectable by
future observations.
