The clustering of ultra high energy cosmic ray events suggests that they have
originated from compact sources. One of the possible physical mechanisms by
which ultra high energy nuclei reach the Earth from far away astrophysical
sources (quasars or BL Lac objects) evading the
  Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cut-off is by violation of Lorentz invariance.
Assuming that there is violation of Lorentz invariance, we calculate the
expected number of neutron events from some of the EGRET sources (including
$\gamma$-ray loud BL Lac objects) which can be correlated in direction with
ultra high energy cosmic ray events observed by AGASA above energy
$4\times10^{19}$eV.
  We present in this paper what AGASA should see in future if violation of
Lorentz invariance is responsible for the propagation of ultra high energy
cosmic rays having energies above the GZK cut-off when there is a correlation
of EGRET sources with the ultra high energy cosmic ray events.
