This paper studies the concept of jointly utilizing the data
information(DI)and channel state information (CSI) in order to design
symbol-level precoders for a multiple input and single output (MISO) downlink
channel. In this direction, the interference among the simultaneous data
streams is transformed to useful signal that can improve the signal to
interference noise ratio (SINR) of the downlink transmissions. We propose a
maximum ratio transmissions (MRT) based algorithm that jointly exploits DI and
CSI to gain the benefits from these useful signals. In this context, a novel
framework to minimize the power consumption is proposed by formalizing the
duality between the constructive interference downlink channel and the
multicast channels. The numerical results have shown that the proposed schemes
outperform other state of the art techniques.
