Single phase Mn doped (2 at %) ZnO samples have been synthesized by
solid-state reaction technique. Before the final sintering at 500 C, the mixed
powders have been milled for different milling periods (6, 24, 48 and 96
hours). The grain sizes of the samples are very close to each other (~ 32 \pm 4
nm). However, the defective state of the samples is different from each other
as manifested from the variation of magnetic properties and electrical
resistivity with milling time. All the samples have been found to be
ferromagnetic with clear hysteresis loops at room temperature. The maximum
value for saturation magnetization (0.11 {\mu}_B / Mn atom) was achieved for 96
hours milled sample. Electrical resistivity has been found to increase with
increasing milling time. The most resistive sample bears the largest saturation
magnetization. Variation of average positron lifetime with milling time bears a
close similarity with that of the saturation magnetization. This indicates the
key role played by open volume vacancy defects, presumably zinc vacancies near
grain surfaces, in inducing ferromagnetic order in Mn doped ZnO. To attain
optimum defect configuration favorable for ferromagnetism in this kind of
samples proper choice of milling period and annealing conditions is required.
