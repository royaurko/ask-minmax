We perform updated and detailed calculations of the complete NLO set of
electroweak radiative corrections to parity violating e- e- --> e- e- (gamma)
scattering asymmetries at energies relevant for the ultra-precise Moller
experiment coming soon at JLab. Our numerical results are presented for a range
of experimental cuts and relative importance of various contributions is
analyzed. We also provide very compact expressions analytically free from
non-physical parameters and show them to be valid for fast yet accurate
estimations.
