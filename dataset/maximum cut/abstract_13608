We show how to use the Malliavin calculus to obtain density estimates of the
law of general centered random variables. In particular, under a non-degeneracy
condition, we prove and use a new formula for the density of a random variable
which is measurable and differentiable with respect to a given isonormal
Gaussian process. Among other results, we apply our techniques to bound the
density of the maximum of a general Gaussian process from above and below;
several new results ensue, including improvements on the so-called
Borell-Sudakov inequality. We then explain what can be done when one is only
interested in or capable of deriving concentration inequalities, i.e. tail
bounds from above or below but not necessarily both simultaneously.
