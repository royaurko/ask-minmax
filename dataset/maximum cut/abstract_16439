We report the first results from evolutions of a generic black-hole binary,
i.e. a binary containing unequal mass black holes with misaligned spins. Our
configuration, which has a mass ratio of 2:1, consists of an initially
non-spinning hole orbiting a larger, rapidly spinning hole (specific spin a/m =
0.885), with the spin direction oriented -45 degrees with respect to the
orbital plane. We track the inspiral and merger for ~2 orbits and find that the
remnant receives a substantial kick of 454 km/s, more than twice as large as
the maximum kick from non-spinning binaries. The remnant spin direction is
flipped by 103 degrees with respect to the initial spin direction of the larger
hole. We performed a second run with anti-aligned spins, a/m = +-0.5 lying in
the orbital plane that produces a kick of 1830 km/s off the orbital plane. This
value scales to nearly 4000 km/s for maximally spinning holes. Such a large
recoil velocity opens the possibility that a merged binary can be ejected even
from the nucleus of a massive host galaxy.
