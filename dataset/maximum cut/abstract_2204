We investigate the possibility to measure the nonforward gluon distribution
function by means of diffractively produced \pi^+\pi^- and K^+K^- pairs in
polarized lepton nucleon scattering. The resulting cross sections are small and
are dominated by the gluonic contribution. We find relatively large spin
asymmetries, both for \pi^+\pi^- and for K^+K^- pairs.
