Several mechanisms cause a granular material to strengthen over time at low
applied stress. The strength is determined from the maximum frictional force
F_max experienced by a shearing plate in contact with wet or dry granular
material after the layer has been at rest for a waiting time \tau. The layer
strength increases roughly logarithmically with \tau -only- if a shear stress
is applied during the waiting time. The mechanisms of strengthening are
investigated by sensitive displacement measurements and by imaging of particle
motion in the shear zone. Granular matter can strengthen due to a slow shift in
the particle arrangement under shear stress. Humidity also leads to
strengthening, but is found not to be its sole cause. In addition to these time
dependent effects, the static friction coefficient can also be increased by
compaction of the granular material under some circumstances, and by cycling of
the applied shear stress.
