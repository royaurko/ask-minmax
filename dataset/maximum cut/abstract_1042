For affine toric varieties, the vector space T1 (containing the infinitesimal
deformations) will be interpreted via Minkowski summands of cross cuts of the
defining polyhedral cone. This result will be applied to study the deformation
theory of (in particular non-isolated) three-dimensional Gorenstein
singularities.
