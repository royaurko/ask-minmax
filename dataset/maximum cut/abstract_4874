Spectra for the emission of charged leptons from evaporating hot-spots of
preconfining phase in SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics are computed.
Specifically, we consider charged single and dileptons with their spectra being
functions of energy and invariant mass, respectively. In the former case, our
results relate to narrow and correlated electron and positron peaks measured in
supercritical heavy-ion collisions performed at GSI in the 1980ies. In the
latter case, we point out how strongly the spectra depend on typical kinematic
cuts (CDF analysis of Tevatron Run II data). We also propose a scenario on how
muon events of anomalously high multiplicity and large impact-parameter modulus
arise in the Tevatron data.
