We investigate the viability of observing charged Higgs bosons (H^\pm)
produced in association with W bosons at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, using
the leptonic decay H^+ -> tau^+ nu_tau and hadronic W decay, within the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. Performing a parton level study we show how the
irreducible Standard Model background from W + 2 jets can be controlled by
applying appropriate cuts. In the standard m_h^max scenario we find a viable
signal for large tan beta and intermediate H^\pm masses (~ m_t).
