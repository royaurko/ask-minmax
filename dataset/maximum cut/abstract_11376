We develop a method for estimating the shear power spectra from weak lensing
observations and test it on simulated data. Our method describes the shear
field in terms of angular power spectra and cross correlation of the two shear
modes which differ under parity transformations. Two of the three power spectra
can be used to monitor unknown sources of noise in the data. The power spectra
are decomposed in a model independent manner in terms of ``band-powers'' which
are then extracted from the data using a quadratic estimator to find the
maximum of the likelihood and its local curvature (for error estimates). We
test the method against simulated data from Gaussian realizations and
cosmological N-body simulations. In the Gaussian case, the mean bandpowers and
their covariance are well recovered even for irregular (or sparsely) sampled
fields. The mild non-Gaussianity of the N-body realizations causes a slight
underestimation of the errors that becomes negligible for scales much larger
than several arcminutes and does not bias the recovered band powers.
