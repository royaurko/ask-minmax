The problem of color confinement in lattice Landau gauge QCD is briefly
reviewed in the light of Kugo-Ojima criterion and Gribov-Zwanziger theory. The
infrared properties of the Landau gauge QCD is studied by the measurement of
the gluon propagator, ghost propagator, Kugo-Ojima parameter and the running
coupling via $\beta=6.4,32^4,48^4$ lattice simulation. The data are analyzed in
the principle of minimum sensitivity(PMS) in the $\widetilde{MOM}$ scheme. We
observe the running coupling $\alpha_s(q)$ has a maximum about 1 and decreases
near q=0. The Kugo-Ojima parameter, which is expected to be 1 was about 0.8.
