A model for the condensation of a dusty plasma is constructed by considering
the spherical shielding layers surrounding a dust grain test particle. The
collisionless region less than a collision mean free path from the test
particle is shown to separate into three concentric layers, each having
distinct physics. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is invoked at the
interfaces between these layers and provides equations which determine the
radii of the interfaces. Despite being much smaller than the Wigner-Seitz
radius, the dust Debye length is found to be physically significant because it
gives the scale length of a precipitous cut-off of the shielded electrostatic
potential at the interface between the second and third layers. Condensation is
predicted to occur when the ratio of this cut-off radius to the Wigner-Seitz
radius exceeds unity and this prediction is shown to be in good agreement with
experiments.
