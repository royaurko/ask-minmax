The hypercube Q_n is the graph whose vertex set is {0,1}^n and where two
vertices are adjacent if they differ in exactly one coordinate. For any
subgraph H of the cube, let ex(Q_n, H) be the maximum number of edges in a
subgraph of Q_n which does not contain a copy of H. We find a wide class of
subgraphs H, including all previously known examples, for which ex(Q_n, H) =
o(e(Q_n)). In particular, our method gives a unified approach to proving that
ex(Q_n, C_{2t}) = o(e(Q_n)) for all t >= 4 other than 5.
