We show a method how to convert any graph into the binary number and vice
versa. We derive upper bound for maximum number of graphs, that, have fixed
number of vertices and can be colored with n colors (n is any given number).
Proof for the result is outlined. Next, graph coloring based check-digit scheme
is proposed. We use quantitative result derived, to show, that feasibility of
the proposed scheme increases with size of the number which digits are checked,
and overall probability of digits errors.
