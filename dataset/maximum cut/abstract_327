We discuss the weak coupling expansion of a one plaquette SU(2) lattice gauge
theory. We show that the conventional perturbative series for the partition
function has a zero radius of convergence and is asymptotic. The average
plaquette is discontinuous at g^2=0. However, the fact that SU(2) is compact
provides a perturbative sum that converges toward the correct answer for
positive g^2. This alternate methods amounts to introducing a specific coupling
dependent field cut, that turns the coefficients into g-dependent quantities.
Generalizing to an arbitrary field cut, we obtain a regular power series with a
finite radius of convergence. At any order in the modified perturbative
procedure, and for a given coupling, it is possible to find at least one (and
sometimes two) values of the field cut that provide the exact answer. This
optimal field cut can be determined approximately using the strong coupling
expansion. This allows us to interpolate accurately between the weak and strong
coupling regions. We discuss the extension of the method to lattice gauge
theory on a D-dimensional cubic lattice.
