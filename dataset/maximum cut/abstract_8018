In the standard pQCD picture particles are produced via the parton jet
fragmentation process. However, there are also other production mechanisms like
higher twist (HT) processes. A usual example of a HT process is a direct
production of an outgoing hadron, where the hadron is produced in the hard
subprocess without fragmentation.
  We study the HT phenomena using a shape analysis (xT scaling) of the
inclusive invariant cross sections of charged hadrons, measured by the ALICE
collaboration at center-of-mass energies \sqrt{s}=2.76 TeV and 7 TeV. The data
is compared to PYTHIA8 event generator and to a phenomenological model for HT.
Using PYTHIA8, we explore a possible enhancement of HT phenomena for isolated
particles, by comparing the shapes of the isolated distributions to inclusive
distributions. The results from the standard PYTHIA8, without HT, is compared
to a PYTHIA8 where we had included a HT process.
  Finally, we found out that the effects observed in the xT spectra originate
from kinematic biases posed by the isolation cuts, rather than from an
enrichment of the HT hadrons at the observed cross sections. A more detailed
data analysis is ongoing.
