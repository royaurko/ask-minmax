We study the problem of a Schwarzschild-anti-deSitter black hole in a
noncommutative geometry framework, thought to be an effective description of
quantum-gravitational spacetime. As a first step we derive the noncommutative
geometry inspired Schwarzschild-anti-deSitter solution. After studying the
horizon structure, we find that the curvature singularity is smeared out by the
noncommutative fluctuations. On the thermodynamics side, we show that the black
hole temperature, instead of a divergent behavior at small scales, admits a
maximum value. This fact implies an extension of the Hawking-Page transition
into a van der Waals-like phase diagram, with a critical point at a critical
cosmological constant size in Plank units and a smooth crossover thereafter. We
speculate that, in the gauge-string dictionary, this corresponds to the
confinement "critical point" in number of colors at finite number of flavors, a
highly non-trivial parameter that can be determined through lattice
simulations.
