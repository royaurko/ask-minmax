We measure the alignment of galaxy ellipticities in the local universe over a
range of scales using digitized photographic data from the SuperCOSMOS Sky
Survey. We find for a magnitude cut of b_J < 20.5, corresponding to a median
galaxy redshift of z = 0.1, and 2x10^6 galaxies, that the galaxy ellipticities
exhibit a non-zero correlation over a range of scales between 1 and 100
arcminutes. In particular, we measure the variance of mean galaxy
ellipticities, sg^2(theta), in square angular cells on the sky as a function of
cell size and find it lies in the range, 2 x 10^{-4} > sg^2(theta) > 1 x
10^{-5} for cell side lengths between 15 < theta < 100 arcminutes. Considering
the low median redshift of the galaxies in the sample and hence the relatively
low effective cross-section for lensing of these galaxies by the large-scale
structure of the Universe, we propose that we have detected an intrinsic
alignment of galaxy ellipticities. We compare our results to recent analytical
and numerical predictions made for the intrinsic galaxy alignment and find good
agreement. We discuss the importance of these results for measuring cosmic
shear from upcoming shallow surveys (e.g. Sloan Digital Sky Survey) and we
outline how these measurements could possibly be used to constrain models of
galaxy formation and/or measure the mass distribution in the local universe.
