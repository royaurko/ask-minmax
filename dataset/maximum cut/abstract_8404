We analyse the effect of synchronization between noise and periodic signal in
a two-state spatially extended system analytically. Resonance features are
demonstrated. To have the maximum cooperation between signal and noise, it is
shown that noise strength at resonance should increase linearly with the
frequency of the signal. The time scale of the process at resonance is also
shown to increase linearly with the period of the signal.
