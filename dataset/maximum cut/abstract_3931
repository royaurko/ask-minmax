The challenges of multi-wavelength astrophysics require new outlooks from
those appropriate to traditional astronomy. The next generation of research
scientists must be trained to exploit the potentiality now being provided for
the first time. Just as importantly, the full range of available information
must be indexed and made available, to avoid wasteful repeat observations, or
incomplete analyses. Perhaps the greatest challenge in the immediate future is
to ensure the wealth of multi-wavelength data already available, and being
accumulated, is available for efficient scientific exploitation. The difference
between observations in a depositary and a fully-operational data archive is
the difference between waste and cutting-edge science. The EU Optical Infrared
Coordination Network for Astronomy (OPTICON) provides a forum to coordinate and
develop the many national and international efforts and desires leading towards
an operational virtial observatory.
