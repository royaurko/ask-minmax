We use the language of errors to handle local Dirichlet forms with square
field operator (cf [2]). Let us consider, under the hypotheses of Donsker
theorem, a random walk converging weakly to a Brownian motion. If in addition
the random walk is supposed to be erroneous, the convergence occurs in the
sense of Dirichlet forms and induces the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck structure on the
Wiener space. This quite natural result uses an extension of Donsker theorem to
functions with quadratic growth. As an application we prove an invariance
principle for the gradient of the maximum of the Brownian path computed by
Nualart and Vives.
