The nu_mu -> nu_tau oscillation hypothesis will be tested through nu_tau
production of tau in underground neutrino telescopes as well as long-baseline
experiments. We provide the full QCD framework for the evaluation of tau
neutrino deep inelastic charged current (CC) cross sections, including
next-leading-order (NLO) corrections, charm production, tau threshold, and
target mass effects in the collinear approximation. We investigate the
violation of the Albright-Jarlskog relations for the structure functions F_4,5
which occur only in heavy lepton (tau) scattering. Integrated CC cross sections
are evaluated naively over the full phase space and with the inclusion of DIS
kinematic cuts. Uncertainties in our evaluation based on scale dependence, PDF
errors and the interplay between kinematic and dynamical power corrections are
discussed and/or quantified.
