An overview of the recent efforts in point-contact (PC) spectroscopy of the
nickel borocarbide superconductors RNi2B2C in the normal and superconducting
(SC) state is given. The results of measurements of the PC electron-
boson(phonon) interaction spectral function are presented. Phonon maxima and
crystalline-electric-field (CEF) excitations are observed in the PC spectra of
compounds with R=Dy, Ho, Er and Tm, while for R=Y a dominant phonon maximum
around 12 meV is characteristic. Additionally, non-phonon and non-CEF maxima
are observed near 3 meV in R=Ho and near 6 meV in R=Dy. Directional PC study of
the SC gap gives evidence for the multi-band nature of superconductivity in
R=Y, Lu. At low temperature the SC gap in R=Ho exhibits a standard single-band
BCS-like dependence, which vanishes above T_c^*= 5.6K< T_c=8.5K, where a
specifc magnetic ordering starts to play a role. For R=Tm (T_c=10.5 K) a
decrease of the SC gap is observed below 5 K.
