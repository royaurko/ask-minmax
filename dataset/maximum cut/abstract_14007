The Hill Cipher is a classical symmetric cipher which breaks plaintext into
blocks of size m and then multiplies each block by an m by m key matrix to
yield ciphertext. However, it is well known that the Hill cipher succumbs to
cryptanalysis relatively easily. As a result, there have been efforts to
strengthen the cipher through the use of various techniques e.g. permuting rows
and columns of the key matrix to encrypt each plaintext vector with a new key
matrix. In this paper, we strengthen the security of the Hill cipher against a
known-plaintext attack by encrypting each plaintext matrix by a variable-length
key matrix obtained from a Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) master key matrix.
