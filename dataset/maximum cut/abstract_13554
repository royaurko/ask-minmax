The pressure dependence of superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$
has been investigated through the DC magnetic measurements for FeSe$_{0.8}$ and
FeSe$_{1.0}$. For both samples, with increasing pressure $P$, the $T_{\rm
c}$$-$$P$ curve exhibits a two-step increase, showing a local maximum of
$\sim$11 K at $P$$\sim$1.0 GPa and a rapid increase with an extremely large
pressure coefficient for $P$$>$1.5 GPa. $T_{\rm c}$ saturates at $\sim$25 K (21
K) in FeSe$_{1.0}$ (FeSe$_{0.8}$) for $P$$>$3 GPa. A rapid decrease in
superconducting volume fraction is observed with an increase in $T_{\rm c}$
above 1.5 GPa, suggesting the presence of electronic inhomogeneity.
