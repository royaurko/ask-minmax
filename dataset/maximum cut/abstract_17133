The acquisition and use of mobile phone is tremendously increasing especially
in developing countries, but not without a concern. The greater concern among
the public is principally over the proximity of mobile base stations (MBS) to
residential areas rather than the use of handsets. In this paper, we present an
assessment of Radio-Frequency (RF) radiation exposure level measurements and
analysis of radiation power density (in W/sq m) from mobile base stations
relative to radial distance (in metre). The minimum average power density from
individual base station in the town was about 47uW/sq m while the average
maximum was about 1.5mW/sq m. Our result showed that average power density of a
base station decreased with increase in distance (away from base station) and
that radiation intensity varies from one base station to another even at the
same distance away. Our result (obtained signature of power density variation
from data) was also compared the with an 'expected' signature. It was found
that radiation from external sources (indicative) interfered with the reference
base station and accounted for the deviation observed in this study. Finally,
our result showed that the RF exposure hazard index in the town of Lokoja was
below the permitted RF exposure limit to the general public recommended by
ICRNIP. Useful recommendations were also made to the Policy and Regulatory
Agencies responsible to Telephony in Nigeria.
