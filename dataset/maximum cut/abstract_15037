We have measured the thermal conductivity along different directions of the S
= 1/2 one-dimensional (1D) spin system Sr2V3O9 in magnetic fields up to 14 T.
It has been found that the thermal conductivity along the [10-1] direction,
\k{appa}[10-1], is large and markedly suppressed by the application of magnetic
field, indicating that there is a large contribution of spinons to
\k{appa}[10-1] and that the spin chains run along the [10-1] direction. The
maximum value of the thermal conductivity due to spinons is ~14 W/Km along the
[10-1] direction, supporting the empirical law that the magnitude of the
thermal conductivity due to spinons is roughly proportional to the
antiferromagnetic interaction between the nearest neighboring spins.
