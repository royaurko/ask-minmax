We present 2.5-dimensional time-dependent simulations of nonrelativistic and
nonradiative outflows from sinusoidally perturbed Keplerian accretion disks. A
sinusoidal perturbation is introduced in the velocity of the gas ejected from
the surface of the disk into a cold corona. In the simulations, the disk is a
fixed boundary from which the gas is ejected with a pulsed velocity. The
maximum value of this velocity is taken to be a thousandth of the local
Keplerian disk velocity. It was found that for large periods, the structures in
the jet tend to fragment into smaller substructures. For small values of the
period, the structures tend to dissipate, while for medium values of the
period, they tend to persist.
