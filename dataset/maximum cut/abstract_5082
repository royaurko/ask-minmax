We report the discovery of an interesting and rare, rectangular-shaped
galaxy. At a distance of 21 Mpc, the dwarf galaxy LEDA 074886 has an absolute
R-band magnitude of -17.3 mag. Adding to this galaxy's intrigue is the presence
of an embedded, edge-on stellar disk (of extent 2R_{e,disk} = 12 arcsec = 1.2
kpc) for which Forbes et al. reported V_rot/sigma ~ 1.4. We speculate that this
galaxy may be the remnant of two (nearly edge-one) merged disk galaxies in
which the initial gas was driven inward and subsequently formed the inner disk,
while the stars at larger radii effectively experienced a dissipationless
merger event resulting in this `emerald cut galaxy' having very boxy isophotes
with a_4/a = -0.05 to -0.08 from 3 to 5 kpc. This galaxy suggests that
knowledge from simulations of both `wet' and `dry' galaxy mergers may need to
be combined to properly understand the various paths that galaxy evolution can
take, with a particular relevance to blue elliptical galaxies.
