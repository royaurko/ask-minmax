We present the 0.1-200 keV BeppoSAX spectrum of MR 2251-178 observed at two
epochs in 1998 separated by 5 months. Both epochs show identical spectral shape
and X-ray flux. Analysis of the combined spectra allow us to confirm the
presence of the ionized Fe K-alpha line detected by ASCA and to test the
presence of reflection from ionized material. The best self-consistent spectral
fit is obtained when including a contribution from a mildly ionized reflector
(Xi(0.01-100) ~ 1625 erg cm s-1, i.e. U(0.1-10) ~ 0.14) with a reflection
fraction R_ion ~ 0.11. An exponential cut-off to the direct power-law continuum
is then required at E ~ 100 keV. The low energy spectrum is absorbed by ionized
matter with a column density N_W = (8.1 (-1.2/+2.1))*10^21 cm^-2 and an X-ray
ionization parameter U(0.1-10)= 0.06 +/- 0.01. The warm absorber column is
slightly lower than that measured with ASCA. This change could be caused by
bulk motion. The BeppoSAX absorber ionization parameter globally agrees with
the ``U versus Flux'' correlation found for MR 2251-178 with EXOSAT, Ginga and
ASCA. This suggests that the absorber is in a state of instantaneous ionization
equilibrium.
