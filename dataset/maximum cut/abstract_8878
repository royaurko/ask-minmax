The striking asymmetry of the ice cover during the Last Global Maximum
suggests that the North Pole was in Greenland and then rapidly shifted to its
present position in the Arctic See. A scenario which causes such a rapid
geographic polar shift is physically possible. It involves an additional
planet, which disappeared by evaporation within the Holocene. This is only
possible within such a short period, if the planet was in an extremely
eccentric orbit and hot. Then, since this produced an interplanetary gas cloud,
the polar shift had to be preceded by a cold period with large global
temperature variations during several million years.
