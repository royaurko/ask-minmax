We discuss indirect manifestations of graviton exchange, predicted by large
extra dimensions, in fermion-pair production at a high-energy e^+e^- collider.
By means of specifically defined asymmetries among integrated angular
distributions, the graviton exchange signal can be cleanly distinguished from
the effects of either vector-vector contact interactions or heavy scalar
exchanges. The role of initial electron and positron beams polarization is also
discussed. The method is applied to a quantitative assessment of the
sensitivity to the mass cut-off parameter M_H of the KK graviton tower in the
ADD scenario, and of the potential identification reach of this mechanism
obtainable at the currently planned Linear Collider.
