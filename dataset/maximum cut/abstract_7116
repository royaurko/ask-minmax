Exact Lense-Thirring (LT) precession in Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime is reviewed.
It is shown that the LT precession does not obey the general inverse cube law
of distance at strong gravity regime in Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime. Rather, it
becomes maximum just near the horizon, falls sharply and becomes zero near the
horizon. The precession rate increases again and after that it falls obeying
the general inverse cube law of distance. This anomaly is maximum at the polar
region of this spacetime and it vanishes after crossing a certain `critical'
angle towards equator from pole. We highlight that this particular `anomaly'
also arises in the LT effect at the interior spacetime of the rotating neutron
star. In addition, we show that if the Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime rotates with the
angular momentum $J=Mn$ (Mass$\times$Dual Mass), inner horizon goes to at $r=0$
and only {\it event horizon} exists at the distance $r=2M$.
