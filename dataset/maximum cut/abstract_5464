Game semantics extends the Curry-Howard isomorphism to a three-way
correspondence: proofs, programs, strategies. But the universe of strategies
goes beyond intuitionistic logics and lambda calculus, to capture stateful
programs. In this paper we describe a logical counterpart to this extension, in
which proofs denote such strategies. The system is expressive: it contains all
of the connectives of Intuitionistic Linear Logic, and first-order
quantification. Use of Laird's sequoid operator allows proofs with imperative
behaviour to be expressed. Thus, we can embed first-order Intuitionistic Linear
Logic into this system, Polarized Linear Logic, and an imperative total
programming language.
  The proof system has a tight connection with a simple game model, where games
are forests of plays. Formulas are modelled as games, and proofs as
history-sensitive winning strategies. We provide a strong full completeness
result with respect to this model: each finitary strategy is the denotation of
a unique analytic (cut-free) proof. Infinite strategies correspond to analytic
proofs that are infinitely deep. Thus, we can normalise proofs, via the
semantics.
