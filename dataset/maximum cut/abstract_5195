For a 4D N=1 supersymmetric model with a low SUSY breaking scale (f) and
general Kahler potential K(Phi^i,Phi_j^*) and superpotential W(Phi^i) we study,
in an effective theory approach, the relation of the goldstino superfield to
the (Ferrara-Zumino) superconformal symmetry breaking chiral superfield X. In
the presence of more sources of supersymmetry breaking, we verify the
conjecture that the goldstino superfield is the (infrared) limit of X for
zero-momentum and Lambda->\infty. (Lambda is the effective cut-off scale). We
then study the constraint X^2=0, which in the one-field case is known to
decouple a massive sgoldstino and thus provide an effective superfield
description of the Akulov-Volkov action for the goldstino. In the presence of
additional fields that contribute to SUSY breaking we identify conditions for
which X^2=0 remains valid, in the effective theory below a large but finite
sgoldstino mass. The conditions ensure that the effective expansion (in
1/Lambda) of the initial Lagrangian is not in conflict with the decoupling
limit of the sgoldstino (1/m_sgoldstino\sim Lambda/f, f<Lambda^2).
