In this paper we provide the small-time heat kernel asymptotics at the cut
locus in three relevant cases: generic low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds,
generic 3D contact sub-Riemannian manifolds (close to the starting point) and
generic 4D quasi-contact sub-Riemannian manifolds (close to a generic starting
point). As a byproduct, we show that, for generic low-dimensional Riemannian
manifolds, the only singularities of the exponential map, as a Lagragian map,
that can arise along a minimizing geodesic are $A_3$ and $A_5$ (in the
classification of Arnol'd's school). We show that in the non-generic case, a
cornucopia of asymptotics can occur, even for Riemannian surfaces.
