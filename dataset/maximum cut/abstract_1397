Calculations of the conductance of a carbon nanotube (CNT)-molecule-CNT
structure are in agreement with experimental measurements [1]. The features in
the transmission correspond directly to the features of the isolated molecular
orbitals. The HOMO provides conductance at low bias that is relatively
insensitive to the end groups of the cut CNTs, the cut angle, or the number of
molecular bridges. A molecular conformation change not directly in the path of
the carrier transport increases the resistance by over 2 orders of magnitude.
