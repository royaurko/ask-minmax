The yrast sequence of the neutron-rich dysprosium isotope 168Dy has been
studied using multi-nucleon transfer reactions following collisions between a
460-MeV 82Se beam and a 170Er target. The reaction products were identified
using the PRISMA magnetic spectrometer and the gamma rays detected using the
CLARA HPGe-detector array. The 2+ and 4+ members of the previously measured
ground state rotational band of 168Dy have been confirmed and the yrast band
extended up to 10+. A tentative candidate for the 4+ to 2+ transition in 170Dy
was also identified. The data on these nuclei and on the lighter even-even
dysprosium isotopes are interpreted in terms of Total Routhian Surface
calculations and the evolution of collectivity in the vicinity of the
proton-neutron valence product maximum is discussed.
