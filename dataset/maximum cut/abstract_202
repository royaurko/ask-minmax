Suppression in primordial power on the Universe's largest observable scales
has been invoked as a possible explanation for large-angle observations in the
cosmic microwave background, and is allowed or predicted by some inflationary
models. Here we investigate the extent to which such a suppression could be
confirmed by the upcoming large-volume redshift surveys. For definiteness, we
study a simple parametric model of suppression that improves the fit of the
vanilla LCDM model to the angular correlation function measured by WMAP in
cut-sky maps, and at the same time improves the fit to the angular power
spectrum inferred from the maximum-likelihood analysis presented by the WMAP
team. We find that the missing power at large scales, favored by WMAP
observations within the context of this model, will be difficult but not
impossible to rule out with a galaxy redshift survey with large volume (~100
Gpc^3). A key requirement for success in ruling out power suppression will be
having redshifts of most galaxies detected in the imaging survey.
