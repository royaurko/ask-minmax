We consider the effect of lensing by galaxy clusters on the angular
distribution of submillimeter wavelength objects. While lensing does not change
the total flux and number counts of submillimeter sources, it can affect the
number counts and fluxes of flux-limited samples. Therefore imposing a flux cut
on point sources not only reduces the overall Poisson noise, but imprints the
correlations between lensing clusters on the unresolved flux distribution.
Using a simple model, we quantify the lensing anisotropy induced in
flux-limited samples and compare this to Poisson noise. We find that while the
level of induced anisotropies on the scale of the cluster angular correlation
length is comparable to Poisson noise for a slowly evolving cluster model, it
is negligible for more realistic models of cluster evolution. Thus the removal
of point sources is not expected to induce measurable structure in the
microwave or far-infrared backgrounds.
