We construct a new type of thin-shell wormhole for non-asymptotically flat
charged black holes in generalized dilaton-axion gravity inspired by low-energy
string theory using cut-and-paste technique. We have shown that this thin shell
wormhole is stable. The most striking feature of our model is that the total
amount of exotic matter needed to support the wormhole can be reduced as
desired with the suitable choice of the value of a parameter. Various other
aspects of thin-shell wormhole are also analyzed.
