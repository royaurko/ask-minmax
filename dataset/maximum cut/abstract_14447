We consider a real-time streaming system where messages are created
sequentially at the source, and are encoded for transmission to the receiver
over a packet erasure link. Each message must subsequently be decoded at the
receiver within a given delay from its creation time. The goal is to construct
an erasure correction code that achieves the maximum message size when all
messages must be decoded by their respective deadlines under a specified set of
erasure patterns (erasure model). We present an explicit intrasession code
construction that is asymptotically optimal under erasure models containing a
limited number of erasures per coding window, per sliding window, and
containing erasure bursts of a limited length.
