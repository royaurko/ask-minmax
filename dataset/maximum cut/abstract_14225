In this paper, a new multi-hop weighted clustering procedure is proposed for
homogeneous Mobile Ad hoc networks. The algorithm generates double star
embedded non-overlapping cluster structures, where each cluster is managed by a
leader node and a substitute for the leader node (in case of failure of leader
node). The weight of a node is a linear combination of six different graph
theoretic parameters which deal with the communication capability of a node
both in terms of quality and quantity, the relative closeness relationship
between network nodes and the maximum and average distance traversed by a node
for effective communication. This paper deals with the design and analysis of
the algorithm and some of the graph theoretic/structural properties of the
clusters obtained are also discussed.
