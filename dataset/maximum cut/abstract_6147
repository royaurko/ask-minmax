We obtain explicit bounds on the moments of character sums, refining
estimates of Montgomery and Vaughan. As an application we obtain results on the
distribution of the maximal magnitude of character sums normalized by the
square root of the modulus, finding almost double exponential decay in the tail
of this distribution.
