The formation of planetesimals requires that primordial dust grains grow from
micron- to km-sized bodies. Dust traps caused by gas pressure maxima have been
proposed as regions where grains can concentrate and grow fast enough to form
planetesimals, before radially migrating onto the star. We report new VLA Ka &
Ku observations of the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae/Be star MWC
758. The Ka image shows a compact emission region in the outer disk indicating
a strong concentration of big dust grains. Tracing smaller grains, archival
ALMA data in band 7 continuum shows extended disk emission with an intensity
maximum to the north-west of the central star, which matches the VLA clump
position. This segregation of grains sizes is expected in the context of dust
trapping, where big grains are trapped more easily than smaller grains in gas
pressure maxima. We develop a non-axisymmetric parametric model inspired by a
steady state vortex solution which reproduces the observations, including the
spectral energy distribution. Finally, we compare the radio continuum with
SPHERE scattered light data. The ALMA continuum spatially coincides with a
region devoid of scattered polarised emission and the VLA clump is offset to
the north of the north-western spiral-like feature, indicating moderate or no
flaring in the outer disk.
