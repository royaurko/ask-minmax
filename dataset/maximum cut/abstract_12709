Convective downbursts are known to produce potentially hazardous weather
conditions. Currently, severity indices are used to estimate the strength of a
potential downburst, but this information does not readily translate to the
variables affected by downburst events. The effects of downbursts are often
associated with aviation because of rapid changes in wind direction and speed,
but can also be observed in marine conditions. Three recently observed
downburst events have been selected as case studies to evaluate the effects of
the downbursts on the marine environment. The information gathered on these
events includes wind speed, gusts and direction at the surface, air temperature
and pressure, water level, and Wet Microburst Severity Index (WMSI) values.
Correlation between the WMSI values, the maximum wind gust, and the change in
water level is suggested.
