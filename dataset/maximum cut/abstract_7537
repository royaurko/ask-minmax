In supersymmetric models with gaugino mediated SUSY breaking (inoMSB), it is
assumed that SUSY breaking on a hidden brane is communicated to the visible
brane via gauge superfields which propagate in the bulk. This leads to GUT
models where the common gaugino mass $m_{1/2}$ is the only soft SUSY breaking
term to receive contributions at tree level. To obtain a viable phenomenology,
it is assumed that the gaugino mass is induced at some scale $M_c$ beyond the
GUT scale, and that additional renormalization group running takes place
between $M_c$ and $M_{GUT}$ as in a SUSY GUT. We assume an SU(5) SUSY GUT above
the GUT scale, and compute the SUSY particle spectrum expected in models with
inoMSB. We use the Monte Carlo program ISAJET to simulate signals within the
inoMSB model, and compute the SUSY reach including cuts and triggers approriate
to Fermilab Tevatron and CERN LHC experiments. We find no reach for SUSY by the
Tevatron collider in the trilepton channel. %either with or without %identified
tau leptons. At the CERN LHC, values of $m_{1/2}=1000$ (1160) GeV can be probed
with 10 (100) fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, corresponding to a reach in
terms of $m_{\tg}$ of 2150 (2500) GeV. The inoMSB model and mSUGRA can likely
only be differentiated at a linear $e^+e^-$ collider with sufficient energy to
produce sleptons and charginos.
