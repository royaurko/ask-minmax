Empirical research with electricity transmission networks reliability data
shows that the size of major failures - in terms of energy not supplied (ENS),
total loss of power (TLP) or restoration time (RT) - appear to follow a power
law behaviour in the upper tail of the distribution. However, this pattern -
also known as Pareto distribution - is not valid in the whole range of those
major events. We aimed to find a probability distribution that we could use to
model them, and hypothesized that there is a two-parameter model that fits the
pattern of those data well in the entire domain. We considered the major
failures produced between 2002 and 2009 in the European power grid; analyzed
those reliability indicators: ENS, TLP and RT; fitted six alternative models:
Pareto II, Fisk, Lognormal, Pareto, Weibull and Gamma distributions, to the
data by maximum likelihood; compared these models by the Bayesian information
criterion; tested the goodness-of-fit of those models by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test method based on bootstrap resampling; and validated them graphically by
rank-size plots. We found that Pareto II distribution is, in the case of ENS
and TLP, an adequate model to describe major events reliability data of power
grids in the whole range, and in the case of RT, is the best choice of the six
alternative models analyzed.
