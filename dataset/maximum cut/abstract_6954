The quasiparticle model is extended to investigate the properties of strange
quark matter in a strong magnetic field at finite densities. For the
density-dependent quark mass, self-consistent thermodynamic treatment is
obtained with an additional effective bag parameter, which depends not only on
the density but also on the magnetic field strength. The magnetic field makes
strange quark matter more stable energetically when the magnetic field strength
is less than a critical value of the order $10^7$ Gauss depending on the QCD
scale $\Lambda$. Instead of being a monotonic function of the density for the
QCD scale parameter $\Lambda>126$ MeV, the effective bag function has a maximum
near $0.3\sim 0.4$ fm$^{-3}$. The influence of the magnetic field and the QCD
scale parameter on the stiffness of the equation of state of the magnetized
strange quark matter and the possible maximum mass of strange stars are
discussed
