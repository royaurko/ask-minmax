In this work we investigate higher order statistics for the $\lcdm$ and ReBEL
scalar-interacting dark matter models by analyzing $180\hmpc$ dark matter
N-body simulation ensembles. The N-point correlation functions and the related
hierarchical amplitudes, such as skewness and kurtosis, are computed using the
Count-In-Cells method. Our studies demonstrate that the hierarchical amplitudes
$S_n$ of the scalar-interacting dark matter model significantly deviate from
the values in the $\lcdm$ cosmology on scales comparable and smaller then the
screening length $r_s$ of a given scalar-interacting model. The corresponding
additional forces that enhance the total attractive force exerted on dark
matter particles at galaxy scales lowers the values of the hierarchical
amplitudes $S_n$. We conclude that hypothetical additional exotic interactions
in the dark matter sector should leave detectable markers in the higher-order
correlation statistics of the density field. We focussed in detail on the
redshift evolution of the dark matter field's skewness and kurtosis. From this
investigation we find that the deviations from the canonical $\lcdm$ model
introduced by the presence of the ``fifth'' force attain a maximum value at
redshifts $0.5<z<2$. We therefore conclude that moderate redshift data are
better suited for setting observational constraints on the investigated ReBEL
models.
