The point contact tunneling technique is used to examine quasiparticle and
Josephson currents in overdoped Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$
(Bi-2212) single crystals with bulk T$_{c}$ values near 62 K. High quality
superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) tunnel junctions are formed between
Bi-2212 crystals and a Au tip, which display well-resolved quasiparticle gap
features including sharp conductance peaks. Reproducible superconductor-
insulator-superconductor (SIS) tunnel junctions are also obtained between two
pieces of the Bi-2212 crystals, resulting in simultaneous quasiparticle and
Josephson currents. Superconducting gap values are obtained from the SIS data
using a model with d-wave symmetry. The SIS tunneling conductances also show
very pronounced symmetric dips and humps at high bias voltages. The high bias
conductance data reveal that the dip and hump features are part of a larger
spectrum that extends out to 300-400 mV. The dynamic conductances of both SIN
and SIS junctions are qualitatively similar to those found on optimally-doped
Bi-2212 but with reduced gap values ($\Delta$=15-20 meV). The maximum Josephson
current depends on junction resistance in a manner consistent with
Ambegaokar-Baratoff theory but with a reduced $I_{c}R_{n}$ product of $\sim$2.4
mV.
