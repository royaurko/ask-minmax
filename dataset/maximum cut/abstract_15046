Threshold and ambiguity phenomena are studied in Part 1 of this work where
approximations for the mean-squared-error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood
estimator are proposed using the method of interval estimation (MIE), and where
approximate upper and lower bounds are derived. In this part we consider
time-of-arrival estimation and we employ the MIE to derive closed-form
expressions of the begin-ambiguity, end-ambiguity and asymptotic
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) thresholds with respect to some features of the
transmitted signal. Both baseband and passband pulses are considered. We prove
that the begin-ambiguity threshold depends only on the shape of the envelope of
the ACR, whereas the end-ambiguity and asymptotic thresholds only on the shape
of the ACR. We exploit the results on the begin-ambiguity and asymptotic
thresholds to optimize, with respect to the available SNR, the pulse that
achieves the minimum attainable MSE. The results of this paper are valid for
various estimation problems.
