The article presents the results of experiments in computation of statistical
values related to Young diagrams, including the estimates on maximum and
average (by Plancherel distribution) dimension of irreducible representation of
symmetric group $S_n$. The computed limit shapes of two-dimensional and
three-dimensional diagrams distributed by Richardson statistics are presented
as well.
