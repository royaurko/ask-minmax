We have explored the question of whether the renormalization group running of
the neutrino mixing parameters in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is
detectable with ultra-high energy neutrinos from active galactic nuclei (AGN).
We use as observables the ratios of neutrino fluxes produced at the AGN,
focusing on four different neutrino production models:
$(\Phi_{\nu_e+\bar{\nu}_e}^0 : \Phi_{\nu_\mu+\bar{\nu}_\mu}^0 :
\Phi_{\nu_\tau+\bar{\nu}_\tau}^0)$ = (1:2:0), (0:1:0), (1:0:0), and (1:1:0).
The prospects for observing deviations experimentally are taken into
consideration, and we find out that it is necessary to impose a cut-off on the
transferred momentum of $Q^2 \geq 10^7$ GeV$^2$. However, this condition,
together with the expected low value of the diffuse AGN neutrino flux, yields a
negligible event rate at a km-scale Cherenkov detector such as IceCube.
