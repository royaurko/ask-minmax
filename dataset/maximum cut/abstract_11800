We compare the angle-resolved photoemission spectra of the hole-doped Cu-O
chains in PrBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (Pr123) and in PrBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ (Pr124).
While, in Pr123, a dispersive feature from the chain takes a band maximum at
$k_b$ (momentum along the chain) $\sim$ $\pi/4$ and loses its spectral weight
around the Fermi level, it reaches the Fermi level at $k_b$ $\sim$ $\pi/4$ in
Pr124. Although the chains in Pr123 and Pr124 are approximately 1/4-filled,
they show contrasting behaviors: While the chains in Pr123 have an instability
to charge ordering, those in Pr124 avoid it and show an interesting spectral
feature of a metallic coupled-chain system.
