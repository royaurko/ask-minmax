We consider Standard Model Higgs boson production in association with a W
boson in hadron collisions. We supplement the fully exclusive perturbative
computation of QCD radiative effects up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
with the computation of the decay of the Higgs boson into a bb pair at
next-to-leading order (NLO). We consider the selection cuts that are typically
applied in the LHC experimental analysis, and we compare our fixed-order
predictions with the results obtained with the MC@NLO event generator. We find
that NLO corrections to the H -> bb decay can be important to obtain a reliable
pT spectrum of the Higgs boson, but that, in the cases of interest, their
effect is well accounted for by the parton shower Monte Carlo. NNLO corrections
to the production process typically decrease the cross section by an amount
which depends on the detail of the applied cuts, but they have a mild effect on
the shape of the Higgs pT spectrum. We also discuss the effect of QCD radiative
corrections on the invariant mass distribution of the Higgs candidate.
