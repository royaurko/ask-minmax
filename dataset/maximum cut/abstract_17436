The sensitivity of a Cherenkov imaging telescope is strongly dependent on the
rejection of the cosmic-ray background events. The methods which have been used
to achieve the segregation between the gamma-rays from the source and the
background cosmic-rays, include methods like Supercuts/Dynamic Supercuts,
Maximum likelihood classifier, Kernel methods, Fractals, Wavelets and random
forest. While the segregation potential of the neural network classifier has
been investigated in the past with modest results, the main purpose of this
paper is to study the gamma / hadron segregation potential of various ANN
algorithms, some of which are supposed to be more powerful in terms of better
convergence and lower error compared to the commonly used Backpropagation
algorithm. The results obtained suggest that Levenberg-Marquardt method
outperforms all other methods in the ANN domain. Applying this ANN algorithm to
$\sim$ 101.44 h of Crab Nebula data collected by the TACTIC telescope, during
Nov. 10, 2005 - Jan. 30, 2006, yields an excess of $\sim$ (1141$\pm$106) with a
statistical significance of $\sim$ 11.07$\sigma$, as against an excess of
$\sim$ (928$\pm$100) with a statistical significance of $\sim$ 9.40$\sigma$
obtained with Dynamic Supercuts selection methodology. The main advantage
accruing from the ANN methodology is that it is more effective at higher
energies and this has allowed us to re-determine the Crab Nebula energy
spectrum in the energy range $\sim$ 1-24 TeV.
