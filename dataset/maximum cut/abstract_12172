We consider the properties of a gas of bosonic diatomic molecules in the
limit when few of the molecules are dissociated. Taking into account the
effects of dissociation and scattering among molecules and atoms, we calculate
the dispersion relation for a molecule, and the thermal depletion of the
condensate. We calculate the dependence of the Bose-Einstein condensation
temperature of a uniform gas on the atom-atom scattering length, and conclude
that, for a broad Feshbach resonance, the condensation temperature increases as
the molecular state becomes less strongly bound, thereby giving rise to a
maximum in the transition temperature in the BEC-BCS crossover. We also argue
on general grounds that, for a gas in a harmonic trap and for a narrow Feshbach
resonance, the condensation temperature will decrease with increasing
scattering length.
