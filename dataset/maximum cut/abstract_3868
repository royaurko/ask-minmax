Installation of the ARIANNA Hexagonal Radio Array (HRA) on the Ross Ice Shelf
of Antarctica has been completed. This detector serves as a pilot program to
the ARIANNA neutrino telescope, which aims to measure the diffuse flux of very
high energy neutrinos by observing the radio pulse generated by
neutrino-induced charged particle showers in the ice. All HRA stations ran
reliably and took data during the entire 2014-2015 austral summer season. A new
radio signal direction reconstruction procedure is described, and is observed
to have a resolution better than a degree. The reconstruction is used in a
preliminary search for potential neutrino candidate events in the data from one
of the newly installed detector stations. Three cuts are used to separate radio
backgrounds from neutrino signals. The cuts are found to filter out all data
recorded by the station during the season while preserving 85.4% of simulated
neutrino events that trigger the station. This efficiency is similar to that
found in analyses of previous HRA data taking seasons.
