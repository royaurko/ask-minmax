We investigate the stability of strange quark matter and the properties of
the cor- responding strange stars, within a wide range of quark mass scaling.
The calculation shows that the resulting maximum mass always lies between
1.5M_{sun} and 1.8M_{sun} for all the scalings chosen here. Strange star
sequences with a linear scaling would sup- port less gravitational mass, and a
change (increase or decrease) of the scaling around the linear scaling would
lead to a higher maximum mass. Radii invariably decrease with the mass scaling.
Then the larger the scaling, the faster the star might spin. In addition, the
variation of the scaling would cause an order of magnitude change of the strong
electric field on quark surface, which is essential to support possible crusts
of strange stars against gravity and may then have some astrophysical
implications.
