We found that non-magnetic defects in two-dimensional topological insulators
induce bound states of two kinds for each spin orientation: electron- and
hole-like states. Depending on the sign of the defect potential these states
can be also of two kinds with different distribution of the electron density.
The density has a maximum or minimum in the center. A surprising effect caused
by the topological order is a singular dependence of the bound-state energy on
the defect potential.
