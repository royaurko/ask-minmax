In this paper, the error performance of on-off frequency shift keying (OOFSK)
modulation over fading channels is analyzed when the receiver is equipped with
multiple antennas. The analysis is conducted in two cases: the coherent
scenario where the fading is perfectly known at the receiver, and the
noncoherent scenario where neither the receiver nor the transmitter knows the
fading coefficients. For both cases, the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)
detection rule is derived and analytical probability of error expressions are
obtained. The effect of fading correlation among the receiver antennas is also
studied. Simulation results indicate that for sufficiently low duty cycle
values, lower probability of error values with respect to FSK signaling are
achieved. Equivalently, when compared to FSK modulation, OOFSK with low duty
cycle requires less energy to achieve the same probability of error, which
renders this modulation a more energy efficient transmission technique.
