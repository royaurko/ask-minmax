We suggest a method of singular terms regularization in potential model of
$N\bar{N}$ interaction. This method is free from any uncertainties, related to
the usual cut-off procedure and based on the fact, that in the presence of
sufficiently strong short-range annihilation $N$ and $\bar{N}$ never approach
close enough to each other. The effect of mentioned singular terms of OBE
potential, modified by annihilation is shown to be repulsive. The obtained
results for S- and P-wave scattering lengths are in agreement with existing
theoretical models.
