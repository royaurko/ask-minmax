HgBa$_{2}$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Hg1201) has been shown to be a model cuprate for
scattering, optical, and transport experiments, but angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data are still lacking owing to the absence
of a charge-neutral cleavage plane. We report on progress in achieving the
experimental conditions for which quasiparticles can be observed in the
near-nodal region of the Fermi surface. The d-wave superconducting gap is
measured and found to have a maximum of 39 meV. At low temperature, a kink is
detected in the nodal dispersion at approximately 51 meV below the Fermi level,
an energy that is different from other cuprates with comparable T$_c$. The
superconducting gap, Fermi surface, and nodal band renormalization measured
here provide a crucial momentum-space complement to other experimental probes.
