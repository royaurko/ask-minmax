The possibility to detect the Z0 in the ALICE central barrel is studied via
the electronic decay channel Z0->e+e-. The signal and the background are
simulated with the leading order event generator PYTHIA 6. The total
cross-sections are taken from NLO calculations. Based on test beam data, the
electron identification performance of the Transition Radiation Detector is
extrapolated to high momenta. The expected yields for minimum-bias pp
collisions at 14 TeV are presented. An isolation cut on the single electron,
together with a minimum transverse momentum cut, allows to obtain a clear
signal. The expected background is of the order of 1 % with the main
contribution coming from misidentified pions from jets.
