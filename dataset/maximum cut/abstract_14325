The CLAS detector was used to obtain the first ever measurement of the
electromagnetic decay of the $\Sigma^{*+}(1385)$ from the reaction $\gamma p
\to K^0 \Sigma^{*+}(1385)$. A real photon beam with a maximum energy of 3.8 GeV
was incident on a liquid-hydrogen target, resulting in the photoproduction of
the kaon and $\Sigma^*$ hyperon. Kinematic fitting was used to separate the
reaction channel from the background processes. The fitting algorithm exploited
a new method to kinematically fit neutrons in the CLAS detector, leading to the
partial width measurement of $250.0\pm56.9(stat)^{+34.3}_{-41.2}(sys)$ keV. A
U-spin symmetry test using the SU(3) flavor-multiplet representation yields
predictions for the $\Sigma^{*+}(1385)\to\Sigma^{+}\gamma$ and
$\Sigma^{*0}(1385)\to\Lambda\gamma$ partial widths that agree with the
experimental measurements.
