This paper brings out the design patterns according to the various services
involved in internet banking. The Pattern oriented Software Architecture uses
the pattern which eliminates the difficulty of reusability in a particular
context. The patterns are to be designed using BPM (Business Process Model) for
effective cross cutting on process level. For implementing the above said BPM,
the Internet banking has been taken to implement the pattern into it. The
Analysis and identification of various processes in Internet Banking have been
done, to identify the effective cross cutting features. With this process the
pattern has been designed, as a reusability component to be used by the
Software Architect. The pattern help us to resolve recurring problems
constructively and based on proven solutions and also support us in
understanding the architecture of a given software system. Once the model is
finalized by analyzing we found enquiry pattern as the visitor pattern and
implement the pattern.
