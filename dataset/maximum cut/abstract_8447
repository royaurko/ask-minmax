Electrical resistivity measurements on a single crystal of the heavy-fermion
superconductor CeCoIn_5 at pressures to 4.2 GPa reveal a strong crossover in
transport properties near P^* \approx 1.6 GPa, where T_c is a maximum. The
temperature-pressure phase diagram constructed from these data provides a
natural connection to cuprate physics, including the possible existence of a
pseudogap.
