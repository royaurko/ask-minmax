Let $T(n)$ denote the maximal number of transversals in an order-$n$ Latin
square. Improving on the bounds obtained by McKay et al., Taranenko recently
proved that $T(n) \leq \left((1+o(1))\frac{n}{e^2}\right)^{n}$, and conjectured
that this bound is tight.
  We prove via a probabilistic construction that indeed $T(n) =
\left((1+o(1))\frac{n}{e^2}\right)^{n}$. Until the present paper, no
superexponential lower bound for $T(n)$ was known. We also give a simpler proof
of the upper bound.
