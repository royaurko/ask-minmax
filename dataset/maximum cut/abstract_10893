We present measurements of \Omega_m and \Omega_{\Lambda} from a blind
analysis of 21 high-redshift supernovae using a new technique (CMAGIC) for
fitting the multi-color lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae, first introduced in
Wang et al. (2003). CMAGIC takes advantage of the remarkably simple behavior of
Type Ia supernovae on color-magnitude diagrams, and has several advantages over
current techniques based on maximum magnitudes. Among these are a reduced
sensitivity to host galaxy dust extinction, a shallower luminosity-width
relation, and the relative simplicity of the fitting procedure. This allows us
to provide a cross check of previous supernova cosmology results, despite the
fact that current data sets were not observed in a manner optimized for CMAGIC.
We describe the details of our novel blindness procedure, which is designed to
prevent experimenter bias. The data are broadly consistent with the picture of
an accelerating Universe, and agree with a flat Universe within 1.7\sigma,
including systematics. We also compare the CMAGIC results directly with those
of a maximum magnitude fit to the same SNe, finding that CMAGIC favors more
acceleration at the 1.6\sigma level, including systematics and the correlation
between the two measurements. A fit for w assuming a flat Universe yields a
value which is consistent with a cosmological constant within 1.2\sigma.
