The basic cosmological predictions of a `polarizable-vacuum' theory of
gravity due to Dicke, predating the scalar-tensor theory, are investigated and
tested for their compliance with current observations. A Friedmann-like
equation is derived for the theory that differs in a significant way from that
of GR, for which it is demonstrated that a big bang is not a solution: the
initial scale factor may be small but not zero, and must have zero first
derivative. Detailed graphs of the predictions of the theory for combinations
of the density parameters are given. It is shown that these predictions are
compatible with current estimates for the age and deceleration parameter, and
the maximum observable redshift, provided the matter density $\Omega_m$ is
close to the luminous matter density, i.e. provided there is not a significant
amount of missing mass. For these best fit parameters, the theory predicts a
maximum initial temperature that is too small for BBN and probably too small to
support an era of radiation domination. The theory predicts a radiation power
from a binary system that is 2/3 that predicted by GR, and so incompatible with
observed orbital decay rate of PSR 1913 + 16. There is some discussion of
possible developments, including reconciliation through accommodation of vacuum
anisotropy, and of the relation between PV and the Yilmaz theory and the
quasi-steady-state cosmology.
