We establish new results on weighted $L^2$ extension of holomorphic top forms
with values in a holomorphic line bundle, from a smooth hypersurface cut out by
a holomorphic function. The weights we use are determined by certain functions
that we call denominators. We give a collection of examples of these
denominators related to the divisor defined by the submanifold.
