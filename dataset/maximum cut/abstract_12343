We discuss the one-loop radiative corrections to the reaction e^+ e^- ->
X^+_a X^-_b, for a,b=1,2 where X^+_{1,2} are the charginos of the minimal
supersymmetric standard model. We calculate the leading one loop radiative
corrections involving loops of top, stop, bottom and sbottom quarks, working in
the MS-bar scheme. At LEP2 we find positive radiative corrections typically of
10% to 15% and with a maximum value of approximately 30% if the squark mass
parameters are of the order of 1 TeV. If \sqrt{s}=500 GeV we find smaller
corrections but they can be also negative, with extreme values of 13% and -4%.
For a center of mass given by \sqrt{s}=2 TeV we find larger corrections, with
typical values between 20% and -20%.
