We explore possible effects of vacuum energy on the evolution of black holes.
If the universe contains a cosmological constant, and if black holes can absorb
energy from the vacuum, then black hole evaporation could be greatly
suppressed. For the magnitude of the cosmological constant suggested by current
observations, black holes larger than $\sim 4 \times 10^{24}$ g would accrete
energy rather than evaporate. In this scenario, all stellar and supermassive
black holes would grow with time until they reach a maximum mass scale of $\sim
6 \times 10^{55}$ g, comparable to the mass contained within the present day
cosmological horizon.
