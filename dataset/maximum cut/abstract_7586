We develop a systematic perturbative expansion and compute the one-loop
two-points, three-points and four-points correlation functions in a
non-commutative version of the U(N) Wess-Zumino-Witten model in different
regimes of the $\theta$-parameter showing in the first case a kind of phase
transition around the value $\theta_c = \frac{\sqrt{p^2 + 4 m^2}}{\Lambda^2
p}$, where $\Lambda$ is a ultraviolet cut-off in a Schwinger regularization
scheme. As a by-product we obtain the functions of the renormalization group,
showing they are essentially the same as in the commutative case but applied to
the whole U(N) fields; in particular there exists a critical point where they
are null, in agreement with a recent background field computation of the
beta-function, and the anomalous dimension of the Lie algebra-valued field
operator agrees with the current algebra prediction. The non-renormalization of
the level $k$ is explicitly verified from the four-points correlator, where a
left-right non-invariant counter-term is needed to render finite the theory,
that it is however null on-shell. These results give support to the equivalence
of this model with the commutative one.
