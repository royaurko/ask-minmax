We construct examples of smooth surfaces S in P^6 with no trisecant lines.
This list includes examples of surfaces not cut out by quadrics. We prove that
unless S has a finite number of disjoint $(-1)$-lines, and each one meets some
other line L on the surface with L^2\leq -2, and S is not an inner projection
from P^7 the surface belongs to the list of examples.
