In this paper, a practical power detection scheme for OFDM terminals, based
on recent free probability tools, is proposed. The objective is for the
receiving terminal to determine the transmission power and the number of the
surrounding base stations in the network. However, thesystem dimensions of the
network model turn energy detection into an under-determined problem. The focus
of this paper is then twofold: (i) discuss the maximum amount of information
that an OFDM terminal can gather from the surrounding base stations in the
network, (ii) propose a practical solution for blind cell detection using the
free deconvolution tool. The efficiency of this solution is measured through
simulations, which show better performance than the classical power detection
methods.
