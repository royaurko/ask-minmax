A strategy for computing upper code-length limits of AC Huffman codes for an
8x8 block in JPEG Baseline coding is developed. The method is based on a
geometric interpretation of the DCT, and the calculated limits are as close as
14% to the maximum code-lengths. The proposed strategy can be adapted to other
transform coding methods, e.g., MPEG 2 and 4 video compressions, to calculate
close upper code length limits for the respective processing blocks.
