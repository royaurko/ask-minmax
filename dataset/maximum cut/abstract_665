Motivated by Granda and Oliveros (GO) model, we generalize their work to the
non-flat case. We obtain the evolution of the dark energy density, the
deceleration and the equation of state parameters for the holographic dark
energy model in a non-flat universe with GO cut-off. In the limiting case of a
flat universe, i.e. $k = 0$, all results given in GO model are obtained.
