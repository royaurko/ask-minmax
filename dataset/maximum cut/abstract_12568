We address the "Additive Equivalence" discovered by Virk and coworkers: drag
reduction affected by flexible and rigid rodlike polymers added to turbulent
wall-bounded flows is limited from above by a very similar Maximum Drag
Reduction (MDR) asymptote. Considering the equations of motion of rodlike
polymers in wall-bounded turbulent ensembles, we show that although the
microscopic mechanism of attaining the MDR is very different, the macroscopic
theory is isomorphic, rationalizing the interesting experimental observations.
