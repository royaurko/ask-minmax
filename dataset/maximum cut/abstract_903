An estimate of the maximum observable redshift is obtained using only t_{0}
approximately equal to (14+- 3)10^{9}years, H_{0} approximately equal to 65 +-
10Km\sec^{-1}Mpc^{-1}(t_{0}H_{0} approximately equal to 0.91 +- 0.08/0.18)
assuming \Lambda approximately equal to 0. The resulting maximum redshift z_{+}
approximately equal to 10 appears to give a reasonable upper limit to the
highest actually observed redshifts. Some implications are discussed.
