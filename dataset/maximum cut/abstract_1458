The computation of hard processes in hadronic collisions is a major success
of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. The environment of heavy-ion collisions
offers the opportunity to embed such hard processes into a soft medium which is
created simultaneously and study the medium-induced modifications. On the level
of single high transverse momentum hadrons, a reduction in yield, the so-called
quenching is observed. However, on the level of jets, the energy-momentum flux
carried by hadrons is conserved, i.e. the effect of the medium is a
redistribution of energy and momentum, and statements about quenching of jets
can only be made for specific cuts used to identify the jet. In this paper, we
present a baseline computation for the expected modification of the
longitudinal momentum distribution in jets by the medium created in 200 AGeV
Au-Au collisions given a realistic set of experimental cuts used to identify
jets in a heavy-iron environment. For this purpose, we use a Monte-Carlo code
developed to simulate in-medium shower evolution following a hard process and a
3-d hydrodynamical evolution to simulate the soft medium.
