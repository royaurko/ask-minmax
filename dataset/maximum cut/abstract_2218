In 1967 Glashow, Schnitzer and Weinberg derived a sum rule in the soft-pion
and soft kaon limit relating the Delta I=1/2 non-leptonic K->2pi amplitude to
integrals over strange and non-strange spectral functions. Using the recent
ALEPH data from tau-decay, we show that the sum rule, slightly modified to
reduce contributions near the cut, yields the correct magnitude decay amplitude
corresponding to the Delta I=1/2 rule.
