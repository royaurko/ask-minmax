Recent advancements in genomic study and clinical research have drew growing
attention to understanding how relationships among genes, such as dependencies
or co-regulations, vary between different biological states. Complex and
unknown dependency among genes, along with the large number of measurements,
imposes methodological challenge in studying genes relationships between
different states. Starting from an interrelated problem, we propose a bootstrap
procedure for testing the equality of two unspecified covariance matrices in
high dimensions, which turns out to be an important tool in understanding the
change of gene relationships between states. The two-sample bootstrap test
takes maximum advantage of the dependence structures given the data, and gives
rise to powerful tests with desirable size in finite samples. The theoretical
and numerical studies show that the bootstrap test is powerful against sparse
alternatives and more importantly, it is robust against highly correlated and
nonparametric sampling distributions. Encouraged by the wide applicability of
the proposed bootstrap test, we design a gene clustering algorithm to
understand gene clustering structures. We apply the bootstrap test and gene
clustering algorithm to the analysis of a human asthma dataset, for which some
interesting biological implications are discussed.
