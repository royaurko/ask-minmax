We obtain a new fluctuation identity for a general L\'{e}vy process giving a
quintuple law describing the time of first passage, the time of the last
maximum before first passage, the overshoot, the undershoot and the undershoot
of the last maximum. With the help of this identity, we revisit the results of
Kl\"{u}ppelberg, Kyprianou and Maller [Ann. Appl. Probab. 14 (2004) 1766--1801]
concerning asymptotic overshoot distribution of a particular class of L\'{e}vy
processes with semi-heavy tails and refine some of their main conclusions. In
particular, we explain how different types of first passage contribute to the
form of the asymptotic overshoot distribution established in the aforementioned
paper. Applications in insurance mathematics are noted with emphasis on the
case that the underlying L\'{e}vy process is spectrally one sided.
