Power line communication continues to draw increasing interest by promising a
wide range of applications including cost-free last-mile communication
solution. However, signal transmitted through the power lines deteriorates
badly due to the presence of severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) and harsh
random pulse noise. This work proposes a new precoded turbo equalization scheme
specifically designed for the PLC channels. By introducing useful precoding to
reshape ISI, optimizing maximum {\it a posteriori} (MAP) detection to address
the non-Gaussian pulse noise, and performing soft iterative decision
refinement, the new equalizer demonstrates a gain significantly better than the
existing turbo equalizers.
