The evolution of tidally truncated globular clusters is investigated by
integrating two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation that allows the development
of velocity anisotropy. We start from the isotropic Plummer model with tidal
cut off and followed the evolution through the corecollapse. The heating by
three-binary is included to obtain the evolution past the corecollapse. The
anisotropy in velocity dispersion develops during the precollapse evolution.
However, the anisotropy becomes highly depressed during the post-collapse
evolution because of rapid loss of radial orbits. Maximum radial anisotropy
appears just after the beginning of the expansion, and degree of anisotropy
decreases slowly as the total mass of the cluster decreases. Thus it may be
possible to determine the evolutionary status of a cluster if the velocity
anisotropy can be measured in the sense that the postcollapse clusters always
have very little degree of anisotropy. The structure of the post-collapse
cluster can be well fitted to King models because the degree of anisotropy is
rather small.
