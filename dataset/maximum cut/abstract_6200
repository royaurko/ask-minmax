We prove a continuity result for the fibers of the Berkovich analytification
of a complex algebraic variety with respect to the the maximum of the
Archimedean norm and the trivial norm. As a consequence, we obtain
generalizations of a result of Mikhalkin and Rullgard about degenerations of
amoebae onto tropical varieties.
