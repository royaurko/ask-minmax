Memory and aging behaviors in stage-2 CoCl$_{2}$ GIC ($T_{cu}$ = 8.9 K and
$T_{cl}$ = 6.9 K) have been studied using low frequency ($f$ = 0.1 Hz) AC
magnetic susceptibility ($\chi^{\prime}$ and $\chi^{\prime\prime}$) as well as
thermoremnant magnetization. There occurs a crossover from a cumulative aging
(mainly) with a partial memory effect for the domain-growth in the intermediate
state between $T_{cu}$ and $T_{cl}$ to an aging and memory in a spin glass
phase below $T_{cl}$. When the system is aged at single or multiple stop and
wait processes at stop temperatures $T_{s}$'s below $T_{cl}$ for wait times
$t_{s}$, the AC magnetic susceptibility shows single or multiple aging dips at
$T_{s}$'s on reheating. The depth of the aging dips is logarithmically
proportional to the wait time $t_{s}$. Very weak aging dip between $T_{cu}$ and
$T_{cl}$ indicates the existence of a partial memory effect. The sign of the
difference between the reference cooling and reference heating curves changes
from positive to negative on crossing $T_{cl}$ from the high $T$-side. The time
dependence of $\chi^{\prime}$ and $\chi^{\prime\prime}$ below $T_{cl}$ is
described by a scaling function of $\omega t$. its a local maximum at 6.5 K
just below $T_{cl}$, and drastically decreases with increasing $T$. The nature
of the cumulative aging between $T_{cl}$ and $T_{cu}$ is also examined.
