The interaction of classical and quantized electromagnetic fields with an
ensemble of atoms in an optical cavity is considered. Four fields drive a
double-lambda level scheme in the atoms, consisting of a pair of lambda systems
sharing the same set of lower levels. Two of the fields produce maximum
coherence, rho12 = -1/2, between the ground state sublevels 1 and 2. This
pumping scheme involves equal intensity fields that are resonant with both the
one and two-photon transitions of the lambda system. There is no steady-state
absorption of these fields, implying that the fields induce a type
electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) in the medium. An additional
pair of fields interacting with the second lambda system, combined with the EIT
fields, leads to squeezing of the atom spin associated with the ground state
sublevels. Our method involves a new mechanism for creating steady-state spin
squeezing using an optical cavity. As the cooperativity parameter C is
increased, the optimal squeezing varies as C^{-1/3}. For experimentally
accessible values of C, squeezing as large as 90% can be achieved.
