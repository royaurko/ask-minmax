Interaction of external monochromatic, linearly polorized plane EM-wave with
nonlinear one-dimensional wake wave, generated by relativistic electron bunch
moving in cold plasma, is considered. At definite conditions on parameters of
plasma and bunch, nonlinear wake wave can have a pronounced spikes, where
plasma electron density has its maximum value and plasma electron velocities
are nearing wave breaking limit, i.e. velocity of the rigid driving bunch.
Presented calculations show, that external EM-wave, propagating through plasma,
normal to the bunch velocity, at such a conditions can be amplified inside the
spikes, due to interaction with the plasma electrons. EM-wave, Thomson
scattered on spikes, is also amplified. Amplification factors are obtained for
the both cases at different conditions on EM-wave-plasma-electron bunch system
parameters. An additional amplification takes place, when the frequency of
EM-wave is nearing to the spike plasma frequency.
