The distribution of EAS hadronic component energy fluxes through the
ionization calorimeter in the primary energy range ~ 3x10^13 - 10^16 eV is
considered. The EAS, carrying the zero or the minimal flux of the hadron
component energy are extracted. The conclusion supports the existence of
izotropic gamma-radiation in the primary energy region E_0 ~ 1x10^14 - 2x10^15
eV. This radiation has a spectrum of a form, close to the bell-like one, with
the maximum at E_0 ~ 2.2x10^14 ev and with an additional local maximum at E_0 ~
1.6x10^15 eV.
