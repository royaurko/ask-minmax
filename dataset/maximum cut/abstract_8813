Stability of cylindrical and spherical crystals growing from a supersaturated
solution (in Mullins-Sekerka's approximation) is considered using the maximum
entropy production principle. The concept of the binodal of the nonequilibrium
(morphological) phase transition is introduced for interpretation of the
obtained results. The limits of the metastable regions are determined. The
morphological phase diagrams of stable-unstable growth in the plane (surface
energy, supersaturation) are given.
