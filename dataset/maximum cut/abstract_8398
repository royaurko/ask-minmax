We report on an exploration of the mean-field phase diagram for Pauli-limited
superconductivity in small metallic grains. Emphasis is placed on the crossover
from the ultra-small grain limit where superconductivity disappears to the bulk
thin-film limit as the single-particle level spacing in the grain decreases. We
find that the maximum Zeeman coupling strength compatible with
superconductivity increases with decreasing grain size, in spite of a
monotonically decreasing condensation energy per unit volume.
