We study spectral singularities and their application in determining the
threshold gain coefficient $g^{(E/M)}$ for oblique transverse electric/magnetic
(TE/TM) modes of an infinite planar slab of homogenous optically active
material. We show that $g^{(E)}$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the
incidence angle $\theta$ (measured with respect to the normal direction to the
slab), while $g^{(M)}$ has a single maximum, $\theta_c$, where it takes an
extremely large value. We identify $\theta_c$ with the Brewster's angle and
show that $g^{(E)}$ and $g^{(M)}$ coincide for $\theta=0$ (normal incidence),
tend to zero as $\theta\to 90^\circ$, and satisfy $g^{(E)}<g^{(M)}$ for
$0<\theta<90^\circ$. We therefore conclude that lasing and coherent perfect
absorption are always more difficult to achieve for the oblique TM waves and
that they are virtually impossible for the TM waves with
$\theta\approx\theta_c$. We also give a detailed description of the behavior of
the energy density and the Poynting vector for spectrally singular oblique TE
and TM waves. This provides an explicit demonstration of the parity-invariance
of these waves and shows that the energy density of a spectrally singular TM
wave with $\theta>\theta_c$ is smaller inside the gain region than outside it.
The converse is true for the TM waves with $\theta<\theta_c$ and all TE waves.
