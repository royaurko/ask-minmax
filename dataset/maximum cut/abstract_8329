A new method to evaluate the dust-to-gas ratios in the Kepler SNR is
presented. Dust emission in the infrared and bremsstrahlung are calculated
consistently, considering that dust grains are collisionally heated by the gas
throughout the front and downstream of both the expanding and the reverse
shocks. The dust-to-gas ratios are determined by the ratio of the dust emission
bump and bremsstrahlung in the infrared. A maximum dust mass < 0.16 Mo is
calculated.
