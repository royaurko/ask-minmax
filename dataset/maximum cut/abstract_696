We determine some of the derived equivalences of a class of gentle algebras
called surface algebras. These algebras are constructed from an unpunctured
Riemann surface of genus 0 with boundary and marked points by introducing cuts
in internal triangles of an arbitrary triangulation of the surface. In
particular, we fix a triangulation of a surface and determine when different
cuts produce derived equivalent algebras.
