In the paper I study properties of random polynomials with respect to a
general system of functions. Some lower bounds for the mathematical expectation
of the uniform and recently introduced integral-uniform norms of random
polynomials are established.
  {\sc Key words and phrases:} Random polynomial, estimates for maximum of
random process, integral-uniform norm.
