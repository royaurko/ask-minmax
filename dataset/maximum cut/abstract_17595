The lensing power spectrum from cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature
maps will be measured with unprecedented precision with upcoming experiments,
including upgrades to ACT and SPT. Achieving significant improvements in
cosmological parameter constraints, such as percent level errors on sigma_8 and
an uncertainty on the total neutrino mass of approximately 50 meV, requires
percent level measurements of the CMB lensing power. This necessitates tight
control of systematic biases. We study several types of biases to the
temperature-based lensing reconstruction signal from foreground sources such as
radio and infrared galaxies and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from
galaxy clusters. These foregrounds bias the CMB lensing signal due to their
non-Gaussian nature. Using simulations as well as some analytical models we
find that these sources can substantially impact the measured signal if left
untreated. However, these biases can be brought to the percent level if one
masks galaxies with fluxes at 150 GHz above 1 mJy and galaxy clusters with
masses above M_vir = 10^14 M_sun. To achieve such percent level bias, we find
that only modes up to a maximum multipole of l_max ~ 2500 should be included in
the lensing reconstruction. We also discuss ways to minimize additional bias
induced by such aggressive foreground masking by, for example, exploring a
two-step masking and in-painting algorithm.
