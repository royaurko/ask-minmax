We define an intersection product of tropical cycles on matroid varieties
(via cutting out the diagonal) and show that it is well-behaved. In particular,
this enables us to intersect cycles on moduli spaces of tropical rational
marked curves $M_{0,n}$ and $M_{0,n}(\R^r, d)$. This intersection product can
be extended to smooth varieties (whose local models are matroid varieties). We
also study pull-backs of cycles and rational equivalence.
