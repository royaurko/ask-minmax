We present Very Large Array observations of the intermediate mass
pre-main-sequence stars UX Ori and CQ Tau at 7mm, 3.6cm, and 6cm. These stars
are members of the UX Ori variability class, where the origin of optical
variability is thought to derive from inhomogeneities in circumstellar disks.
Both stars are detected at 7mm but not at longer wavelengths, which confirms
that the millimeter emission is dominated by dust.
  The UX Ori system exhibits a remarkably flat spectral index in the millimeter
range, with alpha_mm 2 (F_nu nu^alpha_mm). Two different disk models can
reproduce this property: i) a physically small disk with optically thick
emission, truncated at a radius about 30 AU, or ii) a massive (~0.3-1 Msun)
disk mainly composed of dust particles grown to radii of 10cm (``pebbles'').
The observations do not spatially resolve the 7mm emission. We discuss
implications of these two models and suggest observational tests that will
discriminate between them.
  The CQ Tau system exhibits a spectral index in the millimeter range of
alpha_mm 2.6, consistent with values commonly found for disks around
pre-main-sequence stars. The observations marginally resolve the 7mm emission
as an elongated structure with full width at half maximum of 2.4"x1.1" (240x110
AU at 100pc distance). The size and inclination of ~63 degrees (implied by
circular symmetry) are consistent with flared disk models previously suggested
to explain the optical colors and polarization properties.
