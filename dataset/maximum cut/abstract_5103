We consider the production of W bosons in hadron collisions, and the
subsequent leptonic decay W->lnu_l. We study the asymmetry between the rapidity
distributions of the charged leptons, and we present its computation up to the
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD perturbation theory. Our
calculation includes the dependence on the lepton kinematical cuts that are
necessarily applied to select W-> lnu_l events in actual experimental analyses
at hadron colliders. We illustrate the main differences between the W and
lepton charge asymmetry, and we discuss their physical origin and the effect of
the QCD radiative corrections. We show detailed numerical results on the charge
asymmetry in ppbar collisions at the Tevatron, and we discuss the comparison
with some of the available data. Some illustrative results on the lepton charge
asymmetry in pp collisions at LHC energies are presented.
