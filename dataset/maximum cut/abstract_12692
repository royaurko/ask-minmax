The North-South asymmetry of solar activity has been recognized for different
solar phenomena. Following Waldmeier, it is now assumed that solar activity
dominates in the Northern solar hemisphere during the ascending part of the
secular solar cycle, in the Southern one during the descending part, and in
epochs of secular minima and maxima the asymmetry is small. The episodes when
this rule does not hold (the Maunder minimum in the end of the 17th century,
and 19th and 20th solar cycles in the 20th century secular maximum) are
considered as "anomalies". Analyzing solar activity influence on climate, we
come to the conclusion that the asymmetry differs not in the ascending and
descending parts of the secular solar cycles, but in consecutive secular
cycles. This hypothesis is in agreement with all available data and leaves no
anomalies.
