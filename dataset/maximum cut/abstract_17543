Power-law cosmology with scale factor as power of cosmic time, $a \propto
t^{\a}$, is investigated. We review and discuss value of $\a$ obtained from
various types of observation. Considering dark energy dominant era in late
universe from $z < 0.5$, we use observational derived results from Cosmic
Microwave Background (WMAP7), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and
observational Hubble data to find power exponent $\a$ and other cosmological
variables. $\a$ is found to be $0.99 \pm 0.02$ (WMAP7+BAO+$H_0$) and $0.99 \pm
0.04$ (WMAP7). These values do not exclude possibility of acceleration at
1$\sigma$ hence giving viability to power-law cosmology in general. When
considering scenario of canonical scalar field dark energy with power-law
cosmology, we derive scalar field potential, exact scalar field solution and
equation of state parameter. We found that the scenario of power-law cosmology
containing dynamical canonical scalar field predicts present equation of state
parameter $w_{\phi, 0} = -0.449 \pm 0.030 $ while the $w$CDM with WMAP7 data
(model independent, $w$ constant) allows a maximum (+1$\sigma$) value of
$w_{\phi, 0}$ at -0.70 which is off the prediction range. However, in case of
varying $w_{\phi}$, the $w_{\phi, 0}$ value predicted from quintessential
power-law cosmology is allowed within 1$\sigma$ uncertainty.
