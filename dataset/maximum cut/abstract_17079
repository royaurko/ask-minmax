The Type II-Plateau supernova (SN II-P) SN 2004dj was the first SN II-P for
which spectropolarimetry data were obtained with fine temporal sampling before,
during, and after the fall off of the photometric plateau -- the point that
marks the transition from the photospheric to the nebular phase in SNe II-P.
Unpolarized during the plateau, SN 2004dj showed a dramatic spike in
polarization during the descent off of the plateau, and then exhibited a smooth
polarization decline over the next two hundred days. This behavior was
interpreted by Leonard et al. (2006) as evidence for a strongly non-spherical
explosion mechanism that had imprinted asphericity only in the innermost
ejecta. In this brief report, we compare nine similarly well-sampled epochs of
spectropolarimetry of the Type II-P SN 2008bk to those of SN 2004dj. In
contrast to SN 2004dj, SN 2008bk became polarized well before the end of the
plateau and also retained a nearly constant level of polarization through the
early nebular phase. Curiously, although the onset and persistence of
polarization differ between the two objects, the detailed spectropolarimetric
characteristics at the epochs of recorded maximum polarization for the two
objects are extremely similar, feature by feature. We briefly interpret the
data in light of non-Local-Thermodynamic Equilibrium, time-dependent
radiative-transfer simulations specifically crafted for SN II-P ejecta.
