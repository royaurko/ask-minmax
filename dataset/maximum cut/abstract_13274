The electronic phase diagram of PrFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$ (0$\leq$x$\leq$0.225)
has been determined using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, magnetization
and resistivity measurements. The structural transition temperature is
suppressed from 154 K to $\approx$120 K and the magnetic phase transitions of
both iron and praseodymium ions are completely suppressed by x$\approx$0.08
fluorine doping, coinciding with the emergence of superconductivity. The
optimal doping is x$\approx$0.15 when T$_{C}$=47 K, while the maximum
solubility of fluorine in PrFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$ is reached around x=0.22. The
structural, magnetic and superconducting phase diagram is presented.
