The maximum achievable temperature (energy density) and minimum kinetic
energy required for the formation of a baryon-rich quark-gluon plasma formed at
central rapidity in small impact parameter nuclear collisions is estimated. A
possible mechanism leading to the pile-up of matter is introduced. Plasma
formation is expected to appear at about 15 GeV/Nucleon uranium beam energy on
a stationary target or 2.7 GeV/Nucleon in colliding beams.
