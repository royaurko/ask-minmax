It is now apparent that classical T Tauri-like outflows commonly accompany
the formation of young brown dwarfs. To date two optical outflows have been
discovered and results presented in this paper increase this number to three.
Using spectro-astrometry the origin of the LS-RCrA 1 forbidden emission lines
in a blue-shifted outflow is confirmed. The non-detection of the red-shifted
component of the outflow in forbidden lines, along with evidence for some
separation between low and high velocity outflow components, do not support the
hypothesis that LS-RCrA 1 has an edge-on accretion disk. The key result of this
analysis is the discovery of an outflow component to the H-alpha line. The
H-alpha line profile has blue and red-shifted features in the wings which
spectro-astrometry reveals to also originate in the outflow. The discovery that
H-alpha emission in BDs can have a significant contribution from an outflow
suggests the use of H-alpha line widths as a proxy of mass accretion in BDs is
not clear-cut. This method assumes that any contribution to the H-alpha line
flux from a possible outflow is negligible. Finally the fact that the H-alpha
line traces both lobes of the outflow while only the blue-shifted lobe is seen
in forbidden emission points to the presence of a dust hole in the accretion
disk of LS-RCrA 1. This is commonly seen in CTTSs and is assumed to signal the
onset of planet formation.
