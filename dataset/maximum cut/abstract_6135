We discuss the problem how "bad" may be lower-order coefficients in elliptic
and parabolic second order equations to ensure some qualitative properties of
solution such as strong maximum principle, Harnack's inequality, Liouville's
theorem. The answers are given in terms of the Lebesgue spaces and the Morrey
spaces.
