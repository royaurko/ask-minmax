We propose a new 2D shape decomposition method based on the short-cut rule.
The short-cut rule originates from cognition research, and states that the
human visual system prefers to partition an object into parts using the
shortest possible cuts. We propose and implement a computational model for the
short-cut rule and apply it to the problem of shape decomposition. The model we
proposed generates a set of cut hypotheses passing through the points on the
silhouette which represent the negative minima of curvature. We then show that
most part-cut hypotheses can be eliminated by analysis of local properties of
each. Finally, the remaining hypotheses are evaluated in ascending length
order, which guarantees that of any pair of conflicting cuts only the shortest
will be accepted. We demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art shape
decomposition methods, the proposed approach achieves decomposition results
which better correspond to human intuition as revealed in psychological
experiments.
