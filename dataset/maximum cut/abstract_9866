Spherically symmetric anisotropic static compact solutions to the Einstein
equations in dimension $d\geq4$ are considered. Various matter models are
examined and upper bounds on the ratio of the gravitational mass to the radius
in these different models are obtained. Bounds are also generalised in the
presence of a non-zero charge and a positive cosmological constant. These
bounds are then used to find the maximum of the gravitational redshift at the
surface of the object.
