We investigate the contribution of technicolor mechanisms to the production
of single top quarks at hadron colliders. We find that a promising candidate
process is gluon-gluon fusion to produce a W-boson plus technipion, with
subsequent decay of the technipion to a top quark plus a bottom quark. The
top-plus-bottom mode is the dominant one when the technipion mass is larger
than the top mass. We calculate the total cross section and the $p_{T}$
distribution for the technipion production at Tevatron and LHC energies for a
range of technipion masses, starting at 200 GeV. The decay chain of technipion
to top plus bottom quarks and then top to W plus bottom yields a final state
with two W's and two bottom quarks. We study the backgrounds to our process and
the kinematic cuts that maximize the signal to background. We report event rate
estimates for the upgraded Tevatron and the LHC.
