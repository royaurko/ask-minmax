This paper describes the analysis of quantitative characteristics of frequent
sets and association rules in the posts of Twitter microblogs, related to the
discussion of "end of the world", which was allegedly predicted on December 21,
2012 due to the Mayan calendar. Discovered frequent sets and association rules
characterize semantic relations between the concepts of analyzed subjects.The
support for some fequent sets reaches the global maximum before the expected
event with some time delay. Such frequent sets may be considered as predictive
markers that characterize the significance of expected events for blogosphere
users. It was shown that time dynamics of confidence of some revealed
association rules can also have predictive characteristics. Exceeding a certain
threshold, it may be a signal for the corresponding reaction in the society
during the time interval between the maximum and probable coming of an event.
