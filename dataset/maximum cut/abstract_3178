A novel maximum Doppler spread estimation algorithm for OFDM systems with
comb-type pilot pattern is presented in this paper. By tracking the drifting
delay subspace of time-varying multipath channels, a Doppler dependent
parameter can be accurately measured and further expanded and transformed into
a non-linear high-order polynomial equation, from which the maximum Doppler
spread is readily solved by resorting to the Newton's method. Its performance
is demonstrated by simulations.
