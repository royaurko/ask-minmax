Voltage-gated ion channels are key molecules for the generation and
propagation of electrical signals in excitable cell membranes. The
voltage-dependent switching of these channels between conducting and
nonconducting states is a major factor in controlling the transmembrane
voltage. In this study, a statistical mechanics model of these molecules has
been discussed on the basis of a two-dimensional spin model. A new Hamiltonian
and a new Monte Carlo simulation algorithm are introduced to simulate such a
model. It was shown that the results well match the experimental data obtained
from batrachotoxin-modified sodium channels in the squid giant axon using the
cut-open axon technique.
