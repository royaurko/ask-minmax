One of the main goals of the Long Baseline Neutrino Observatory (LBNO) is to
study the $L/E$ behaviour (spectral information) of the electron neutrino and
antineutrino appearance probabilities, in order to determine the unknown
CP-violation phase $\delta_{CP}$ and discover CP-violation in the leptonic
sector. The result is based on the measurement of the appearance probabilities
in a broad range of energies, covering t he 1st and 2nd oscillation maxima, at
a very long baseline of 2300 km. The sensitivity of the experiment can be
maximised by optimising the energy spectra of the neutrino and anti-neutrino
fluxes. Such an optimisation requires exploring an extended range of parameters
describing in details the geometries and properties of the primary protons,
hadron target and focusing elements in the neutrino beam line. In this paper we
present a numerical solution that leads to an optimised energy spectra and
study its impact on the sensitivity of LBNO to discover leptonic CP violation.
In the optimised flux both 1st and 2nd oscillation maxima play an important
role in the CP sensitivity. The studies also show that this configuration is
less sensitive to systematic errors (e.g. on the total event rates) than an
experiment which mainly relies on the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry at the
1st maximum to determine the existence of CP-violation.
