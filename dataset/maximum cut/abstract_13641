Lattice reduction algorithms, such as the LLL algorithm, have been proposed
as preprocessing tools in order to enhance the performance of suboptimal
receivers in MIMO communications. In this paper we introduce a new kind of
lattice reduction-aided decoding technique, called augmented lattice reduction,
which recovers the transmitted vector directly from the change of basis matrix,
and therefore doesn't entail the computation of the pseudo-inverse of the
channel matrix or its QR decomposition. We prove that augmented lattice
reduction attains the maximum receive diversity order of the channel;
simulation results evidence that it significantly outperforms LLL-SIC detection
without entailing any additional complexity. A theoretical bound on the
complexity is also derived.
