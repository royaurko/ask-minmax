The magnetic properties of Na2CuP2O7 were investigated by means of 31P
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity
measurements. We report the 31P NMR shift, the spin-lattice 1/T1, and spin-spin
1/T2 relaxation-rate data as a function of temperature T.
 The temperature dependence of the NMR shift K(T) is well described by the
S=1/2 square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnetic (HAF) model with an
intraplanar exchange of J/k_B \simeq 18\pm2 K and a hyperfine coupling A =
(3533\pm185) Oe/mu_B. The 31P NMR spectrum was found to broaden abruptly below
T \sim 10 K signifying some kind of transition. However, no anomaly was noticed
in the bulk susceptibility data down to 1.8 K. The heat capacity appears to
have a weak maximum around 10 K. With decrease in temperatures, the
spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 decreases monotonically and appears to agree
well with the high temperature series expansion expression for a S = 1/2 2D
square lattice.
