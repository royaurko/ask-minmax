This paper investigates the Picard numbers of quintic surfaces. We give the
first example of a complex quintic surface in IP^3 with maximum Picard number
45. We also investigate its arithmetic and determine the zeta function. Similar
techniques are applied to produce quintic surfaces with several other Picard
numbers that have not been achieved before.
