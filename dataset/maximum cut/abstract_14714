We study the model high-temperature superconductor HgBa2CuO4+d with
electronic Raman scattering and optical ellipsometry over a wide doping range.
The resonant Raman condition which enhances the scattering cross section of
"two-magnon" excitations is found to change strongly with doping, and it
corresponds to a rearrangement of inter-band optical transitions in the 1-3 eV
range seen by ellipsometry. This unexpected change of the resonance condition
allows us to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between Raman and x-ray
detection of magnetic fluctuations in superconducting cuprates. Intriguingly,
the strongest variation occurs across the doping level where the antinodal
superconducting gap reaches its maximum.
