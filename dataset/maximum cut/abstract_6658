Two distinct models of feedback, suited for FDD (Frequency Division Duplex)
and TDD (Frequency Division Duplex) systems respectively, have been widely
studied in the literature. In this paper, we compare these two models of
feedback in terms of the diversity multiplexing tradeoff for varying amount of
channel state information at the terminals. We find that, when all
imperfections are accounted for, the maximum achievable diversity order in FDD
systems matches the diversity order in TDD systems. TDD systems achieve better
diversity order at higher multiplexing gains. In FDD systems, the maximum
diversity order can be achieved with just a single bit of feedback. Additional
bits of feedback (perfect or imperfect) do not affect the diversity order if
the receiver does not know the channel state information.
