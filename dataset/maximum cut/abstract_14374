The results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of the friction at
an interface between polymer melts and weakly attractive crystalline surfaces
are reported. We consider a coarse-grained bead-spring model of linear chains
with adjustable intrinsic stiffness. The structure and relaxation dynamics of
polymer chains near interfaces are quantified by the radius of gyration and
decay of the time autocorrelation function of the first normal mode. We found
that the friction coefficient at small slip velocities exhibits a distinct
maximum which appears due to shear-induced alignment of semiflexible chain
segments in contact with solid walls. At large slip velocities the decay of the
friction coefficient is independent of the chain stiffness. The data for the
friction coefficient and shear viscosity are used to elucidate main trends in
the nonlinear shear rate dependence of the slip length. The influence of chain
stiffness on the relationship between the friction coefficient and the
structure factor in the first fluid layer is discussed.
