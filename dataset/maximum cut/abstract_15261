When power grids are heavily stressed with a bulk power transfer, it is
useful to have a fast indication of the increased stress when multiple line
outages occur. Reducing the bulk power transfer when the outages are severe
could forestall further cascading of the outages. We show that synchrophasor
measurements of voltage angles at all the area tie lines can be used to
indicate the severity of multiple outages. These synchrophasor measurements are
readily combined into an "area angle" that can quickly track the severity of
multiple outages after they occur. We present a procedure to define thresholds
for the area angle that relate to the maximum power that can be transferred
through the area until a line limit is reached. Then in real time we would
monitor the area angle and compare it to the thresholds when line outages occur
to determine the urgency (or not) of actions to reduce the bulk transfer of
power through the area. The procedure also identifies exceptional cases in
which separate actions to resolve local power distribution problems are needed.
We illustrate the thresholds and monitoring with the area angle across several
states of Northwestern USA.
