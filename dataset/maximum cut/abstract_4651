We study the thermodynamics of the hard wall model, which consists in the
introduction of an infrared cut-off in asymptotically AdS spaces. This is a toy
model for confining backgrounds in the context of the gauge/gravity
correspondence. We use holographic renormalization and reproduce the existence
of a Hawking Page phase transition recently discussed by Herzog. We also show
that the entropy jumps from $N^0$ to $N^2$, which reinforces the interpretation
of this transition as the gravity dual of confinement/deconfinement. We also
show that similar results hold for the phenomenologically motivated soft wall
model, underlining the potential universality of our analysis.
