We study a noninteracting supersymmetric model in an expanding FRW spacetime.
A soft supersymmetry breaking induces a nonzero contribution to the vacuum
energy density. A short distance cutoff of the order of Planck length provides
a scale for the vacuum energy density comparable with the observed cosmological
constant. Assuming the presence of a dark energy substance in addition to the
vacuum fluctuations of the field an effective equation of state is derived in a
selfconsistent approach. The effective equation of state is sensitive to the
choice of the cut-off but no fine tuning is needed.
