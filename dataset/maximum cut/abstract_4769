In this Letter we investigate the possible emission of low-energy electron
neutrinos and electron-positron pairs of anomalously large multiplicity in
close-to-central $pp$ collisions at LHC. The scenario is based on confining
SU(2) Yang-Mills dynamics of Hagedorn temperature $\sim m_e=511 $keV being
responsible for the emergence of the lightest lepton family and the weak
interactions of the Standard Model. Although cut off by LHC's detectors these
electrons-positron bursts would be seen indirectly by a large defect energy and
thus an anomalously strong decrease of events with interesting high-energy
secondaries for increasing $\sqrt{s}$ . This is because the formation of
superconducting (preconfining) SU(2) hot-spots `steals' a large fraction of
$\sqrt{s}$ subsequently transferring it to a thermal spectrum of electron
neutrinos, electrons, and positrons liberated through evaporation. We thus
propose the detection of electrons and positrons of kinetic energy $\sim m_e$
and photons of energy $\sim 2 m_e$.
