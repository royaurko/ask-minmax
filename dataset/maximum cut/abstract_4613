I propose a scaling analysis of the hadron multiplicity ratio measured in
Deep Inelastic Scattering on nuclear targets as a tool to distinguish energy
loss and nuclear absorption effects on hadron suppression in cold nuclear
matter. The proposed scaling variable is a function of the hadron fractional
energy and of the virtual photon energy. Its functional form, which depends on
a parameter \lambda, can be fixed by general theoretical considerations and
encompasses both energy loss and absorption models. The parameter \lambda is
fitted to HERMES experimental data and shown to favor prehadron nuclear
absorption as leading mechanism for hadron suppression as opposed to quark
energy loss.
