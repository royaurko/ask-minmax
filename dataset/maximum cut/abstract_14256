We have estimated the masses of the central supermassive black holes of 2442
radio galaxies froma catalog compiled using data from the NED, SDSS, and CATS
databases. Mass estimates based on optical photometry and radio data are
compared. Relationships between the mass of the central black hole $M_p^{bh}$
and the redshift $z_p$ are constructed for both wavelength ranges. The
distribution of the galaxies in these diagrams and systematic effects
influencing estimation of the black-hole parameters are discussed.
Upperenvelope cubic regression fits are obtained using the maximum estimates of
the black-hole masses. The optical and radio upper envelopes show similar
behavior, and have very similar peaks in position, $z_p \simeq 1.9$, and
amplitude, $\log M_p^{bh}$ = 9.4. This is consistent with a model in which the
growth of the supermassive black holes is self-regulating, with this redshift
corresponding to the epoch when the accretion-flow phase begins to end and the
nuclear activity falls off.
