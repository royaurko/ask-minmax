Ultra High Energy Neutrino scattering on Relic Light Neutrinos in Dark
Galactic or Local Group lead to Z and WW,ZZ showering: the nucleon component of
the shower may overcome the GZK cut-off while the electro-magnetic tail at TeVs
up to EeVs energy may solve the Infrared-TeV cut-off in a natural way.
Different Gamma TeV puzzles may find a solution within this scenario: new
predictions on UHECR spectra in future data are derived.
