We present discoveries of SNe Ia at z > 1 and the photometric diagnostic used
to discriminate them from other types of SNe detected during the GOODS Hubble
Space Telescope Treasury program with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS).
Photometric redshift measurements of the hosts combined with deep f606w, f775w,
and f850lp imaging discriminates hydrogen-rich SNe II from SNe I at z > 1 by
exploiting the ultraviolet (UV) deficit in the energy distributions of SNe Ia.
This sorting allows rapid follow-up of space-based discoveries. Subsequent
spectroscopy of 11 GOODS SNe Ia obtained from the ground and with the grism on
ACS confirmed the reliability of our photometric screening. We present the
highest-redshift spectrum of any supernova published to date,
 SN Ia 2002fw at z = 1.3 observed near maximum brightness with the ACS grism.
  The lack of UV flux for true SNe Ia provides an effective tool for our
ongoing efforts to build a sample of SNe Ia at 1.2 < z < 1.8 which will extend
the useful range of the magnitude-redshift relation of SNe Ia.
