We present a new method of resummation of QCD threshold distributions to the
hard scattering function of the dilepton production cross section in
hadron-hadron collisions. Our formulation by-passes the infrared singularities
of the QCD running coupling through a principal value prescription, and does
not require an explicit infrared cut-off. The resulting large corrections
exponentiate, and we discuss asymptotic properties of the exponent. We present
a closed analytical formula for the resummed hard part in momentum space, and
give predictions, at fixed-target energies, for the resulting cross section
which is a bounded function of its kinematic variables in the entire partonic
phase space.
