Using direct-write atom lithography, Fe nanolines are deposited with a pitch
of 186 nm, a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 50 nm, and a height of up to
6 nm. These values are achieved by relying on geometrical collimation of the
atomic beam, thus without using laser collimation techniques. This opens the
way for applying direct-write atom lithography to a wide variety of elements.
