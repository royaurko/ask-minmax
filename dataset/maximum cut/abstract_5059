Lambek's non-associative syntactic calculus (NL) excels in its resource
consciousness: the usual structural rules for weakening, contraction, exchange
and even associativity are all dropped. Recently, there have been proposals for
conservative extensions dispensing with NL's intuitionistic bias towards
sequents with single conclusions: De Groote and Lamarche's classical
non-associative Lambek calculus (CNL) and the Lambek-Grishin calculus (LG) of
Moortgat and associates. We demonstrate Andreoli's focalization property for
said proposals: a normalization result for Cut-free sequent derivations
identifying to a large extent those differing only by trivial rule
permutations. In doing so, we proceed from a `uniform' sequent presentation,
deriving CNL from LG through the addition of structural rules. The
normalization proof proceeds by the construction of syntactic phase models
wherein every `truth' has a focused proof, similar to work of Okada and of
Herbelin and Lee.
