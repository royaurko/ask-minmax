The observed iron K-alpha fluorescence lines in Seyfert-1 galaxies provide
strong evidence for an accretion disk near a supermassive black hole as a
source of the line emission. These lines serve as powerful probes for examining
the structure of inner regions of accretion disks. Previous studies of line
emission have considered geometrically thin disks only, where the gas moves
along geodesics in the equatorial plane of a black hole. Here we extend this
work to consider effects on line profiles from finite disk thickness, radial
accretion flow and turbulence. We adopt the Novikov and Thorne (1973) solution,
and find that within this framework, turbulent broadening is the dominant new
effect. The most prominent change in the skewed, double-horned line profiles is
a substantial reduction in the maximum flux at both red and blue peaks. The
effect is most pronounced when the inclination angle is large, and when the
accretion rate is high. Thus, the effects discussed here may be important for
future detailed modeling of high quality observational data.
