Dynamic properties of the three-dimensional single-band Hubbard model are
studied using Quantum Monte Carlo combined with the maximum entropy technique.
At half-filling, there is a clear gap in the density of states and well-defined
quasiparticle peaks at the top (bottom) of the lower (upper) Hubbard band. We
find an antiferromagnetically induced weight above the naive Fermi momentum.
Upon hole doping, the chemical potential moves to the top of the lower band
where a robust peak is observed. Results are compared with spin-density-wave
(SDW) mean-field and self consistent Born approximation results, and also with
the infinite dimensional Hubbard model, and experimental photoemission (PES)
for three dimensional transition-metal oxides.
