Recently we have proposed a new cut-off scheme for pion loop integrals in the
two-pion exchange potential. This method allows for a consistent implementation
of constraints from pion-nucleon scattering and has been successfully applied
to peripheral nucleon-nucleon partial waves. We now consider low partial waves
in the non-perturbative regime, where the regularized Lippmann-Schwinger
equation has to be solved in order to generate the bound and scattering states.
We observe an improved description of most of the phase shifts when going from
next-to- to next-to-next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion. We also find
a good description of the deuteron properties. In addition, the new cut-off
scheme allows to avoid the presence of unphysical deeply bound states. We
discuss the cut-off dependence of the four-nucleon low-energy constants and
show that their numerical values can be understood in terms of resonance
saturation. This connects the effective field theory approach to boson exchange
phenomenology.
