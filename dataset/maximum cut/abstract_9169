The $t-U-V-J$ model is used to describe the positions of the experimental
peaks associated with commensurate and incommensurate structure of the magnetic
susceptibility probed by neutron scattering in cuprate compounds. Assuming that
the tight-binding form of the mean-field electron energy and the maximum gap
can be obtained by fitting the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) data, we have determined the strengths of the on-site repulsive
interaction $U$, the spin-independent attractive interaction $V$ and the
spin-dependent antiferromagnetic interaction $J$ from the positions of the
commensurate and incommensurate peaks.
