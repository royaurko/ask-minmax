The very precise combined HERA data provides a testing ground in which the
relevance of novel QCD regimes, other than the successful linear DGLAP
evolution, in small-x inclusive DIS data can be ascertained. We present a study
of the dependence of the AAMQS fits, based on the running coupling BK
non-linear evolution equations (rcBK), on the fitted dataset. This allows for
the identification of the kinematical region where rcBK accurately describes
the data, and thus for the determination of its applicability boundary. We
compare the rcBK results with NNLO DGLAP fits, obtained with the NNPDF
methodology with analogous kinematical cuts. Further, we explore the impact on
LHC phenomenology of applying stringent kinematical cuts to the low-x HERA data
in a DGLAP fit.
