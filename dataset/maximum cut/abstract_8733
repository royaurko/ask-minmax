We describe new numerical methods to solve the static axisymmetric vacuum
Einstein equations in more than four dimensions. As an illustration, we study
the compactified non-uniform black string phase connected to the uniform
strings at the Gregory-Laflamme critical point. We compute solutions with a
ratio of maximum to minimum horizon radius up to nine. For a fixed
compactification radius, the mass of these solutions is larger than the mass of
the classically unstable uniform strings. Thus they cannot be the end state of
the instability.
