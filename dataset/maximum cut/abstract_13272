There is a gap between single-species model predictions, and empirical
studies, regarding the effect of habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., a process
involving the breaking apart of habitat without loss of habitat. Empirical
works indicate that fragmentation can have positive as well as negative
effects, whereas, traditionally, single-species models predict a negative
effect of fragmentation. Within the class of reaction-diffusion models, studies
almost unanimously predict such a detrimental effect. In this paper,
considering a single-species reaction-diffusion model with a removal -- or
similarly harvesting -- term, in two dimensions, we find both positive and
negative effects of fragmentation of the reserves, i.e. the protected regions
where no removal occurs. Fragmented reserves lead to higher population sizes
for time-constant removal terms. On the other hand, when the removal term is
proportional to the population density, higher population sizes are obtained on
aggregated reserves, but maximum yields are attained on fragmented
configurations, and for intermediate harvesting intensities.
