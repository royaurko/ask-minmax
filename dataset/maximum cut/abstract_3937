In this letter we report a Chandra X-ray detection of the double northern hot
spot of the radio quasar 3C 351. The hot spot has also been observed in the
optical with the Hubble Space Telescope (R-band) and with the 3.5m. Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo (B-band). The radio-to-optical and X-ray spectra are
interpreted as the results of the synchrotron and synchrotron-self-Compton
(SSC) mechanisms, respectively, with hot-spot magnetic field strengths ~3 times
smaller than the equipartition values. In the framework of shock acceleration
theory, we show that the requirement for such a relatively small field strength
is in agreement with the fitted synchrotron spectral models and with the sizes
of the hot spots. Finally, we show that the combination of a lower magnetic
field strength with the high frequencies of the synchrotron cut-off in the
fitted synchrotron spectra provides strong evidence for electron acceleration
in the hot spots.
