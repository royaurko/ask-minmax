The rapidity-even dipolar flow v1 associated with dipole asymmetry in the
initial geometry is measured over a broad range in transverse momentum 0.5
GeV<pT<9 GeV, and centrality (0-50)% in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=2.76
TeV, recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The v1 coefficient is
determined via a two-component fit of the first order Fourier coefficient,
v_{1,1}= cos \Delta\phi, of two-particle correlations in azimuthal angle
\Delta\phi=\phi_a-\phi_b as a function of pT^a and pT^b. This fit is motivated
by the finding that the pT dependence of v_{1,1}(pT^a,pT^b) data are consistent
with the combined contributions from a rapidity-even v1 and global momentum
conservation. The magnitude of the extracted momentum conservation component
suggests that the system conserving momentum involves only a subset of the
event (spanning about 3 units in \eta in central collisions). The extracted v1
is observed to cross zero at pT~1.0 GeV, reaches a maximum at 4-5 GeV with a
value comparable to that for v3, and decreases at higher pT. Interestingly, the
magnitude of v1 at high pT exceeds the value of the v3 in all centrality
interval and exceeds the value of v2 in central collisions. This behavior
suggests that the path-length dependence of energy loss and initial dipole
asymmetry from fluctuations corroborate to produce a large dipolar anisotropy
for high pT hadrons, making the v1 a valuable probe for studying the jet
quenching phenomena.
