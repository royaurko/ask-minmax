We formulate a real-space renormalization group (RG) approach for efficient
numerical analysis of the low-temperature hopping dynamics in energy-disordered
lattices. The approach explicitly relies on the time-scale separation of the
trapping/escape dynamics. This time-scale separation allows to treat the
hopping dynamics as a hierarchal process, an RG step being a transformation
between the levels of the hierarchy. We apply the proposed RG approach to
analyze hopping dynamics in one- and two-dimensional lattices with varying
degree of energy disorder, and find the approach to be more accurate at low
temperatures and computationally much faster, than the direct diagonalization.
Applicability criteria of the proposed approach with respect to the time-scale
separation and the maximum number of hierarchy levels are formulated. RG flows
of energy distribution and preexponents of the Miller-Abrahams model are
analyzed.
