We search for infrared zeros of the beta function and evaluate the anomalous
dimension of the mass at the associated fixed point for asymptotically free
vector-like fermionic gauge theories with gauge group SU(N). The fixed points
of the beta function are studied at the two, three and four loop level in two
different explicit schemes. These are the modified regularization invariant,
RI', scheme and the minimal momentum subtraction, mMOM, scheme. The search is
performed in Landau gauge where the beta function of the gauge parameter
vanishes. We then compare our findings to earlier identical investigations
performed in the modified minimal subtraction, $\bar{\text{MS}}$, scheme.
  It is found that the value of the anomalous dimension of the mass is smaller
at three and four loops than at two loops. This seems to be a generic pattern
that is observed in all three different schemes. We then estimate the value of
the anomalous dimension to be $\gamma \sim 0.225-0.375$ for twelve fundamental
flavors and three colors, $\gamma \sim 0.500 - 0.593$ for two adjoint flavors
and two colors and finally $\gamma \sim 1.12-1.70$ for two two-indexed flavors
and three colors with the lower and upper bound set by the minimum and maximum
value respectively over all three schemes and at three and four loops. Our
analysis suggests that the former two theories lie in the conformal window
while the latter belongs to the chirally broken phase.
