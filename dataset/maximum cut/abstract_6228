The spectral statistics of even-even rare-earth nuclei are investigated by
using all the available empirical data for Ba, Ce, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Er, Yb and
Hf isotopes. The Berry- Robnik distribution and Maximum Likelihood estimation
technique are used for analyses. An obvious deviation from GOE is observed for
considered nuclei and there are some suggestions about the effect due to mass,
deformation parameter and shell model configurations.
