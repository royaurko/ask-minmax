Z pinches produce an X ray rich plasma environment where backlighting imaging
of imploding targets can be quite challenging to analyze. What is required is a
detailed understanding of the implosion dynamics by studying snapshot images of
its in flight deformations away from a spherical shell. We have used wavelets,
curvelets and multiresolution analysis techniques to address some of these
difficulties and to establish the Shell Thickness Averaged Radius (STAR) of
maximum density, r*(N, {\theta}), where N is the percentage of the shell
thickness over which we average. The non-uniformities of r*(N, {\theta}) are
quantified by a Legendre polynomial decomposition in angle, {\theta}, and the
identification of its largest coefficients. Undecimated wavelet decompositions
outperform decimated ones in denoising and both are surpassed by the curvelet
transform. In each case, hard thresholding based on noise modeling is used.
