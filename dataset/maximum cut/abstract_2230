In view of the intriguing, preliminary search results for instanton-induced
events at HERA from the H1 collaboration, some important remaining theoretical
issues are discussed. Notably, the question is addressed, to which extent the
H1 analysis may be directly compared to our original predictions from
instanton-perturbation theory, since certain fiducial cuts are lacking in the
H1 data. Various theoretical uncertainties are evaluated and their impact on
the observed excess is discussed. An improved understanding of the experimental
findings along with an encouraging over-all agreement with our original
predictions seems to emerge.
