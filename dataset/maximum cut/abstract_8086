The Fermi velocity ($v_{F}$) associated with the spin-orbit coupling is two
orders of magnitude smaller for spintronic semiconductors than it is for
topological insulators. Both families can be treated with the same Hamiltonian
which contains a relativistic (Dirac) linear in momentum term proportional to
$v_{F}$ and a non-relativistic quadratic contribution with Schr\"{o}dinger mass
(m). We find that the AC dynamic longitudinal and transverse (Hall)
magneto-conductivities are strongly dependent on the size of $v_{F}$. When the
Dirac fermi velocity is small, the absorption background provided by the
interband optical transitions is finite only over a very limited range of
photon energies as compared with topological insulators. Its onset depends on
the value of the chemical potential ($\mu$) and on the magnetic field (B), as
does its upper cut off. Within this limited range its magnitude is however
constant and has the same magnitude of $e^{2}\pi/(8h)$ as is found in
topological insulators and also in graphene noting a difference in degeneracy
factor. The total optical spectral weight under the universal interband
background is $e^{2}\pi/(8h)4mv_{F}^{2}$. In contrast to the known result for
graphene no strict conservation law applies to the spectral weight transfers
between inter and intra band transition brought about by variations in the
magnitude of the chemical potential when a non-relativistic contribution is
present in the Hamiltonian whatever size it may have.
