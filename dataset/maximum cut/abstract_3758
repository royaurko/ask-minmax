In 2-neighborhood bootstrap percolation on a graph G, an infection spreads
according to the following deterministic rule: infected vertices of G remain
infected forever and in consecutive rounds healthy vertices with at least 2
already infected neighbors become infected. Percolation occurs if eventually
every vertex is infected. The maximum time t(G) is the maximum number of rounds
needed to eventually infect the entire vertex set. In 2013, it was proved
\cite{eurocomb13} that deciding whether $t(G)\geq k$ is polynomial time
solvable for k=2, but is NP-Complete for k=4 and, if the problem is restricted
to bipartite graphs, it is NP-Complete for k=7. In this paper, we solve the
open questions. We obtain an $O(mn^5)$-time algorithm to decide whether
$t(G)\geq 3$. For bipartite graphs, we obtain an $O(mn^3)$-time algorithm to
decide whether $t(G)\geq 3$, an $O(m^2n^9)$-time algorithm to decide whether
$t(G)\geq 4$ and we prove that $t(G)\geq 5$ is NP-Complete.
