Spiral galaxies can be affected by interactions in clusters, that also may
distort the internal velocity field. If unrecognized from single-slit
spectroscopy, this could lead to a wrong determination of the maximum rotation
velocity as pointed out by Ziegler et al. (2003). This parameter directly
enters into the Tully-Fisher relation, an important tool to investigate the
evolution of spiral galaxies. To overcome this problem, we measure the
2D-velocity fields by observing three different slit positions per galaxy using
FORS2 at the VLT providing us with full coverage of each galaxy and an adequate
spatial resolution. The kinematic properties are compared to structural
features determined on the HST/ACS images to assess possible interaction
processes. As a next step, the whole analysis will be performed for three more
clusters, so that we will be able to establish a high-accuracy TFR for spirals
at z~0.5.
