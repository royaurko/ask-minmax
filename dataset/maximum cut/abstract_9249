A magnetic detector such as MINOS which is measuring the sign of muons has to
deal with issues of bending, which depend on the magnetic field configuration,
and multiple scattering, which depends on the amount of material which is
traversed. Above some momentum which depends on these factors, the momentum
cannot be resolved. Issues related to measurement of the muon charge ratio in
MINOS are discussed.
