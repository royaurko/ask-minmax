Employing new precision data of the equation of state of the SU(3) Yang-Mills
theory (gluon plasma) the dilaton potential of a gravity-dual model is adjusted
in the temperature range $(1 - 10) T_c$ within a bottom-up approach. The ratio
of bulk viscosity to shear viscosity follows then as $\zeta/\eta \approx \pi
\Delta v_s^2$ for $\Delta v_s^2 < 0.2$ and achieves a maximum value of $0.94$
at $\Delta v_s^2 \approx 0.3$, where $\Delta v_s^2 \equiv 1/3 - v_s^2$ is the
non-conformality measure and $v_s^2$ is the velocity of sound squared, while
the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density is known as $(4 \pi)^{-1}$ for
the considered set-up with Hilbert action on the gravity side.
