A correlative study between the geomagnetic indices and the peak values of
various plasma and field parameters during rising, maximum and decay phases as
well as during complete solar cycle 23 have been presented. We have also
presented the lag/lead analysis between the maximum of Dst and peak values of
plasma and field parameters and found that peak values of lag/lead time lies in
the +/-10 hr interval. Three geomagnetic storms (GMSs) and associated solar
sources observed during these phases of this solar cycle have also been studied
and found that GMSs are associated with large flares and halo CMEs.
