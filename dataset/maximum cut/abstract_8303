Several large volume, high energy neutrino detectors are in operation or in
the design stage. Upward going signal neutrino events must be separated from
large backgrounds of downgoing cosmic ray induced atmospheric muons. To this
end, a Bayesian extension of the traditional maximum likelihood reconstruction
method will be described. Further, it will be shown how signals can be
separated from backgrounds through integration of Bayesian posterior
probability densities.
