We study the topological properties of fuzzy sphere. We show that the
topological charge is only defined modulo N+1, that is finite integer quotient
Z_{N+1}, where N is a cut-off spin of fuzzy sphere. This periodic structure on
topological charges is shown based on the boson realizations of SU(2) algebra,
Schwinger vs. Holstein-Primakoff. We argue that this result can have a natural
K-theory interpretation and the topological charges on fuzzy sphere can be
classified by the twisted K-theory. We also outline how solitons on fuzzy
sphere can realize D-brane solitons in the presence of Neveu-Schwarz fivebranes
proposed by Harvey and Moore.
