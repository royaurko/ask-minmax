We present single-epoch, post-maximum spectropolarimetry of four Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) that span a range of spectral and photometric properties:
SN 2002bf and SN 2004dt exhibit unusually high-velocity (HV) absorption lines.
SN 1997dt is probably somewhat subluminous, and SN 2003du is slightly
overluminous. We detect polarization modulations across strong lines in all
four objects, demonstrating that all are intrinsically polarized. However, the
nature and degree of the polarization varies considerably. Including all SNe Ia
studied thus far, the following order emerges in terms of increasing strength
of line-polarization features: ordinary/overluminous < subluminous < HV SNe Ia,
with the strength of the line-polarization features increasing from 0.2% in the
slightly overluminous SN 2003du to 2% in both of the HV SNe Ia in our study.
The most convincing explanation for the line polarization of all objects is
partial obscuration of the photosphere by clumps of intermediate-mass elements
(IMEs) forged in the explosion; the polarization characteristics of the HV SNe
Ia in particular effectively rule out a simple ellipsoidal asphericity as the
root cause of their line polarization. That SNe Ia are separable into different
groups based on their spectropolarimetric characteristics may help narrow down
progenitor possibilities and/or explosion physics. In particular, the recently
proposed gravitationally confined detonation model may provide an attractive
explanation for many of the observed polarization characteristics of HV SNe Ia.
