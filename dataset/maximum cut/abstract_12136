The statistical theory of certain complex wave interference phenomena, like
the statistical fluctuations of transmission and reflection of waves, is of
considerable interest in many fields of physics. In this article we shall be
mainly interested in those situations where the complexity derives from the
quenched randomness of scattering potentials, as in the case of disordered
conductors, or, more in general, disordered waveguides. In studies performed in
such systems one has found remarkable statistical regularities, in the sense
that the probability distribution for various macroscopic quantities involves a
rather small number of relevant physical parameters, while the rest of the
microscopic details serves as mere "scaffolding". We shall review past work in
which this feature was captured following a maximum-entropy approach, as well
as later studies in which the existence of a limiting distribution, in the
sense of a generalized central-limit theorem, has been actually demonstrated.
We then describe a microscopic potential model that was developed recently,
which gives rise to a further generalization of the central-limit theorem and
thus to a limiting macroscopic statistics.
