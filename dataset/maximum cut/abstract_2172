We compare the BFKL prediction for the associated production of forward jets
at HERA with fixed-order matrix element calculations taking into account the
kinematical cuts imposed by experimental conditions. Comparison with H1 data of
the 1993 run favours the BFKL prediction. As a further signal of BFKL dynamics,
we propose to look for the azimuthal dependence of the forward jets.
