We calculate effective potentials in scalar field theories on the maximally
supersymmetric pp-wave background in ten dimensions. For this purpose we have
to work in the light-cone formulation, and hence we introduce two methods to
compute them in the light-cone frame. One is to use the Yan's formula for
evaluating one-loop correction terms. The other is to introduce a cut-off for
the light-cone momentum. These methods are also confirmed in the case of
Minkowski spacetime.
