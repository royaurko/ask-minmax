The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is the special case of the renormalized Yukawa
model with the compositeness condition. We use it to calculate the effective
coupling constants in terms of the compositeness sale (momentum cut off) at the
next-to-leading order in 1/N. The next-to-leading correction is too large in
the model of scalar composite, while that in the induced gauge theory is
reasonably suppressed due to the gauge cancellation of the leading divergences.
