In the real-time thermal field theory, the pion self-energy at finite
temperature and density is evaluated where the different mesonic and baryonic
loops are considered. The interactions of pion with the other mesons and
baryons in the medium are governed by the effective hadronic Lagrangian
densities whose effective strength of coupling constants have been determined
from the experimental decay widths of the mesons and baryons. The detail branch
cut structures of these different mesonic and baryonic loops are analyzed. The
Landau cut contributions of different baryon and meson loops become only
relevant around the pion pole and it is completely appeared in presence of
medium. The in-medium spectral function of pion has been plotted for different
values of temperature, baryon chemical potential as well as three momentum of
the pion. A noticeable low mass probability in pion spectral function promise
to contribute in the low mass dilepton enhancement via indirect modification of
$\rho$ self-energy for $\pi\pi$ loop.
