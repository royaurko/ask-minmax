Starting from the relation between the kinetic energy of a free
Levy-Schroedinger particle and the logarithmic characteristic of the underlying
stochastic process, we show that it is possible to get a precise relation
between renormalizable field theories and a specific Levy process. This
subsequently leads to a particular cut-off in the perturbative diagrams and can
produce a phenomenological mass spectrum that allows an interpretation of
quarks and leptons distributed in the three families of the standard model.
