We consider reduced-rank modeling of the white noise covariance matrix in a
large dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) model. We first propose the
reduced-rank covariance estimator under the setting where independent
observations are available. We derive the reduced-rank estimator based on a
latent variable model for the vector observation and give the analytical form
of its maximum likelihood estimate. Simulation results show that the
reduced-rank covariance estimator outperforms two competing covariance
estimators for estimating large dimensional covariance matrices from
independent observations. Then we describe how to integrate the proposed
reduced-rank estimator into the fitting of large dimensional VAR models, where
we consider two scenarios that require different model fitting procedures. In
the VAR modeling context, our reduced-rank covariance estimator not only
provides interpretable descriptions of the dependence structure of VAR
processes but also leads to improvement in model-fitting and forecasting over
unrestricted covariance estimators. Two real data examples are presented to
illustrate these fitting procedures.
