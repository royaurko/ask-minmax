The design of the Linac Coherent Light Source assumes that a low-emittance,
1-nC, 10-ps beam will be available for injection into the 15-GeV linac. The
proposed rf photocathode injector that will provide a 150-MeV beam with rms
normalized emittances of 1 mm in both the transverse and longitudinal
dimensions is based on a 1.6-cell S-band rf gun that is equipped with an
emittance compensating solenoid. The booster accelerator is positioned at the
beam waist coinciding with the first emittance maximum and is provided with an
accelerating gradient of ~25 MeV/m, i.e., the "new working point." The uv
pulses required for cathode excitation will be generated by tripling the output
of a Ti:sapphire laser system consisting of a highly stable cw mode-locked
oscillator and two bow-tie amplifiers pumped by a pair of Q-switched Nd:YAG
lasers. The large bandwidth of the Ti:sapphire system accommodates the desired
temporal pulse shaping. Details of the design and the supporting simulations
are presented.
