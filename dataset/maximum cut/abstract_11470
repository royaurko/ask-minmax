The recent discovery, based on a search of public OGLE data, of Be star
candidates in the Small Magellanic Cloud showing spectacular photometric
variations (Mennickent et al. 2002), has motivated further analysis of their
light curves. Here we report the results of a statistical study of the light
curves of Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 stars. Type-3 stars show a bimodal period
distribution, with a main, broad peak, between 20 and 130 days, and a narrower,
secondary peak, between 140 and 210 days. We also find that, among Type-3
stars, the maximum amplitude of oscillation correlates with the system
luminosity, in the sense that only low luminosity systems show large amplitude
oscillations. In general, the amplitude of these oscillations tends to increase
with the photometric period. A parametric study shows no correlation between
the amplitude, duration and asymmetry of Type-1 outbursts, and amplitude of
Type-2 jumps, with the available stellar photometric parameters.
