The complete form of the equation of state of strangeness rich proto-neutron
and neutron star matter has been obtained. The currently obtained lower value
of the Lambda Lambda potential at the level of 5 MeV permits the existence of
additional parameter set which reproduces the weaker Lambda Lambda interaction.
The effects of the strength of hyperon-hyperon interactions on the equations of
state constructed for the chosen parameter set have been analyzed. It has been
shown that replacing the strong Y-Y interaction model by the weak one
introduces large differences in the composition of a proto-neutron star matter
both in the strange and non-strange sectors. Also concentrations of neutrinos
have been significantly altered in proto-neutron star interiors. The performed
calculations have indicated that the change of the hyperon-hyperon coupling
constants affects the value of the proto-neutron star maximum mass.
