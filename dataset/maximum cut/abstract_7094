The enclosed tests demonstrate that an effective pitch can be attributed to
acoustic signals shorter then tenths of milliseconds. A power-law dependence of
this pitch on the signal's duration time is found for subjects tested with
Gaussian pulses. The discrimination threshold for the pulse duration time
reported on the basis of the effective pitch increases proportionally to the
duration time itself, i.e. it follows the Weber-Fechner law. A model based on
the "Helmholtz's harp" idea, i.e. a series of damped resonators tuned in the
audible range of frequencies, reveals the mechanism of producing a maximum in
the filtered spectrum of the pulse. This corroborates the power law in the
dependence of the position of the maximum on the duration time of the pulse.
The model indicates a possibility of designing a manmade device dedicated to
determination of the durations so short that they are inaccessible by direct
measurements.
