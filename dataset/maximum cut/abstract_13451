We consider a Periodic Anderson Model (PAM) with a momentum-dependent
inter-band hybridization that is strongly suppressed near the Fermi level.
Under these conditions, we reduce the PAM to an effective low-energy
Hamiltonian, $H_{\rm eff}$, by expanding in the small parameter $V_0/t$ ( $V_0$
is the maximum inter-band hybridization amplitude and $t$ is the hopping
integral of the broad band). The resulting model consists of a t-J f-band
coupled via the Kondo exchange to the electrons in the broad band. $H_{\rm
eff}$ allows for studying the f-electron delocalization transition. The result
is a doping-induced Mott transition for the f-electron delocalization, which we
demonstrate by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations.
