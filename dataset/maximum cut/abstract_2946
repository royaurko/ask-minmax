The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer has observed the nearest radio galaxy,
Centaurus A, in 13 intervals from 1966 August to 2009 February over the 3--200
keV band. Spectra accumulated over the 13 intervals were well described with an
absorbed power law and iron line. Cut-off power laws and Compton reflection
from cold matter did not provide a better description. For the 2009 January
observation, we set a lower limit on the cut-off energy at over 2 MeV. The
power spectral density function was generated from RXTE/ASM and PCA data, as
well as an XMM-Newton long look, and clear evidence for a break at 18+10-7 days
(68% conf.) was seen. Given Cen A's high black hole mass and very low value of
Lx/LEdd, the break was a factor of 17+/-9 times higher than the break frequency
predicted by the McHardy and co-workers' relation, which was empirically
derived for a sample of objects, which are radio-quiet and accreting at
relatively high values of Lbol/LEdd. We have interpreted our observations in
the context of a clumpy molecular torus. The variability characteristics and
the broadband spectral energy distribution, when compared to Seyferts, imply
that the bright hard X-ray continuum emission may originate at the base of the
jet, yet from behind the absorbing line of sight material, in contrast to what
is commonly observed from blazars.
