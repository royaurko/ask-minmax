We designed and demonstrate a fiber-based amplified spontaneous emission
(ASE) source with low spatial coherence, low temporal coherence, and high power
per mode. ASE is produced by optically pumping a large gain core multimode
fiber while minimizing optical feedback to avoid lasing. The fiber ASE source
provides 270 mW of continuous wave emission, centered at {\lambda}=1055 nm with
a full-width half-maximum bandwidth of 74 nm. The emission is distributed among
as many as ~70 spatial modes, enabling efficient speckle suppression when
combined with spectral compounding. Finally, we demonstrate speckle-free full
field imaging using the fiber ASE source. The fiber ASE source provides a
unique combination of high power per mode with both low spatial and low
temporal coherence, making it an ideal source for full-field imaging and
ranging applications.
