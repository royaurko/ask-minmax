Single MeV electrons subjected in vacuum to single high-intensity
quadratically-chirped laser pulses are shown to gain multi-GeV energies. The
laser pulses are modeled by finite-duration trapezoidal and $\cos^2$
pulse-shapes and the equations of motion are solved numerically. It is found
that, typically, the maximum energy gain from interaction with a quadratic
chirp is about half of what would be gained from a linear chirp.
