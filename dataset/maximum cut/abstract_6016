Walter Rudin, in 1966, characterized analytic functions in the unit disk in
terms of the maximum principle relative to the boundary. We conjecture a
generalization of this result when the disk is replaced by the punctured disk,
and we prove a special case of this conjecture, making use of the notion of
projective hull in P^n introduced by R. Harvey and B. Lawson.
