Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is a statistical method for post-processing
forecast ensembles of atmospheric variables, obtained from multiple runs of
numerical weather prediction models, in order to create calibrated predictive
probability density functions (PDFs). The BMA predictive PDF of the future
weather quantity is the mixture of the individual PDFs corresponding to the
ensemble members and the weights and model parameters are estimated using
ensemble members and validating observation from a given training period.
  In the present paper we introduce a BMA model for calibrating wind speed
forecasts, where the components PDFs follow truncated normal distribution with
cut-off at zero, and apply it to the ALADIN-HUNEPS ensemble of the Hungarian
Meteorological Service. Three parameter estimation methods are proposed and
each of the corresponding models outperforms the traditional gamma BMA model
both in calibration and in accuracy of predictions. Moreover, since here the
maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters does not require numerical
optimization, modelling can be performed much faster than in case of gamma
mixtures.
