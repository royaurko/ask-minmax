We consider the effect of the RKKY interaction between magnetic impurities on
the electron relaxation rates in a normal metal. The interplay between the RKKY
interaction and the Kondo effect may result in a non-monotonic temperature
dependence of the electron momentum relaxation rate, which determines the Drude
conductivity. The electron phase relaxation rate, which determines the
magnitude of the weak localization correction to the resistivity, is also a
non-monotonic function of temperature. For this function, we find the
dependence of the position of its maximum on the concentration of magnetic
impurities. We also relate the electron energy relaxation rate to the
excitation spectrum of the system of magnetic impurities. The energy relaxation
determines the distribution function for the out-of-equilibrium electrons.
Measurement of the electron distribution function thus may provide information
about the excitations in the spin glass phase.
