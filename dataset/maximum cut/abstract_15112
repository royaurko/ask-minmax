Phase mixing and eventual breaking of longitudinal Akhiezer - Polovin wave
subjected to a small amplitude longitudinal perturbation is studied
analytically. It is well known that longitudinal Akhiezer - Polovin wave breaks
via the process of phase mixing at an amplitude well below its breaking
amplitude, when subjected to arbitrarily small longitudinal perturbation[Phys.
Rev. Lett.108, 125005 (2012)]. Here we analytically show that the phase mixing
time (breaking time) has a linear dependence with phase velocity of the wave,
inverse square dependence with the maximum fluid velocity and it is inversely
proportional to the amplitude of perturbation. This analytical dependence of
phase mixing time on the above three parameters is further verified using
numerical simulations based on Dawson Sheet Model.
