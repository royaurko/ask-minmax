According to the cosmological principle, Universal large-scale structure is
homogeneous and isotropic. The observable Universe, however, shows complex
structures even on very large scales. The recent discoveries of structures
significantly exceeding the transition scale of 370 Mpc pose a challenge to the
cosmological principle.
  We report here the discovery of the largest regular formation in the
observable Universe; a ring with a diameter of 1720 Mpc, displayed by 9 gamma
ray bursts (GRBs), exceeding by a factor of five the transition scale to the
homogeneous and isotropic distribution. The ring has a major diameter of $43^o$
and a minor diameter of $30^o$ at a distance of 2770 Mpc in the 0.78<z<0.86
redshift range, with a probability of $2\times 10^{-6}$ of being the result of
a random fluctuation in the GRB count rate.
  Evidence suggests that this feature is the projection of a shell onto the
plane of the sky. Voids and string-like formations are common outcomes of
large-scale structure. However, these structures have maximum sizes of 150 Mpc,
which are an order of magnitude smaller than the observed GRB ring diameter.
Evidence in support of the shell interpretation requires that temporal
information of the transient GRBs be included in the analysis.
  This ring-shaped feature is large enough to contradict the cosmological
principle. The physical mechanism responsible for causing it is unknown.
