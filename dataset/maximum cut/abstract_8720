The finite momentum meson spectral function (MSF) in the pseudoscalar channel
is evaluated, adopting for the fermionic propagators HTL expressions. The
different contributions to the meson spectral functions are clearly displayed.
Our analysis may be of relevance for lattice studies of MSF based so far on the
Maximum Entropy Method. As a further step the correlation function along the
(imaginary-) temporal direction is evaluated.
