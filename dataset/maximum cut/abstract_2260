We analyze how can some dynamical process lead to (almost) exponential
distribution of hadrons without instantaneous equipartition with a heat bath.
We present a model for parton dressing whic re-combines the exponential from
cut power law minijet distributions as a limiting distribution. Thermal models
and power law tails are interpreted within the framework of the more general
Tsallis distribution.
