Quasi-stationary, or metastable, states play an important role in
two-dimensional turbulent fluid flows where they often emerge on time-scales
much shorter than the viscous time scale, and then dominate the dynamics for
very long time intervals. In this paper we propose a dynamical systems
explanation of the metastability of an explicit family of solutions, referred
to as bar states, of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equation
on the torus. These states are physically relevant because they are associated
with certain maximum entropy solutions of the Euler equations, and they have
been observed as one type of metastable state in numerical studies of
two-dimensional turbulence. For small viscosity (high Reynolds number), these
states are quasi-stationary in the sense that they decay on the slow, viscous
timescale. Linearization about these states leads to a time-dependent operator.
We show that if we approximate this operator by dropping a higher-order,
non-local term, it produces a decay rate much faster than the viscous decay
rate. We also provide numerical evidence that the same result holds for the
full linear operator, and that our theoretical results give the optimal decay
rate in this setting.
