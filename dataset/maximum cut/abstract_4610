Within spectator model we study the reaction ${\gamma}d \to K^-{\Theta}^+p
\to K^-K^+np$ in the threshold energy region. We present the predictions for
the exclusive and inclusive antikaon angular distributions in the laboratory
system for this reaction calculated for two possible parity states of the
${\Theta}^+$ resonance at 1.5 and 1.75 GeV beam energies with and without
imposing the relevant kinematical cuts on those parts of the sampled phase
space where contribution from the main background sources associated with the
${\phi}(1020)$, ${\Lambda}(1520)$ production as well as with the
$K^-p$--rescattering in the final state, is expected to be dominant. We show
that under chosen kinematics these distributions are sensitive to the
${\Theta}^+$ parity and, therefore, can be used as a filter for the
determination of its parity.
