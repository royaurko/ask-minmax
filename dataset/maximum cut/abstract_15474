We consider the problem of organizing a scattered group of $n$ robots in
two-dimensional space, with geometric maximum distance $D$ between robots. The
communication graph of the swarm is connected, but there is no central
contributority for organizing it. We want to arrange them into a sorted and
equally-spaced array between the robots with lowest and highest label, while
maintaining a connected communication network.
  In this paper, we describe a distributed method to accomplish these goals,
without using central control, while also keeping time, travel distance and
communication cost at a minimum. We proceed in a number of stages (leader
election, initial path construction, subtree contraction, geometric
straightening, and distributed sorting), none of which requires a central
contributority, but still accomplishes best possible parallelization. The overall
arraying is performed in $O(n)$ time, $O(n^2)$ individual messages, and $O(nD)$
travel distance. Implementation of the sorting and navigation use communication
messages of fixed size, and are a practical solution for large populations of
low-cost robots.
