Near-IR spectroscopy is presented for Nova Scorpii 2014. It is shown that the
outburst occurred in a symbiotic binary system - an extremely rare
configuration for a classical nova outburst to occur in but appropriate for the
eruption of a recurrent nova of the T CrB class. We estimate the spectral class
of secondary as M5III $\pm$ (two sub-classes). The maximum magnitude versus
rate of decline (MMRD) relations give an unacceptably large value of 37.5 kpc
for the distance. The spectra are typical of the He/N class of novae with
strong HeI and H lines. The profiles are broad and flat topped with full width
at zero intensities (FWZIs) approaching 9000-10000 km s$^{-1}$ and also have a
sharp narrow component superposed which is attributable to emission from the
giant's wind. Hot shocked gas, accompanied by X-rays and $\gamma$ rays, is
expected to form when the high velocity ejecta from the nova plows into the
surrounding giant wind. Although X-ray emission was observed no $\gamma$-ray
emission was reported. It is also puzzling that no signature of a decelerating
shock is seen in the near-infrared (NIR), seen in similar systems like RS Oph,
V745 Sco and V407 Cyg, as rapid narrowing of the line profiles. The small
outburst amplitude and the giant secondary strongly suggest that Nova Sco 2014
could be a recurrent nova.
