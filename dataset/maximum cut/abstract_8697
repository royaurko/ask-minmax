As a model for nonideal behavior in the equation of state of QCD at high
density, we consider cold quark matter in perturbation theory. To second order
in the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s$, the results depend sensitively on
the choice of the renormalization mass scale. Certain choices of this scale
correspond to a strongly first order chiral transition, and generate quark
stars with maximum masses and radii approximately half that of ordinary neutron
stars. At the center of these stars, quarks are essentially massless.
