We present two algorithms for unfolding the surface of any polyhedron, all of
whose faces are triangles, to a nonoverlapping, connected planar layout. The
surface is cut only along polyhedron edges. The layout is connected, but it may
have a disconnected interior: the triangles are connected at vertices, but not
necessarily joined along edges.
