We propose an extended Quantum Chromodynamics (XQCD) Lagrangian in which the
fermions are coupled to elementary scalar %$\sigma$ and $\pi$ fields through a
Yukawa coupling which preserves chiral invariance. Our principle motivation is
to find a new lattice formulation for QCD which avoids the source of critical
slowing down usually encountered as the bare quark mass is tuned to the chiral
limit. The phase diagram and the weak coupling limit for XQCD are studied. They
suggest a conjecture that the continuum limit of XQCD is the same as the
continuum limit of conventional lattice formulation of QCD. As examples of such
universality, we present the large N solutions of two prototype models for
XQCD, in which the mass of the spurious pion and sigma resonance go to infinity
with the cut-off. Even if the universality conjecture turns out to be false, we
believe that XQCD will still be useful as a low energy effective action for QCD
phenomenology on the lattice. Numerical simulations are recommended to further
investigate the possible benefits of XQCD in extracting QCD predictions.
