We investigate antikaon condensation in compact star matter using a
relativistic mean field model. Antikaon condensates make the equation of state
softer resulting in a smaller maximum mass star compared to the case without
condensate. It is found that the equation of state including antikaon
condensates gives rise to a stable sequence of compact stars called the third
family beyond the neutron star branch.
