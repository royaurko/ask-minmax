We study numerically scaling properties of the distribution of cumulative
energy dissipated in an avalanche and the dynamic phase transition in a
stochastic directed cellular automaton [B. Tadi\'c and D. Dhar, Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 79}, 1519 (1997)] in d=1+1 dimensions. In the critical steady state
occurring for the probability of toppling $p\ge p^\star$= 0.70548, the
dissipated energy distribution exhibits scaling behavior with new scaling
exponents $\tau_E $ and D_E for slope and cut-off energy, respectively,
indicating that the sandpile surface is a fractal. In contrast to avalanche
exponents, the energy exponents appear to be p- dependent in the region
$p^\star \le p <1$, however the product $(\tau_E-1)D_E$ remains universal. We
estimate the roughness exponent of the transverse section of the pile as $\chi
=0.44\pm 0.04$. Critical exponents characterizing the dynamic phase transition
at $p^\star $ are obtained by direct simulation and scaling analysis of the
survival probability distribution and the average outflow current. The
transition belongs to a new universality class with the critical exponents
$\nu_\| =\gamma =1.22 \pm 0.02$, $\beta =0.56\pm 0.02$ and $\nu_\bot = 0.761
\pm 0.029$, with apparent violation of hyperscaling. Generalized hyperscaling
relation leads to $\beta + \beta ^\prime = (d-1)\nu_\bot $, where $\beta
^\prime = 0.195 \pm 0.012$ is the exponent governed by the ultimate survival
probability.
