Families of generalized spatially-coupled low-density parity-check (GSC-LDPC)
code ensembles can be formed by terminating protograph-based generalized LDPC
convolutional (GLDPCC) codes. It has previously been shown that ensembles of
GSC-LDPC codes constructed from a protograph have better iterative decoding
thresholds than their block code counterparts, and that, for large termination
lengths, their thresholds coincide with the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) decoding
threshold of the underlying generalized LDPC block code ensemble. Here we show
that, in addition to their excellent iterative decoding thresholds, ensembles
of GSC-LDPC codes are asymptotically good and have large minimum distance
growth rates.
