The effect of doping on electronic and other related properties of PbO-type
FeSe1-xTex has been investigated theoretically using density functional method.
The elastic properties for mono- and poly-crystalline FeSe1-xTex system are
predicted for the first time and the results discussed. Analysis of doping
dependent band characteristics in conjunction with previous studies reveal that
favorable nesting of Fermi surface indicates a possible basis for understanding
why Tc in FeSe1-xTex is maximum for x ~ 0.5.
