Topological entanglement entropy, which is defined as the conditional mutual
information of a state for an annular region in a topologically ordered system,
is widely used to detect characteristic topological correlations in
topologically ordered phases. We investigate an information-theoretical meaning
of the topological entanglement entropy by analyzing a multi-partite
correlation measure called irreducible correlation. We prove that the
topological entanglement entropy is equivalent to the irreducible correlation
if the state has zero-correlation length. We further show that for
zero-correlation length states the irreducible correlation is equal to the
maximum communication rate of a particular class of secret sharing protocols.
Therefore, we provide an operational interpretation of the topological
entanglement entropy.
