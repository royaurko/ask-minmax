It is possible that quarks and/or leptons have substructure that will become
manifest at high energies. Here we investigate the limits on the muon
compositeness scale that could be obtained at the First Muon Collider using
Bhabha scattering. We study this limit as a function of the collider energy and
the angular cut imposed by the detector capability.
