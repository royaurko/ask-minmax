The excitation rate P of solar p-modes is computed with a model of stochatic
excitation which involves constraints on the averaged properties of the solar
turbulence. These constraints are obtained from a 3D simulation. Resulting
values for P are found ~9 times larger than when the calculation assumes
properties of turbulent convection which are derived from an 1D solar model
based on Gough (1977)'s formulation of the mixing-length theory (GMLT). This
difference is mainly due to the assumed values for the mean anisotropy of the
velocity field in each case.Calculations based on 3D constraints bring the P
maximum closer to the observational one.We also compute P for several models of
intermediate mass stars (1Mo < M < 2Mo). Differences in the values of P_max
between models computed with the classical mixing-length theory and GMLT models
are found large enough for main sequence stars to suggest that measurements of
P in this mass range will be able to discriminate between different models of
turbulent convection.
