Je\v{r}\'abek showed that cuts in propositional-logic deep-inference proofs
can be eliminated in quasipolynomial time. The proof is indirect and it relies
on a result of Atserias, Galesi and Pudl\'ak about monotone sequent calculus
and a correspondence between that system and cut-free deep-inference proofs. In
this paper we give a direct proof of Je\v{r}\'abek's result: we give a
quasipolynomial-time cut-elimination procedure in propositional-logic deep
inference. The main new ingredient is the use of a computational trace of
deep-inference proofs called atomic flows, which are both very simple (they
only trace structural rules and forget logical rules) and strong enough to
faithfully represent the cut-elimination procedure.
