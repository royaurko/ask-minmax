We investigate the onset of collective oscillations in a network of
pulse-coupled leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons in the presence of quenched and
annealed disorder. We find that the disorder induces a weak form of chaos that
is analogous to that arising in the Kuramoto model for a finite number N of
oscillators [O.V. Popovych at al., Phys. Rev. E 71} 065201(R) (2005)]. In fact,
the maximum Lyapunov exponent turns out to scale to zero for N going to
infinite, with an exponent that is different for the two types of disorder. In
the thermodynamic limit, the random-network dynamics reduces to that of a fully
homogenous system with a suitably scaled coupling strength. Moreover, we show
that the Lyapunov spectrum of the periodically collective state scales to zero
as 1/N^2, analogously to the scaling found for the `splay state'.
