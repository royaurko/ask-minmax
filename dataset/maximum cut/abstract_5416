We compute the Heegaard-Floer link homology of algebraic links in terms of
the multivariate Hilbert function of the corresponding plane curve
singularities. The main result of the paper identifies four homologies: (a) the
Heegaard-Floer link homology of the local embedded link of the germ, (b) the
lattice homology associated with the Hilbert function, (c) the homologies of
the projectivized complements of local hyperplane arrangements cut out from the
local algebra, and (d) a certain variant of the Orlik-Solomon algebra of these
local arrangements. In particular, the Poincar\'e polynomials of all these
homology groups are the same, and we also show that they agree with the
coefficients of the motivic Poincar\'e series of the singularity.
