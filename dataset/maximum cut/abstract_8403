In this paper we report measurements of conductance fluctuations in single
crystal samples of Si doped with P and B close to the critical composition of
the metal insulator transition (n_c \approx 4 x 10^18 /cc). The measurements
show that the noise, which arises from bulk sources, does not diverge as the
Ioffe-Regal limit (k_{F}l -> 1) is approached from the metallic side. At room
temperatures, the magnitude of the noise shows a shallow maximum around k_{F}l
\approx 1.5 and drops sharply as the insulating state is approached.
