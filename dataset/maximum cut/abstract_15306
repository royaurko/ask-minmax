The paper describes an electronic multiprocessor system that assures
functionality of a miniature UAV capable of 3D flying. The apparatus consists
of six independently controlled brushless DC motors, each having a propeller
attached to it. Since the brushless motor requires complex algorithms in order
to achieve maximum torque, efficiency and response time a DSP must be used. All
the motors are then controlled by a main microprocessor which is capable of
reading sensors (Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-orientation and GPS),
receiving input commands (remote controller or trajectory plan) and sending
independent commands to each of the six motors. The apparatus contains a total
of eight microcontrollers: the main unit, the IMU mathematical processor and
one microcontroller for each of the six brushless DC motors. Applications for
such an apparatus could include not only military, but also search-and-rescue,
geodetics, aerial photography and aerial assistance.
