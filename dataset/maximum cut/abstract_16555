The Configuration Interaction (CI) method using a very large Laguerre orbital
basis is applied to the calculation of the He ground state. The largest
calculations included a minimum of 35 radial orbitals for each l ranging from 0
to 12 resulting in basis sets in excess of 400 orbitals. The convergence of the
energy and electron-electron delta-function with respect to J (the maximum
angular momenta of the orbitals included in the CI expansion) were investigated
in detail. Extrapolations to the limit of infinite in angular momentum using
expansions of the type Delta X_J = A_X/(J+1/2)^p + B_X/(J+1/2)^(p+1) + ...,
gave an energy accurate to 10^(-7) Hartree and a value of <delta> accurate to
about 0.5%. Improved estimates of <E> and <delta>, accurate to 10^(-8) Hartree
and 0.01% respectively, were obtained when extrapolations to an infinite radial
basis were done prior to the determination of the J -> infty limit. Round-off
errors were the main impediment to achieving even higher precision since
determination of the radial and angular limits required the manipulation of
very small energy and <delta> differences.
