Four new probability models are derived which generalize the common
univariate continuous distributions. Classical distributional measures are
derived from Hoel, et al., Introduction to Probability Theory, 1971. Measures
include probability density function, moments generating function, cumulative
distribution function,derivatives, inverse distributions, skewness, kurtosis,
change of variable distributions, log distributions. Maximum likelihood
estimation technique is briefly outlined. Appendices describe applications.
Errata/addenda sheet included.
