Aiming at bridging the gap between the maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) and
the suboptimal iterative decodings for short or medium length LDPC codes, we
present a generalized ordered statistic decoding (OSD) in the form of syndrome
decoding, to cascade with the belief propagation (BP) or enhanced min-sum
decoding. The OSD is invoked only when the decoding failures are obtained for
the preceded iterative decoding method. With respect to the existing OSD which
is based on the accumulated log-likelihood ratio (LLR) metric, we extend the
accumulative metric to the situation where the BP decoding is in the
probability domain. Moreover, after generalizing the accumulative metric to the
context of the normalized or offset min-sum decoding, the OSD shows appealing
tradeoff between performance and complexity. In the OSD implementation, when
deciding the true error pattern among many candidates, an alternative proposed
proves to be effective to reduce the number of real additions without
performance loss. Simulation results demonstrate that the cascade connection of
enhanced min-sum and OSD decodings outperforms the BP alone significantly, in
terms of either performance or complexity.
