We describe the entire phase structure of a large number of colour
generalized Yang-Mills theories in 1+1 dimensions. This is illustrated by the
explicit computation for a quartic plus quadratic model. We show that the
Douglas-Kazakov and cut-off transitions are naturally present for generalized
Yang-Mills theories separating the phase space into three regions: a dilute one
a strongly interacting one and a degenerate one. Each region is separated into
sub-phases. For the first two regions the transitions between sub-phases are
described by the Jurekiewicz-Zalewski analysis. The cut-off transition and
degenerated phase arise only for a finite number of colours. We present
second-order phase transitions between sub-phases of the degenerate phase.
