An important form of prior information in clustering comes in form of
cannot-link and must-link constraints. We present a generalization of the
popular spectral clustering technique which integrates such constraints.
Motivated by the recently proposed $1$-spectral clustering for the
unconstrained problem, our method is based on a tight relaxation of the
constrained normalized cut into a continuous optimization problem. Opposite to
all other methods which have been suggested for constrained spectral
clustering, we can always guarantee to satisfy all constraints. Moreover, our
soft formulation allows to optimize a trade-off between normalized cut and the
number of violated constraints. An efficient implementation is provided which
scales to large datasets. We outperform consistently all other proposed methods
in the experiments.
