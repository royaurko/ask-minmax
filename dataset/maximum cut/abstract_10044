Excitation-energy distributions have been derived from measurements of
5.0-14.6 GeV/c antiproton, proton and pion reactions with $^{197}$Au target
nuclei, using the ISiS 4$\pi$ detector array. The maximum probability for
producing high excitation-energy events is found for the antiproton beam
relative to other hadrons, $^3$He and $\bar{p}$ beams from LEAR. For protons
and pions, the excitation-energy distributions are nearly independent of hadron
type and beam momentum above about 8 GeV/c. The excitation energy enhancement
for $\bar{p}$ beams and the saturation effect are qualitatively consistent with
intranuclear cascade code predictions. For all systems studied, maximum cluster
sizes are observed for residues with E*/A $\sim$ 6 MeV.
