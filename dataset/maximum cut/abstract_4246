WPHACT (W W and Higgs Physics with PHACT) is a MC program and unweighted
event generator which computes all Standard Model processes with four fermion
in the final state at $e^+ e^-$ colliders. It is based on an helicity amplitude
method which allows precise and fast evaluations of the matrix elements both
for massless and massive fermions. Fermion masses for $b$ quarks are exactly
taken into account. QED initial state and Coulomb corrections are evaluated,
while QCD final state corrections are included in an approximate formulation.
Cuts can be easily introduced and distributions for any variable at parton
level can be implemented. The contributions to the processes of neutral
Standard Model or Susy Higgs can be included. Anomalous couplings effects for
the triple coupling can be computed. An interface to hadronization is provided
and Jetset can be directly called from the program.
