We calculate the Laplace transform of the cut-and-join equation of Goulden,
Jackson and Vakil. The result is a polynomial equation that has the topological
structure identical to the Mirzakhani recursion formula for the Weil-Petersson
volume of the moduli space of bordered hyperbolic surfaces. We find that the
direct image of this Laplace transformed equation via the inverse of the
Lambert W-function is the topological recursion formula for Hurwitz numbers
conjectured by Bouchard and Marino using topological string theory.
