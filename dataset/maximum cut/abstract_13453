We investigate medium effects due to density-dependent magnetic moments of
baryons on neutron stars under strong magnetic fields. If we allow the
variation of anomalous magnetic moments (AMMs) of baryons in dense matter under
strong magnetic fields, AMMs of nucleons are enhanced to be larger than those
of hyperons. The enhancement naturally affects the chemical potentials of
baryons to be large and leads to the increase of a proton fraction.
Consequently, it causes the suppression of hyperons, resulting in the stiffness
of the equation of state. Under the presumed strong magnetic fields, we
evaluate relevant particles' population, the equation of state and the maximum
masses of neutron stars by including density-dependent AMMs and compare them
with those obtained from AMMs in free space.
