Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, evolving from the cerebral
supportive cells. For clinical follow-up, the evaluation of the preoperative
tumor volume is essential. Volumetric assessment of tumor volume with manual
segmentation of its outlines is a time-consuming process that can be overcome
with the help of segmentation methods. In this paper, a flexible semi-automatic
approach for grade IV glioma segmentation is presented. The approach uses a
novel segmentation scheme for spherical objects that creates a directed 3D
graph. Thereafter, the minimal cost closed set on the graph is computed via a
polynomial time s-t cut, creating an optimal segmentation of the tumor. The
user can improve the results by specifying an arbitrary number of additional
seed points to support the algorithm with grey value information and
geometrical constraints. The presented method is tested on 12 magnetic
resonance imaging datasets. The ground truth of the tumor boundaries are
manually extracted by neurosurgeons. The segmented gliomas are compared with a
one click method, and the semi-automatic approach yields an average Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 77.72% and 83.91%, respectively.
