The analytic expression of CRLB and the maximum likelihood estimator for the
sample frequency correlation matrices in doubly selective fading channels for
OFDM systems are reported in this paper. According to the analytical and
numerical results, the amount of samples affects the average mean square error
dominantly while the SNR and the Doppler spread do negligibly.
