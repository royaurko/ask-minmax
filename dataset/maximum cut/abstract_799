We present OPE predictions for the hadronic mass and q^2 moments in inclusive
semileptonic charmless B decays, with a lower cut on the charged lepton energy
and an upper cut on the hadronic invariant mass. We include non-perturbative
corrections through O(1/m_b^3) and perturbative contributions through
O(alpha_s^2 beta_0). We also investigate the range of the cut on the hadronic
mass for which the local OPE can be considered valid and give estimates of the
residual theoretical uncertainty. The study of these moments is important to
constrain the effect of the Weak Annihilation (WA) contributions and the shape
of the distribution function, providing a more precise inclusive determination
of V_ub.
