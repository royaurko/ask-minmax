This paper presents a fast computational method, the Expectation Maximization
algorithm, for Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation in diffusion tensor imaging
under the Rice noise model. We further extend the ML framework to the maximum a
posterior (MAP) estimation and describe the numerical similarities of both ML
and MAP estimators. This novel method is implemented and applied using both
synthetic and real data in a wide range of b amplitudes. The comparison with
other popular methods are made in accuracy, methodology and computation.
