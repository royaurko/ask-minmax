We analyze the structure and evolution of discussion cascades in four popular
websites: Slashdot, Barrapunto, Meneame and Wikipedia. Despite the big
heterogeneities between these sites, a preferential attachment (PA) model with
bias to the root can capture the temporal evolution of the observed trees and
many of their statistical properties, namely, probability distributions of the
branching factors (degrees), subtree sizes and certain correlations. The
parameters of the model are learned efficiently using a novel maximum
likelihood estimation scheme for PA and provide a figurative interpretation
about the communication habits and the resulting discussion cascades on the
four different websites.
