Clustering with submodular functions has been of interest over the last few
years. Symmetric submodular functions are of particular interest as minimizing
them is significantly more efficient and they include many commonly used
functions in practice viz. graph cuts, mutual information. In this paper, we
propose a novel constraint to make clustering actionable which is motivated by
applications across multiple domains, and pose the problem of performing
symmetric submodular clustering subject to this constraint. We see that
obtaining a $k$ partition with approximation guarantees is a non-trivial task
requiring further work.
