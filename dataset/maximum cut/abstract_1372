As shown in our previous experiments fine structure of histograms of
alpha-activity measurements serve as a sensitive tool for investigation of
cosmo-physical influences. Particularly, the histograms structure is changed
with the period equal to sidereal (1436 min) and solar (1440) day. It is
similar with the high probability in different geographic points at the same
local (longitude) time. More recently investigations were carried out with
collimators, cutting out separate flows of total alpha-particles flying out at
radioactive decay of 239Pu. These experiments revealed sharp dependence the
histogram structure on the direction of alpha-particles flow. In the presented
work measurements were made with collimators rotating in the plane of sky
equator. It was shown that during rotation the shape of histograms changes with
periods determined by number of revolution. These results correspond to the
assumption that the histogram shapes are determined by a picture of the
celestial sphere, and also by interposition of the Earth, the Sun and the Moon.
