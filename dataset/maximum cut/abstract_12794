We consider electrostatic plasma modes along the open field lines of a
rotating neutron star. Goldreich-Julian charge density in general relativity is
analyzed for the neutron star with zero inclination. It is found that the
charge density is maximum at the polar cap and it remains almost same in
certain extended region of the pole. For a steady state Goldreich-Julian charge
density we found the usual plasma oscillation along the field lines; plasma
frequency resembles to the gravitational redshift close to the Schwarzschild
radius. We study the nonlinear plasma mode along the field lines. From the
system of equations under general relativity, a second order differential
equation is derived. The equation contains a term which describes the growing
plasma modes near Schwarzschild radius in a black hole environment. The term
vanishes with the distance far away from the gravitating object. For initially
zero potential and field on the surface of a neutron star, Goldreich-Julian
charge density is found to create the plasma mode, which is enhanced and
propagates almost without damping along the open field lines. We briefly
outline our plan to extend the work for studying soliton propagation along the
open field lines of strongly gravitating objects.
