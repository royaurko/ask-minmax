We present the mixture-of-parents maximum entropy Markov model (MoP-MEMM), a
class of directed graphical models extending MEMMs. The MoP-MEMM allows
tractable incorporation of long-range dependencies between nodes by restricting
the conditional distribution of each node to be a mixture of distributions
given the parents. We show how to efficiently compute the exact marginal
posterior node distributions, regardless of the range of the dependencies. This
enables us to model non-sequential correlations present within text documents,
as well as between interconnected documents, such as hyperlinked web pages. We
apply the MoP-MEMM to a named entity recognition task and a web page
classification task. In each, our model shows significant improvement over the
basic MEMM, and is competitive with other long-range sequence models that use
approximate inference.
