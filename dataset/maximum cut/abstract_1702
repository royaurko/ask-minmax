We characterize the validity of the Maximum Principle in bounded domains for
fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic operators in terms of the sign of a
suitably defined generalized principal eigenvalue. Here, maximum principle
refers to the non-positivity of viscosity subsolutions of the Dirichlet
problem. This characterization is derived in terms of a new notion of
generalized principal eigenvalue, which is needed because of the possible
degeneracy of the operator, admitted in full generality. We further discuss the
relations between this notion and other natural generalizations of the
classical notion of principal eigenvalue, some of which had already been used
in the literature for particular classes of operators.
