Total cross sections for single ionization and excitation of molecular
hydrogen by antiproton impact are presented over a wide range of impact energy
from 1 keV to 6.5 MeV. A nonpertubative time-dependent close-coupling method is
applied to fully treat the correlated dynamics of the electrons. Good agreement
is obtained between the present calculations and experimental measurements of
single-ionization cross sections at high energies, whereas some discrepancies
with the experiment are found around the maximum. The importance of the
molecular geometry and a full two-electron description is demonstrated. The
present findings provide benchmark results which might be useful for the
development of molecular models.
