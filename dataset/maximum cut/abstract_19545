The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is currently observing the cosmic
microwave background with arcminute resolution at 148 GHz, 218 GHz, and 277
GHz. In this paper, we present ACT's first results. Data have been analyzed
using a maximum-likelihood map-making method which uses B-splines to model and
remove the atmospheric signal. It has been used to make high-precision beam
maps from which we determine the experiment's window functions. This beam
information directly impacts all subsequent analyses of the data. We also used
the method to map a sample of galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)
effect, and show five clusters previously detected with X-ray or SZ
observations. We provide integrated Compton-y measurements for each cluster. Of
particular interest is our detection of the z = 0.44 component of A3128 and our
current non-detection of the low-redshift part, providing strong evidence that
the further cluster is more massive as suggested by X-ray measurements. This is
a compelling example of the redshift-independent mass selection of the SZ
effect.
