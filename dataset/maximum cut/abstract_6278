We entertain the idea that robust theoretical expectations can become a tool
in removing hidden observational or data-reduction biases. We illustrate this
approach for a specific problem associated with gravitational microlensing.
Using the fact that a group is more than just a collection of individuals, we
derive formulae for correcting the distribution of the dimensionless impact
parameters of events, u_min. We refer to the case when undetected biases in the
u_min distribution can be alleviated by multiplication of impact parameters of
all events by a common constant factor. We show that in this case the general
maximum likelihood problem of solving an infinite number of equations reduces
to two constraints, and we find an analytic solution. Under the above
assumptions, this solution represents a state in which the ``entropy'' of a
microlensing ensemble is at its maximum, that is, the distribution of u_min
resembles a specific, theoretically expected, box-like distribution to the
highest possible extent. We also show that this technique does not allow one to
correct the parameters of individual events on the event by event basis
independently from each other.
