We demonstrate a possibility of computation of inelastic scattering
cross-section in a multi-peripheral model by application of the Laplace method
to multidimensional integral over the domain of physical process. The
constrained maximum point of scattering cross-section integral under condition
of the energy-momentum conservation has been found. In the vicinity of this
point the integrand is substituted for an expression of Gaussian type, which
made possible to compute this integral numerically. The paper has two parts.
The hunting procedure of the constrained maximum point is considered and the
properties of this maximum point are discussed in the given part of the paper.
It is shown that virtuality of all internal lines of the "comb" diagram reduced
at the constrained maximum point with energy growth. In the second part of the
paper we give some arguments in favor of consideration of the mechanism of
virtuality reduction as the mechanism of the total hadron scattering
cross-section growth, which is not taken into account within the framework of
Regge theory.
