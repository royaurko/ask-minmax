In this paper, we introduce a direct method of moving spheres for the
nonlocal fractional Laplacian $(-\triangle)^{\alpha/2}$ for $0<\alpha<2$, in
which a key ingredient is the narrow region maximum principle. As immediate
applications, we classify the non-negative solutions for a semilinear equation
involving the fractional Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^n$; we prove a non-existence
result for prescribing $Q_{\alpha}$ curvature equation on $\mathbb{S}^n$; then
by combining the direct method of moving planes and moving spheres, we
establish a Liouville type theorem on the half Euclidean space. We expect to
see more applications of this method to many other equations involving
non-local operators.
