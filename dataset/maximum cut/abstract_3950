We present a new and homogeneous set of explosive yields for masses 13, 15,
20, 25, 30 and 35 Msun and metallicities Z=0, 10^{- 6}, 10^{- 4}, 10^{- 3},
6x10^{- 3}, 2x10^{-2}. A wide network extending up to Mo has been used in all
the computation. We show that at low metallicities (Z<10^{- 4}) the final
yields do not depend significantly on the initial chemical composition of the
models so that a scaled solar distribution may be safely assumed at all
metallicities. Moreover, no elements above Zn are produced by any mass in the
grid up to a metallicity ~10^{-3}. These yields are available for any choice of
the mass cut upon request.
