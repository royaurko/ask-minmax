Using a method of a Raman effect of light the heterodiffusion in molecular
crystals is investigated by the example of p-dichlorobenzene in a
p-dibromobenzene. The installation diagram and a procedure of a determination
of diffusivities using this method is given. Changes of diffusivities in a cut
of a crystal perpendicularly to a direction of diffusion are found. Obtained
values of diffusivities are in good agreement with those obtained by other
methods.
