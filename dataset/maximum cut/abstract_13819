We establish a link between unitary relaxation dynamics after a quench in
closed many-body systems and the entanglement in the energy eigenbasis. We find
that even if reduced states equilibrate, they can have memory on the initial
conditions even in certain models that are far from integrable. We show that in
such situations the equilibrium states are still described by a maximum entropy
or generalized Gibbs ensemble, regardless of whether a model is integrable or
not, thereby contributing to a recent debate. In addition, we discuss
individual aspects of the thermalization process, comment on the role of
Anderson localization, and collect and compare different notions of
integrability.
