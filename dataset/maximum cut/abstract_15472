Dependence on the parameter is continuous when perturbations of the parameter
preserves strict preference for one alternative over another. We characterise
this property via a utility function over alternatives that depends
continuously on the parameter. The class of parameter spaces where such a
representation is guaranteed to exist is also identified. When the parameter is
the type or belief of a player, these results have implications for Bayesian
and psychological games. When alternatives are discrete, the representation is
jointly continuous and an extension of Berge's theorem of the maximum yields a
continuous value function. We apply this result to generalise a standard
consumer choice problem where parameters are price-wealth vectors. When the
parameter space is lexicographically ordered, a novel application to
reference-dependent preferences is possible.
