We show that the infinite imaginary anomalous dimensions of certain heavy
quark-antiquark currents in the HQET arise due to an inappropriate commutation
of two limits, namely coinciding velocities and infinite cut-off. This
commutation is not apparent when dimensional regularization is used, but it can
be made manifest in a cut-off regularization. We argue that operators
containing heavy quark and antiquark fields with the same velocity in the HQET
must not be matched to perturbative QCD but to Coulomb-type bound state
contributions. We show how to do so at one loop level.
