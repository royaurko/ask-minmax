We have explored Natural Supersymmetry (NSUSY) scenarios with low values of
the $\mu$ parameter which are characterised by higgsino-like Dark Matter (DM)
and compressed spectra for the lightest MSSM particles, $\chi^0_1$, $\chi^0_2$
and $\chi^\pm_1$. This scenario could be probed via monojet signatures, but as
the signal-to-background ratio (S/B) is low we demonstrate that the 8 TeV LHC
cannot obtain limits on the DM mass beyond those of LEP2. On the other hand, we
have found, for the 13 TeV run of the LHC, that by optimising kinematical cuts
we can bring the S/B ratio up to the 5(3)% level which would allow the
exclusion of the DM mass up to 200(250) GeV respectively, significantly
extending LEP2 limits. Moreover, we have found that LUX/XENON1T and LHC do play
very complementary roles in exploring the parameter space of NSUSY, as the LHC
has the capability to access regions where DM is quasi-degenerate with other
higgsinos, which are challenging for direct detection experiments.
