On the basis of the percolation picture from the hadronic phase with hyperons
to the quark phase with strangeness, we construct a new equation of state (EOS)
with the pressure interpolated as a function of the baryon density. The maximum
mass of neutron stars can exceed $2M_{\odot}$ if the following two conditions
are satisfied; (i) the crossover from the hadronic matter to the quark matter
takes place at around three times the normal nuclear matter density, and (ii)
the quark matter is strongly interacting in the crossover region and has stiff
equation of state. This is in contrast to the conventional approach assuming
the first order phase transition in which the EOS becomes always soft due to
the presence of the quark matter at high density. Although the choice of the
hadronic EOS does not affect the above conclusion on the maximum mass, the
three-body force among nucleons and hyperons plays an essential role for the
onset of the hyperon mixing and the cooling of neutron stars.
