We classify twenty-one Indo-European languages starting from written text. We
use neural networks in order to define a distance among different languages,
construct a dendrogram and analyze the ultrametric structure that emerges. Four
or five subgroups of languages are identified, according to the "cut" of the
dendrogram, drawn with an entropic criterion. The results and the method are
discussed.
