The 11-year activity cycle of the Sun is a consequence of a dynamo process
occurring beneath its surface. We analyzed photometric data obtained by the
CoRoT space mission, showing solar-like oscillations in the star HD49933, for
signatures of stellar magnetic activity. Asteroseismic measurements of global
changes in the oscillation frequencies and mode amplitudes reveal a modulation
of at least 120 days, with the minimum frequency shift corresponding to maximum
amplitude as in the Sun. These observations are evidence of a stellar magnetic
activity cycle taking place beneath the surface of HD49933 and provide
constraints for stellar dynamo models under conditions different from those of
the Sun.
