Vehicle-infrastructure communication opens up new ways to improve traffic
flow efficiency at signalized intersections. In this study, we assume that
equipped vehicles can obtain information about switching times of relevant
traffic lights in advance. This information is used to improve traffic flow by
the strategies 'early braking', 'anticipative start', and 'flying start'. The
strategies can be implemented in driver-information mode, or in automatic mode
by an Adaptive Cruise Controller (ACC). Quality criteria include cycle-averaged
capacity, driving comfort, fuel consumption, travel time, and the number of
stops. By means of simulation, we investigate the isolated strategies and the
complex interactions between the strategies and between equipped and
non-equipped vehicles. As universal approach to assess equipment level effects
we propose relative performance indexes and found, at a maximum speed of 50
km/h, improvements of about 15% for the number of stops and about 4% for the
other criteria. All figures double when increasing the maximum speed to 70
km/h.
