The Booster Neutrino Experiment (MiniBooNE) searches for muon neutrino to
electron neutrino oscillations using the ~1 GeV neutrino beam produced by the
FNAL Booster synchrotron. The array of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) lining the
MiniBooNE detector records Cherenkov and scintillation photons from the charged
particles produced in neutrino interactions. We describe a maximum likelihood
fitting algorithm used to reconstruct the basic properties (position,
direction, energy) of these particles from the charges and times measured by
the PMTs. The likelihoods returned from fitting an event to different particle
hypotheses are used to categorize it as a signal electron neutrino event or as
one of the background muon neutrino processes, in particular charged current
quasi-elastic scattering and neutral current $\pi^0$ production. The
reconstruction and event selection techniques described here can be applied to
current and future neutrino experiments using similar Cherenkov-based
detection.
