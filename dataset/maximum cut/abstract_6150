We consider a transient excited random walk on $Z$ and study the asymptotic
behavior of the occupation time of a currently most visited site. In
particular, our results imply that, in contrast to the random walks in random
environment, a transient excited random walk does not spend an asymptotically
positive fraction of time at its favorite (most visited up to a date) sites.
