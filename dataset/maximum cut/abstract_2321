We calculate the finite temperature effective potential of $\lambda\phi^4$ at
the two loop order of the 2PPI expansion. This expansion contains all diagrams
which remain connected when two lines meeting at the same point are cut and
therefore sums systematically the bubble graphs. At one loop in the 2PPI
expansion, the symmetry restoring phase transition is first order. At two
loops, we find a second order phase transition with mean field critical
exponents.
