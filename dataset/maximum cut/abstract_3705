Solar events, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares, heat up
the upper atmosphere and near-Earth space environment. Due to this heating and
expansion of the outer atmosphere by the energetic ultraviolet, X-ray and
particles expelled from the sun, the low Earth-Orbiting satellites (LEOS)
become vulnerable to an enhanced drag force by the ions and molecules of the
expanded atmosphere. Out of various types of perturbations, Earth directed CMEs
play the most significant role. They are more frequent and intense during the
active (solar maximum) phase of the sun's approximately 11-year cycle. As we
are approaching another solar maximum later in 2013, it may be instructive to
analyse the effects of the past solar cycles on the orbiting satellites using
the archival data of space environment parameters as indicators. In this paper,
we compute the plasma drag on a model LEOS due to the atmospheric heating by
CMEs and other solar events as a function of the solar parameters. Using the
current forecast on the time and strength of the next solar maximum, we predict
how an existing satellite orbit may be affected in the forthcoming years.
