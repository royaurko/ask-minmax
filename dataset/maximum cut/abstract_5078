We study the phenomenology of a supersymmetric scenario where the
next-to-lightest superparticle is the lighter stau and long-lived due to a very
weakly coupled lightest superparticle, such as the gravitino. We investigate
the LHC sensitivity and its dependence on the superparticle spectrum with an
emphasis on strong production and decay. We do not assume any high-scale model
for SUSY breaking but work along the lines of simplified models. Devising cuts
that yield a large detection efficiency in the whole parameter space, we
determine the LHC's discovery and exclusion potential. This allows us to derive
robust limits on m_stau, m_gluino, a common m_squark, and m_stop1. We briefly
discuss the prospects for observing stopped staus.
