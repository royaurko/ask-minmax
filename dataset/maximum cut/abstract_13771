P/2010 A2 is an object on an asteroidal orbit that was observed to have an
extended tail or debris trail in January 2010. In this work, we fit the
outburst of P/2010 A2 with a conical burst model, and verify previous
suspicions that this was a one--time collisional event rather than an sustained
cometary outburst, implying that P/2010 A2 is not a new Main Belt Comet driven
by ice sublimation. We find that the best--fit cone opening angle is about 40
to 50 degrees, in agreement with numerical and laboratory simulations of
cratering events. Mapping debris orbits to sky positions suggests that the
distinctive arc features in the debris correspond to the same debris cone
inferred from the extended dust. From the velocity of the debris, and from the
presence of a velocity maximum at around 15 cm/s, we infer that the surface of
A2 probably has a very low strength (<1 kPa), comparable to lunar regolith.
