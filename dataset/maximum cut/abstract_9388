A strong edge coloring of a graph is a proper edge coloring where the edges
at distance at most two receive distinct colors. It is known that every planar
graph with maximum degree D has a strong edge coloring with at most 4D + 4
colors. We show that 3D + 6 colors suffice if the graph has girth 6, and 3D
colors suffice if the girth is at least 7. Moreover, we show that cubic planar
graphs with girth at least 6 can be strongly edge colored with at most 9
colors.
