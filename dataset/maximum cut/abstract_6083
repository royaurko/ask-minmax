It is argued that PHENIX collaboration observed for the first time the
radiation of the longitudinal wake oscillations formed behind the parton
penetrating the quark-gluon medium. It shifts the maximum of a hump in
two-particle correlations and changes its width in the case of some special
orientation of the trigger particle.
