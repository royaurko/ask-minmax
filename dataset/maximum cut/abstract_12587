A high purity germanium crystal was operated in liquid argon as a Compton
suppressed radiation spectrometer. Spectroscopic quality resolution of less
than 1% of the full-width half maximum of full energy deposition peaks was
demonstrated. The construction of the small apparatus used to obtain these
results is reported. The design concept is to use the liquid argon bath to both
cool the germanium crystal to operating temperatures and act as a scintillating
veto. The scintillation light from the liquid argon can veto cosmic-rays,
external primordial radiation, and gamma radiation that does not fully deposit
within the germanium crystal. This technique was investigated for its potential
impact on ultra-low background gamma-ray spectroscopy. This work is based on a
concept initially developed for future germanium-based neutrinoless double-beta
decay experiments.
