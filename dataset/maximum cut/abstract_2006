The key algorithms and features of the Gasoline code for parallel
hydrodynamics with self-gravity are described. Gasoline is an extension of the
efficient Pkdgrav parallel N-body code using smoothed particle hydrodynamics.
Accuracy measurements, performance analysis and tests of the code are
presented. Recent successful Gasoline applications are summarized. These cover
a diverse set of areas in astrophysics including galaxy clusters, galaxy
formation and gas-giant planets. Future directions for gasdynamical simulations
in astrophysics and code development strategies for tackling cutting edge
problems are discussed.
