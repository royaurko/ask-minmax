In this work we shall sketch a further piece of evidence for the plausibility
of hypothesis of galactic origin of Ly-$\alpha$ forest absorption systems. Two
basic premises of our discussion are (1) HDF redshift surface densities in the
redshift interval 0<z<6; and (2) validity of low-redshift results on redshift
coincidences, showing average absorption cross-section corresponding to radius
of 160$h^{-1}$ kpc for $L^*$ galaxies. Low-redshift analysis also showed
covering factor nearing unity, which will be used and discussed in further
considerations. Semantic problems concerned with the interpretation of galaxy
absorption cross-section are discussed in some details, and importance of
distinction between size of the absorbers and absorption coherence length is
emphasized. It is shown that HDF data predict huge number of absorption
systems, in fact much larger than observed, which shows frequently quoted
argument that number of galaxies is insufficient to account for all absorption
lines to be wrong. Road to achieving higher compatibility with the empirical
statistics is shown to lie in applying the luminosity scaling, possibly with
cut-off. This is significant for recent attempts to explain the association of
the Ly-$\alpha$ forest systems with normal galaxies.
