We use a geometric construction to exhibit examples of autonomous Lagrangian
systems admitting exactly two homoclinics emanating from a nondegenerate
maximum of the potential energy and reaching a regular level of the potential
having the same value of the maximum point. Similarly, we show examples of
Hamiltonian systems that admit exactly two brake orbits in an annular potential
region connecting the two connected components of the boundary of the potential
well. These examples show that the estimates proven in [R. Giamb\`o, F.
Giannoni, P. Piccione, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 200, (2011) 691-724] are
sharp.
