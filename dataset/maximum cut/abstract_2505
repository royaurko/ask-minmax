We discuss the various mechanisms potentially at work in hadroproduction of
heavy quarkonia in the light of computations of higher-order QCD corrections
both in the Colour-Singlet (CS) and Colour-Octet (CO) channels and the
inclusion of the contribution arising from the s-channel cut in the CS channel.
We also discuss new observables meant to better discriminate between these
different mechanisms.
