Belavin's $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$-symmetric model is considered on the
basis of bosonization of vertex operators in the $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$ model and
vertex-face transformation. Free field representations of nonlocal tail
operators are constructed for off diagonal matrix elements with respect to the
ground state sectors. As a result, integral formulae for form factors of any
local operators in the $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$-symmetric model can be
obtained, in principle.
