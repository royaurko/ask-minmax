In this paper we study qualitative features of glueballs in N=1 SYM for
models of wrapped branes in IIA and IIB backgrounds. The scalar mode, 0++ is
found to be a mixture of the dilaton and the internal part of the metric. We
carry out the numerical study of the IIB background. The potential found
exhibits a mass gap and produces a discrete spectrum without any cut-off. We
propose a regularization procedure needed to make these states normalizable.
