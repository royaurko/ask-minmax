A dynamic model of the product lifecycle of (nearly) homogeneous durables in
polypoly markets is established. It describes the concurrent evolution of the
unit sales and price of durable goods. The theory is based on the idea that the
sales dynamics is determined by a meeting process of demanded with supplied
product units. Taking advantage from the Bass model for first purchase and a
logistic model for repurchase the entire product lifecycle of a durable can be
established. For the case of a fast growing supply the model suggests that the
mean price of the good decreases according to a logistic law. Both, the
established unit sales and price evolution are in agreement with the empirical
data studied in this paper. The presented approach discusses further the
interference of the diffusion process with the supply dynamics. The model
predicts the occurrence of lost sales in the initial stages of the lifecycle
due to supply constraints. They are the origin for a retarded market
penetration. The theory suggests that the imitation rate B indicating social
contagion in the Bass model has its maximum magnitude for the case of a large
amount of available units at introduction and a fast output increase. The
empirical data of the investigated samples are in qualitative agreement with
this prediction.
