This paper explores the dynamical interaction between extended halo and
spheroid components of a disk galaxy and an environmental disturbance. One
finds that resonant interaction between a galaxy and passing interlopers or
satellite companions can carry the disturbance inward, deep inside the halo,
where it can perturb the disk. Applied to the Milky Way for example, the LMC
and SMC appear to be sufficient to cause the observed Galactic warp and
possibly seed other asymmetries. A polar satellite orbit produces the largest
warp and therefore the inferred LMC orbit is nearly optimal for maximum warp
production. Both the magnitude and morphology of the response depend on the
details of the disk and halo models. The results and prognosis for N-body
simulations are discussed. Discreteness noise in the halo, similar to that due
to a population of $10^6M_\odot$ black holes, can produce observable warping.
