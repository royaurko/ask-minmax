In this letter, the electrical and magnetic properties of
La{sub(1-x)}Te{sub(x)}MnO{sub(3)}(x=0.1, 0.15), which is a new material and
shows good colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) behavior, have been investigated.
These compounds have rhombohedral structure. In this materical, Te replaced a
part of La ions, which induced the lattice cell constriction and Mn-O-Mn bond
angle widening. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurement revealed
that the Te ions were in the tetravalent state and the manganese ions could be
considered as in a mixture state of Mn{sup(2+)} and Mn{Sup(3+)}. Thus the
material could be viewed as an electron-doped compound. The Curie temperature
(Tc) was about 240 K and 255 K for x=0.1, 0.15, respectively. The maximum
magnetoresistance ratio MR=[r(0)-r(H)]/r(0) was about 51% at 200 K and in the
applied magnetic field of 40 kOe.
