We determine the mass distribution of a spiral galaxy, 2237+0305 using both
gravitational lensing and dynamical constraints. We find that lensing can break
the disc-halo degeneracy. 2237+0305 has a sub-maximal disc, contributing 57+/-3
per cent of the rotational support at the disc maximum. The disc mass-to-light
ratio is 1.1+/-0.2 in the I-band and the bulge, 2.9+/-0.5. The dark matter
halo, modelled as a softened isothermal sphere, has a large core radius
(13.4+/-0.4 kpc, equivalent to 1.4r_d) to high accuracy for the best-fitting
solution. The image positions are reasonably well fitted, but require further
rotation information to obtain a unique solution.
