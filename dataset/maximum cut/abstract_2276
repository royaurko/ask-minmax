We compute the complete one-loop corrections to the simplest class of QCD
gluon amplitudes, those with two color-adjacent opposite-helicity external
particles. We present results for an arbitrary number of external legs. The
computation uses the recently-developed on-shell recursion relations for the
rational parts, along with older unitarity-based results for the cut-containing
terms.
