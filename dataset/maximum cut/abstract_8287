We present results from numerical evolutions of single black holes distorted
by axisymmetric, but equatorially asymmetric, gravitational (Brill) waves. Net
radiated energies, apparent horizon embeddings, and recoil velocities are shown
for a range of Brill wave parameters, including both even and odd parity
distortions of Schwarzschild black holes. We find that a wave packet initially
concentrated on the black hole throat, a likely model also for highly
asymmetric stellar collapse and late stage binary mergers, can generate a
maximum recoil velocity of about 150 (23) km/sec for even (odd) parity
perturbations, significantly less than that required to eject black holes from
galactic cores.
