It has been suggested by various contributors that the `dynamical Casimir effect'
might prove responsible for the production of visible-light photons in the
bubble collapse which occurs in sonoluminescence. Previously, I have argued
against this point of view based on energetic considerations, in the adiabatic
approximation. Those arguments have recently been strengthened by the
demonstration of the equivalence between van der Waals and Casimir energies. In
this note I concentrate on the other extreme possibility, that of the validity
of the `sudden approximation' where in effect the bubble instantaneously ceases
to exist. Previous estimates which seemed to support the relevance of the
Casimir effect are shown to be unconvincing because they require macroscopic
changes on excessively small time scales, involving the entire volume of the
bubble at maximum radius.
