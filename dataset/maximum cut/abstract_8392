A magnetic field induced electric polarization and the corresponding change
of an effective junction capacitance are considered within a 3D model of
disordered Josephson junction arrays. At some threshold field (near the
Josephson network critical field), the effective junction charge and the
related capacitance are shown to reach a maximum and to change a sign,
respectively. A possibility to observe the predicted effects in artificially
prepared arrays of superconducting grains is discussed.
