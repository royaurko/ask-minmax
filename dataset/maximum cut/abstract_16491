A Laplacian matrix is a square real matrix with nonpositive off-diagonal
entries and zero row sums. As a matrix associated with a weighted directed
graph, it generalizes the Laplacian matrix of an ordinary graph. A standardized
Laplacian matrix is a Laplacian matrix with the absolute values of the
off-diagonal entries not exceeding 1/n, where n is the order of the matrix. We
study the spectra of Laplacian matrices and relations between Laplacian
matrices and stochastic matrices. We prove that the standardized Laplacian
matrices are semiconvergent. The multiplicities of 0 and 1 as the eigenvalues
of a standardized Laplacian matrix are equal to the in-forest dimension of the
corresponding digraph and one less than the in-forest dimension of the
complementary digraph, respectively. These eigenvalues are semisimple. The
spectrum of a standardized Laplacian matrix belongs to the meet of two closed
disks, one centered at 1/n, another at 1-1/n, each having radius 1-1/n, and two
closed angles, one bounded with two half-lines drawn from 1, another with two
half-lines drawn from 0 through certain points. The imaginary parts of the
eigenvalues are bounded from above by 1/(2n) cot(pi/2n); this maximum converges
to 1/pi as n goes to infinity.
