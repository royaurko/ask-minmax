If $R$-parity is not conserved, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP)
could decay via lepton number violating or baryon number violating
interactions. The latter case is particularly insidious since it leads to a
reduction of the $\eslt$ as well as leptonic signals for supersymmetry. We
evaluate cross sections for jets plus $\eslt$, 1$\ell$, $2\ell$ (same-sign and
opposite sign) and $3\ell$ event topologies that result from the simultaneous
production of all sparticles at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), assuming
that the lightest supersymmetric particle $\tz_1$ decays hadronically inside
the detector via $R$-parity violating interactions. We assume that these
interactions do not affect the production rates or decays of other sparticles.
We examine the SUSY reach of the LHC for this ``pessimistic'' scenario, and
show that experiments at the LHC will still be able to search for gluinos and
squarks as heavy as 1 TeV, given just 10 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity,
even with cuts designed to explore the canonical SUSY framework with a {\it
conserved} $R$-parity.
