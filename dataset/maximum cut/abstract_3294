To interpret the mean depth of cosmic ray air shower maximum and its
dispersion, we parametrize those two observables as functions of the first two
moments of the $\ln A$ distribution. We examine the goodness of this simple
method through simulations of test mass distributions. The application of the
parameterization to Pierre Auger Observatory data allows one to study the
energy dependence of the mean $\ln A$ and of its variance under the assumption
of selected hadronic interaction models. We discuss possible implications of
these dependences in term of interaction models and astrophysical cosmic ray
sources.
