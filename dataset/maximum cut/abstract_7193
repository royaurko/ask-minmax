We demonstrate high-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon
detectors (SNSPDs) fabricated from MoSi thin-films. We measure a maximum system
detection efficiency (SDE) of 87 +- 0.5 % at 1542 nm at a temperature of 0.7 K,
with a jitter of 76 ps, maximum count rate approaching 10 MHz, and polarization
dependence as low as 3.4 +- 0.7 % The SDE curves show saturation of the
internal efficiency similar to WSi-based SNSPDs at temperatures as high as 2.3
K. We show that at similar cryogenic temperatures, MoSi SNSPDs achieve
efficiencies comparable to WSi-based SNSPDs with nearly a factor of two
reduction in jitter.
