Nolan and Temple Lang argue that "the ability to express statistical
computations is an essential skill." A key related capacity is the ability to
conduct and present data analysis in a way that another person can understand
and replicate. The copy-and-paste workflow that is an artifact of antiquated
user-interface design makes reproducibility of statistical analysis more
difficult, especially as data become increasingly complex and statistical
methods become increasingly sophisticated. R Markdown is a new technology that
makes creating fully-reproducible statistical analysis simple and painless. It
provides a solution suitable not only for cutting edge research, but also for
use in an introductory statistics course. We present evidence that R Markdown
can be used effectively in introductory statistics courses, and discuss its
role in the rapidly-changing world of statistical computation.
