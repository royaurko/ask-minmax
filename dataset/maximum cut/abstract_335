We report on our recent evaluation of the s-channel cut contribution to J/psi
hadroproduction. We show that it is likely significantly larger than the usual
cut contribution of the colour-singlet model (CSM), which is known to
underestimate the experimental measurements. Here the s-channel cut develops
for configurations with off-shell quarks in the bound state. A correct
treatment of its contribution requires the introduction of a four point
function, partially constrained by gauge invariance and limiting behaviours at
small and large momenta. When the unconstrained degrees of freedom are fixed to
reproduce the Tevatron data, we show that RHIC data are remarkably well
reproduced down to very low transverse momenta P_T without need of resummation
of initial-state gluon effects. This unique feature might be typical of
s-channel cut contribution.
