The degree of linear polarization in solar flares has not yet been precisely
determined despite multiple attempts to measure it with different missions. The
high energy range in particular has very rarely been explored, due to its
greater instrumental difficulties. We approached the subject using the Reuven
Ramaty High Energy Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) satellite to study 6 X-class
and 1 M-class flares in the energy range between 100 keV and 350 keV. Using
RHESSI as a polarimeter requires the application of strict cuts to the event
list in order to extract those photons that are Compton scattered between two
detectors. Our measurements show polarization values between 2% and 54%, with
errors ranging from 10% to 26% in 1 sigma level. In view of the large
uncertainties in both the magnitude and direction of the polarization vector,
the results can only reject source models with extreme properties.
