We present predictions for the clustering of Extremely Red Objects (EROs) in
a \Lambda cold dark matter Universe, using a semi-analytical galaxy formation
model in combination with a cosmological N-body simulation. EROs are red,
massive galaxies observed at 0.7< z < 3, and their numbers and properties have
posed a challenge to hierarchical galaxy formation models. We analyse the halo
occupation distribution and two-point correlation function of EROs, exploring
how these quantities change with apparent magnitude, colour cut and redshift.
Our model predicts a halo occupation distribution that is significantly
different from that typically assumed. This is due to the inclusion of AGN
feedback, which changes the slope and scatter of the luminosity-host halo mass
relation above the mass where AGN feedback first becomes important. We predict
that, on average, dark matter haloes with masses above 10^{13}h^{-1}Msun host
at least one ERO at 1.5 < z < 2.5. Taking into account sample variance in
observational estimates, the predicted angular clustering for EROs with either
(R-K)>5 or (i-K)>4.5 is in reasonable agreement with current observations.
