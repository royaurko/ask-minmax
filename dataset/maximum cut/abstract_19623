A search for muon neutrinos in coincidence with gamma-ray bursts with the
ANTARES neutrino detector using data from the end of 2007 to 2011 is performed.
Expected neutrino fluxes are calculated for each burst individually. The most
recent numerical calculations of the spectra using the NeuCosmA code are
employed, which include Monte Carlo simulations of the full underlying
photohadronic interaction processes. The discovery probability for a selection
of 296 gamma-ray bursts in the given period is optimised using an extended
maximum-likelihood strategy. No significant excess over background is found in
the data, and 90% confidence level upper limits are placed on the total
expected flux according to the model.
