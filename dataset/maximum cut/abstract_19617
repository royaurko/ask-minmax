The data taken with the ANTARES neutrino telescope from 2007 to 2010, a total
live time of 863 days, are used to measure the oscillation parameters of
atmospheric neutrinos. Muon tracks are reconstructed with energies as low as 20
GeV. Neutrino oscillations will cause a suppression of vertical upgoing muon
neutrinos of such energies crossing the Earth. The parameters determining the
oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos are extracted by fitting the event rate as
a function of the ratio of the estimated neutrino energy and reconstructed
flight path through the Earth. Measurement contours of the oscillation
parameters in a two-flavour approximation are derived. Assuming maximum mixing,
a mass difference of $\Delta m_{32}^2=(3.1\pm 0.9)\cdot 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ is
obtained, in good agreement with the world average value.
