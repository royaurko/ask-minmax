The effective action induced by fermions in the chiral Schwinger model with
charges (3,4,5) is investigated. Pauli-Villars regularization is combined with
momentum cut-off for the evaluation of the fermion determinants on continuum
gauge fields interpolated between lattice points. The convergence and gauge
variance are studied numerically on gauge configurations taken from quenched
updating.
