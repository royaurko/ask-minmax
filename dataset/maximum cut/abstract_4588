We apply the renormalisation-group to two-body scattering by a combination of
known long-range and unknown short-range forces. A crucial feature is that the
low-energy effective theory is regulated by applying a cut-off in the basis of
distorted waves for the long range potential. We illustrate the method by
applying it to scattering in the presence of a repulsive 1/r^2 potential. We
find a trivial fixed point, describing systems with weak short-range
interactions, and a unstable fixed point. The expansion around the latter
corresponds to a distorted-wave effective-range expansion.
