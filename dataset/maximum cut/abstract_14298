We consider the problem of indexing a string $t$ of length $n$ to report the
occurrences of a query pattern $p$ containing $m$ characters and $j$ wildcards.
Let $occ$ be the number of occurrences of $p$ in $t$, and $\sigma$ the size of
the alphabet. We obtain the following results.
  - A linear space index with query time $O(m+\sigma^j \log \log n + occ)$.
This significantly improves the previously best known linear space index by Lam
et al. [ISAAC 2007], which requires query time $\Theta(jn)$ in the worst case.
  - An index with query time $O(m+j+occ)$ using space $O(\sigma^{k^2} n \log^k
\log n)$, where $k$ is the maximum number of wildcards allowed in the pattern.
This is the first non-trivial bound with this query time.
  - A time-space trade-off, generalizing the index by Cole et al. [STOC 2004].
  We also show that these indexes can be generalized to allow variable length
gaps in the pattern. Our results are obtained using a novel combination of
well-known and new techniques, which could be of independent interest.
