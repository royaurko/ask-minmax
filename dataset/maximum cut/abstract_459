The highest energy cosmic rays, above the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cut-off of
cosmic ray spectrum, may be produced in decays of superheavy long-living
X-particles. We conjecture that these particles may be produced naturally in
the early Universe from vacuum fluctuations during inflation and may constitute
a considerable fraction of Cold Dark Matter. We predict a new cut-off in the
UHE cosmic ray spectrum E_{cut-off} < m_inflaton \approx 10^{13} GeV, the exact
position of the cut-off and the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum beyond the GZK
cut-off being determined by the QCD quark/gluon fragmentation. The Pierre Auger
Project installation might discover this phenomenon.
