The Multiple Input Multiple output system are considered to be the strongest
candidate for the maximum utilization of available bandwidth. In this paper,
the MIMO system with the combination of Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple
Access and Space Time Coding using the Alamoutis scheme is considered. A
Genetic Algorithm based receiver with an exceptional relationship between
filter weights while detecting symbols is proposed. This scheme has better
Convergence Rate and Bit Error Rate than the Fast-LMS Adaptive receiver.
