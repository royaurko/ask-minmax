We propose a method to increase the capacity achieved by uniform prior in
discrete memoryless channels (DMC) with high input cardinality. It consists in
appropriately reducing the input set. Different design criteria of the input
subset are discussed. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem
based on the maximization of the cut-off rate. The method is applied to a
mono-bit transceiver MIMO system, and it is shown that the capacity can be
approached within tenths of a dB by employing standard binary codes while
avoiding the use of distribution shapers.
