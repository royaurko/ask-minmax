We study the charged non-relativistic Bose gas interacting with a constant
magnetic field but which is otherwise free. The notion of Bose-Einstein
condensation for the three dimensional case is clarified, and we show that
although there is no condensation in the sense of a phase transition, there is
still a maximum in the specific heat which can be used to define a critical
temperature. Although the absence of a phase transition persists for all values
of the magnetic field, we show how as the magnetic field is reduced the curves
for the specific heat approach the free field curve. For large values of the
magnetic field we show that the gas undergoes a "dimensional reduction" and
behaves effectively as a one-dimensional gas except at very high temperatures.
These general features persist for other spatial dimensions D and we show
results for D=5. Finally we examine the magnetization and the
Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect.
