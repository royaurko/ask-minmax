We use a single j-shell model with random two-body interactions to derive
closed expressions for the distribution of and the correlations between
spectral widths of different spins. This task is facilitated by introducing
two-body operators whose squared spectral widths sum up to the squared spectral
width of the random Hamiltonian. The spin-0 width is characterized by a
relatively large average value and small fluctuations while the width of
maximum spin has the largest average and the largest fluctuations. The
approximate proportionality between widths and spectral radii explains the
preponderance of spin-0 ground states.
