Determining the evolution of the ejecta morphology of novae provides valuable
information on the shaping mechanisms in operation at early stages of the nova
outburst. Understanding such mechanisms has implications for studies of shaping
for example in proto-Planetary Nebulae. Here we perform morpho-kinematical
studies of V2491 Cyg using spectral data to determine the likely structure of
the ejecta and its relationship to the central system and shaping mechanisms.
We use Shape to model different morphologies and retrieve their spectra. These
synthetic spectra are compared with observed spectra to determine the most
likely morphology giving rise to them, including system inclination and
expansion velocity of the nova ejecta. We find the best fit remnant morphology
to be that of polar blobs and an equatorial ring with an implied inclination of
80$^{+3}_{-12}$ degrees and an maximum expansion velocity of the polar blobs of
3100$^{+200}_{-100}$ km/s and for the equatorial ring 2700$^{+200}_{-100}$
km/s. This inclination would suggest that we should observe eclipses which will
enable us to determine more precisely important parameters of the central
binary. We also note that the amplitude of the outburst is more akin to the
found in recurrent nova systems.
