Estimated masses of fissioning and non-fissioning radioactive elements and
their respective distributions within the Earth are presented, based upon the
fundamental identity of the components of the interior 82% of the Earth, the
endo-Earth, with corresponding components of the Abee enstatite chondrite
meteorite. Within limits of existing data, the following generalizations
concerning the endo-Earth radionuclides can be made: (1) Most of the K-40 may
be expected to exist in combination with oxygen in the silicates of the lower
mantle, perhaps being confined to the upper region of the lower mantle where it
transitions to the upper mantle; (2) Uranium may be expected to exist at the
center of the Earth where it may undergo self-sustaining nuclear fission chain
reactions, but there is a possibility that some non-fissioning uranium may be
found scattered diffusely within the core floaters which are composed of CaS
and MgS; and, (3) Thorium may be expected to occur within the core floaters at
the core-mantle boundary, although its presence as well at the center of the
Earth cannot be ruled out. Results of nuclear georeactor numerical simulations
show: (1) The maximum constant nuclear fission power level is 30 terawatts; (2)
U-235 comprises 76 percent of present-day georeactor fission, U-238 comprises
23 percent; and, (3) Thorium can neither be fuel nor converted into fuel for
the georeactor.
