We present a pulsed-magnet system that enables x-ray single-crystal
diffraction in addition to powder and spectroscopic studies with the magnetic
field applied on or close to the scattering plane. The apparatus consists of a
single large-bore solenoid, cooled by liquid nitrogen. A second independent
closed-cycle cryostat is used for cooling samples near liquid helium
temperatures. Pulsed magnetic fields close to $\sim 30$ T with a
zero-to-peak-field rise time of $\sim$2.9 ms are generated by discharging a 40
kJ capacitor bank into the magnet coil. The unique characteristic of this
instrument is the preservation of maximum scattering angle ($\sim 23.6^\circ$)
on the entrance and exit sides of the magnet bore by virtue of a novel
double-funnel insert. This instrument will facilitate x-ray diffraction and
spectroscopic studies that are impractical, if not impossible, to perform using
split-pair and narrow-opening solenoid magnets, and offers a practical solution
for preserving optical access in future higher-field pulsed magnets.
