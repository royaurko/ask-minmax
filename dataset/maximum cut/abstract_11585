We report on the observation of rapid particle acceleration in numerical
simulations of relativistic jet-plasma interactions and discuss the underlying
mechanisms. The dynamics of a charge-neutral, narrow, electron-positron jet
propagating through an unmagnetized electron-ion plasma was investigated using
a three-dimensional, electromagnetic, particle-in-cell computer code. The
interaction excited magnetic filamentation as well as electrostatic plasma
instabilities. In some cases, the longitudinal electric fields generated
inductively and electrostatically reached the cold plasma wave-breaking limit,
and the longitudinal momentum of about half the positrons increased by 50% with
a maximum gain exceeding a factor of 2 during the simulation period. Particle
acceleration via these mechanisms occurred when the criteria for Weibel
instability were satisfied.
