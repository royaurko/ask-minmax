We define spin-c prequantization of a symplectic manifold to be a spin-c
structure and a connection which are compatible with the symplectic form. We
describe the cutting of an S^1-equivariant spin-c prequantization. The cutting
process involves a choice of a spin-c prequantization for the complex plane. We
prove that the cutting is possible if and only if the moment map level set
along which the cutting is done is compatible with this choice.
