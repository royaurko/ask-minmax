We present a practical and easy-to-implement method for high-speed near
infrared single-photon detection based on InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche
photodiodes (SPADs), combining aspects of both sine gating and
self-differencing techniques. At a gating frequency of 921 MHz and temperature
of -30 $^{\circ}$C we achieve: a detection efficiency of 9.3 %, a dark count
probability of 2.8$\times10^{-6}$ ns$^{-1}$, while the afterpulse probability
is 1.6$\times10^{-4}$ ns$^{-1}$, with a 10 ns "count-off time" setting. In
principle, the maximum count rate of the SPAD can approach 100 MHz, which can
significantly improve the performance for diverse applications.
