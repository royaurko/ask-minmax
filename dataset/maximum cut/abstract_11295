The soft X-ray nova GRS 1739-278 flared up in 1996 near the Galactic center.
We present the observations of this interesting source, a black-hole candidate,
with the instruments on board the Mir-Kvant module and the RXTE satellite. The
TTM data allow the spectrum of the X-ray nova to be studied during the rise in
its brightness. The source's spectrum in this period is satisfactorily
described by a power law with a gradually increasing index. The RXTE spectra
after the source passed its maximum brightness have the appearance that is
typical of the high and ultrahigh states of black-hole candidates; they are
described by a two-component model. The broad-band spectra of the source are
discussed in terms of the processes that proceed near an accreting black hole
in a binary system.
