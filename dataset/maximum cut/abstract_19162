We look for traces of the QCD critical point using an intermittency analysis
in the transverse momentum phase space of protons produced around midrapidity
in the 12.5\% most central C+C, Si+Si and Pb+Pb collisions at the maximum SPS
energy of 158$A$ GeV. We find evidence of power-law fluctuations for the Si+Si
data. The fitted power-law exponent $\phi_{2} =
0.96^{+0.38}_{-0.25}\text{(stat.)} \pm 0.16\text{(syst.)}$ is consistent with
the value expected for critical fluctuations. Power-law fluctuations had
previously also been observed in low-mass $\pi^+ \pi^-$ pairs in the same Si+Si
collisions.
