We present results for screening masses of light and strange mesons in 2+1
flavour QCD using improved (p4fat3) staggered fermions on 6x24^3 lattices. We
have studied the screening masses of scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector and
axial-vector mesons along the line of constant physics, determined by a pion
mass ~220 MeV and a kaon mass ~500 MeV. In order to investigate the cut-off and
volume dependencies we have also performed studies of the meson screening
correlators in the non-interacting theory using the p4 and the standard
staggered discretizations.
