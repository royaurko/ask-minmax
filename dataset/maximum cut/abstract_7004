The residual load and excess power generation of 27 European countries with a
100% penetration of variable renewable energy sources are explored in order to
quantify the benefit of power transmission between countries. Estimates are
based on extensive weather data, which allows for modelling of hourly
mismatches between the demand and renewable generation from wind and solar
photovoltaics. For separated countries, balancing is required to cover around
24% of the total annual energy consumption. This number can be reduced down to
15% once all countries are networked together with uncon- strained
interconnectors. The reduction represents the maximum possible benefit of
transmission for the countries. The total Net Transfer Capacity of the
unconstrained interconnectors is roughly twelve times larger than current
values. However, constrained interconnector capacities six times larger than
the current values are found to provide 97% of the maximum possible benefit of
cooperation. This motivates a detailed investigation of several constrained
transmission capacity layouts to determine the export and import capabilities
of countries participating in a fully renewable European electricity system.
