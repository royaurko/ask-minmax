The correlation between inertial range velocity fluctuations and energy
dissipation in fully developed turbulence is studied using high resolution
direct numerical simulation. Runs with microscale Reynolds number up to ${\cal
R}_{\lambda} \simeq 300$ have been performed in order to achieve the maximum
extent of the scaling range compatible with a proper resolution of the
dissipative scales. The bridge relations, a set of scaling relations which
express quantitatively the statistical dependence of dissipation-scale velocity
fluctuations on inertial-range ones, are verified. Corrections to the bridge
relations due to the finite size of the scaling range are investigated.
