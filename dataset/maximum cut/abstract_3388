K.A.S. Immink and J.H. Weber recently defined and studied a channel with both
gain and offset mismatch, modelling the behaviour of charge-leakage in flash
memory. They proposed a decoding measure for this channel based on minimising
Pearson distance (a notion from cluster analysis). The paper derives a formula
for maximum likelihood decoding for this channel, and also defines and
justifies a notion of minimum distance of a code in this context.
