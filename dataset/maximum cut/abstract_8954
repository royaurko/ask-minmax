The magnetoelectric (ME) coupling of cylindrical trilayered composite was
studied in this paper. The Ni-lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-Ni trilayered
cylindrical composite was synthesized by electro-deposition. The maximum ME
voltage coefficient of cylindrical ME composite is 35V/cm Oe, about three times
higher than that of the plate trilayered composite with the same raw materials
and magnetostrictive- piezoelectric phase thickness ratio. The high ME voltage
coefficient of cylindrical composite owes to the self-bound effect of circle.
Moreover, the resulting complex condition can induce a double peak in the field
dependence of ME coefficient.
