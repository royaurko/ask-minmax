We give an asymptotic analytic solution for the generic atom-laser system
with gain in a $D$-dimensional trap, and show that this has a non-Thomas-Fermi
behavior. The effect is due to Bose-enhanced condensate growth, which creates a
local density maximum and a corresponding outward momentum component. In
addition, the solution predicts amplified center-of-mass oscillations, leading
to enhanced center-of-mass temperature.
