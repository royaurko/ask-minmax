Using the automatic system GRACE-LOOP, the full $O(\alpha)$ electroweak
corrections has been calculated for the process $e^+e^- \to W^+\mu
\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$. The total correction to the cross section is found to be
typically -6.4% at $\sqrt{s}=190$ GeV with $10^\circ$ cut on the muon angle
from the beam, including the correction from the hard photon emission. It is
observed that the correction is rather sensitive to the physical parameters.
With the same conditions the correction corresponding to the real W-boson pair
is -4.1% and hence the deviation is not negligible.
