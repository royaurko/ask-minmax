In this paper we analyze soft and hard X-ray emission of the 2002 September
20 M1.8 GOES class solar flare observed by RHESSI and GOES satellites. In this
flare event, soft X-ray emission precedes the onset of the main bulk hard X-ray
emission by ~5 min. This suggests that an additional heating mechanism may be
at work at the early beginning of the flare. However RHESSI spectra indicate
presence of the non-thermal electrons also before impulsive phase. So, we
assumed that a dominant energy transport mechanism during rise phase of solar
flares is electron beam-driven evaporation. We used non-thermal electron beams
derived from RHESSI spectra as the heating source in a hydrodynamic model of
the analyzed flare. We showed that energy delivered by non-thermal electron
beams is sufficient to heat the flare loop to temperatures in which it emits
soft X-ray closely following the GOES 1-8 A light-curve. We also analyze the
number of non-thermal electrons, the low energy cut-off, electron spectral
indices and the changes of these parameters with time.
