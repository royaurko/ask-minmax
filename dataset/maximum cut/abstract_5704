In this paper a variant of the classical hierarchical cluster analysis is
reported. This agglomerative (bottom-up) cluster technique is referred to as
the Adaptive Mean-Linkage Algorithm. It can be interpreted as a linkage
algorithm where the value of the threshold is conveniently up-dated at each
interaction. The superiority of the adaptive clustering with respect to the
average-linkage algorithm follows because it achieves a good compromise on
threshold values: Thresholds based on the cut-off distance are sufficiently
small to assure the homogeneity and also large enough to guarantee at least a
pair of merging sets. This approach is applied to a set of possible
substituents in a chemical series.
