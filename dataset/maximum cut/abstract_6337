We analyse in detail the attenuation caused by an isothermal turbulent
distant foreground dust screen. The attenuation curve is well determined by two
parameters, the absolute-to-relative attenuation ratio R^A_V=A_V/E(B-V) and the
absolute attenuation A_V. We show quantitatively how these two observable
quantities depend on the statistical properties of the local density and the
mean attenuation <A_V> and how they vary with the thickness of the screen
measured in units of the largest turbulent scale. The attenuation through a
turbulent medium is characterised by higher transparency and a flatter
attenuation curve in comparison with a homogeneous dust screen. In general, the
effect of the turbulent medium on the attenuation increases with slice
thickness. In the limit of thick slices, typically larger than the maximum
turbulent scale, R^A_V asymptotically approaches a maximum value.
