We study how periodicity manifestations recently found in the turbulent
globall coupled maps depend on the global feature of the couplings. We examine
three non-locally coupled map models. In the first two, the all-to-all
interaction is maintained but the coupling decreases with distance in a power
and an exponential law. In the third, the interaction is uniform but cut off
sharply. We find that, in all three and in dimension $D=1,2,3$, periodicity
manifests universally from turbulence when the same suppression of the local
mean field fluctuation is achieved by the non-local averaging.
