We report two spectropolarimetric observations of SN 2005hk, which is a close
copy of the "very peculiar" SN 2002cx, showing low peak luminosity, slow
decline, high ionization near peak and an unusually low expansion velocity of
only about 7,000 km s^-1. Further to the data presented by Chornock et al.,
(2006), at -4 days before maximum, we present data of this object taken on 9
November 2005 (near maximum) and 23 November (+ two weeks) that show the
continuum and most of the spectral lines to be polarized at levels of about
0.2-0.3%. At both epochs the data corresponds to the Spectropolarimetric Type
D1. The general low level of line polarization suggests that the line forming
regions for most species observed in the spectrum have a similar shape to that
of the photosphere, which deviates from a spherical symmetry by <10%. In
comparison with spectropolarimetry of Type Ia and Core-collapse SNe at similar
epochs, we find that the properties of SN 2005hk are most similar to those of
Type Ia SNe. In particular, we find the low levels of continuum and line
polarization to indicate that the explosion mechanism is approximately
spherical, with homogeneous ejecta (unlike the chemically segregated ejecta of
CCSNe). We discuss the possibility that SN 2005hk was the result of the pure
deflagration of a white dwarf and note the issues concerning this
interpretation.
