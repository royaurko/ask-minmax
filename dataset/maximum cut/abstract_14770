In this paper, the problem of joint oscillator phase noise (PHN) estimation
and data detection for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems using
bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) is analyzed. A new MIMO receiver that
iterates between the estimator and the detector, based on the
expectation-maximization (EM) framework, is proposed. It is shown that at high
signal-to-noise ratios, a maximum a posteriori estimator (MAP) can be used to
carry out the maximization step of the EM algorithm. Moreover, to reduce the
computational complexity of the proposed EM algorithm, a soft decision-directed
extended Kalman filter-smoother (EKFS) is applied instead of the MAP estimator
to track the PHN parameters. Numerical results show that by combining the
proposed EKFS based approach with an iterative detector that employs low
density parity check (LDPC) codes, PHN can be accurately tracked. Simulations
also demonstrate that compared to existing algorithms, the proposed iterative
receiver can significantly enhance the performance of MIMO systems in the
presence of PHN.
