The interaction of trimethyl methylcyclopentadienyl platinum (MeCpPtMe3) with
a fully hydroxylated SiO2 surface has been explored by means of ab initio
calculations. A large slab model cut out from the hydroxylated
beta-cristobalite SiO2 (111) surface was chosen to simulate a silica surface.
Density functional theory calculations were performed to evaluate the energies
of MeCpPtMe3 adsorption to the SiO2 surface. Our results show that the
physisorption of the molecule is dependent on both (i) the orientation of the
adsorbate and (ii) the adsorption site on the substrate. The most stable
configuration was found with the MeCp and Me3 groups of the molecule oriented
towards the surface. Finally, we observe that van-der-Waals corrections are
crucial for the stabilization of the molecule on the surface. We discuss the
relevance of our results for the growth of Pt-based nanostructured materials
via deposition processes such as electron beam induced deposition.
