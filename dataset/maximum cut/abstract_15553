In this work we propose an adaptive buffer-aided space-time coding scheme for
cooperative wireless networks. A maximum likelihood receiver and adjustable
code vectors are considered subject to a power constraint with an
amplify-and-forward cooperation strategy. Each multiple-antenna relay is
equipped with a buffer and is capable of storing the received symbols before
forwarding them to the destination. We also present an adaptive relay selection
and optimization algorithm, in which the instantaneous signal to noise ratio in
each link is calculated and compared at the destination. An adjustable code
vector obtained by a feedback channel at each relay is employed to form a
space-time coded vector which achieves a higher coding gain than standard
schemes. A stochastic gradient algorithm is developed to compute the parameters
of the adjustable code vector with reduced computational complexity. Simulation
results show that the proposed buffer-aided scheme and algorithm obtain
performance gains over existing schemes.
