Graphene was recently proposed as a material for heat removal owing to its
extremely high thermal conductivity. We simulated heat propagation in
silicon-on-insulator circuits with and without graphene lateral heat spreaders.
Numerical solutions of the heat propagation equations were obtained using the
finite element method. The analysis was focused on the prototype
silicon-on-insulator circuits with the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
transistors. It was found that the incorporation of graphene or few-layer
graphene layers with proper heat sinks can substantially lower the temperature
of the localized hot spots. The maximum temperature in the transistor channels
was studied as function of graphene's thermal conductivity and the thickness of
the few-layer-graphene. The developed model and obtained results are important
for the design of graphene heat spreaders and interconnects.
