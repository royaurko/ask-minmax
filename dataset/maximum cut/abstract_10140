There is an increasing need for high density data storage devices driven by
the increased demand of consumer electronics. In this work, we consider a data
storage system that operates by encoding information as topographic profiles on
a polymer medium. A cantilever probe with a sharp tip (few nm radius) is used
to create and sense the presence of topographic profiles, resulting in a
density of few Tb per in.2. The prevalent mode of using the cantilever probe is
the static mode that is harsh on the probe and the media. In this article, the
high quality factor dynamic mode operation, that is less harsh on the media and
the probe, is analyzed. The read operation is modeled as a communication
channel which incorporates system memory due to inter-symbol interference and
the cantilever state. We demonstrate an appropriate level of abstraction of
this complex nanoscale system that obviates the need for an involved physical
model. Next, a solution to the maximum likelihood sequence detection problem
based on the Viterbi algorithm is devised. Experimental and simulation results
demonstrate that the performance of this detector is several orders of
magnitude better than the performance of other existing schemes.
