We study the motion of pedestrians through an obscure tunnel where the lack
of visibility hides the exits. Using a lattice model, we explore the effects of
communication on the effective transport properties of the crowd of
pedestrians. More precisely, we study the effect of two thresholds on the
structure of the effective nonlinear diffusion coefficient. One threshold
models pedestrians's communication efficiency in the dark, while the other one
describes the tunnel capacity. Essentially, we note that if the evacuees show a
maximum trust (leading to a fast communication), they tend to quickly find the
exit and hence the collective action tends to prevent the occurrence of
disasters.
