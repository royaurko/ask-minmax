We present an algorithm to unfold any triangulated 2-manifold (in particular,
any simplicial polyhedron) into a non-overlapping, connected planar layout in
linear time. The manifold is cut only along its edges. The resulting layout is
connected, but it may have a disconnected interior; the triangles are connected
at vertices, but not necessarily joined along edges. We extend our algorithm to
establish a similar result for simplicial manifolds of arbitrary dimension.
