Tropical cyclones and cyclogenesis are active areas of research.
Chute-operated dropsondes jointly developed by NASA and NCAR are capable of
acquiring high resolution vertical wind profile of tropical cyclones. This
paper proposes a chute-free vertical retardation technique (termed as
spinsonde) that can accurately measure vertical wind profile. Unlike the
expendable dropsondes, the spinsonde allows multi-cycle measurement to be
performed within a single flight. Proof of principle is demonstrated using a
simulation software and results indicate that the GPS ground speed correlates
with the wind speeds to within +/-5 km/h. This technique reduces flying weight
and increases payload capacity by eliminating bulky chutes. Maximum cruising
speed (Vh) achieved by the spinsonde UAV is 372 km/h.
