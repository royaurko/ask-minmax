The geometric, kinetic, and total inductances and the attenuation constant
are theoretically analyzed for a thin-film superconducting coplanar waveguide
(CPW) resonator consisting of a current-carrying central conductor, adjacent
slots, and ground planes that return the current. The analysis focuses on films
of thickness $d$ obeying $d < 2\lambda$ ($\lambda$ is the London penetration
depth), for which the material properties are characterized by the
two-dimensional screening length $\Lambda = 2 \lambda^2/d$. Introducing a
cut-off procedure that guarantees that the magnitudes of the currents in the
central conductor and the ground planes are equal, new and simpler results are
obtained for the kinetic inductance and the attenuation constant for small
$\Lambda$. Exact results for arbitrary $\Lambda$ are presented for the
geometric, kinetic, and total inductances in the limit of tiny slot widths, and
approximate results are presented for arbitrary slot widths.
