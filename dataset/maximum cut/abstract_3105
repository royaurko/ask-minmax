We classify all cubic systems possessing the maximum number of invariant
straight lines (real or complex) taking into account their multiplicities. We
prove that there are exactly 23 topological different classes of such systems.
For every class we provide the configuration of its invariant straight lines in
the Poincare disc. Moreover, every class is characterized by a set of affine
invariant conditions.
