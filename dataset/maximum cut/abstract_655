In this article we investigate the asymptotic behavior of a new class of
multi-dimensional diffusions in random environment. We introduce cut times in
the spirit of the work done by Bolthausen, Sznitman and Zeitouni, see [4], in
the discrete setting providing a decoupling effect in the process. This allows
us to take advantage of an ergodic structure to derive a strong law of large
numbers with possibly vanishing limiting velocity and a central limit theorem
under the quenched measure.
