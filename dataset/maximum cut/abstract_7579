We give a complete description of the genus expansion of the one-cut solution
to the generalized Penner model. The solution is presented in a form which
allows us in a very straightforward manner to localize critical points and to
investigate the scaling behaviour of the model in the vicinity of these points.
We carry out an analysis of the critical behaviour to all genera addressing all
types of multi-critical points. In certain regions of the coupling constant
space the model must be defined via analytical continuation. We show in detail
how this works for the Penner model. Using analytical continuation it is
possible to reach the fermionic 1-matrix model. We show that the critical
points of the fermionic 1-matrix model can be indexed by an integer, $m$, as it
was the case for the ordinary hermitian 1-matrix model. Furthermore the $m$'th
multi-critical fermionic model has to all genera the same value of
$\gamma_{str}$ as the $m$'th multi-critical hermitian model. However, the
coefficients of the topological expansion need not be the same in the two
cases. We show explicitly how it is possible with a fermionic matrix model to
reach a $m=2$ multi-critical point for which the topological expansion has
alternating signs, but otherwise coincides with the usual Painlev\'{e}
expansion.
