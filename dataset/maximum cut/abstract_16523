This paper is concerned with the form and dynamics of shock-acoustic waves
(SAW) generated during rocket launchings. We have developed a method for
determining SAW parameters (including angular characteristics of the wave
vector, and the SAW phase velocity, as well as the direction towards the
source) using GPS-arrays whose elements can be chosen out of a large set of
GPS-stations of the global GPS network. The application of the method is
illustrated by a case study of ionospheric effects from launchings of launch
vehicles (LV) Proton and Space Shuttle from space-launch complexes Baikonur and
Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in 1998 and 1999 (a total of five launchings). The
study revealed that, in spite of a difference of LV characteristics, the
ionospheric response for all launchings had the character of an N - wave
corresponding to the form of a shock wave, regardless of the disturbance source
(rocket launchings, industrial explosions). The SAW period T is 270--360 s, and
the amplitude exceeds the standard deviation of TEC background fluctuations in
this range of periods under quiet and moderate geomagnetic conditions by
factors of 2 to 5 as a minimum. The angle of elevation of the SAW wave vector
varies from 30 degree to 60 degree, and the SAW phase velocity (900-1200 m/s)
approaches the sound velocity at heights of the ionospheric F-region maximum.
