Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) All Sky Monitor observations of the
transient Be star X-ray source X0726-260 suggest a 34.5 day period. This is
apparently confirmed by a serendipitous RXTE Proportional Counter Array (PCA)
slew detection of the source on 1997 May 5, near the time of a predicted flux
maximum. A subsequent 5000 second pointed observation of X0726-260 with the
RXTE PCA detector was carried out on 1997 June 7, when X0726-260 was predicted
to be bright again, and this revealed pulsations at a period of 103.2 seconds.
If the 34.5 day period is orbital, then the pulse period is surprisingly long
compared to that predicted by the correlation between orbital period and spin
period observed for other Be/neutron star systems. A possible similarity with
GROJ2058+42 is briefly discussed.
