In the present paper the analytical aspects related to the maximum invariance
depth of propagation finite energy Airy-type beams are investigated,
considering not only the usual exponentially dumped Airy beams but also the
truncated ones. It is obtained an analytic expression which seems capable of
finding accurately the maximum invariance distance of these waves. The results
seem to be in line with those obtained from numerical simulations.
