We monitored the Ca II H and K lines of HD 179949, a notable star in the
southern hemisphere, to observe and confirm previously identified planet
induced emission (PIE) as an effect of star-planet interaction. We obtained
high resolution spectra (R ~ 53,000) with a signal-to-noise ratio S/N >~ 50 in
the Ca II H and K cores during 10 nights of observation at the McDonald
Observatory. Wide band echelle spectra were taken using the 2.7 m telescope.
Detailed statistical analysis of Ca II K revealed fluctuations in the Ca II K
core attributable to planet induced chromospheric emission. This result is
consistent with previous studies by Shkolnik et al. (2003). Additionally, we
were able to confirm the reality and temporal evolution of the phase shift of
the maximum of star-planet interaction previously found. However, no
identifiable fluctuations were detected in the Ca II H core. The Al I lambda
3944 A line was also monitored to gauge if the expected activity enhancements
are confined to the chromospheric layer. Our observations revealed some
variability, which is apparently unassociated with planet induced activity.
