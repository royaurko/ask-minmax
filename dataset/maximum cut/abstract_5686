We propose a model for assessing the unresolved wrinkling factor in LES of
turbulent premixed combustion. It relies essentially on a power-law dependence
of the wrinkling factor to the filter size and an original expression for the
active corrugating strain rate. The latter is written as a product of an
efficiency function which accounts for viscous effects and the kinematic
constraint of Peters, by a recent expression for the turbulent strain
intensity. Yields functional expressions for the fractal dimension and the
inner cut-off length scale, the latter being (i) filter-size independent and
(ii) consistent with the Damk\"ohler asymptotic behaviors at both large and
small Karlovitz numbers. A new expression for the wrinkling factor which
incorporates finite Reynolds numbers effects is further proposed. Finally, the
model is successfully assessed on an experimental filtered database.
