Angle-resolved valence-band resonant photoemission of nickel metal has been
measured close to the 2p core-level thresholds with synchrotron radiation. The
well-known 6-eV correlation satellite has an intensity enhancement of about two
orders of magnitude at resonance. The angular dependence of the photoemission
intensity has been studied as function of photon energy and provides
unambiguous evidence for interference effects all the way up to the resonance
maximum. The observation of different angular asymmetries, {\beta}, for the
valence band and the satellite is discussed in connection to the origin of the
resonant photoemission process and the character of the satellite.
