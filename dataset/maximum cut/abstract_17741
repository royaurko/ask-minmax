We present a nonlinear Monte Carlo model of efficient diffusive shock
acceleration (DSA) where the magnetic turbulence responsible for particle
diffusion is calculated self-consistently from the resonant cosmic-ray (CR)
streaming instability, together with non-resonant short- and long-wavelength
CR-current-driven instabilities. We include the backpressure from CRs
interacting with the strongly amplified magnetic turbulence which decelerates
and heats the super-alfvenic flow in the extended shock precursor. Uniquely, in
our plane-parallel, steady-state, multi-scale model, the full range of
particles, from thermal (~eV) injected at the viscous subshock, to the escape
of the highest energy CRs (~PeV) from the shock precursor, are calculated
consistently with the shock structure, precursor heating, magnetic field
amplification (MFA), and scattering center drift relative to the background
plasma. In addition, we show how the cascade of turbulence to shorter
wavelengths influences the total shock compression, the downstream proton
temperature, the magnetic fluctuation spectra, and accelerated particle
spectra. A parameter survey is included where we vary shock parameters, the
mode of magnetic turbulence generation, and turbulence cascading. From our
survey results, we obtain scaling relations for the maximum particle momentum
and amplified magnetic field as functions of shock speed, ambient density, and
shock size.
