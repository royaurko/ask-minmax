We have performed 1-dimensional calculations for explosive nucleosynthesis in
collapse-driven supernova and investigated its sensitivity to the initial form
of the shock wave. We have found the tendency that the peak temperature becomes
higher around the mass cut if the input energy is injected more in the form of
kinetic energy rather than internal energy. Then, the mass cut becomes larger,
and, as a result, neutron-rich matter is less included in the ejecta; this is
favorable for producing the observational data compared with a previous model.
Our results imply that the standard method to treat various processes for
stellar evolution, such as convection and electron capture during the silicon
burning stage, are still compatible with the calculation of explosive
nucleosynthesis.
