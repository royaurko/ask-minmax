We perform a qualitative analysis of phase locking in a double point-contact
spinvalve system by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonzewski equation
using a hybrid-finite-element method. We show that the phase-locking behaviour
depends on the applied field angle. Starting from a low field angle, the
locking-current difference between the current through contact A and B
increases with increasing angle up to a maximum of 14 mA at 30 degree and it
decreases thereafter until it reaches a minimum of 1 mA at 75 degree. The
tunability of the phase-lock frequency with current decreases linearly with
increasing out of plane angle from 45 to 21 MHz/mA.
