CMB experiments aiming at a precise measurement of the CMB polarization, such
as the Planck satellite, need a strong polarized absolute calibrator on the sky
to accurately set the detectors polarization angle and the cross-polarization
leakage. As the most intense polarized source in the microwave sky at angular
scales of few arcminutes, the Crab nebula will be used for this purpose. Our
goal was to measure the Crab nebula polarization characteristics at 90 GHz with
unprecedented precision. The observations were carried out with the IRAM 30m
telescope employing the correlation polarimeter XPOL and using two orthogonally
polarized receivers. We processed the Stokes I, Q, and U maps from our
observations in order to compute the polarization angle and linear polarization
fraction. The first is almost constant in the region of maximum emission in
polarization with a mean value of alpha_Sky=152.1+/-0.3 deg in equatorial
coordinates, and the second is found to reach a maximum of Pi=30% for the most
polarized pixels. We find that a CMB experiment having a 5 arcmin circular beam
will see a mean polarization angle of alpha_Sky=149.9+/-0.2 deg and a mean
polarization fraction of Pi=8.8+/-0.2%.
