It is shown that the spin and orbital angular momentum of electric dipole
photons have the same operator structure and may differ from each other only by
spatial dependence in the very vicinity of the atom. It is shown that the
photon twins created by a dipole forbidden transition can manifest the maximum
entanglement with respect to the angular momentum. It is shown that the states
of photons with projection of angular momentum $m=0$ are less stable than those
with $m= \pm 1$.
