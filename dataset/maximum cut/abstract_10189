Sunspot numbers exhibit large short-timescale (daily-monthly) variation in
addition to longer timescale variation due to solar cycles.
  A formal statistical framework is presented for estimating and forecasting
randomness in sunspot numbers on top of deterministic (including chaotic)
models for solar cycles. The Fokker-Planck approach formulated assumes a
specified long-term or secular variation in sunspot number over an underlying
solar cycle via a driver function. The model then describes the observed
randomness in sunspot number on top of this driver function. We consider a
simple harmonic choice for the driver function, but the approach is general and
can easily be extended to include other drivers which account for underlying
physical processes and/or empirical features of the sunspot numbers. The
framework is consistent during both solar maximum and minimum, and requires no
parameter restrictions to ensure non-negative sunspot numbers. Model parameters
are estimated using statistically optimal techniques. The model agrees both
qualitatively and quantitatively with monthly sunspot data even with the
simplistic representation of the periodic solar cycle. This framework should be
particularly useful for solar cycle forecasters and is complementary to
existing modeling techniques. An analytic approximation for the Fokker-Planck
equation is presented, which is analogous to the Euler approximation, which
which allows for efficient maximum likelihood estimation of large data sets
and/or when using difficult to evaluate driver functions.
