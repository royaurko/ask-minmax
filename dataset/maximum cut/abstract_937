We investigate the relationship between two kinds of vertex colorings of
graphs: unique-maximum colorings and conflict-free colorings. In a
unique-maximum coloring, the colors are ordered, and in every path of the graph
the maximum color appears only once. In a conflict-free coloring, in every path
of the graph there is a color that appears only once. We also study
computational complexity aspects of conflict-free colorings and prove a
completeness result. Finally, we improve lower bounds for those chromatic
numbers of the grid graph.
