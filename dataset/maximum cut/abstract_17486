Particle acceleration using ultraintense, ultrashort laser pulses is one of
the most attractive topics in relativistic laser-plasma research. We report
proton/ion acceleration in the intensity range of 5x1019 W/cm2 to 3.3x1020
W/cm2 by irradiating linearly polarized, 30-fs, 1-PW laser pulses on 10- to
100-nm-thick polymer targets. The proton energy scaling with respect to the
intensity and target thickness was examined. The experiments demonstrated, for
the first time with linearly polarized light, a transition from the target
normal sheath acceleration to radiation pressure acceleration and showed a
maximum proton energy of 45 MeV when a 10-nm-thick target was irradiated by a
laser intensity of 3.3x1020 W/cm2. The experimental results were further
supported by two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Based on
the deduced proton energy scaling, proton beams having an energy of ~ 200 MeV
should be feasible at a laser intensity of 1.5x1021 W/cm2.
