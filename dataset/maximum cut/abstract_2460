Spontaneous symmetry breaking has been observed in lattice simulations of
five-dimensional gauge theories on an orbifold. This effect is reproduced by
perturbation theory if it is modified to account for a finite cut-off. We
present a comparison of lattice and analytic results for bulk gauge group
SU(2).
