In this study the possibility of combining commercial Scanning Force
Microscopes (SFM) with stretching devices for the investigation of microscopic
surface changes during stepwise elongation is investigated. Different types of
stretching devices have been developed either for Scanning Platform-SFM or for
Stand Alone-SFM. Their suitability for the investigation of deformation induced
surface changes is demonstrated. A uniaxially oriented polypropylene film is
stretched vertically to its extrusion direction. The reorientation of its
microfibrillar structure is investigated and correlated to macroscopic
structural changes determined by taking a force-elongation curve. Microtome
cuts of natural rubber filled with 15 PHR carbon black are stretched. Changes
in topography, local stiffness and adhesive force are simultaneously reported
by using a new imaging method called Pulsed Force Mode (PFM).
