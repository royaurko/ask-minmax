In this paper we study how the triviality bound on higgs mass in the context
of the SM is modified by a light stabilized radion of the Goldberger-Wise
variety. Our approach is inherently perturbative. Including the radion
contribution to $\bt(\l)$ and $\bt(g_t)$ to one loop we evolve the higgs self
coupling $\l$ from the cut off $\L(=\vphi)$ down to the EW scale $\mu_0 = v$.
The triviality bound is obtained by requiring that $\l(\L) = \sqrt{4 \pi}$
which is the perturbative limit. We also study the effect of small changes in
the UVBC on the triviality bound both in the presence and absence of a light
radion.
