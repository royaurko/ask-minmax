We find Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) black hole solutions endowed with massless
scalar hair in the presence of a potential $V\left(\phi \right) $ as function
of the scalar field $\phi $. Choosing $V\left(\phi \right) =$constant (or zero)
sets the scalar field to vanish leaving us with the EYM black holes. Our class
of black hole solutions is new so that they do not asymptote in general to any
known limits. Particular case is given, however, which admits an asymptotically
anti de Sitter limit in $6-$dimensional spacetime. The role of the potential
$V\left(\phi \right) $ in making double bounces (i.e. both a minimum and
maximum radii) on a Domain Wall (DW) universe is highlighted.
