The rearrangement time \Deltat of the fission reaction can be extracted from
the full-width at half maximum (f.w.h.m.) of the isotopic distributions of
fission fragments if this width is attributed to an uncertainty \DeltaN in the
neutron-number N of the fragment; then the energy-time uncertainty relation
leads to \Deltat = 0.17 yoctosecond.
