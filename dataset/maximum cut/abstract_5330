The angular dependence of terahertz (THz) emission from birefringent crystals
can differ significantly from that of cubic crystals. Here we consider optical
rectification in uniaxial birefringent materials, such as chalcopyrite
crystals. The analysis is verified in (110)-cut ZnGeP_2 and compared to
(zincblende) GaP. Although the crystals share the same nonzero second-order
tensor elements, the birefringence in chalcopyrite crystals cause the pump
pulse polarization to evolve as it propagates through the crystal, resulting in
a drastically different angular dependence in chalcopyrite crystals. The
analysis is extended to {012}- and {114}-cut chalcopyrite crystals and predicts
more efficient conversion for the {114} crystal cut over the {012}- and
{110}-cuts.
