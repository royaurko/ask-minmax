The six independent elastic constants of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ were determined using
resonant ultrasound spectroscopy on a high-quality single-crystal specimen. The
constants are in excellent agreement with those obtained from pulse-echo
experiments performed on a sample cut from the same ingot. A calculation of the
Debye temperature using the measured constants agrees well with values obtained
from both specific heat and M\"{o}ssbauer measurements.
