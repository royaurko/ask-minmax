We consider decay of phonon condensate into phonons at photodissociation of
the strong coupling large polaron (SCLP), when the charge carrier becomes free.
Expression to calculate the band in ARPES caused by photodissociation of SCLP
is obtained. The band in ARPES caused by photodissociation of strong-coupling
large-radius polarons is a broad band with the shape determined by Poisson
distribution. It can be structured or unstructured depending on the phonon
dispersion since a distance between neighbouring lines comprising the band is
the phonon energy. Half-width of the band is in the interval 1.3 - 1.7Ep,
depending on the phonon energy. The band maximum is situated approximately at
the electron energy Ephot-W-3.2Ep (where Ephot is the photon energy, W is work
function), and its position does not depend on the electron wave vector
direction.
