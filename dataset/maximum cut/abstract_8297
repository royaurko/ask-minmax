The cosmic far-infrared background is now well measured from 140 micron to 1
mm. Uncertainties remain at 100 micron (and even more at 60 micron). These are
dominated by limitations of the zodiacal model. The nature of sources
dominating the background near its maximum are beginning to be studied through
deep surveys carried out with ISOPHOT. These surveys show very steep number
counts and fluctuations of the background due to unresolved sources.
