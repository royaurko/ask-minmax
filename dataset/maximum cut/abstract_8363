A Monte Carlo-maximum entropy calculation of the optical conductivity of the
infinite-dimensional Hubbard model is presented. We show that the optical
conductivity displays the anomalies found in the cuprate superconductors,
including a Drude width which grows linearly with temperature, a Drude weight
which grows linearly with doping, and a temperature and doping-dependent mid-IR
peak. These anomalies arise as a consequence of the dynamical generation of a
quasiparticle band at the Fermi energy as T -> 0, and are a generic property of
the strongly correlated Hubbard model in all dimensions greater than one.
