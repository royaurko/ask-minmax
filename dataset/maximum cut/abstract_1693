Extreme Value theory is part and parcel of any study of order statistics in
one-dimension. Our aim here is to consider such large sample theory for the
maximum distance to the origin, and the related maximum "interpoint distance,"
in multi-dimensions. We show that for the spherically symmetric families of
densities, these statistics have a Gumbel type limit, generalizing several
existing results. We also discuss the other two types of limit laws and suggest
some still open problems. This work complements our earlier study on the
minimum interpoint distance.
