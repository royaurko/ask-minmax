This paper presents the dynamical simulations run in the potential derived
from the light distribution of 5 late-type barred spiral galaxies. The aim is
to determine whether the mass distribution together with the hydrodynamical
simulations can reproduce the observed line-of-sight velocity curves and the
gas morphology in the inner regions of the sample barred galaxies. The light
distribution is obtained from the $H$-band and the $I$-band combined together.
The M/L is determined using population synthesis models. The observations and
the methodology of the mass distribution modelling are presented in a companion
paper. The SPH models using the stellar mass models obtained directly from the
$H$-band light distributions give a good representation of the gas distribution
and dynamics of the modelled galaxies, supporting the maximum disk assumption.
This result indicates that the gravitational field in the inner region is
mostly provided by the stellar luminous component. When 40% of the total mass
is transferred to an axisymmetric dark halo, the modelled kinematics clearly
depart from the observed kinematics, whereas the departures are negligible for
dark mass halos of 5% and 20% of the total mass. This result sets a lower limit
for the contribution of the luminous component of about 80%, which is in
agreement with the maximum disk definition of the stellar mass contribution to
the rotation curve (about 85%$\pm$10).
