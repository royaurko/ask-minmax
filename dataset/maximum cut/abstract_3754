Microscopic vapor explosions or cavitation bubbles can be generated
periodically in an optical tweezer with a microparticle that partially absorbs
at the trapping laser wavelength. In this work we correlate the size of the
cavitation bubbles with the cycle frequency for microparticles with a diameter
of 3 $\mu$m. We use high speed video recording to measure the maximum bubble
sizes and a fast photodiode to collect the trapping laser light scattered by
both the particle and the transient bubble. We find an inverse relation between
maximum bubble size and cycle frequency, consistent with a longer displacement
of the microbead induced by larger bubbles and hence a longer time back to the
waist. More than $94 \%$ of the measured maximum bubble radiuses are in the
range between 2 and 6 $\mu$m, while the same percentage of the measured
frequencies are between 10 and 200 Hz. The width of the scattered light signal
for both particle and bubble during cavitation is proportional to the predicted
lifetime for a spherical bubble. In this way we also show that it is possible
to get good estimates of the bubble sizes and the cycle frequencies using a
high speed photodiode.
