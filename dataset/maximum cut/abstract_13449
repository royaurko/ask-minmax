For monochromatic solutions of D'Alembert's wave equation and Maxwell's
equations, we obtain sharp bounds on the sup norm as a function of the far
field energy. The extremizer in the scalar case is radial. In the case of
Maxwell's equation, the electric field maximizing the value at the origin
follows longitude lines on the sphere at infinity. In dimension $d=3$ the
highest electric field for Maxwell's equation is smaller by a factor 2/3 than
the highest corresponding scalar waves.
  The highest electric field densities on the balls $B_R(0)$ occur as $R\to 0$.
The density dips to half max at $R$ approximately equal to one third the
wavelength. The extremizing fields are identical to those that attain the
maximum field intensity at the origin.
