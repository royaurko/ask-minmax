In this paper, we construct thin-shell wormholes from charged black string
through cut and paste procedure and investigate its stability. We assume
modified generalized Chaplygin gas as a dark energy fluid (exotic matter)
present in the thin layer of matter-shell. The stability of these constructed
thin-shell wormholes is investigated in the scenario of linear perturbations.
We conclude that static stable as well as unstable configurations are possible
for cylindrical thin-shell wormholes.
