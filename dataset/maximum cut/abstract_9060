We consider particular entanglement of two particles whose state vectors are
in bases that are mutually unbiased (MUB), i.e. "that exhibit maximum degree of
incompatibility" (J.Schwinger,Nat. Ac. Sci. (USA), 1960)). We use this link
between entanglement and MUB to outline a protocol for secure key distribution
among the parties that share these entangled states. The analysis leads to an
association of entangled states and states in an MUB set: both carry the same
labels.
