In this paper, we analyze the scaling properties of a model that has as
limiting cases the diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) and the ballistic
aggregation (BA) models. This model allows us to control the radial and angular
scaling of the patterns, as well as, their gap distributions. The particles
added to the cluster can follow either ballistic trajectories, with probability
$P_{ba}$, or random ones, with probability $P_{rw}=1-P_{ba}$. The patterns were
characterized through several quantities, including those related to the radial
and angular scaling. The fractal dimension as a function of $P_{ba}$
continuously increases from $d_f\approx 1.72$ (DLA dimensionality) for
$P_{ba}=0$ to $d_f\approx 2$ (BA dimensionality) for $P_{ba}=1$. However, the
lacunarity and the active zone width exhibt a distinct behavior: they are
convex functions of $P_{ba}$ with a maximum at $P_{ba}\approx1/2$. Through the
analysis of the angular correlation function, we found that the difference
between the radial and angular exponents decreases continuously with increasing
$P_{ba}$ and rapidly vanishes for $P_{ba}>1/2$, in agreement with recent
results concerning the asymptotic scaling of DLA clusters.
