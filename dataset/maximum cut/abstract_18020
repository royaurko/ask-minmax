We study the spot distribution on the surface of LQ~Hya during the observing
seasons October 1998 -- November 2002. We look for persistent active
longitudes, trends in the level of spot activity and compare to photometric
data, specifically to the derived time epochs of the lightcurve minima. We
apply the Doppler Imaging technique on photospheric spectral lines using an
inversion code to retrieve images of the surface temperature. We present new
temperature maps using multiple spectral lines for a total of 7 seasons. We
calculate spot coverage fractions from each map, and as a result we find a
general trend that is interpreted to be an indication of a spot cycle. There is
a minimum during the observing season of March 1999. After this the activity
increases until November 2000, followed by a general decrease in activity
again. We find no evidence for active longitudes persisting over multiple
observing seasons. The spot activity appears to be concentrated to two latitude
regions. The high latitude spots are particularly strong when the spot coverage
is at a maximum. Using the currently accepted rotation period, we find spot
structures to show a trend in the phase-time plot, indicative of a need for a
longer period. We conclude that the long-term activity of LQ~Hya is more
chaotic than that of some magnetically active binary stars analyzed with
similar methods, but still with clear indications of an activity cycle.
