In this paper, continuation of Gil de Paz et al. (Paper I), we derive the
main properties of the stellar populations in the Blue Compact Dwarf galaxy
Mrk86. Ages, stellar masses, metallicites and burst strengths have been
obtained using the combination of Monte Carlo simulations, a maximum likelihood
estimator and Cluster and Principal Component Analysis. The three stellar
populations detected show well defined properties. We have studied the
underlying stellar population, which shows an age between 5-13 Gyr and no
significant color gradients. The intermediate aged (30 Myr old) central
starburst show a very low dust extinction with high burst strength and high
stellar mass content (9 10^6 M_sun). Finally, the properties of 46
low-metallicity star-forming regions were also studied. The properties derived
suggest that the most recent star-forming activity in Mrk86 was triggered by
the evolution of a superbubble originated at the central starburst by the
energy deposition of stellar winds and supernova explosions. Finally, different
mechanisms for the star formation triggering in this massive central starburst
are studied, including the merging with a low mass companion and the
interaction with UGC4278.
