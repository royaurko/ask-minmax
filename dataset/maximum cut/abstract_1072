An extension of the notion of dinatural transformation is introduced in order
to give a criterion for preservation of dinaturality under composition. An
example of an application is given by proving that all bicartesian closed
canonical transformations are dinatural. An alternative sequent system for
intuitionistic propositional logic is introduced as a device, and a cut
elimination procedure is established for this system.
