It is shown that for any fixed $c \geq 3$ and $r$, the maximum possible
chromatic number of a graph on $n$ vertices in which every subgraph of radius
at most $r$ is $c$ colorable is $\tilde{\Theta}\left(n ^ {\frac{1}{r+1}}
\right)$ (that is, $n^\frac{1}{r+1}$ up to a factor poly-logarithmic in $n$).
The proof is based on a careful analysis of the local and global colorability
of random graphs and implies, in particular, that a random $n$-vertex graph
with the right edge probability has typically a chromatic number as above and
yet most balls of radius $r$ in it are $2$-degenerate.
