New Faddeev-Yakubovsky calculations are reported for Lambda-Lambda-6He and
Lambda-Lambda-10Be in terms of clusters of alpha's and Lambda's, using
Lambda-Lambda s-wave potentials motivated by several of the Nijmegen model
interactions. The self consistency of the Lambda-Lambda hypernuclear world data
for these species is discussed. The newly reported Lambda-Lambda-6He event is
found to be compatible with Lambda-Lambda interaction strengths provided by the
Nijmegen soft-core one-boson-exchange model NSC97. Faddeev calculations for
Lambda-Lambda-5H and Lambda-Lambda-5He suggest that these Lambda-Lambda
hypernuclei are stable against emitting Lambda's for any (essentially
attractive) Lambda-Lambda interaction, whereas calcualtions for
Lambda-Lambda-4H do not allow a clear-cut conclusion whether or not it is
particle stable.
