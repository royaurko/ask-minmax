We show which multi-trace structures are compatible with the symmetrisation
of local operators in \cN=4 super Yang-Mills when they are organised into
representations of the global symmetry group. Cut-and-join operators give the
non-planar expansion of correlation functions of these operators in the free
theory. Using these techniques we find the 1/N corrections to the quarter-BPS
operators which remain protected at weak coupling. We also present a new way of
counting these chiral ring operators using the Weyl group S_N.
