In this paper, we define the minimum (maximum) rank, term rank and the sign
nonsingular of tensors. The sufficiency and necessity for the minimum rank of a
real tensor to be $1$ is given. And we show that the maximum rank of a tensor
is not less than the term rank. We also prove that the minimum rank of a sign
nonsingular tensor is not less than the dimension of it. And we get some
characterizations of a tensor having sign left or sign right inverses.
