We present a type-I outburst of the high-mass X-ray binary EXO 2030+375,
detected during INTEGRAL's Performance and Verification Phase in December 2002
(on-source time about 10e+06 seconds). In addition, six more outbursts have
been observed during INTEGRAL's Galactic Plane Scans. X-ray pulsations have
been detected with a pulse period of 41.691798+-0.000016 s. The X-ray
luminosity in the 5-300 keV energy range was 9.7*10e+36 erg/s, for a distance
of 7.1 kpc. Two unusual features were found in the light curve, with an initial
peak before the main outburst and another possible spike after the maximum.
RXTE observations confirm only the existence of the initial spike. Although the
initial peak appears to be a recurrent feature, the physical mechanisms
producing it and the possible second spike are unknown. Moreover, a four-day
delay between periastron passage and the peak of the outburst is observed. We
present for the first time a 5-300 keV broad-band spectrum of this source. It
can be modelled by the sum of a disk black body (kT_bb~8 keV) with either a
power law model with Gamma=2.04+-0.11 keV or a Comptonized component (spherical
geometry, kT_e=30 keV, tau=2.64, kT_W=1.5 keV).
