We present near-infrared spectra of young radio quasars [P(1.4GHz) ~ 26-27
W/Hz] selected from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer. The detected
objects have typical redshifts of z ~ 1.6-2.5 and bolometric luminosities ~
10^47 erg/s. Based on the intensity ratios of narrow emission lines, we find
that these objects are mainly powered by active galactic nuclei (AGNs),
although star formation contribution cannot be completely ruled out. The host
galaxies experience moderate levels of extinction, A(V) ~ 0-1.3 mag. The
observed [O III] luminosities and rest-frame J-band magnitudes constrain the
black hole masses to lie in the range ~ 10^8.9-10^9.7 solar mass. From the
empirical correlation between black hole mass and host galaxy mass, we infer
stellar masses of ~ 10^11.3-10^12.2 solar mass. The [O III] line is
exceptionally broad, with full width at half maximum ~1300 to 2100 km/s,
significantly larger than that of ordinary distant quasars. We argue that these
large line widths can be explained by jet-induced outflows, as predicted by
theoretical models of AGN feedback.
