We present a simplified analytic model of a quadrupolar magnetic field and
flux rope to model coronal mass ejections. The model magnetic field is
two-dimensional, force-free and has current only on the axis of the flux rope
and within two currents sheets. It is a generalization of previous models
containing a single current sheet anchored to a bipolar flux distribution. Our
new model can undergo quasi-static evolution due either to changes at the
boundary or to magnetic reconnection at either current sheet. We find that all
three kinds of evolution can lead to a catastrophe known as loss of
equilibrium. Some equilibria can be driven to catastrophic instability either
through reconnection at the lower current sheet, known as tether cutting, or
through reconnection at the upper current sheet, known as breakout. Other
equilibria can be destabilized through only one and not the other. Still others
undergo no instability, but evolve increasingly rapidly in response to slow
steady driving (ideal or reconnective). One key feature of every case is a
response to reconnection different from that found in simpler systems. In our
two-current sheet model a reconnection electric field in one current sheet
causes the current in that sheet to {\em increase} rather than decrease. This
suggests the possibility for the microscopic reconnection mechanism to run
away.
