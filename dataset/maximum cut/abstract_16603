Neutron scattering experiments were performed on single crystals of layered
cobalt-oxides La2-xCaxCoO4 (LCCO) to characterize the charge and spin orders in
a wide hole-doping range of 0.3<x<0.8. For a commensurate value of x=0.5 in
(H,0,L) plane, two types of superlattice reflections concomitantly appear at
low temperature; one corresponds to a checkerboard charge ordered pattern of
Co2+/Co3+ ions and the other is magnetic in origin. Further, the latter
magnetic-superlattice peaks show two types of symmetry in the reflections,
suggesting antiferromagnetic-stacking (AF-S) and ferromagnetic-stacking (F-S)
patterns of spins along the c direction. From the hole-doping dependence, the
in-plane correlation lengths of both charge and spin orders are found to give a
maximum at x=0.5. These features are the same with those of x=0.5 in
La1-xSr1+xMnO4 (LSMO), a typical checkerboard and spin ordered compound.
However, in (H,H,L) plane, we found a magnetic scattering peak at
Q=(1/4,1/4,1/2) position below TN. This magnetic peak can not be understood by
considering the Co2+ spin configuration, suggesting that this peak is
originated from Co3+ spin order. By analyzing these superlattice reflections,
we found that they are originated from high-spin state of Co3+ spin order.
