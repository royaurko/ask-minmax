This paper presents a parametric stiffness analysis of the Orthoglide, a
3-DOF translational Parallel Kinematic Machine. First, a compliant modeling of
the Orthoglide is conducted based on an existing method. Then stiffness matrix
is symbolically computed. This allows one to easily study the influence of the
geometric design parameters on the matrix elements. Critical links are
displayed. Cutting forces are then modeled so that static displacements of the
Orthoglide tool during slot milling are symbolically computed. Influence of the
geometric design parameters on the static displacements is checked as well.
Other machining operations can be modeled. This parametric stiffness analysis
can be applied to any parallel manipulator for which stiffness is a critical
issue.
