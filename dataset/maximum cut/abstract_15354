The maximum entropy principle is largely used in thresholding and
segmentation of images. Among the several formulations of this principle, the
most effectively applied is that based on Tsallis non-extensive entropy. Here,
we discuss the role of its entropic index in determining the thresholds. When
this index is spanning the interval (0,1), for some images, the values of
thresholds can have large leaps. In this manner, we observe abrupt transitions
in the appearance of corresponding bi-level or multi-level images. These
gray-level image transitions are analogous to order or texture transitions
observed in physical systems, transitions which are driven by the temperature
or by other physical quantities.
