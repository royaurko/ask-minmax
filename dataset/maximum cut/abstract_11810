A wide variety of superconducting oxides are used to test a general model of
high pressure induced transition temperature (T c) changes. The T c 's vary
from a low of 24 K to a high of 164 K. Although the model is capable of
predicting both increases and decreases in T c with pressure, only
superconductors that exhibit an increase are considered at this time.
Predictions are made of the maximum T^ cP theo for 15 super-conductors as a
function of their compressibilities. The theoretical results generally agree
well with experiment. This model of T c as a function of pressure is derived
from a recent successful phenomenological theory of short coherence length
superconductivity.
