We report measurements of turbulent heat-transport in samples of ethane
(C$_2$H$_6$) heated from below while the applied temperature difference $\Delta
T$ straddled the liquid-vapor co-existance curve $T_\phi(P)$. When the sample
top temperature $T_t$ decreased below $T_\phi$, droplet condensation occurred
and the latent heat of vaporization $H$ provided an additional heat-transport
mechanism.The effective conductivity $\lambda_{eff}$ increased linearly with
decreasing $T_t$, and reached a maximum value $\lambda_{eff}^*$ that was an
order of magnitude larger than the single-phase $\lambda_{eff}$. As $P$
approached the critical pressure, $\lambda_{eff}^*$ increased dramatically even
though $H$ vanished. We attribute this phenomenon to an enhanced
droplet-nucleation rate as the critical point is approached.
