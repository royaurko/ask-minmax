Higgs production in association with a $W$ boson and two energetic tag jets
at the LHC is studied for $M_H = 120$ \GeV, with the Higgs decaying to
$b\bar{b}$ and the $W$ to $\ell\nu$ ($\ell = e, \mu$), guaranteeing high
trigger efficiency. All parton level backgrounds are analyzed, including the
effect of fake $b$--tagging. We discuss two detection strategies: in the first,
more traditional, one, two jets are required to be $b$--tagged while in the
second, which has not been previously examined in detail, only one tag is
required. After all selection cuts about 80 and 200 events are foreseen in the
two cases for a standard luminosity of 100 $fb^{-1}$ with a S/B ratio of 1/25
and 1/60 respectively. The corresponding statistical significancies,
S/$\sqrt{\mathrm B}$ are 1.81 and 1.82.
