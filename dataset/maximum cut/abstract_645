We argue that the s-channel cut contribution to J/psi hadroproduction can be
significantly larger than the usual cut contribution of the color-singlet
mechanism, which is known to underestimate the experimental measurements. A
scenario accounting for intermediate $c\bar(c)$ interactions is proposed that
reproduces the data at low- and mid-range transverse momenta P_T from the
Fermilab Tevatron and BNL Relativistiv Heavy Ion Collider. The J/psi produced
in this manner are polarized predominantly longitudinally.
