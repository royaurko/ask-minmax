The doping dependence of the superfluid density, r_s, of high-Tc
superconductors is usually considered in the context of the Uemura relation,
namely Tc proportional to rs, which is generally assumed to apply in the
underdoped regime. We show that a modified plot of Tc/Do versus rs, where Do is
the maximum d-wave gap at T=0, exhibits universal features that point to an
alternative interpretation of the underlying physics. In the underdoped region
this plot exhibits the canonical negative curvature expected when a
ground-state correlation competes with superconductivity (SC) by opening up a
gap in the normal-state DOS. In particular rs is suppressed much faster than
Tc/Do or indeed Tc. The pseudogap is found to strongly modify the SC ground
state.
