The tree-level-massless gaugino scenario predicts that the lighter chargino
mass is less than m_W and that gluino and lightest neutralino masses are $\lsi
1$ GeV. In this case the dominant decay mode of charginos and non-LSP
neutralinos is generically to three jets. The excess of "4j" events with total
invariant mass $\sim 105$ GeV observed in LEP running at 130-136 GeV is noted
to be consistent with pair production of $\sim 53$ GeV charginos. Data at 161
and 172 GeV from Fall, 1996, cannot conclusively test this hypothesis (because
cuts to eliminate $W^+W^-$ background reduce the efficiency significantly) but
is suggestive that the signal persists.
