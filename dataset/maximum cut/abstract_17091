The test particle method has been used in conjunction with molecular dynamics
simulations to evaluate the solubility of noble gases in silicate melts of
various compositions. At low pressure the calculated solubility constants (the
inverse of the Henry's constant) are in excellent agreement with data of the
literature. In particular it is found that the solubility constant (i)
decreases when the size of the noble gas increases, (ii) decreases from
silica-rich to silica-poor composition of the melt, and (iii) is positively
correlated with the temperature. Moreover it is shown that the solubility is
governed primarily by the entropic cost of cavity formation for inserting the
noble gas into the melt and secondarily by its solvation energy. Interestingly,
the behaviour of these two contributions differ from each other as the entropic
cost of cavity formation increases strongly with the size of the solute atom to
insert whereas large atoms are better solvated than small ones.
  With all melt composition investigated here (silica, rhyolite, MORB and
olivine), the calculated solubility curves exhibit the same qualitative
behaviour with pressure; a steep rise culminating in a broad maximum followed
by a gradual decrease of the solubility at higher pressure. At variance with
LHDAC experiments (Chamorro et al. (1996, 1998) and Bouhifd et al. (2006,
2008)) where a Ar solubility drop is observed at about 50 kbar in silica and
molten olivine and in the pressure range ~100-160 kbar with other melt
composition, we do not find such a sudden change of the solubility.
