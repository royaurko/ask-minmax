We describe the recently developed on-shell bootstrap for computing one-loop
amplitudes in non-supersymmetric theories such as QCD. The method combines the
unitarity method with loop-level on-shell recursion. The unitarity method is
used to compute cut-containing parts of amplitudes, and on-shell recursion is
used for the remaining rational terms.
