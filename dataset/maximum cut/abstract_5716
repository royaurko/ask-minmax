We introduce amorphic complexity as a new topological invariant that measures
the complexity of dynamical systems in the regime of zero entropy. Its main
purpose is to detect the very onset of disorder in the asymptotic behaviour.
For instance, it gives positive value to Denjoy examples on the circle and
Sturmian subshifts, while being zero for all isometries and Morse-Smale
systems. After discussing basic properties and examples, we show that amorphic
complexity and the underlying asymptotic separation numbers can be used to
distinguish almost automorphic minimal systems from equicontinuous ones. For
symbolic systems, amorphic complexity equals the box dimension of the
associated Besicovitch space. In this context, we concentrate on regular
Toeplitz flows and give a detailed description of the relation to the scaling
behaviour of the densities of the p-skeletons. Finally, we take a look at
strange non-chaotic attractors appearing in so-called pinched skew product
systems. Continuous-time systems, more general group actions and the
application to cut and project quasicrystals will be treated in subsequent
work.
