We present the effect of energy loss of charm/anti-charm produced in a
relativistic heavy ion collision as they traverse the resulting quark gluon
plasma on the azimuthal correlation of c\bar{c} and D\bar{D} pairs and their
correlated decay into leptons. We employ an empirical model of energy loss by
charm quark energy loss and find that the consequences are easily discernible
as different cuts on their momenta are applied. We also notice a modest
increase in the invariant mass spectrum of dileptons from correlated decay as
mentioned above due to energy loss.
