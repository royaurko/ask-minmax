In this paper, we define, from a finite set E of functions, a family of
holomorphic webs ${\cal W}(n;E)$ of codimension one in any dimension $ n $. We
prove that it is sufficient to check a finite number of conditions for these
webs to be all ordinary and to have all maximal rank.
  Moreover, these conditions may be practically checked by computer with the
program on Maple published in [DL](arXiv1408.3909v1, DG, 18 August 2014), the
time of computation being acceptable, as far as some integer $k_0$ given in the
data be "not too big".
