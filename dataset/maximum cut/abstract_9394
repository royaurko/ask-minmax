Starting from preferences on N proposed policies obtained via questionnaires
from a sample of the electorate, an Ising spin-glass model in a field can be
constructed from which a political party could find the subset of the proposed
policies which would maximize its appeal, form a coherent choice in the eyes of
the electorate, and have maximum overlap with the party's existing policies. We
illustrate the application of the procedure by simulations of a spin glass in a
random field on scale-free networks.
