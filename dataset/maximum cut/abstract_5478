The BPS spectrum of certain N=2 supersymmetric field theories can be
determined algebraically by studying the representation theory of BPS quivers.
We introduce methods based on BPS quivers to study line defects. The presence
of a line defect opens up a new BPS sector: framed BPS states can be bound to
the defect. The defect can be geometrically described in terms of laminations
on a curve. To a lamination we associate certain elements of the Leavitt path
algebra of the BPS quiver and use them to compute the framed BPS spectrum. We
also provide an alternative characterization of line defects by introducing
framed BPS quivers. Using the theory of (quantum) cluster algebras, we derive
an algorithm to compute the framed BPS spectra of new defects from known ones.
Line defects are generated from a framed BPS quiver by applying certain
sequences of mutation operations. Framed BPS quivers also behave nicely under a
set of "cut and join" rules, which can be used to study how N=2 systems with
defects couple to produce more complicated ones. We illustrate our formalism
with several examples.
