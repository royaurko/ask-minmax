Continuing the study reported in Satheesh (2001),(arXiv:math.PR/0304499 dated
01May2003) here we study certain aspects of randomization in infinitely
divisible (ID) and max-infinitely divisible (MID) laws. They generalize ID and
MID laws. In particular we study mixtures of ID & MID laws, its relation to
random sums & random maximums, corresponding stationary processes & extremal
processes and some of their properties. It is shown that mixtures of ID laws
and mixtures of MID laws appear as limits of random sums and random maximums
respectively. We identify a class of probability generating functions for N,
the random sample size. A method to construct class-L laws is given.
