Two independent acoustic methods were used to verify the results of earlier
explosion energy calculations of Chelyabinsk meteoroid. They are: estimations
through a path length of infrasound wave and through maximum concentration of
the wave energy. The energy of this explosion turned out the same as in earlier
calculations, and it is close to 57 Mt of TNT. The first method, as well as
evaluations through seismic signals and barograms, have confirmed the energy of
Tunguska meteoroid explosion at 14.0 - 14.5 Mt level. Moreover, there is a good
agreement between acoustic estimations and other data for the explosion energy
of another meteoroid that was ended its flight over the southern part of Indian
Ocean, and for two catastrophic volcanoes explosions - Bezymyanny and Krakatoa.
