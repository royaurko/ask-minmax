The properties of uniformly rotating white dwarfs are analyzed within the
framework of general relativity. Hartle's formalism is applied to construct
self-consistently the internal and external solutions to the Einstein
equations. The mass, the radius, the moment of inertia and quadrupole moment of
rotating white dwarfs have been calculated as a function of both the central
density and rotation period of the star. The maximum mass of rotating white
dwarfs for stable configurations has been obtained.
