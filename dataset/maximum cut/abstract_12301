The restoration of chiral symmetry and its subsequent breaking through a
phase transition has been predicted to create regions of Disoriented Chiral
Condensates (DCC). This phenomenon has been predicted to cause anomalous
fluctuations in the relative production of charged and neutral pions in
high-energy hadronic and nuclear collisions. The WA98 experiment has been used
to measure charged and photon multiplicities in the central region of 158 AGeV
Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS. In a sample of 212646 events, no clear DCC
signal can be distinguished. Using a simple DCC model, we have set a 90% C.L.
upper limit on the maximum DCC production allowed by the data.
