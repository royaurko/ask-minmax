In this paper we study dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in dimensionally
regularized quenched QED within the context of Dyson-Schwinger equations. In D
< 4 dimensions the theory has solutions which exhibit chiral symmetry breaking
for all values of the coupling. To begin with, we study this phenomenon both
numerically and, with some approximations, analytically within the rainbow
approximation in the Landau gauge. In particular, we discuss how to extract the
critical coupling alpha_c = pi/3 relevant in four dimensions from the D
dimensional theory. We further present analytic results for the chirally
symmetric solution obtained with the Curtis-Pennington vertex as well as
numerical results for solutions exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking. For these
we demonstrate that, using dimensional regularization, the extraction of the
critical coupling relevant for this vertex is feasible. Initial results for
this critical coupling are in agreement with cut-off based work within the
currently achievable numerical precision.
