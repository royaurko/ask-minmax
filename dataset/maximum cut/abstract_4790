We studied the universality of Wishart ensembles whose covariance matrix has
2 distinct eigenvalues. We studied the asymptotic limit when the number of both
eigenvalues goes to infinity and obtained universality results. In this case,
the limiting eigenvalue distribution can be supported on 1 or 2 disjoint
intervals. We obtained a necessary and sufficient condition on the parameters
such that the limiting distribution is supported on 2 disjoint intervals and
have computed the eigenvalue density in the limit. Furthermore, by using
Riemann-Hilbert analysis, we have shown that under proper rescaling of the
eigenvalues, the limiting correlation kernel is given by the sine kernel and
the Airy kernel in the bulk and the edge of the spectrum respectively. As a
consequence, the behavior of the largest eigenvalue in this model is described
by the Tracy-Widom distribution.
