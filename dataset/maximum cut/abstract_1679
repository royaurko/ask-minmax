We show that for several notions of rank including tensor rank, Waring rank,
and generalized rank with respect to a projective variety, the maximum value of
rank is at most twice the generic rank. We show that over the real numbers, the
maximum value of the real rank is at most twice the smallest typical rank,
which is equal to the (complex) generic rank.
