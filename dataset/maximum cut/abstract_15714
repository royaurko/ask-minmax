We analyze the cosmic peculiar velocity field as traced by a sample of 1184
spiral, elliptical and S0 galaxies, grouped in 704 objects. We perform a
statistical analysis, by calculating the bulk flow, Cosmic Mach Number and
velocity correlation function for this sample and for mock catalogs extracted
from a set of N--body simulations. We run four cold dark matter (CDM)
simulations: two tilted models (with spectral index $n=0.6$ and $n=0.8$), the
standard model ($n=1$) and a ``blue" one ($n=1.2$), with different values of
the linear bias parameter $b$. By means of a Maximum Likelihood analysis we
estimate the ability of our models to fit the observations, as measured by the
above statistics, and to reproduce the Local Group properties. On the basis of
this analysis we conclude that the best model is the unbiased standard model
$(n,~b)=(1,~1)$, even though the overall flatness of the joint likelihood
function implies that one cannot strongly discriminate models in the range $0.8
\le n \le 1$, and $1 \le b \le 1.5$. Models with $b \geq 2.5$ are rejected at
the $95\%$ confidence level. For $n=0.8$ the values of $b$ preferred by the
present analysis, together with the {\em COBE} data, require a negligible
contribution to $\Delta T/T$ by gravitational waves. Finally, the blue model,
normalized to {\em COBE}, does not provide a good fit to the velocity data.
