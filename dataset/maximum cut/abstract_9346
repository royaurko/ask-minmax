Quantum cryptographic protocols based on complementarity are nonsecure
against attacks in which complementarity is imitated with classical resources.
The Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem provides protection against these attacks,
without requiring entanglement or spatially separated composite systems. We
analyze the maximum tolerated noise to guarantee the security of a KS-protected
cryptographic scheme against these attacks, and describe a photonic realization
of this scheme using hybrid ququarts defined by the polarization and orbital
angular momentum of single photons.
