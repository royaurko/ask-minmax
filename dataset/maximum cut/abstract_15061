This paper introduces an accelerated power series solution for
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, which represents the relativistic
polytropic fluid spheres. We constructed a recurrence relation for the series
coefficients in the power series expansion of the solution of TOV equation. For
the range of the polytropic index 0<=n<=0.5, the series converges for all
values of the relativistic parameters (sigma), but it diverges for larger
polytropic index. To accelerate the convergence radii of the series, we first
used Pad\'e approximation. It is found that the series is converged for the
range 0<=n<=1.5 for all values of sigma. For n>1.5, the series diverges except
for some values of sigma. To improve the convergence radii of the series, we
used a combination of two techniques Euler-Abel transformation and Pad\'e
approximation. The new transformed series converges everywhere for the range of
the polytropic index 0<=n<=3. Comparison between the results obtained by the
proposed accelerating scheme presented here and the numerical one, revealed
good agreement with maximum relative error is of order 0.001.
