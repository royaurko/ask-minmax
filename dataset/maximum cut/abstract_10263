A general analysis of the consequences of including a fourth neutrino in the
standard model matter content, on CP violating observables at neutrino
oscillation experiments, is presented. Neutrino oscillations in vacuum and with
matter effects are studied. For the former we update and generalize previous
studies on CP asymmetries with an additional active neutrino using an updated
fit of the PMNS mixing matrix. We study the values of the new CP violating
phases which maximize the different CP asymmetries in T2K and MINOS-like setups
aiming to elucidate if the new phases yield measurable effects in the most
favorable case. We show that due to a combined effect of kinematics and
unitarity it is possible to obtain an observable asymmetry in the survival
channels without violating CPT. For the MINOS-like setup, we find maximum
asymmetries in vacuum of the order of 2% and 4% for the $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ and
$\nu_e \to \nu_\tau$ channels respectively. For the T2K-like setup we obtain
maximum asymmetries of the order of 6% in the survival $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\mu$
channel. Tree level matter effects enhance the former reaching asymmetries of
the order of 10% for the $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ and $\nu_e \to \nu_\tau$ channels,
while the $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\mu$ survival channel changes slightly depending on
the mass hierarchy. Box diagrams with the fourth mass eigenstate as a virtual
particle were also considered, the corrections to the scattering amplitude
being negligible.
