We present in detail a technique to extract the potential between a static
quark and anti-quark pair from Wilson loops measured on dynamical
configurations. This technique is based on HYP smearing and leads to an
exponential improvement of the noise-to-signal ratio of Wilson loops. We
explain why the correct continuum potential is obtained and show numerical
evidence that the cut-off effects are small. We present precise results for the
non-perturbative potential. As applications, we determine the scale r_0/a and
study the shape of the static potential in the range of distances around r_0,
where it can be compared with phenomenological potential models.
