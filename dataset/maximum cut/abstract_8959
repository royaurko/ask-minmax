The purpose, design specifications, construction techniques, and testing
methods are described for the high voltage feedthrough ports and filters of the
ATLAS Liquid Argon calorimeters. These feedthroughs carry about 5000 high
voltage wires from a room-temperature environment (300 K) through the cryostat
walls to the calorimeters cells (89 K) while maintaining the electrical and
cryogenic integrity of the system. The feedthrough wiring and filters operate
at a maximum high voltage of 2.5 kV without danger of degradation by corona
discharges or radiation at the Large Hadron Collider.
