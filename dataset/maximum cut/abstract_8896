We show that the continuous-variable analogues to the multipartite entangled
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of qubits violate Bell-type inequalities
imposed by local realistic theories. Our results suggest that the degree of
nonlocality of these nonmaximally entangled continuous-variable states,
represented by the maximum violation, grows with increasing number of parties.
This growth does not appear to be exponentially large as for the maximally
entangled qubit states, but rather decreases for larger numbers of parties.
