We have made an 8.7 GHz image of a sky region with a resolution of 8 arcmin
and high brightness sensitivity using the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA). in an ultra compact configuration. The foreground discrete-source
confusion was estimated from observations with higher resolution at the same
frequency and in a scaled array at a lower frequency. Following the subtraction
of the foreground confusion, the field shows no features in excess of the
instrument noise. This limits the CMB anisotropy flat-band power to Q_flat <
23.6 microK with 95 per cent confidence; the ATCA filter function F_l in
multipole l-space peaks at l_eff = 4700 and has half maximum values at l = 3350
and 6050.
