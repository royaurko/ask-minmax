The algebra of transactions as fundamental measurements is constructed on the
basis of the analysis of their properties and represents an expansion of the
Boolean algebra. The notion of the generalized economic measurements of the
economic quantity and quality of objects of transactions is introduced. It has
been shown that the vector space of economic states constructed on the basis of
these measurements is relativistic. The laws of kinematics of economic objects
in this space have been analyzed and the stages of constructing the dynamics
have been formulated. In particular, the principle of maximum benefit, which
represents an economic analog of the principle of least action in the classical
mechanics, and the principle of relativity as the principle of equality of all
possible consumer preferences have been formulated. The notion of economic
interval between two economic objects invariant to the selection of the vector
of consumer preferences has been introduced. Methods of experimental
verification of the principle of relativity in the space of economic states
have been proposed.
