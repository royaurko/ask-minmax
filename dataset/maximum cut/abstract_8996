A nonlinear Schrodinger equation, that had been obtained within the context
of the maximum uncertainty principle, has the form of a difference-differential
equation and exhibits some interesting properties. Here we discuss that
equation in the regime where the nonlinearity length scale is large compared to
the deBroglie wavelength; just as in the perturbative regime, the equation
again displays some universality. We also briefly discuss stationary solutions
to a naturally induced discretisation of that equation.
