We numerically examine the transport of active run-and-tumble particles
driven with a drift force over random disordered landscapes comprised of fixed
obstacles. For increasing run lengths, the net particle transport initially
increases before reaching a maximum and decreasing at larger run lengths. The
transport reduction is associated with the formation of cluster or living
crystal states that become locally jammed or clogged by the obstacles. We also
find that the system dynamically jams at lower particle densities when the run
length is increased. Our results indicate that there is an optimal activity
level for active matter transport through quenched disorder, and could be
important for understanding biological transport in complex environments or for
applications of active matter particles in random media.
