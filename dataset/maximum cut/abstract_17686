In this paper, we consider the competitive diffusion game, and study the
existence of its pure-strategy Nash equilibrium when defined over general
undirected networks. We first determine the set of pure-strategy Nash
equilibria for two special but well-known classes of networks, namely the
lattice and the hypercube. Characterizing the utility of the players in terms
of graphical distances of their initial seed placements to other nodes in the
network, we show that in general networks the decision process on the existence
of pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is an NP-hard problem. Following this, we
provide some necessary conditions for a given profile to be a Nash equilibrium.
Furthermore, we study players' utilities in the competitive diffusion game over
Erdos-Renyi random graphs and show that as the size of the network grows, the
utilities of the players are highly concentrated around their expectation, and
are bounded below by some threshold based on the parameters of the network.
Finally, we obtain a lower bound for the maximum social welfare of the game
with two players, and study sub-modularity of the players' utilities.
