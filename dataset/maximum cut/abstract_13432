We investigate holographic superfluids in AdS_{d+1} with d=3,4 in the
non-backreacted approximation for various masses of the scalar field. In d=3
the phase structure is universal for all the masses that we consider: the
critical temperature decreases as the superfluid velocity increases, and as it
is cranked high enough, the order of the phase transition changes from second
to first. Surprisingly, in d=4 we find that the phase structure is more
intricate. For sufficiently high mass, there is always a second order phase
transition to the normal phase, no matter how high the superfluid velocity. For
some parameters, as we lower the temperature, this transition happens before a
first order transition to a new superconducting phase. Across this first order
transition, the gap in the transverse conductivity jumps from almost zero to
about half its maximum value. We also introduce a double scaling limit where we
can study the phase transitions (semi-)analytically in the large velocity
limit. The results corroborate and complement our numerical results. In d=4,
this approach has the virtue of being fully analytically tractable.
