The Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) was a five-year observational survey
conducted at Las Campanas Observatory that obtained, among other things,
high-quality light curves of ~100 low-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia).
Presented here is the second data release of nearby SN Ia photometry consisting
of 50 objects, with a subset of 45 having near-infrared follow-up observations.
Thirty-three objects have optical pre-maximum coverage with a subset of 15
beginning at least 5 days before maximum light. In the near-infrared, 27
objects have coverage beginning before the epoch of B-band maximum, with a
subset of 13 beginning at least 5 days before maximum. In addition, we present
results of a photometric calibration program to measure the CSP optical
(uBgVri)bandpasses with an accuracy of ~1%. Finally, we report the discovery of
a second SN Ia, SN 2006ot, similar in its characteristics to the peculiar SN
2006bt.
