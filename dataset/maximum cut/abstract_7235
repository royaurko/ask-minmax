We consider the problem of determining the maximum number of common zeros in
a projective space over a finite field for a system of linearly independent
multivariate homogeneous polynomials defined over that field. There is an
elaborate conjecture of Tsfasman and Boguslavsky that predicts the maximum
value when the homogeneous polynomials have the same degree that is not too
large in comparison to the size of the finite field. We show that this
conjecture holds in the affirmative if the number of polynomials does not
exceed the total number of variables. This extends the results of Serre (1991)
and Boguslavsky (1997) for the case of one and two polynomials, respectively.
Moreover, it complements our recent result that the conjecture is false, in
general, if the number of polynomials exceeds the total number of variables.
