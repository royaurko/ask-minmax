We have calculated the perturbative corrections to all the structure
functions in the semileptonic decays of a heavy quark. Assuming an arbitrary
gluon mass as a technical tool allowed to obtain in parallel all the BLM
corrections. We report the basic applications, viz. perturbative corrections to
the hadronic mass and energy moments with full dependence on the charge lepton
energy cut. In the adopted scheme with the OPE momentum scale separation around
1 GeV the perturbative corrections to <M_X^2> are small and practically
independent of E_{cut}; the BLM corrections are small, too. The corrections to
the second mass squared moment show some decrease with E_{cut} consistent with
the effect of the Darwin operator, within the previously estimated theoretical
uncertainty. Perturbative corrections in the pole-type schemes appear
significant and vary with E_\ell, decreasing the moments at higher cuts. The
hardness of hadronic moments is quantitatively illustrated for different cuts
on E_\ell.
