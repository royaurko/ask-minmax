The nucleation and growth of clusters in a progressively cooled vapor is
studied. The chemical-potential of the vapor increases, resulting in a rapidly
increasing nucleation rate. The growth of the newly created clusters depletes
monomers, and counters the increase in chemical-potential. Eventually, the
chemical potential reaches a maximum and begins to decrease. Shortly thereafter
the nucleation of new clusters effectively ceases. Assuming a slow quench rate,
asymptotic methods are used to convert the non-linear advection equation of the
cluster-size distribution into a fourth-order differential equation, which is
solved numerically. The distribution of cluster-sizes that emerges from this
creation era of the quench process, and the total amount of clusters generated
are found.
