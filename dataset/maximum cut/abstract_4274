The processes involving $K^{-}p, KN, \Sigma\pi, \Lambda\pi,\Sigma\eta,
 \Lambda\eta$ coupled channels are studied in the nonperturbative chiral
approach.
 An effective potential is constructed using a chiral meson-baryon Lagrangian
at lowest order. This potential is iterated to all orders with the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation.
 A reasonable fit of the experimental data is obtained.
 It is pointed out, however, that due to a strong sensitivity of the results to
the value of the cut-off, such an approach should be viewed as a rather
phenomenological way to fit the experimental data since there is no small
expansion parameter allowing for truncation of the chiral expansion of the
effective potential at some given order. A possible way to construct the
consistent chiral expansion is briefly discussed
