We present the results of 2.5 years AGILE observations of PSR B1509-58. The
modulation significance of the light-curve above 30 MeV is at a sigma
confidence level and the light-curve is similar to those found earlier up to 30
MeV by \comp: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching its maximum 0.39 +/- 0.02
cycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at 0.94 +/- 0.03. The gamma-ray
spectral energy distribution of pulsed flux is well described by a power-law
(photon index alpha=1.87 +/-0.09) with a remarkable cutoff at E_c=81+/- 20 MeV,
representing the softest spectrum observed among gamma-ray pulsars so far. The
unusual soft break in the spectrum of PSR B1509-58 has been interpreted in the
framework of polar cap models as a signature of the exotic photon splitting
process in the strong magnetic field of this pulsar. In the case of an
outer-gap scenario, or the two pole caustic model, better constraints on the
geometry of the emission would be needed from the radio band in order to
establish whether the conditions required by the models to reproduce AGILE
light-curves and spectra match the polarization measurements.
