In this paper we study the maximum value of the largest eigenvalue for simple
bipartite graphs, where the number of edges is given and the number of vertices
on each side of the bipartition is given. We state a conjectured solution,
which is an analog of the Brualdi- Hoffman conjecture for general graphs, and
prove the conjecture in some special cases.
