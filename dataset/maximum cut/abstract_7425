We point out that in their analysis of the deep Spitzer images, Cooray et al
(2006) perform Fourier transform on maps which have very few pixels left (only
20 to 30 percent). For such deeply cut maps one cannot reliably compute
large-scale map properties using Fourier transforms. Instead the maps must be
analyzed via the correlation function, C(\theta), which is immune to mask
effects. We find, when computing C(\theta) for their maps, that removing
ACS/HST galaxies does not lead to appreciable change in the correlation
properties of the remaining diffuse emission. We then demonstrate with
simulations that the power spectrum of CIB fluctuations prior to removal of the
ACS galaxies reproduces C(\theta) in the maps from which the ACS galaxies have
been removed. This implies that these galaxies cannot be responsible for the
CIB fluctuations detected in Kashlinsky et al (2005, 2007), contrary to the
claims of Cooray et al (2006).
