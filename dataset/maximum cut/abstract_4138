The process e+e- to gamma gamma (gamma) is studied using data recorded with
the OPAL detector at LEP. The data sample corresponds to a total integrated
luminosity of 56.2 pb-1 taken at a centre-of-mass energy of 183 GeV. The
measured cross-section agrees well with the expectation from QED. A fit to the
angular distribution is used to obtain improved limits at 95% CL on the QED
cut-off parameters: Lambda+ > 233 GeV and Lambda- > 265 GeV as well as a mass
limit for an excited electron, M(e*) > 227 GeV assuming equal e*egamma and
eegamma couplings. No evidence for resonance production is found in the
invariant mass spectrum of photon pairs. Limits are obtained for the
cross-section times branching ratio for a resonance decaying into two photons.
