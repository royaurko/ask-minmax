The ages of 203 open clusters from the list of Dambis (1999) are computed in
terms of the evolutionary tracks of Pols et al. (1998) with and without the
allowance for convective overshooting. The vertical scaleheight of the cluster
layer at Galactocentric distances R_0-1 kpc < R_g< R_0+ 1 kpc varies
nonmonotonically with age, exhibiting a wavelike pattern similar to the one
earlier found for the Cepheid population (Joeveer 1974), with a period of P_Z =
74 +/- 2 Myr and P_Z = 92 +/- 2 Myr if cluster ages are computed in terms of
evolutionary models without and with overshooting, respectively. The period of
vertical oscillations can be reconciled with the known local mass density only
if cluster ages are computed with no or just mild overshooting: the
overshooting-based ages imply a local mass density of rho = 0.075 +/- 0.003
M_Sun/pc^3, which is incompatibe with the recent Hipparcos-based estimate of
rho = 0.102 M_Sun/pc^3 (Holmberg and Flynn 2000). Our results imply a maximum
local dark-mass density of rho_DM <= 0.027 M_Sun/pc^3. At the time of their
formation open clusters have, on the average, excess vertical kinetic energy
and as a population are not in virial equilibrium; moreover, their initial
vertical coordinates (at the time of birth) are strongly and positively
correlated with initial vertical velocities (r = 0.81 +/-0.08), thus favoring a
scenario where star formation in the disk is triggered by some massive objects
falling onto the Galactic plane.
