We analyze \emph{RXTE} and \emph{Swift} observations of SWIFT J1729.9$-$3437
after its outburst from 2010 July 20 to 2010 August 12. We calculate a spin
frequency and spin frequency derivative of $1.8734(8) \times 10^{-3}$ Hz and
$6.42(6) \times 10^{-12}$ Hz/s respectively from the quadratic fit of pulse
arrival times. The quadratic fit residuals fit well to a circular orbital model
with a period of $15.3(2)$ days and a mass function of about $1.3M_{\odot}$,
but they can also be explained by a torque noise strength of $6.8 \times
10^{-18}$ Hz sec$^{-2}$. Pulse profiles switches from double-peaked to
single-peaked as the source flux continues to decrease. We find that the pulse
shape generally shows no strong energy dependence. The hardness ratios reveal
that the source becomes softer with decreasing flux. We construct a single
spectrum from all the available RXTE and Swift observations. We find that
adding an \emph{Fe} line complex feature around 6.51 keV slightly improves the
spectral fit and that this feature is more likely to originate from the source
rather than the Galactic ridge. From the pulse phase spectral analysis, it is
shown that that photon index and folding energy of the high energy cut-off vary
with varying pulse phase.
