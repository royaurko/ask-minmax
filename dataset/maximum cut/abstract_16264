We are undertaking a large scale radial velocity survey of the Galactic bulge
which uses M giant stars selected from the 2MASS catalog as targets for the
CTIO 4m Hydra multi-object spectrograph. The aim of this survey is to test
dynamical models of the bulge and to quantify the importance, if any, of cold
stellar streams in the bulge and its vicinity. Here we report on the kinematics
of a strip of fields at -10 < l <+10 degres and b=-4 degres. We construct a
longitude-velocity plot for the bulge stars and the model data, and find that
contrary to previous studies, the bulge does not rotate as a solid body. From
-5<l<+5 degrees the rotation curve has a slope of roughly 100 km/s/kpc and
flattens considerably at greater l and reaches a maximum rotation of 45 km/s.
We compare our rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile to both the
self-consistent model of Zhao (1996) and to N-body models; neither fits both
our observed rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile. The high precision
of our radial velocities (3 km/s) yields an unexpected result: hints of cold
kinematic features are seen in a number of the line of sight velocity
distributions.
