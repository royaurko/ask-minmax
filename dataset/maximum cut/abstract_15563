We have investigated the valley degeneracy of MoS2 multilayers and its effect
on thermoelectric properties. By modulating the layer thickness and external
electric field, the hole valleys at {\Gamma} and K points in the highest energy
valence band and the electron valleys at K and {\Sigma}min points in the lowest
energy conduction band are shifted differently. The hole valley degeneracy is
observed in MoS2 monolayer, while that of electron valley is in MoS2 bilayer
and monolayer under the external electric field. By tuning the valley
degeneracy, the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity can be
separately controlled, and the maximum power factor can be obtained in n-type
(p-type) MoS2 monolayer with (without) the external electric field. We suggest
that the transition metal dichalcogenides are good example to investigate the
role of valley degeneracy in the thermoelectric and optical properties with the
control of interlayer interaction and external electric field strength.
