Asymmetric jet transverse energy cuts are now commonly used for dijet
analyses currently performed in the Breit Frame at ZEUS. I will discuss the
motivation for these cuts and present the results of studies identifying
unphysical behavior in the theroretically calculated dijet cross section when
purely symmetric cuts are used.
