Over the last decades the knowledge on the small scales of turbulent wall
flows has experienced a significant advance, especially in the near-wall region
where the highest production of turbulent energy and the maximum turbulence
intensity occur. The development of computers has played an important role in
this progress, making direct numerical simulations affordable (Kim, Moin &
Moser, 1987), and offering wider observational possibilities than most
laboratory experiments. The large scales have received less attention, and it
has not been until recently that their significance and their real size have
been widely recognized, thanks in part to the experiments by Hites (1997) and
Kim & Adrian (1999), and to the compilation of experimental and numerical data
by Jimenez (1998). The requirements of both a very large box and a high
Reynolds number has made direct numerical simulation of the VLAS unapproachable
until today. The purpose of this report is to serve as a preliminary
description of a newly compiled numerical database of the characteristics of
the large scales in turbulent channel flow at moderate Reynolds numbers.
