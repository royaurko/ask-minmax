Volume and column density PDFs in molecular clouds are important diagnostics
for understanding their general structure. We developed a novel approach to
trace the cloud structure by varying the lower PDF cut-off and exploring a
suggested mass-density relationship with a power-law index $x^\prime$. The
correspondence of x' as a function of spatial scale to the slope of the
high-density PDF tail is studied. To validate the proposed model, we use
results from hydrodynamical simulations of a turbulent self-gravitating cloud
and recent data on dust continuum emission from the Planck mission.
