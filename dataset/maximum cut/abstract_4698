We investigate the associated production of charged Higgs bosons (H^\pm) and
W bosons at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, using the leptonic decay H^+ ->
tau^+ nu_tau and hadronic W decay, within different scenarios of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with both real and complex parameters.
Performing a parton level study we show how the irreducible Standard Model
background from W + 2 jets can be controlled by applying appropriate cuts. In
the standard m_h^max scenario we find a viable signal for large tan beta and
intermediate H^\pm masses (~ m_t). In MSSM scenarios with large mass-splittings
among the heavy Higgs bosons the cross-section can be resonantly enhanced by
factors up to one hundred, with a strong dependence on the CP-violating phases.
