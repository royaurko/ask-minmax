We present observations and analysis of the 2009 outburst of the unusual
dwarf nova V630 Cas which is only the third recorded outburst of this star. The
outburst lasted about 104 days, with the rise to maximum being slightly slower
than the decline, which we interpret as an inside-out outburst. At is brightest
it had V = 14.0, 2.3 magnitudes above the mean quiescence magnitude. The
characteristics of the outburst are similar to several other long orbital
period dwarf novae.
