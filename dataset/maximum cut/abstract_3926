We present an analysis of the optical data of the Hubble Deep Field South. We
derive F300W(AB), F450W(AB), F606W(AB) and F814W(AB) number counts for galaxies
in all four bands. The slope is steeper at shortest wavelengths: we estimated
gamma(F300W(AB))=0.47, gamma(F450W(AB))=0.35, gamma(F606W(AB))=0.28 and
gamma(F814W(AB))=0.28. Morphological number counts are actually dominated by
late type galaxies, while early type galaxies show a decreasing slope at faint
magnitudes. Combining this information with photometric redshifts, we notice
that galaxies contributing with a steep slope to morphological number counts
(i.e. spiral and irregular galaxies) have z>1, suggesting a moderate merging.
However we emphasize that any cut in apparent magnitude at optical wavelengths
results in samples biased against elliptical galaxies, affecting as a
consequence the redshift distributions and the implications on the evolution of
galaxies along the Hubble sequence.
