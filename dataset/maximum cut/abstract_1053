Two processes of matter creation after inflation: 1) gravitational creation
of superheavy (quasi)stable particles, and 2) non-thermal phase transitions
leading to formation of topological defects, may be relevant to the resolution
of the puzzle of cosmic rays observed with energies beyond GZK cut-off. Both
possibilities are reviewed in this talk.
