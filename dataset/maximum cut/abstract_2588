The actions of cut applied to the elastic system generate relative tool/part
displacements, which induce a temperature increasing in the components of the
machine tools, its environment, the system-tools-part and generate vibrations.
The experimental procedures used, at the dynamic level, made it possible to
determine the elements necessary to analyze the influence of the tool geometry,
its displacement and evolution of the contacts tool/part and tool/chip on
surface carried out
