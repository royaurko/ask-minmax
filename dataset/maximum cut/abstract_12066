The nature of multiple electronic orders in skutterudite PrFe_4P_{12} is
discussed on the basis of a model with antiferro-quadrupole (AFQ) interaction
of \Gamma_3 symmetry. The high-field phase can be reproduced qualitatively
provided (i) ferro-type interactions are introduced between the dipoles as well
as between the octupoles of localized f-electrons, and (ii) separation is
vanishingly small between the \Gamma_1-\Gamma_4^{(1)} crystalline electric
field (CEF) levels. The high-field phase can have either the same ordering
vector q=(1,0,0) as in the low-field phase, or a different one q=0 depending on
the parameters. In the latter case, distortion of the crystal perpendicular to
the (111) axis is predicted. The corresponding anomaly in elastic constants
should also appear. The electrical resistivity is calculated with account of
scattering within the CEF quasi-quartet. It is found that the resistivity as a
function of the direction of magnetic field shows a sharp maximum around the
(111) axis at low temperatures because of the level crossing.
