The geometric phase (GP) for bipartite systems in transverse external
magnetic fields is investigated in this paper. Two different situations have
been studied. We first consider two non-interacting particles. The results show
that because of entanglement, the geometric phase is very different from that
of the non-entangled case. When the initial state is a Werner state, the
geometric phase is, in general, zero and moreover the singularity of the
geometric phase may appear with a proper evolution time. We next study the
geometric phase when intra-couplings appear and choose Werner states as the
initial states to entail this discussion. The results show that unlike our
first case, the absolute value of the GP is not zero, and attains its maximum
when the rescaled coupling constant $J$ is less than 1. The effect of
inhomogeneity of the magnetic field is also discussed.
