We present 3-D modelling of the distribution and kinematics of the neutral
hydrogen in the spiral galaxy ESO 123-G23. The optical appearance of this
galaxy is an almost perfectly edge-on disk, while the neutral hydrogen is found
to extend vertically out to about 15 kpc on either side of the galactic plane.
The HI layer and the major features of the HI data cube can be successfully
explained by a model dominated by a strong (about 30 degrees) line-of-sight
warp. Other models were tried, including a flare model and a two-component
model, but they clearly do not reproduce the data. This is the first
unambiguous detection of a galactic warp that has the maximum deviation from
the central plane almost along the line-of-sight. No evidence for the presence
of any companion galaxy is found in the HI data cube. Line-of-sight warps in
edge-on galaxies are probably frequent, but escape detection as they are too
weak. Moreover they may easily be mistaken as flares or 'thick disks'. A 3-D
modelling of the HI layer as the one presented here is needed in order to
distinguish between these possibilities.
