The standard model taken with a momentum space cut-off may be viewed as an
effective low energy theory. The structure of it and its known parameters can
give us hints for relations between these parameters. In the present
investigation the Higgs problem will be discussed, the possible connection of
the Higgs meson with the heavy top quark, and the geometric structure of the
quark and lepton mass matrices.
