The binary Mumford-Shah model is a widespread tool for image segmentation and
can be considered as a basic model in shape optimization with a broad range of
applications in computer vision, ranging from basic segmentation and labeling
to object reconstruction. This paper presents robust a posteriori error
estimates for a natural error quantity, namely the area of the non properly
segmented region. To this end, a suitable strictly convex and non-constrained
relaxation of the originally non-convex functional is investigated and Repin's
functional approach for a posteriori error estimation is used to control the
numerical error for the relaxed problem in the $L^2$-norm. In combination with
a suitable cut out argument, a fully practical estimate for the area mismatch
is derived. This estimate is incorporated in an adaptive meshing strategy. Two
different adaptive primal-dual finite element schemes, and the most frequently
used finite difference discretization are investigated and compared. Numerical
experiments show qualitative and quantitative properties of the estimates and
demonstrate their usefulness in practical applications.
