We have obtained interferometer observations of the central region of the Sb
galaxy NGC 4527 in the 12CO (J=1-0) line emission using the Nobeyama Millimeter
Array. We also obtained optical (Halpha, [NII]) spectroscopy using the Okayama
188-cm reflector along the major axis. The kinematical structure and the
distribution of HII regions show symmetry around the nucleus, while the
distribution of molecular gas is asymmetric. The molecular-gas mass shares only
10% of the dynamical mass in the central 1 kpc radius region. Using
position-velocity diagrams, we have derived a center-to-disk rotation curve. It
rises steeply in the central region, attaining a maximum of about 250 km/s at
400 pc radius, and then decreases to a minimum at 2 kpc radius, followed by a
disk and outer flat part. The rotation curve may provide us with the most
similar case to that of the Milky Way Galaxy.
