The Blow-up Lemma established by Koml\'os, S\'ark\"ozy, and Szemer\'edi in
1997 is an important tool for the embedding of spanning subgraphs of bounded
maximum degree. Here we prove several generalisations of this result concerning
the embedding of a-arrangeable graphs, where a graph is called a-arrangeable if
its vertices can be ordered in such a way that the neighbours to the right of
any vertex v have at most a neighbours to the left of v in total. Examples of
arrangeable graphs include planar graphs and, more generally, graphs without a
K_s-subdivision for constant s. Our main result shows that a-arrangeable graphs
with maximum degree at most sqrt(n)/log(n) can be embedded into corresponding
systems of super-regular pairs. This is optimal up to the logarithmic factor.
  We also present two applications. We prove that any large enough graph G with
minimum degree at least ((r-1)/r+\gamma)n contains an F-factor of every
a-arrangeable r-chromatic graph F with at most \xi n vertices and maximum
degree at most sqrt(n)/log(n), as long as \xi\ is sufficiently small compared
to \gamma/(ar). This extends a result of Alon and Yuster [J. Combin. Theory
Ser. B 66(2),269-282, 1996]. Moreover, we show that for constant p the random
graph G(n,p) is universal for the class of a-arrangeable n-vertex graphs H of
maximum degree at most \xi n/log(n), as long as \xi\ is sufficiently small
compared to p/a.
