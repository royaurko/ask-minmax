Non-equilibrium effects are studied using a full Lorentz-invariant formalism.
Our analysis shows that in reactions considered here, no global or local
equilibrium is reached. The heavier masses are found to be equilibrated more
than the lighter systems. The local temperature is extracted using hot Thomas
Fermi formalism generalized for the case of two interpenetrating pieces of
nuclear matter. The temperature is found to vary linearly with bombarding
energy and impact parameter whereas it is nearly independent of the mass of the
colliding nuclei. This indicates that the study of temperature with medium size
nuclei is also reliable. The maximum temperatures obtained in our approach are
in a nice agreement with earlier calculations of other approaches. A simple
parametrization of maximal temperature as a function of the bombarding energy
is also given.
