Recent progress in the determination of both masses and radii of neutron
stars are starting to place stringent constraints on the dense matter equation
of state. In particular, new theoretical developments together with improved
statistical tools seem to favor stellar radii that are significantly smaller
than those predicted by models using purely nucleonic equations of state. Given
that the underlying equation of state must also account for the observation of
$2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars, theoretical approaches to the study of the dense
matter equation of state are facing serious challenges. In response to this
challenge, we compute in a model-independent way the underlying equation of
state associated with an assumed mass-radius template similar to the "common
radius" assumption used in recent studies. Once such a mass-radius template is
adopted, the equation of state follows directly from the implementation of
Lindblom's algorithm; assumptions on the nature or composition of the dense
stellar core are not required. By analyzing mass-radius profiles with a maximum
mass consistent with observation and common radii in the 8 to 11 km range, a
lower limit on the stellar radius of a $1.4M_{\odot}$ neutron star of $R_{\rm
NS}\!\gtrsim\!10.7$ km is obtained in order to prevent the equation of state
from violating causality.
