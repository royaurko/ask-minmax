In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for piecewise linear regression
which can learn continuous as well as discontinuous piecewise linear functions.
The main idea is to repeatedly partition the data and learn a liner model in in
each partition. While a simple algorithm incorporating this idea does not work
well, an interesting modification results in a good algorithm. The proposed
algorithm is similar in spirit to $k$-means clustering algorithm. We show that
our algorithm can also be viewed as an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood
estimation of parameters under a reasonable probability model. We empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance with
the state of art regression learning algorithms on some real world datasets.
