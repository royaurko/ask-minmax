Samples of amorphous MgSiO_3 annealed at temperature steps leading up to
their crystallisation temperature show a rise in photoluminescence activity,
peaking at ~450C. The photoluminescence band has a main peak at 595nm and a
weaker peak at 624nm. We present laboratory data to show that the maximum in
photoluminescence activity is related to substantial structural reordering that
occurs within a relatively narrow temperature range. We attribute the origin of
the photoluminescence to non-bridging oxygen hole centre defects, which form
around ordered nano-sized domain structures as a result of the breakup of
tetrahedral connectivity in the disordered inter-domain network, aided by the
loss of bonded OH. These defects are removed as crystallisation progresses,
resulting in the decrease and eventual loss of photoluminescence. Thermally
processed hydrogenated amorphous silicate grains could therefore represent a
potential carrier of extended red emission.
