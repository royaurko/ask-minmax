We review recent analytic and numerical results concerning the confinement
scenario in Coulomb gauge. We then consider a local, renormalizable,
BRST-invariant action for QCD in Coulomb gauge that contains auxiliary bose and
fermi ghost fields and sources. When the auxiliary fields are integrated out,
one obtains the standard Coulomb gauge action with a cut-off at the Gribov
horizon. We use the local formulation to calculate the leading correction to
the Stefan-Boltzmann equation of state at high temperature due to the cut-off
at the Gribov horizon. It is of order $g^6$, which is precisely the order at
which the infrared divergence found by Lind\'{e} divergence first occurs. No
such divergence arises in the present calculation because the propagator of
would-be physical gluons is suppressed in the infrared due to the proximity of
the Gribov horizon in infrared directions.
