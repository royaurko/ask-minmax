We present the results of a programme of scanning and mapping observations of
astronomical masers and Jupiter designed to characterise the performance of the
Mopra Radio Telescope at frequencies between 16-50 GHz using the 12-mm and 7-mm
receivers. We use these observations to determine the telescope beam size, beam
shape and overall telescope beam efficiency as a function of frequency. We find
that the beam size is well fit by $\lambda$/$D$ over the frequency range with a
correlation coefficient of ~90%. We determine the telescope main beam
efficiencies are between ~48-64% for the 12-mm receiver and reasonably flat at
~50% for the 7-mm receiver. Beam maps of strong H$_2$O (22 GHz) and SiO masers
(43 GHz) provide a means to examine the radial beam pattern of the telescope.
At both frequencies the radial beam pattern reveals the presence of three
components, a central `core', which is well fit by a Gaussian and constitutes
the telescopes main beam, and inner and outer error beams. At both frequencies
the inner and outer error beams extend out to approximately 2 and 3.4 times the
full-width half maximum of the main beam respectively. Sources with angular
sizes a factor of two or more larger than the telescope main beam will couple
to the main and error beams, and therefore the power contributed by the error
beams needs to be considered. From measurements of the radial beam power
pattern we estimate the amount of power contained in the inner and outer error
beams is of order one-fifth at 22 GHz rising slightly to one-third at 43 GHz.
