In this work, we consider efficient maximum-likelihood decoding of linear
block codes for small-to-moderate block lengths. The presented approach is a
branch-and-bound algorithm using the cutting-plane approach of Zhang and Siegel
(IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2012) for obtaining lower bounds. We have compared
our proposed algorithm to the state-of-the-art commercial integer program
solver CPLEX, and for all considered codes our approach is faster for both low
and high signal-to-noise ratios. For instance, for the benchmark (155,64)
Tanner code our algorithm is more than 11 times as fast as CPLEX for an SNR of
1.0 dB on the additive white Gaussian noise channel. By a small modification,
our algorithm can be used to calculate the minimum distance, which we have
again verified to be much faster than using the CPLEX solver.
