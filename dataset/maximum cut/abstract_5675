We present a semiclassical derivation of the tree-level and 1-loop dressing
phases in the massive sector of string theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 supplemented
by R-R and NS-NS 3-form fluxes. In analogy with the AdS_5 x S^5 case, we use
the dressing method to obtain scattering solutions for dyonic giant magnons
which allows us to determine the semiclassical bound-state S-matrix and its
1-loop correction. We also find that the 1-loop correction to the dyonic giant
magnon energy vanishes. Looking at the relation between the bound-state picture
and elementary magnons in terms of the fusion procedure we deduce the
elementary dressing phases. In both the semiclassical and 1-loop cases we find
agreement with recent proposals from finite-gap equations and unitarity cut
methods. Further, we find consistency with the finite-gap picture by
determining the resolvent for the dyonic giant magnon from the semiclassical
bosonic scattering data.
