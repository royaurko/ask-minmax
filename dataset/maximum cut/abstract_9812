If the three types of active neutrinos possess different maximum attainable
velocities and the neutrino eigenstates in the velocity basis are different
from those in the flavour (and mass) basis then this will induce a flavour
oscillation in addition to the normal mass flavour oscillation. Here we study
such an oscillation scenario in three neutrino framework including also the
matter effect and apply our results to demonstrate its consequences for long
baseline neutrinos. We also predict the possible signatures in terms of yields
in a possible long baseline neutrino experiment.
