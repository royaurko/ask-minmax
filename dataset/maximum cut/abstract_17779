The results presented are a continuation of observing campaigns conducted by
a small group of amateur astronomers interested in the Blazhko effect of RR
Lyrae stars. The goal of these observations is to confirm the RR Lyrae Blazhko
effect and to detect any additional Blazhko modulation which cannot be
identified from all sky survey data-mining. The Blazhko effect of the two
observed stars is confirmed, but no additional Blazhko modulations have been
detected.
  The observation of the RR Lyrae star AL Pic during 169 nights was conducted
from San Pedro de Atacama (Chile). From the observed light curve, 49 pulsation
maxima have been measured. Fourier analyses of (O-C), magnitude at maximum
light (Mmax) and the complete light curve have provided a confirmation of
published pulsation and Blazhko periods, 0.548622 and 34.07 days, respectively.
The second multi-longitude observation campaign focused on the RR Lyrae star FR
Psc was performed from Europe, United States and Chile. Fourier analyses of the
light curve and of 59 measured brightness maxima have improved the accuracy of
pulsation and Blazhko periods which are 0.45568 and 51.31 days, respectively.
For both stars, no additional Blazhko modulations have been detected.
