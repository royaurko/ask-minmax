We present observations of 8 Galactic Bulge microlensing events taken with
the 1.0m JKT on La Palma during 2000 June and July. The JKT observing schedule
was optimized using a prioritizing algorithm to automatically update the target
list. For most of these events we have sampled the lightcurves at times where
no information was available from the OGLE alert team. We assume a point-source
point-lens (PSPL) model and perform a maximum likelihood fit to both our data
and the OGLE data to constrain the event parameters of the fit. We then refit
the data assuming a binary lens and proceed to calculate the probability of
detecting planets with mass ratio $q=10^{-3}$. We have seen no clear signatures
of planetary deviations on any of the 8 events and we quantify constraints on
the presence of planetary companions to the lensing stars. For two well
observed events, 2000BUL31 and 2000BUL33, our detection probabilities peak at
$\sim$30% and $\sim$20% respectively for $q=10^{-3}$ and $a \sim R_{E}$ for a
$\Delta\chi^2$ threshold value of 60.
