We study the asymptotic behaviour of the maximum local time L*(t) of the
Brox's process, the diffusion in Brownian environment. Shi proved that the
maximum speed of L*(t) is surprisingly, at least t log(log(log t)) whereas in
the discrete case it is t. We show here that t log(log(log t)) is the proper
rate and we prove that for the minimum speed the rate is the same as in the
discrete case namely t/log(log(log t)).
