Spinelectronics is becoming an increasingly important future technology for
the realization of nonvolatile, fast, low-power computer memory and is already
well-established in hard disk drive read heads and magnetic sensors. The often
required magnetic films that do not respond to external magnetic field, the
so-called fixed layers, are achieved by pinning them to an antiferromagnet via
the exchange bias effect, which causes a shift of the magnetic loop. In the
present letter we report on the new polycrystalline exchange bias system
MnN/CoFe, which shows exchange bias of up to 1480 Oe at room temperature. The
corresponding interfacial exchange energy is $J_S =
0.38\,\mathrm{erg}/\mathrm{cm}^2$ and the maximum blocking temperature at which
the exchange bias vanishes is about 300{\deg}C. Thus, the bilayers show
exchange bias properties that partly excel those of standard PtMn/CoFe,
IrMn/CoFe, or NiMn/NiFe bilayers, however without the need for noble metals or
other critical materials.
