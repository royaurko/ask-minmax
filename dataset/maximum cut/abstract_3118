We investigate the equations of state for pure neutron matter and strange
hadronic matter in $\beta$-equilibrium, including $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$
hyperons. The masses and radii of pure neutron stars and strange hadronic stars
are obtained. For a pure neutron star, the maximum mass is about $1.8
M_{\mathrm{sun}}$, while for a strange hadronic star, the maximum mass is
around $1.45 M_{\mathrm{sun}}$. The typical radii of pure neutron stars and
strange hadronic stars are about 11.0-12.3 km and 10.7-11.7 km, respectively.
