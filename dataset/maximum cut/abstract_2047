The spatial distribution of unvisited/persistent sites in $d=1$
$A+A\to\emptyset$ model is studied numerically. Over length scales smaller than
a cut-off $\xi(t)\sim t^{z}$, the set of unvisited sites is found to be a
fractal. The fractal dimension $d_{f}$, dynamical exponent $z$ and persistence
exponent $\theta$ are related through $z(1-d_{f})=\theta$. The observed values
of $d_{f}$ and $z$ are found to be sensitive to the initial density of
particles. We argue that this may be due to the existence of two competing
length scales, and discuss the possibility of a crossover at late times.
