Recent measurements of stellar orbits provide compelling evidence that the
compact radio source Sagittarius A* at the Galactic Centre is a
3.6-million-solar-mass black hole. Sgr A* is remarkably faint in all wavebands
other than the radio region, however, which challenges current theories of
matter accretion and radiation surrounding black holes. The black hole's
rotation rate is not known, and therefore neither is the structure of
space-time around it.Here we report high-resolution infrared observations of
Sgr A* that reveal 'quiescent' emission and several flares. The infrared
emission originates from within a few milliarcseconds of the black hole, and
traces very energetic electrons or moderately hot gas within the innermost
accretion region. Two flares exhibit a 17-minute quasi-periodic variability. If
the periodicity arises from relativistic modulation of orbiting gas, the
emission must come from just outside the event horizon, and the black hole must
be rotating at about half of the maximum possible rate.
