Tsallis entropy and a maximum entropy principle allows to reproduce
experimental data of DNA double strand breaking by electron and neutron
radiation. Analytic results for the probability of finding a DNA segment of
length l are obtained reproducing quite well the fragment distribution function
experimentally obtained.
