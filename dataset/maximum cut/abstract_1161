In this paper we extend first the Bismut-Lott's analytic torsion form for
flat vector bundles to the boundary case, then we establish its gluing formula
on a smooth fibration under the assumption that a fiberwise Morse function
exists. We assume that the metrics have product structures near the cutting
hypersurface.
