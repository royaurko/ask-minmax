UBVRIJ photometry and optical spectra of the Type Ia SN 1996X obtained at ESO
during a one-year-long observational campaign are presented, and supplemented
by late time HST photometry. Spectroscopically, SN 1996X appears to be a
`normal' SN Ia. The apparent magnitude at maximum was B=13.24 +/- 0.02, and the
colour B-V=0.00 +/- 0.03. The luminosity decline rate, Delta m_B(15) = 1.31 +/-
0.08, is close to average for a SN Ia. The best estimate of the galactic
extinction is A_B=0.30 +/- 0.05, and there is evidence that reddening within
the parent galaxy is negligible. Detailed comparison of the light and colour
curves of various `normal' SNe Ia shows that the assumption that multicolour
light curves can be described simply as a one-parameter family is not perfect.
Together with problems in the calibration of the templates, this may explain
the discrepancies in the distance modulus derived adopting different
calibrations of the absolute magnitude vs. light curve shape relations. Indeed
we found that M_B ranges from -19.08 to -19.48 and M-m range from 32.02 to
32.48 depending on the method used (Hamuy et al. 1996a,Phillips et al. 1999,
Riess et al. 1998a). Computations of model light curve and synthetic spectra
for both early- and late-times, confirm that 1996X is a normal Type Ia SN and
that a satisfactory fit can be obtained using a W7 progenitor structure only if
we adopt the short distance. A larger distance would imply a too large Ni mass
for this fainter than average SNIa.
