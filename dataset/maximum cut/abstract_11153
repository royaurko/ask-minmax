We examine the nature of galaxy clustering in redshift space using a method
based on an expansion of the galaxian density field in Spherical Harmonics and
linear theory. We derive a compact and self-consistent expression for the
distortion when applied to flux limited redshift surveys. The amplitude of the
distortion is controlled by the combination of the density and bias parameters,
$\beta\equiv\Omega_\circ^{0.6}/b$ as well as the shape of the real space power
spectrum, $P(k)$ (characterized by a shape parameter $\Gamma$), and its
normalization, $\sigma_8$; we exploit this fact to derive a maximum likelihood
estimator for $\beta$, $\Gamma$, and $\sigma_8$. We check our formalism using
$N$-body simulations and demonstrate it provides an unbiased estimate of
$\beta$ when the amplitude and shape of the galaxy power spectrum is known.
Application of the technique to the 1.2 Jy \iras\ redshift survey yields $\beta
=0.94\pm 0.17$ and $\Gamma=0.17\pm0.05$ (1-$\sigma$) when $\sigma_8$ is held
fixed at its best value as determined from the real space correlation function.
Allowing $\sigma_8$ to be a free parameter, we find $\beta=0.47\pm 0.25$,
$\Gamma=0.15\pm0.05$, and $\sigma_8=0.81\pm0.06$.
