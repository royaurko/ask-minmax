This paper studies the large fluctuations of solutions of finite--dimensional
affine stochastic neutral functional differential equations with finite memory,
as well as related nonlinear equations. We find conditions under which the
exact almost sure growth rate of the running maximum of each component of the
system can be determined, both for affine and nonlinear equations. The proofs
exploit the fact that an exponentially decaying fundamental solution of the
underlying deterministic equation is sufficient to ensure that the solution of
the affine equation converges to a stationary Gaussian process.
