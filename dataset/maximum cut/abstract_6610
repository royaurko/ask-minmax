Dynamic micromagnetic simulation studies have been completed to observe the
motion of a domain wall in a magnetic nanowire in an effort to increase the
field-driven domain wall speed. Previous studies have shown that the wire
dimensions place a cap on the maximum speed attainable by a domain wall when
driven by a magnetic field placed along the direction of the nanowire. Here we
present data showing a significant increase in the maximum speed of a domain
wall due to the addition of a magnetic field placed perpendicular to the
longitudinal driving field. The results are expressed in terms of the relative
alignment of the transverse field direction with respect to the direction of
the magnetic moments within the domain wall. In particular, when the transverse
field is parallel to the magnetic moments within the domain wall, the velocity
of the wall varies linearly with the strength of the transverse field
increasing by up to 20%. Further examination of the domain wall structure shows
that the length of the domain wall also depends linearly on the strength of the
transverse field. We present a simple model to correlate the effects.
