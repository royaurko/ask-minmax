Using the data taken at the Pierre Auger Observatory between December 2004
and December 2012, we have examined the implications of the distributions of
depths of atmospheric shower maximum (Xmax), using a hybrid technique, for
composition and hadronic interaction models. We do this by fitting the
distributions with predictions from a variety of hadronic interaction models
for variations in the composition of the primary cosmic rays and examining the
quality of the fit. Regardless of what interaction model is assumed, we find
that our data are not well described by a mix of protons and iron nuclei over
most of the energy range. Acceptable fits can be obtained when intermediate
masses are included, and when this is done consistent results for the proton
and iron-nuclei contributions can be found using the available models. We
observe a strong energy dependence of the resulting proton fractions, and find
no support from any of the models for a significant contribution from iron
nuclei. However, we also observe a significant disagreement between the models
with respect to the relative contributions of the intermediate components.
