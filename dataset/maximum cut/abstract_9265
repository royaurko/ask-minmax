We study the thermal part of the energy density spatial correlator in the
quark-gluon plasma. We describe its qualitative form at high temperatures. We
then calculate it out to distances approx. 1.5/T in SU(3) gauge theory lattice
simulations for the range of temperatures 0.9<= T/T_c<= 2.2. The
vacuum-subtracted correlator exhibits non-monotonic behavior, and is almost
conformal by 2T_c. Its broad maximum at r approx. 0.6/T suggests a dense medium
with only weak short-range order, similar to a non-relativistic fluid near the
liquid-gas phase transition, where eta/s is minimal.
