Iron sesquilayers grown at room temperature on W(110) exhibit a pronounced
coercivity maximum near a coverage of 1.5 atomic monolayers. On lattices which
faithfully reproduce the morphology of the real films, a kinetic Ising model is
utilized to simulate the domain-wall motion. Simulations reveal that the
dynamics is dominated by the second-layer islands, which act as pinning
centers. The simulated dependencies of the coercivity on the film coverage, as
well as on the temperature and the frequency of the applied field, are very
similar to those measured in experiments. Unlike previous micromagnetic models,
the presented approach provides insight into the dynamics of the domain-wall
motion and clearly reveals the role of thermal fluctuations.
