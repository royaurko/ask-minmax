Using molecular dynamics computer simulations we investigate the dynamics of
supercooled silica in the frequency range 0.5-20~THz and the wave-vector range
0.13-1.1\AA^{-1}. We find that for small wave-vectors the dispersion relations
are in very good agreement with the ones found in experiments and that the
frequency at which the boson-peak is observed shows a maximum at around
0.39\AA^{-1}.
