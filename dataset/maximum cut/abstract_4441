Spectra of a string in $ SL(2,R) $ and three dimensional (BTZ) black hole
geometry are discussed. We consider a free field realization of ^sl (2,R)
different from the standard ones in treatment of zero-modes. Applying this to
the string model in SL(2,R), we show that the spectrum is ghost-free. The
essence of the argument is the same as Bars' resolution to the ghost problem,
but there are differences; for example, the currents do not contain logarithmic
cuts. Moreover, we obtain a modular invariant partition function. This
realization is also applicable to the analysis of the string in the three
dimensional black hole geometry, the model of which is described by an orbifold
of the SL(2,R) WZW model. We obtain ghost-free and modular invariant spectra
for the black hole theory as well. These spectra provide examples of few
sensible spectra of a string in non-trivial backgrounds with curved time and,
in particular, in a black hole background with an infinite number of
propagating modes.
