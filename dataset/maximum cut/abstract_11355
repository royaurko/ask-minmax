We argue that both the extreme soft X-ray excess and the large-amplitude
variability of Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) can be explained in the
framework of the slim disk model. When the disk luminosity approaches the
Eddington luminosity, the disk becomes a slim disk, exhibiting a multi-color
blackbody spectrum with a maximum temperature, T(bb), of about 0.2 (M/1e5 solar
masses)e(-1/4) keV, and size of the X-ray emitting region, r(bb), of about R(S)
(the Schwarzschild radius). Furthermore, magnetic energy can be amplified up to
a level exceeding radiation energy emitted from the disk, causing substantial
variability in X-rays by consecutive magnetic flares.
