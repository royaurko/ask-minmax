In this paper, we investigate the solutions of a generalized fractional
diffusion equation that extends some known diffusion equations by taking a
spatial time-dependent diffusion coefficient and $\mathcal{N}$-dimensional case
into account, which subjects to natural boundaries and the general initial
condition. In our analysis, the presence of external force is also taken into
account. We obtain explicit analytical expressions for the probability
distribution and study the relation between our solutions and those obtained
within the maximum entropy principle by using the Tsallis entropy.
