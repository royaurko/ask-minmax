Shepherd (1993) derived a general expression for the available potential
energy for compressible, hydrostatic flow, where the sum of this available
energy and the kinetic energy is called pseudo-energy. He demonstrated that for
a special basic state the small-amplitude limit of the generalized available
potential energy reduces to the well-known approximate form of Lorenz (1955)
expressed in a pressure vertical coordinate.
  Other forms of available energies exist in atmospheric energetics and in
thermodynamics, where the name exergy has been coined by Rant (1956) to denote
the maximum work that can be extracted from any system when it is subject to
some constraints (adiabatic transformations or constant total energy for
instance).
  The purpose of this note is to show that the specific available enthalpy
function denoted by $a_h = (h - h_r) - T_r \: (s - s_r)$ in Marquet (1991) can
be obtained from the generalized approach of Shepherd for another basic state.
This special form of pseudo-energy also leads to the global hydrostatic
concepts of Dutton (1973) and Pichler (1977). The function $a_h$ only depends
on the specific enthalpy $h$ and entropy $s$ at any point, the values $h_r$ and
$s_r$ refer to the special dead state at temperature $T_r$ and pressure $p_r$.
  It is explained that for another choice of the basic state, the generalized
expression of Shepherd reduces with a good accuracy to the approximate
functions introduced by Pearce (1978) or Blackburn (1983) in meteorology and
Thomson (1853, Lord Kelvin) in thermodynamics.
