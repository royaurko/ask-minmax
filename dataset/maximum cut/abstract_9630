The "edge polytope" of a finite graph G is the convex hull of the columns of
its vertex-edge incidence matrix. We study extremal problems for this class of
polytopes. For k =2, 3, 5 we determine the maximum number of vertices of
k-neighborly edge polytopes up to a sublinear term. We also construct a family
of edge polytopes with exponentially-many facets.
