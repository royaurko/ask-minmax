This paper investigates the benefits of Amplify-and-Forward (AF) relaying in
the setup of multi-antenna wireless networks. The concept of Random Sequential
(RS) relaying is previously introduced in the literature and showed that it
achieves the maximum diversity gain in a general multi-antenna network. Here,
we show that random unitary matrix multiplication at the relay nodes empowers
the RS scheme to achieve a better Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT) as
compared to the traditional AF relaying. First, we study the case of a
multi-antenna full-duplex single-relay two-hop network, for which we show that
the RS achieves the optimum DMT. Applying this result, we derive a new
achievable DMT for the case of multi-antenna half-duplex parallel relay
network. Interestingly, it turns out that the DMT of the RS scheme is optimum
for the case of multi-antenna two parallel non-interfering half-duplex relays.
Next, we show that random unitary matrix multiplication also improves the DMT
of the Non-Orthogonal AF relaying scheme in the case of a multi-antenna single
relay channel. Finally, we study the general case of multi-antenna full-duplex
relay networks and derive a new lower-bound on its DMT using the RS scheme.
