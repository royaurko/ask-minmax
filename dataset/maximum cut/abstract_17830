This paper introduces a statistical treatment to use Cepheid variable stars
as distance indicators. The expansion rate of the Universe is also studied here
through deriving the value of the Hubble constant H0. A Gaussian function
approximation is proposed to fit the absolute magnitude and period of Cepheid
variables in our galaxy. The calculations are carried out on samples of
Cepheids observed in 23 galaxies to derive the distance modulus (DM) of these
galaxies based on the frequency distributions of their periods and intrinsic
apparent magnitudes. The DM is the difference between the apparent magnitude
for extragalactic Cepheids and the absolute magnitude of the galactic Cepheids
at maximum number. It is calculated by using the comparison of the period
distribution of Cepheids in our galaxy and in other galaxies. This method is
preferred due to its simplicity to use and its efficiency in providing reliable
DM. A linear fit with correlation coefficient of 99.68% has been found between
the published distance modulus and that computed one in the present work. From
the present sample, a value of H0 in the range of 66 to 80 +/- 5 km/s Mpc is
determined. The present procedure of computation and its accuracy are confirmed
by the high correlation found between our computed DM and that published in the
literature.
