A new 3.2--3.5~$\mu$m spectrum of the protostar Mon~R2/IRS-3 confirms our
previous tentative detection of a new absorption feature near 3.25 $\mu$m. The
feature in our new spectrum has a central wavelength of 3.256 $\mu$m (3071
cm$^{-1}$) and has a full-width at half maximum of 0.079 $\mu$m (75 cm$^{-1}$).
We explore a possible identification with aromatic hydrocarbons at low
temperatures, which absorb at a similar wavelength. If the feature is due to
aromatics, the derived column density of C--H bonds is $\sim$1.8 $\times$
$10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. If the absorbing aromatic molecules are of roughly the
same size as those responsible for aromatic emission features in the
interstellar medium, then we estimate that $\sim$9\% of the cosmic abundance of
carbon along this line of sight would be in aromatic hydrocarbons, in agreement
with abundance estimates from emission features.
