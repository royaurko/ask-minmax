We present a series of two-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulations
for a range of progenitor masses and different input physics. These models
predict a range of supernova energies and compact remnant masses. In
particular, we study two mechanisms for black hole formation: prompt collapse
and delayed collapse due to fallback. For massive progenitors above 20 solar
masses, after a hydrodynamic time for the helium core (a few minutes to a few
hours), fallback drives the compact object beyond the maximum neutron star mass
causing it to collapse into a black hole. With the current accuracy of the
models, progenitors more massive than 40 solar masses form black holes directly
with no supernova explosion (if rotating, these black holes may be the
progenitors of gamma-ray bursts). We calculate the mass distribution of black
holes formed, and compare these predictions to the observations, which
represent a small biased subset of the black hole population. Uncertainties in
these estimates are discussed.
