We develop an information theoretic interpretation of the number-phase
complementarity in atomic systems, where phase is treated as a continuous
positive operator valued measure (POVM). The relevant uncertainty principle is
obtained as an upper bound on a sum of knowledge of these two observables for
the case of two-level systems. A tighter bound characterizing the uncertainty
relation is obtained numerically in terms of a weighted knowledge sum involving
these variables. We point out that complementarity in these systems departs
from mutual unbiasededness in two signalificant ways: first, the maximum
knowledge of a POVM variable is less than log(dimension) bits; second,
surprisingly, for higher dimensional systems, the unbiasedness may not be
mutual but unidirectional in that phase remains unbiased with respect to number
states, but not vice versa. Finally, we study the effect of non-dissipative and
dissipative noise on these complementary variables for a single-qubit system.
