The behaviour of two-loop two-point diagrams at non-zero thresholds
corresponding to two-particle cuts is analyzed. The masses involved in a cut
and the external momentum are assumed to be small as compared to some of the
other masses of the diagram. By employing general formulae of asymptotic
expansions of Feynman diagrams in momenta and masses, we construct an algorithm
to derive analytic approximations to the diagrams. In such a way, we calculate
several first coefficients of the expansion. Since no conditions on relative
values of the small masses and the external momentum are imposed, the threshold
irregularities are described analytically. Numerical examples, using diagrams
occurring in the Standard Model, illustrate the convergence of the expansion
below the first large threshold.
