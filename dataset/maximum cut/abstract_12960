The impact of in-plane alternating currents on the exchange bias, resistance,
and magnetoresistance of a CoFe/NiCoO/CoFe/Cu/CoFe spin-valve is studied. With
increasing current, the resistance is increased while the maximum
magnetoresistance ratio decreases. Noticeably, the reversal of the pinned layer
is systematically suppressed in both field sweeping directions. Since the NiCoO
oxide is a good insulator, it is expected that the ac current flows only in the
CoFe/Cu/CoFe top layers, thus ruling out any presence of spin-transfer torque
acting on the spins in the antiferromagnetic layer. Instead, our measurements
show clear evidences for the influence of Joule heating caused by the current.
Moreover, results from temperature-dependent measurements very much resemble
those of the current dependence, indicating that the effect of Joule heating
plays a major role in the current-in-plane spin-valve configurations. The
results also suggest that spin-transfer torques between ferromagnetic layers
might still exist and compete with the exchange bias at sufficiently high
currents.
