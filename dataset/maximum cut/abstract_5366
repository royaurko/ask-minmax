We study the dispersion relations of mesons and baryons built from Brillouin
quarks on one N_f=2 gauge ensemble provided by QCDSF. For quark masses up to
the physical strange quark mass, there is hardly any improvement over the
Wilson discretization, if either action is link-smeared and tree-level clover
improved. For quark masses in the range of the physical charm quark mass, the
Brillouin action still shows a perfect relativistic behavior, while the Wilson
action induces severe cut-off effects. As an application we determine the
masses of the \Omega_c^0, \Omega_{cc}^+ and \Omega_{ccc}^{++} baryons on that
ensemble.
