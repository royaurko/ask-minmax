We develop a new approach to the theoretical treatment of the separatrix
chaos, using a special analysis of the separatrix map. The approach allows us
to describe boundaries of the separatrix chaotic layer in the Poincar\'{e}
section and transport within the layer. We show that the maximum which the
width of the layer in energy takes as the perturbation frequency varies is much
larger than the perturbation amplitude, in contrast to predictions by earlier
theories suggesting that the maximum width is of the order of the amplitude.
The approach has also allowed us to develop the self-consistent theory of the
earlier discovered (PRL 90, 174101 (2003)) drastic facilitation of the onset of
global chaos between adjacent separatrices. Simulations agree with the theory.
