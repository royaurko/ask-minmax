We have considered an expansion of solutions of the non-linear equations for
both longitudinal and transverse waves in collisionless Maxwellian plasma in
series of non-damping overtones of the field E(x,t) and electron velocity
distribution function f=f(0) +f(1) where f(0) is background Maxwellian electron
distribution function and f(1) is perturbation. The electrical field and
perturbation f(1) are presented as a series of non-damping harmonics with
increasing frequencies of the order n and the same propagation speed. It is
shown presence of recurrent relations for arising overtones. Convergence of the
series is provided by a power law parameter series convergence. There are
proposed also successive procedures of cutting off the distribution function
f(1) to the condition of positivity f near the singularity points where kinetic
equation becomes inapplicable. In this case, at poles absence the solution
reduces to non-damping Vlasov waves (oscillations). In the case of transverse
waves, dispersion equation has two roots, corresponding to the branches of fast
electromagnetic and slow electron waves. There is noted a possibility of
experimental testing appearing exotic results with detecting frequencies and
amplitudes of n-order overtones.
