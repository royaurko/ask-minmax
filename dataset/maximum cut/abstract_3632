We study Markov chains for randomly sampling $k$-colorings of a graph with
maximum degree $\Delta$. Our main result is a polynomial upper bound on the
mixing time of the single-site update chain known as the Glauber dynamics for
planar graphs when $k=\Omega(\Delta/\log{\Delta})$. Our results can be
partially extended to the more general case where the maximum eigenvalue of the
adjacency matrix of the graph is at most $\Delta^{1-\eps}$, for fixed $\eps >
0$.
  The main challenge when $k \le \Delta + 1$ is the possibility of "frozen"
vertices, that is, vertices for which only one color is possible, conditioned
on the colors of its neighbors. Indeed, when $\Delta = O(1)$, even a typical
coloring can have a constant fraction of the vertices frozen. Our proofs rely
on recent advances in techniques for bounding mixing time using "local
uniformity" properties.
