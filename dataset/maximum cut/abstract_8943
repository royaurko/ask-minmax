Dissipation of magnetic fields in Hall plasma of neutron star crusts may
power persistent high energy emission of a class of strongly magnetized
neutrons stars, magnetars. We consider development of a dissipative tearing
mode in Hall plasma (electron MHD) and find that its growth rate increases with
the wave number of perturbations, reaching a maximum value intermediate between
resistive $\tau_r$ and Hall times $\tau_H$, $\Gamma\sim 1 / \sqrt{\tau_r
\tau_H}$.
  We argue that the tearing mode may be the principal mechanism by which strong
magnetic fields are dissipated in magnetars on times scale of $\sim 10^4-10^5$
yrs powering the persistent X-ray emisison.
