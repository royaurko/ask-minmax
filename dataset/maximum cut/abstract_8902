I give a first characterization of the class of generalized measurements that
can be exactly realized on a pair of qudits encoded in indistinguishable
particles, by using only linear elements and particle detectors. Two immediate
results follow from this characterization. (i) The Schmidt number of each POVM
element cannot exceed the number of initial particles. This rules out any
possibility of performing perfect Bell-measurements for qudits. (ii) The
maximum probability of performing a generalized incomplete Bell-measurement is
1/2.
