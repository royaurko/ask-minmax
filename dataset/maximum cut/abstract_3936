We report the detection at X-rays of the radio/optical jet of 3C 371, from a
short (10 ks) Chandra exposure in March 2000. We also present a new MERLIN
observation at 1.4 GHz together with a renalysis of the archival HST WFPC2
F555W image. Despite the limited signal-to-noise ratio of the Chandra data, the
X-ray morphology is clearly different from that of the radio/optical emission,
with the brightest X-ray knot at 1.7" from the nucleus and little X-ray
emission from the brightest radio/optical knot at 3.1". We construct the
spectral energy distributions for the two emission regions at 1.7" and 3.1".
Both show that the X-ray flux is below the extrapolation from the
radio-to-optical continuum, suggesting moderately beamed synchrotron from an
electron population with decreasing high energy cut-off as a plausible emission
mechanism.
