One of the major differences between various explosion scenarios of Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) is the remaining amount of unburned (C+O) material and its
velocity distribution within the expanding ejecta. While oxygen absorption
features are not uncommon in the spectra of SNe Ia before maximum light, the
presence of strong carbon absorption has been reported only in a minority of
objects, typically during the pre-maximum phase. The reported low frequency of
carbon detections may be due to low signal-to-noise data, low abundance of
unburned material, line blending between C II 6580 and Si II 6355, ejecta
temperature differences, asymmetrical distribution effects, or a combination of
these. However, a survey of published pre-maximum spectra reveals that more SNe
Ia than previously thought may exhibit C II 6580 absorption features and relics
of line blending near 6300 Angstroms. Here we present new SN Ia observations
where spectroscopic signatures of C II 6580 are detected, and investigate the
presence of C II 6580 in the optical spectra of 19 SNe Ia using the
parameterized spectrum synthesis code, SYNOW. Most of the objects in our sample
that exhibit C II 6580 absorption features are of the low-velocity gradient
subtype. Our study indicates that the morphology of carbon-rich regions is
consistent with either a spherical distribution or a hemispheric asymmetry,
supporting the recent idea that SN Ia diversity may be a result of off-center
ignition coupled with observer line-of-sight effects.
