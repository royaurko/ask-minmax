The propagation of surface acoustic waves in a rotating anisotropic crystal
is studied. The crystal is monoclinic and cut along a plane containing the
normal to the symmetry plane; this normal is also the axis of rotation. The
secular equation is obtained explicitly using the "method of the polarization
vector", and it shows that the wave is dispersive and decelerates with
increasing rotation rate. The case of orthorhombic symmetry is also treated.
The surface wave speed is computed for 12 monoclinic and 8 rhombic crystals,
and for a large range of the rotation rate/wave frequency ratio.
