We present a new method to detect duplicates used to merge different
bibliographic record corpora with the help of lexical and social information.
As we show, a trivial key is not available to delete useless documents. Merging
heteregeneous document databases to get a maximum of information can be of
interest. In our case we try to build a document corpus about the TOR molecule
so as to extract relationships with other gene components from PubMed and
WebOfScience document databases. Our approach makes key fingerprints based on
n-grams. We made two documents gold standards using this corpus to make an
evaluation. Comparison with other well-known methods in deduplication gives
best scores of recall (95\%) and precision (100\%).
