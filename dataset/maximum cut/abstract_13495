We investigate the position of the Buchen-Kelly density in a family of
entropy maximising densities which all match European call option prices for a
given maturity observed in the market. Using the Legendre transform which links
the entropy function and the cumulant generating function, we show that it is
both the unique continuous density in this family and the one with the greatest
entropy. We present a fast root-finding algorithm that can be used to calculate
the Buchen-Kelly density, and give upper boundaries for three different
discrepancies that can be used as convergence criteria. Given the call prices,
arbitrage-free digital prices at the same strikes can only move within upper
and lower boundaries given by left and right call spreads. As the number of
call prices increases, these bounds become tighter, and we give two examples
where the densities converge to the Buchen-Kelly density in the sense of
relative entropy when we use centered call spreads as proxies for digital
prices. As pointed out by Breeden and Litzenberger, in the limit a continuous
set of call prices completely determines the density.
