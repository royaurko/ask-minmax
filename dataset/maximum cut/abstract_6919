The temperature dependence of the isothermal magnetic entropy change,
{\Delta}SM, and the magnetic field dependence of the refrigerant capacity, RC,
have been investigated in a composite system xA+(1-x)B, based on Fe87Zr6B6Cu1
(A) and Fe90Zr8B2 (B) amorphous ribbons. Under a magnetic field change of 2 T
the maximum improvement of the full-width at half maximum of {\Delta}SM(T)
curve (47 and 29 %) and the RC (18 and 23 %), in comparison with those of the
individual alloys (A and B), is observed for x \approx 0.5. Moreover, a
flattening over 80 K in the {\Delta}SM(T) curve around room temperature range
is observed, which is a key feature for an Ericsson magnetic refrigeration
cycle.
