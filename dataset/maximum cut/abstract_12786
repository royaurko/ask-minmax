The observed apparent velocities and luminosities of the relativistic jets in
AGNs are significantly different from their intrinsic values due to strong
special relativistic effects. We adopt the maximum likelihood method to
determine simultaneously the intrinsic luminosity function and the Lorentz
factor distribution of a sample of AGNs. The values of the best estimated
parameters are consistent with the previous results, but with much better
accuracy. In previous study, it was assumed that the shape of the observed
luminosity function of Fanaroff-Riley type II radio galaxies is the same with
the intrinsic luminosity function of radio loud quasars. Our results prove the
validity of this assumption. We also find that low and high redshift groups
divided by z=0.1 are likely to be from different parent populations.
