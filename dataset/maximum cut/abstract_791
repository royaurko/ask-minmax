We compute the first two moments of the final hadronic invariant mass in
inclusive semileptonic B decay, in the presence of a cut on the charged lepton
energy. These moments may be measured directly by experiments at the
Upsilon(4S) using the neutrino reconstruction technique, which requires such a
cut. Measurement of these moments will place constraints on the nonperturbative
parameters \bar\Lambda and \lambda_1, which are relevant for extracting the
quark masses m_b and m_c, as well as the CKM angle V_cb. We include terms of
order \alpha_s^2\beta_0 and 1/m_b^3 in the operator product expansion, and use
the latter to estimate the theoretical uncertainty in the extraction of
\bar\Lambda and \lambda_1.
