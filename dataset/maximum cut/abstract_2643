In the 1930's, Tarski introduced his plank problem at a time when the field
discrete geometry was about to born. It is quite remarkable that Tarski's
question and its variants continue to generate interest in the geometric as
well as analytic aspects of coverings by planks in the present time as well.
Besides giving a short survey on the status of the affine plank conjecture of
Bang (1950) we prove some new partial results for the successive inradii of the
convex bodies involved. The underlying geometric structures are successive
hyperplane cuts introduced several years ago by Conway and inductive tilings
introduced recently by Akopyan and Karasev.
