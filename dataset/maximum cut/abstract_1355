Given a compact symplectic manifold M with the Hamiltonian action of a torus
T, let zero be a regular value of the moment map, and M_0 the symplectic
reduction at zero. Denote by \kappa_0 the Kirwan map H^*_T(M)-> H^*(M_0). For
an equivariant cohomology class \eta\in H^*_T(M) we present new localization
formulas which express \int_{M_0} \kappa_0(\eta) as sums of certain integrals
over the connected components of the fixed point set M^T. To produce such a
formula we apply a residue operation to the Atiyah-Bott-Berline-Vergne
localization formula for an equivariant form on the symplectic cut of M with
respect to a certain cone, and then, if necessary, iterate this process using
other cones. When all cones used to produce the formula are one-dimensional we
recover, as a special case, the localization formula of Guillemin and Kalkman.
Using similar ideas, for a special choice of the cone (whose dimension is equal
to that of T) we give a new proof of the Jeffrey-Kirwan localization formula.
