The Morse-Novikov number MN(L) of an oriented link L in the 3-sphere is the
minimum number of critical points of a Morse map from the complement of L in
the 3-sphere to the circle representing the class of a Seifert surface for L
(e.g., the Morse-Novikov number of L is zero if and only if L is fibered). We
develop various constructions of Morse maps (Milnor maps, Stallings twists,
splicing along a link which is a closed braid with respect to a Morse map,
Murasugi sums, cutting a Morse map along an arc on a page) and use them to
bound Morse-Novikov numbers from above in terms of other knot and link
invariants (free genus, crossing number, braid index, wrapping genus and
layered wrapping genus).
