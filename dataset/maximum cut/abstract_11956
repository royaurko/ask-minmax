When two fully polarized ferromagnetic (F) wires with opposite polarizations
make contact with a spin-singlet superconductor, a potential-induced current in
wire 1 induces a non-local current of equal magnitude and sign in wire 2. The
magnitude of this current has been studied in the tunneling limit and found to
decay exponentially with the distance between the contact. In this paper we
propose a new structure in which this novel non-local effect is increased by
orders of magnitude. We study the spin-dependent electronic transport of a
diffusive nanojunction and demonstrate that when a normal diffusive region is
placed between the F leads and superconductor, the non-local initially
increases with the separation between the F leads, achieving a maximum and
decays as a power law with increasing separation.
