Photoproduction of $\phi$-meson on protons was studied by means of linearly
polarized photons at forward angles in the low-energy region from threshold to
$E_{\gamma}$= 2.37 GeV. The differential cross sections at $t = -|t|_{min}$ do
not increase smoothly as $E_{\gamma}$ increases, but show a local maximum at
around 2.0 GeV. The angular distributions demonstrate that $\phi$-mesons are
photo-produced predominantly by helicity-conserving processes, and the local
maximum is not likely due to unnatural-parity processes.
