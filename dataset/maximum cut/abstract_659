A brief summary of the CMS discovery potential for the Standard Model Higgs
boson in the H->gamma+gamma channel is presented. We review both a standard
cut-based search and a more optimized analysis that takes advantage of the wide
range of signal/background expectations as function of the possible selection
cuts. As the Higgs discovery in this channel will rely heavily on performance
of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter, the relevant aspects of its design and
operation in situ at the LHC are also briefly discussed.
