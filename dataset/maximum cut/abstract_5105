We study spiky string solutions in AdS3 x S1 that are characterized by two
spins S,J as well as winding m in S1 and spike number n. We construct
explicitly two-cut solutions by using the SL(2) asymptotic Bethe Ansatz
equations at leading order in strong coupling. Unlike the folded spinning
string, these solutions have asymmetric distributions of Bethe roots. The
solutions match the known spiky string classical results obtained directly from
string theory for arbitrary semiclassical parameters, including J=0 and any
value of S, namely short and long strings. At large spins and winding number
the string touches the boundary, and we find a new scaling limit with the
energy given as E-S = n /2/ pi sqrt[1+ 4 pi^2/n^2 (J^2/ln^2 S + m^2/ln^2 S)] ln
S. This is a generalization of the known scaling for the folded spinning
string.
