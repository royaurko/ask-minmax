The (any) seismogenic area in the lithosphere is considered as an open
physical system. Following its energy balance analysis earlier presented (Part
- I, Thanassoulas, 2008), the specific case when the seismogenic area is under
normal (input energy equals released energy) seismogenic conditions is studied.
In this case the cumulative seismic energy release is a linear time function.
Starting from this linear function a method is postulated for the determination
of the maximum expected magnitude of a future earthquake. The proposed method
has been tested "a posteriori" on real EQs from the Greek territory, USA and
data obtained from the seismological literature. The obtained results validate
the methodology while an analysis is presented that justifies the obtained high
degree of accuracy compared to the corresponding calculated EQ magnitudes with
seismological methods.
