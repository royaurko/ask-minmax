Measurements of diboson events in proton-antiproton collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV are effective probes of the electro-weak gauge structure in
the Standard Model (SM). Due to the potentially high energy scale in the
collisions, bosonic operators beyond the leading order in the Lagrangian become
important at the Tevatron and make the theoretical interpretations non trivial.
The fact that we need cut-offs in our models in order to maintain unitarity
underline the importance of direct measurements at the highest possible energy
scales. I report on two new such measurement from CDF and compare to similar D0
results taken at lower integrated luminosities.
