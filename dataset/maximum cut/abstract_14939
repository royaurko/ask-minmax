The interrelationships of the fundamental biological processes natural
selection, mutation, and stochastic drift are quantified by the entropy rate of
Moran processes with mutation, measuring the long-run variation of a Markov
process. The entropy rate is shown to behave intuitively with respect to
evolutionary parameters such as monotonicity with respect to mutation
probability (for the neutral landscape), relative fitness, and strength of
selection. Strict upper bounds, depending only on the number of replicating
types, for the entropy rate are given and the neutral fitness landscape attains
the maximum in the large population limit. Various additional limits are
computed including small mutation, weak and strong selection, and large
population holding the other parameters constant, revealing the individual
contributions and dependences of each evolutionary parameter on the long-run
outcomes of the processes.
