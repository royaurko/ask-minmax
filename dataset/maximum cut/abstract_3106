In the Bradley-Terry model for paired comparisons, and its extensions to
include order effects and ties, the maximum likelihood estimates of
probabilities of certain outcomes can be 0 or 1 under certain data
configurations. This poses problems for standard estimation methods. In this
paper, we give algorithms for identifying the outcomes with estimated
probability 0 or 1, and indicate how the remaining probabilities may be
estimated and summarized.
