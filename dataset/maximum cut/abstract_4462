In this talk the gauge symmetry for Wilsonian flows in pure Yang-Mills
theories is discussed. The background field formalism is used for the
construction of a gauge invariant effective action. The symmetries of the
effective action under gauge transformations for both the gauge field and the
auxiliary background field are separately evaluated. Modified Ward-Takahashi
and background field identities are used in my study. Finally it is shown how
the symmetry properties of the full theory are restored in the limit where the
cut-off is removed.
