Critical thermoelectric parameters including Seebeck coefficient, electrical
conductivity, thermal conductivity and figure of merit ZT of one-dimensional
coaxial Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 nanocomposite were modeled by following the single
carrier pocket and sharp interface assumptions. A calculation scheme based on
Landauer approach, instead of commonly used Boltzmann transport equation (BTE)
with relaxation time approximation, was adopted to numerically obtain the
transmission functions which can be used to evaluate thermoelectric properties.
Considerable enhancement of ZT was obtained through our modeling and numerical
calculation, and the corresponding dependence of thermoelectric performance on
structure parameters was studied. Finally, the efficiency at the maximum power
condition for this 1-D system was also investigated.
