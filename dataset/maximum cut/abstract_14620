In this paper we describe the infinitesimal deformations of null-filiform
Leibniz superalgebras over a field of zero characteristic. It is known that up
to isomorphism in each dimension there exist two such superalgebras $NF^{n,m}$.
One of them is a Leibniz algebra (that is $m=0$) and the second one is a pure
Leibniz superalgebra (that is $m\neq 0$) of maximum nilindex. We show that the
closure of union of orbits of single-generated Leibniz algebras forms an
irreducible component of the variety of Leibniz algebras. We prove that any
single-generated Leibniz algebra is a linear integrable deformation of the
algebra $NF^{n}$. Similar results for the case of Leibniz superalgebras are
obtained.
