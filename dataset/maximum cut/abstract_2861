The results from an X-ray spectroscopic study of the giant elliptical galaxy
NGC5044 in the center of a galaxy group are presented. The line dominated soft
X-ray spectra (mainly Fe-L and O VIII Ly_a) from the diffuse gas are resolved
for the first time in this system with the Reflection Grating Spectrometers
on-board XMM-Newton and provide a strong constraint on the temperature
structure. The spectra integrated over 2' (\sim 20kpc) in full-width can be
described by a two temperature plasma model of 0.7keV and 1.1keV. Most of the
latter component is consistent with originating from off-center regions.
Compared to the isobaric cooling flow prediction, the observation shows a clear
cut-off below a temperature of 0.6 +-0.1keV. Furthermore, the Fe and O
abundances within the central 10--20kpc in radius are accurately measured to be
0.55+-0.05 and 0.25+-0.1 times the solar ratios, respectively. The observed
cut-off temperature of this galaxy and other central galaxies in galaxy groups
and clusters are compared with the scale of the galaxy and properties of the
surrounding intra-cluster medium. Based on this comparison, the origin of the
lack of predicted cool emission is discussed.
