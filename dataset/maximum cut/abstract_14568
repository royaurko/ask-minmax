We performed point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy measurements in
Ca(Fe_{1-x}Co_x)2As2 single crystals with effective x=0.060 +- 0.005. The
spectra of ab-plane contacts show a zero-bias maximum and broad shoulders at
about 5-6 meV. Their fit with the three-dimensional Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk
model (making use of a analytical expression for the Fermi surface that mimics
the one calculated from first principles) shows that this compound presents a
large isotropic gap on the quasi-2D electronlike Fermi surface sheets and a
smaller anisotropic (possibly nodal) gap on the 3D holelike Fermi surface
pockets centered at the Z point in the Brillouin zone. These results nicely fit
into the theoretical picture for the appearance of nodal superconductivity in
122 compounds.
