We discuss the relative merits of mid-infrared and X-ray selection of type-2
quasars. We describe the mid-infrared, near-infrared and radio selection
criteria used to find a population of redshift z~2 type-2 quasars which we
previously argued suggests that most supermassive black hole growth in the
Universe is obscured (Martinez-Sansigre et al., 2005). We present the optical
spectra obtained from the William Herschel Telescope, and we compare the narrow
emission line luminosity, radio luminosity and maximum size of jets to those of
objects from radio-selected samples. This analysis suggests that these are
genuine radio-quiet type-2 quasars, albeit the radio-bright end of this
population. We also discuss the possibility of two different types of quasar
obscuration, which could explain how the ~2-3:1 ratio of type-2 to type-1
quasars preferred by modelling our population can be reconciled with the ~1:1
ratio predicted by unified schemes.
