A model with a singular forward scattering amplitude for particles with
opposite spins in d spatial dimensions is proposed and solved by using the
bosonization transformation. This interacting potential leads to the
spin-charge separation. Thermal properties at low temperature for this
Luttinger liquid are discussed. Also, the explicit form of the single-electron
Green function is found; it has square-root branch cut. New fermion field
operators are defined; they describe holons and spinons as the elementary
excitations. Their single particle Green functions possess pseudoparticle
properties. Using these operators the spin-charge separated Hamiltonian for an
ideal gases of holons and spinons is derived and reflects an inverse
(fermionization) transformation.
