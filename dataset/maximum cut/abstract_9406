Tsallis has suggested a nonextensive generalization of the Boltzmann-Gibbs
entropy, the maximization of which gives a generalized canonical distribution
under special constraints. In this brief report we show that the generalized
canonical distribution so obtained may differ from that predicted by the law of
large numbers when empirical samples are held to the same constraint. This
conclusion is based on a result regarding the large deviation property of
conditional measures and is confirmed by numerical evidence.
