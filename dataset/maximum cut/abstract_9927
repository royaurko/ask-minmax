The Lyon-Meudon Extragalactic database (LEDA) gives a free access to the main
astrophysical parameters for more than 100,000 galaxies. The most common names
are compiled allowing users to recover quickly any galaxy. All these measured
astrophysical parameters are first reduced to a common system according to well
defined reduction formulae leading to mean homogeneized parameters. Further,
these parameters are also transformed into corrected parameters from widely
accepted models. For instance, raw 21-cm line widths are transformed into mean
standard widths after correction for instrumental effect and then into maximum
velocity rotation properly corrected for inclination and non-circular velocity.
This paper presents the reduction formulae for each parameter: coordinates,
morphological type and luminosity class, diameter and axis ratio, apparent
magnitude (UBV, IR, HI) and colors, maximum velocity rotation and central
velocity dispersion, radial velocity, mean surface brightness, distance modulus
and absolute magnitude, and group membership. For each of these parameters
intermediate quantities are given: galactic extinction, inclination,
K-correction etc..
  All these parameters are available from direct connexion to LEDA (telnet

(PGC-ROM 1996) by the Observatoire de Lyon via the CNRS (mail to
