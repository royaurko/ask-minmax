This paper investigates the different effects of chaotic switching on
Parrondo's games, as compared to random and periodic switching. The rate of
winning of Parrondo's games with chaotic switching depends on coefficient(s)
defining the chaotic generator, initial conditions of the chaotic sequence and
the proportion of Game A played. Maximum rate of winning can be obtained with
all the above mentioned factors properly set, and this occurs when chaotic
switching approaches periodic behavior.
