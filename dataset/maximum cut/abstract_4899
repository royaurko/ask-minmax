We study the production of a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson in association
with a single top quark and either a light jet or $W$-boson at the LHC with a
center of mass energy of 14 TeV. Due to the destructive interference of the
contributing SM diagrams, the value of the top Yukawa coupling and the sign of
the $WWh$ coupling may be probed for Higgs masses above 150 GeV where $WW$ and
$ZZ$ are the dominant Higgs decays. We consider Higgs masses of $m_{h}=120$,
150, 180, and 200 GeV and devise experimental cuts to extract the signal from
SM backgrounds and measure the top Yukawa coupling.
