A large class of multidimensional nonlinear Schroedinger equations admit
localized nonradial standing wave solutions that carry nonzero intrinsic
angular momentum. Here we provide evidence that certain of these spinning
excitations are spectrally stable. We find such waves for equations in two
space dimensions with focusing-defocusing nonlinearities, such as
cubic-quintic. Spectrally stable waves resemble a vortex (non-localized
solution with asymptotically constant amplitude) cut off at large radius by a
kink layer that exponentially localizes the solution.
  For the evolution equations linearized about a localized spinning wave, we
prove that unstable eigenvalues are zeros of Evans functions for a finite set
of ordinary differential equations. Numerical computations indicate that there
exist spectrally stable standing waves having central vortex of any degree.
