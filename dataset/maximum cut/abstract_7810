Constraints on dark matter from the first CMS and ATLAS SUSY searches are
investigated. It is shown that within the minimal supergravity model, the early
search for supersymmetry at the LHC has depleted a large portion of the
signature space in dark matter direct detection experiments. In particular, the
prospects for detecting signals of dark matter in the XENON and CDMS
experiments are significantly affected in the low neutralino mass region. Here
the relic density of dark matter typically arises from slepton coannihilations
in the early universe. In contrast, it is found that the CMS and ATLAS analyses
leave untouched the Higgs pole and the Hyperbolic Branch/Focus Point regions,
which are now being probed by the most recent XENON results. Analysis is also
done for supergravity models with non-universal soft breaking where one finds
that a part of the dark matter signature space depleted by the CMS and ATLAS
cuts in the minimal SUGRA case is repopulated. Thus, observation of dark matter
in the LHC depleted region of minimal supergravity may indicate
non-universalities in soft breaking.
