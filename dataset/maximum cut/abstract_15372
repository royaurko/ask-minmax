The R package lcmm provides a series of functions to estimate statistical
models based on the linear mixed model theory. It includes the estimation of
mixed models and latent class mixed models for Gaussian longitudinal outcomes
(hlme), curvilinear and ordinal univariate longitudinal outcomes (lcmm) and
multivariate longitudinal outcomes (multlcmm), as well as joint latent class
mixed models (Jointlcmm) for a (Gaussian or curvilinear) longitudinal outcome
and a time-to-event that can be possibly left-truncated right-censored and
defined in a competing setting. Maximum likelihood estimators are obtained
using a modified Marquardt algorithm with strict convergence criteria based on
the first and second derivatives in addition to the parameters and likelihood
stability. The package also provides various post-fit functions including
goodness-of-fit analyses, classification, plots, predicted trajectories,
individual dynamic prediction of the event and predictive accuracy assessment.
This paper constitutes a companion paper by introducing each family of models,
the estimation technique, some implementation details and giving examples
through a dataset on cognitive aging.
