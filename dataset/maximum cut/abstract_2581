In the previous article "Refined Analytic Torsion on Manifolds with Boundary"
we have presented a construction of refined analytic torsion in the spirit of
Braverman and Kappeler, which does apply to compact manifolds with and without
boundary. We now derive a gluing formula for our construction, which can be
viewed as a gluing law for the original definition of refined analytic torsion
by Braverman and Kappeler. A gluing formula allows to compute the torsion
invariant by cutting the manifold into elementary pieces and performing
computations on each component. Certainly, the general fact of existence of
such gluing formulas is remarkable from the analytic point of view, since the
secondary spectral invariants are uppermost non-local.
