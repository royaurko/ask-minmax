Recent observation of pulsar PSR J1614-2230 with mass about 2 solar masses
poses a severe constraint on the equations of state (EOS) of matter describing
stars under extreme conditions. Neutron stars (NS) can reach the mass limits
set by PSR J1614-2230. But stars having hyperons or quark stars (QS) having
boson condensates, with softer EOS can barely reach such limits and are ruled
out. QS with pure strange matter also cannot have such high mass unless the
effect of strong coupling constant or colour superconductivity are taken into
account. In this work I try to calculate the upper mass limit for a hybrid
stars (HS) having a quark-hadron mixed phase. The hadronic matter (having
hyperons) EOS is described by relativistic mean field theory and for the quark
phase I use the simple MIT bag model. I construct the intermediate mixed phase
using Glendenning construction. HS with a mixed phase cannot reach the mass
limit set by PSR J1614-2230 unless I assume a density dependent bag constant.
For such case the mixed phase region is small. The maximum mass of a mixed
hybrid star obtained with such mixed phase region is $2.01 M_{\odot}$.
