Quantum-dynamical full-dimensional (15D) calculations are reported for the
protonated water dimer (H5O2+) using the multiconfiguration time-dependent
Hartree (MCTDH) method. The dynamics is described by curvilinear coordinates.
The expression of the kinetic energy operator in this set of coordinates is
given and its derivation, following the polyspherical method, is discussed. The
PES employed is that of Huang et al. [JCP, 122, 044308, (2005)]. A scheme for
the representation of the potential energy surface (PES) is discussed which is
based on a high dimensional model representation scheme (cut-HDMR), but
modified to take advantage of the mode-combination representation of the
vibrational wavefunction used in MCTDH. The convergence of the PES expansion
used is quantified and evidence is provided that it correctly reproduces the
reference PES at least for the range of energies of interest. The reported zero
point energy of the system is converged with respect to the MCTDH expansion and
in excellent agreement (16.7 cm-1 below) with the diffusion Monte Carlo result
on the PES of Huang et al. The highly fluxional nature of the cation is
accounted for through use of curvilinear coordinates. The system is found to
interconvert between equivalent minima through wagging and internal rotation
motions already when in the ground vibrational-state, i.e., T=0. It is shown
that a converged quantum-dynamical description of such a flexible, multi-minima
system is possible.
