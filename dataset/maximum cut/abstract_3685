The performance of known and new parametric estimators for Archimedean
copulas is investigated, with special focus on large dimensions and numerical
difficulties. In particular, method-of-moments-like estimators based on
pairwise Kendall's tau, a multivariate extension of Blomqvist's beta, minimum
distance estimators, the maximum-likelihood estimator, a simulated
maximum-likelihood estimator, and a maximum-likelihood estimator based on the
copula diagonal are studied. Their performance is compared in a large-scale
simulation study both under known and unknown margins (pseudo-observations), in
small and high dimensions, under small and large dependencies, various
different Archimedean families and sample sizes. High dimensions up to one
hundred are considered for the first time and computational problems arising
from such large dimensions are addressed in detail. All methods are implemented
in the open source \R{} package \pkg{copula} and can thus be easily accessed
and studied.
