We show that states on tensor products of matrix algebras whose ranks are
relatively small are {\em almost surely} entangled, but that states of maximum
rank are not. More precisely, let $M=M_m(\mathbb C)$ and $N=M_n(\mathbb C)$ be
full matrix algebras with $m\geq n$, fix an arbitrary state $\omega$ of $N$,
and let $E(\omega)$ be the set of all states of $M\otimes N$ that extend
$\omega$. The space $E(\omega)$ contains states of rank $r$ for every
$r=1,2,...,m\cdot\rank\omega$, and it has a filtration into compact subspaces
$$ E^1(\omega)\subseteq E^2(\omega)\subseteq ...\subseteq
E^{m\cdot\rank\omega}=E(\omega), $$ where $E^r(\omega)$ is the set of all
states of $E(\omega)$ having rank $\leq r$.
  We show first that for every $r$, there is a real-analytic manifold $V^r$,
homogeneous under a transitive action of a compact group $G^r$, which
parameterizes $E^r(\omega)$. The unique $G^r$-invariant probability measure on
$V^r$ promotes to a probability measure $P^{r,\omega}$ on $E^r(\omega)$, and
$P^{r,\omega}$ assigns probability 1 to states of rank $r$. The resulting
probability space $(E^r(\omega),P^{r,\omega})$ represents ``choosing a rank $r$
extension of $\omega$ at random".
  Main result: For every $r=1,2,...,[\rank \omega/2]$, states of
$(E^r(\omega),P^{r,\omega})$ are almost surely entangled.
