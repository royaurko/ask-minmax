Let M be a compact, connected, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold and T' an
incompressible torus boundary component of M such that the pair (M,T') is not
cabled. By a result of C. Gordon, if S and T are incompressible punctured tori
in M with boundary on T' and boundary slopes at distance d, then d is at most
8, and the cases where d=6,7,8 are very few and classified. We give a
simplified proof of this result (or rather, of its reduction process), based on
an improved estimate for the maximum possible number of mutually parallel
negative edges in the graphs of intersection of S and T. We also extend
Gordon's result by allowing either S or T to be an essential Klein bottle. to
the case where S or T is a punctured essential Klein bottle.
