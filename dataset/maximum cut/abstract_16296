I show that there exist universal constants $C(r) < \infty$ such that, for
all loopless graphs $G$ of maximum degree $\le r$, the zeros (real or complex)
of the chromatic polynomial $P_G(q)$ lie in the disc $|q| < C(r)$. Furthermore,
$C(r) \le 7.963906... r$. This result is a corollary of a more general result
on the zeros of the Potts-model partition function $Z_G(q, {v_e})$ in the
complex antiferromagnetic regime $|1 + v_e| \le 1$. The proof is based on a
transformation of the Whitney-Tutte-Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation of $Z_G(q,
{v_e})$ to a polymer gas, followed by verification of the
Dobrushin-Koteck\'y-Preiss condition for nonvanishing of a polymer-model
partition function. I also show that, for all loopless graphs $G$ of
second-largest degree $\le r$, the zeros of $P_G(q)$ lie in the disc $|q| <
C(r) + 1$. Along the way, I give a simple proof of a generalized (multivariate)
Brown-Colbourn conjecture on the zeros of the reliability polynomial for the
special case of series-parallel graphs.
