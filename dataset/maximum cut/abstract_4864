Motivated by fading channels and erasure channels, the problem of reliable
communication over deterministic relay networks is studied, in which relay
nodes receive a function of the incoming signals and a random network state. An
achievable rate is characterized for the case in which destination nodes have
full knowledge of the state information. If the relay nodes receive a linear
function of the incoming signals and the state in a finite field, then the
achievable rate is shown to be optimal, meeting the cut-set upper bound on the
capacity. This result generalizes on a unified framework the work of
Avestimehr, Diggavi, and Tse on the deterministic networks with state
dependency, the work of Dana, Gowaikar, Palanki, Hassibi, and Effros on linear
erasure networks with interference, and the work of Smith and Vishwanath on
linear erasure networks with broadcast.
