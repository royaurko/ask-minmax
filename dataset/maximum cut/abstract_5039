The AdS/CFT correspondence in principle gives a new approach to deep
inelastic scattering as formulated by Polchinski and Strassler. Subsequently
Brower, Polchinski, Strassler and Tan (BPST) computed the strong coupling
kernel for the vacuum (or Pomeron) contribution to total cross sections. By
identifying deep inelastic scattering with virtual photon total cross section,
this allows a self consistent description at small-$x$ where the dominant
contribution is the vacuum exchange process. Here we formulate this
contribution and compare it with HERA small-$x$ DIS scattering data. We find
that the BPST kernel along with a very simple local approximation to the proton
and current "wave functions" gives a remarkably good fit not only at large
$Q^2$ dominated by conformal symmetry but also extends to small $Q^2$,
supplemented by a hard-wall cut-off of the AdS in the IR. We suggest that this
is a useful phenomenological parametrization with implications for other
diffractive processes, such as double diffractive Higgs production.
