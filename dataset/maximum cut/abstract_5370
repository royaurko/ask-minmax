The phase diagram of five-dimensional SU(2) gauge theories with one
compactified dimension on anisotropic lattices has a rich structure. In this
contribution we show how to control non-perturbatively the scale hierarchy
between the cut-off and the compactification scale in the bare parameter space.
There exists a set of strong bare couplings where the the five-dimensional
lattice theory can be described by an effective four-dimensional theory with a
scalar field in the adjoint representation. We present a detailed study of the
light scalar spectrum as it arises from the non-perturbative dynamics of the
full five-dimensional lattice theory. We also investigate the mixing with
scalar glueball states in the attempt to further establish the
extra-dimensional nature of light scalar states.
