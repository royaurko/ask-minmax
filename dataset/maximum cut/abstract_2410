We study the total cross section for photo production of open charm hadrons
near threshold using a hadronic Lagrangian. Both two-body final states
involving $\Lambda_c$ and a charmed meson as well as three-body final states
involving nucleon and a charm-anticharm meson pair are included. With
appropriate cut-off parameters in the form factors at interaction vertices, the
model gives a total cross section that is consistent with the measured data at
center-of-mass energy of 6 GeV. The result is compared with the prediction from
the leading-order perturbative QCD.
