We study the spin dynamics of an electron-hole pair in a random hyperfine
magnetic field and an external field, B0, under a resonant drive with frequency
omega0 = gamma B0. The fact that the pair decays by recombination exclusively
from a singlet configuration, S, in which the spins of the pair-partners are
entangled, makes this dynamics highly nontivial. Namely, as the amplitude, B1,
of the driving field grows, mixing all of the triplet components, the
long-living modes do not disappear, but evolve from T+, T- into (T+ +/- sqrt(2)
T0 + T-)/2. Upon further increase of B1, the lifetime of the S-mode is cut in
half, while the T0-mode transforms into an antisymmetric combination (T- -
T-)/sqrt(2) and acquires a long lifetime, in full analogy to the superradiant
and subradiant modes in the Dicke effect. Peculiar spin dynamics translates
into a peculiar dependence on B1. In particular, at small B1, the
radiation-induced correction to the current is linear in B1.
