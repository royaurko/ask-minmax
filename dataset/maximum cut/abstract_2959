We calculate upper and lower bounds on the modulus of the pion electro
magnetic form factor on the unitarity cut below the $\omega\pi$ inelastic
threshold, using as input the phase in the elastic region known via the
Fermi-Watson theorem from the $\pi\pi$ $P$-wave phase shift, and a suitably
weighted integral of the modulus squared above the inelastic threshold. The
normalization at $t=0$, the pion charge radius and experimental values at
spacelike momenta are used as additional input information. The bounds are
model independent, in the sense that they do not rely on specific
parametrizations and do not require assumptions on the phase of the form factor
above the inelastic threshold. The results provide nontrivial consistencychecks
on the recent experimental data on the modulus available below the $\omega\pi$
threshold from $e^+ e^-$ annihilation and $\tau$-decay experiments. In
particular, at low energies the calculated bounds offer a more precise
description of the modulus than the experimental data.
