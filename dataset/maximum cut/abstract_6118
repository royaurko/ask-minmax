Frequency pulling is a well-known phenomenon in standard laser physics,
leading to a shift of the laser frequency when the cavity and maximum gain
frequencies are detuned. In this letter we present the first experimental
demonstration of frequency pulling in single-pass free-electron lasers.
Measurements are performed using the single-pass free-electron laser installed
on the Elettra storage ring.
