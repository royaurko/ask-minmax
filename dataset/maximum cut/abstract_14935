We perform frequency- and time-resolved all-optical switching of a GaAs-AlAs
micropillar cavity using an ultrafast pump-probe setup. The switching is
achieved by two-photon excitation of free carriers. We track the cavity
resonances in time with a high frequency resolution. The pillar modes exhibit
simultaneous frequency shifts, albeit with markedly different maximum switching
amplitudes and relaxation dynamics. These differences stem from the
non-uniformity of the free carrier density in the micropillar, and are well
understood by taking into account the spatial distribution of injected free
carriers, their spatial diffusion and surface recombination at micropillar
sidewalls.
