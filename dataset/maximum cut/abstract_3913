After the first release of HIPPARCOS data, Feast & Catchpole gave a new value
to the zero-point of the visual Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation based on
trigonometric parallaxes. Because of the large uncertainties on these
parallaxes, the way in which individual measurements are weighted bears a
crucial importance, and the discrepancy they show leads to the conclusion that
the choice of the best weighting system can be provided through a Monte-Carlo
simulation. On the basis of such a simulation it is shown that:
  - A cut in \pi or in \sigma_{\pi} / \pi introduces a strong bias. - The
zero-point is more stable when only the brightest Cepheids are used. - The
Feast & Catchpole weighting gives the best zero-point and the lowest
dispersion.
  After correction, the adopted visual Period-Luminosity relation is:
  <M_V> = -2.77 log P - 1.44 \pm 0.05. Moreover, we extend this study to the
photometric I-band (Cousins) and obtain:
  <M_I> = -3.05 log P - 1.81 \pm 0.09.
