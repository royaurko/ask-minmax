Recently there has been interest in electroweak models on a five dimensional
interval that break the symmetry without a higgs boson. By warping the metric
of the interval it may be possible to avoid experimental bounds on extra W
bosons and delta rho. Five dimensional models necessarily require an explicit
UV cut-off to remain perturbative, such as that provided by deconstruction. We
study a simple deconstruction of this scenario with a chain of SU(2)^N+1 x
U(1)_Y groups linked by bi-fundamental higgs. There are two interesting
decoupling limits of this model, when the higgs vevs are taken large and when
the SU(2) couplings grow, which might provide a perturbative realization. In
fact it is very challenging to satisfy all the experimental bounds and the most
compatible scenario has both a higgs and a relatively strongly coupled new W
both close to 2 TeV
