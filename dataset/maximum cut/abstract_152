We develop a new method for tagging jets produced by hadronically decaying
top quarks. The method is an application of shower deconstruction, a maximum
information approach that was previously applied to identifying jets produced
by Higgs bosons that decay to bottom quarks. We tag an observed jet as a top
jet based on a cut on a calculated variable that is an approximation to the
ratio of the likelihood that a top jet would have the structure of the observed
jet to the likelihood that a non-top QCD jet would have this structure. We find
that the shower deconstruction based tagger can perform better in
discriminating boosted top quark jets from QCD jets than other publicly
available tagging algorithms.
