We develop an approach for calculating the inclusive multigluon production
within the JIMWLK high energy evolution. We give a formal expression of
multigluon cross section in terms of a generating functional for arbitrary
number of gluons $n$. In the dipole limit the expression simplifies
dramatically. We recover the previously known results for single and double
gluon inclusive cross section and generalize those for arbitrary multigluon
amplitude in terms of Feynman diagramms of Pomeron - like objects coupled to
external rapidity dependent field $s(\eta)$. We confirm the conclusion that the
AGK cutting rules in general are violated in multigluon production. However we
present an argument to the effect that for doubly inclusive cross section the
AGK diagramms give the leading contribution at high energy, while genuine
violation only occurs for triple and higher inclusive gluon production. We
discuss some general properties of our expressions and suggest a line of
argument to simplify the approach further.
