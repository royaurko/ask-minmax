We investigate how different stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) can affect
the mass loss and survival of star clusters. We find that IMFs with radically
different low-mass cut-offs (between 0.1 and 2 Msun) do not change cluster
destruction time-scales as much as might be expected. Unsurprisingly, we find
that clusters with more high-mass stars lose relatively more mass through
stellar evolution, but the response to this mass loss is to expand and hence
significantly slow their dynamical evolution. We also argue that it is very
difficult, if not impossible, to have clusters with different IMFs that are
initially "the same", since the mass, radius and relaxation times depend on
each other and on the IMF in a complex way. We conclude that changing the IMF
to be biased towards more massive stars does speed up mass loss and
dissolution, but that it is not as dramatic as might be thought.
