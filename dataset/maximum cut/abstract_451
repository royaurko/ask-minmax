We classify link diagrams with Turaev genus one and two in terms of an
alternating tangle structure of the link diagram. The proof involves surgery
along simple closed curves on the Turaev surface, called cutting loops, which
have corresponding cutting arcs that are visible on the planar link diagram.
These also provide new obstructions for a link diagram on a surface to come
from the Turaev surface algorithm.
