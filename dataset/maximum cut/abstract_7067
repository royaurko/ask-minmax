The problem of estimating the maximum Lyapunov exponents of the motion in a
multiplet of interacting nonlinear resonances is considered for the case when
the resonances have comparable strength. The corresponding theoretical
approaches are considered for the multiplets of two, three, and infinitely many
resonances (i.e., doublets, triplets, and "infinitets"). The analysis is based
on the theory of separatrix and standard maps. A "multiplet separatrix map" is
introduced, valid for description of the motion in the resonance multiplet
under certain conditions. In numerical experiments it is shown that, at any
given value of the adiabaticity parameter (which controls the degree of
interaction/overlap of resonances in the multiplet), the value of the maximum
Lyapunov exponent in the multiplet of equally-spaced equally-sized resonances
is minimal in the doublet case and maximal in the infinitet case. This is
consistent with the developed theory.
