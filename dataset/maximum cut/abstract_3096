It is shown how to apply the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) to numerical
Dyson-Schwinger studies for the extraction of spectral functions of correlators
from their corresponding Euclidean propagators. Differences to the application
in lattice QCD are emphasized and, as an example, the spectral functions of
massless quarks in cold and dense matter are presented.
