Within a wide class of models, the LEP2 lower limit of 95 GeV on the chargino
mass implies gluinos are heavier than $\sim$300 GeV. In this case electroweak
$\tw_1\twb_1$ and $\tw_1\tz_2$ production are the dominant SUSY processes at
the Tevatron, and the extensively examined isolated trilepton signal from
$\tw_1\tz_2$ production assumes an even greater importance. We update our
previous calculations of the SUSY reach of luminosity upgrades of the Fermilab
Tevatron in this channel incorporating ({\it i}) decay matrix elements in the
computation of the momenta of leptons from chargino and neutralino decays,
({\it ii}) the trilepton background from $W^*Z^*$ and $W^*\gamma^*$ production
which, though neglected in previous analyses, turns out to be the dominant
background, and finally, ({\it iii}) modified sets of cuts designed to reduce
these new backgrounds and increase the range of model parameters for which the
signal is observable. We show our improved projections for the reach for SUSY
of both the Fermilab Main Injector and the proposed TeV33 upgrade. We also
present opposite sign same flavor dilepton invariant mass distributions as well
as the $p_T$ distributions of leptons in SUSY trilepton events, and comment
upon how the inclusion of decay matrix elements impacts upon the Tevatron
reach, as well as upon the extraction of neutralino masses.
