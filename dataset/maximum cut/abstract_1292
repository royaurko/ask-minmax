We propose event cuts in deep inelastic scattering, suitable for an
examination of quark fragmentation universality. We compare the current
hemisphere of the Breit frame with hemispheres in e+e- annihilation events,
using Monte Carlo simulations. The agreement between the two processes is
improved after the suggested events cuts. A method to study the scale evolution
in quark hemispheres using data from fixed energy e+e- experiments is
presented. This makes it possible to use the high statistics from LEP1 also at
scales below the Z mass. We also discuss observables which are sensitive to the
dynamics of regions closer to the remnant. The observables probes the
relatively clean region on the current side of the hardest emission in the
event, and can be used to distinguish between different assumptions about
remnant effects and mechanisms for the parton evolution.
