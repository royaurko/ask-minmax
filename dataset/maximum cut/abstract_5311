The resonance-continuum interference between the SM Higgs search signal
process gg --> H --> VV (V=W,Z) and the irreducible background process gg -->
VV is studied at leading order for integrated cross sections and differential
distributions in pp collisions at \sqrt{s}=7 TeV and 14 TeV for M_H=400 GeV.
Leptonic weak boson decays are included, and realistic experimental selection
cuts are applied.
