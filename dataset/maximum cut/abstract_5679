The ultraviolet divergences of amplitude diagrams in maximal supergravity are
investigated using the pure spinor superfield formalism in maximal
supergravity, with maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for reference. We
comment on the effects of the loop regularisation in relation to the actual
absence of high powers (within the degrees of freedom) of the non-minimal
variable r. The absence affects previous results of the field theory
description, which is examined more closely (with a new b-ghost) with respect
to the limit on the dimension for finiteness of the theory, dependent on the
number of loops present. The results imply a cut-off of the loop dependence at
six loops for the 4-point amplitude, and at seven loops otherwise.
