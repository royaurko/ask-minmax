We present the cross sections for production of up to four jets at the Large
Hadron Collider, at next-to-leading order in the QCD coupling. We use the
BlackHat library in conjunction with SHERPA and a recently developed algorithm
for assembling primitive amplitudes into color-dressed amplitudes. We adopt the
cuts used by ATLAS in their study of multi-jet events in pp collisions at
\sqrt{s} = 7 TeV. We include estimates of nonperturbative corrections and
compare to ATLAS data. We store intermediate results in a framework that allows
the inexpensive computation of additional results for different choices of
scale or parton distributions.
