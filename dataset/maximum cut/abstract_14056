Achieving high efficiency with numerical kernels for sparse matrices is of
utmost importance, since they are part of many simulation codes and tend to use
most of the available compute time and resources. In addition, especially in
large scale simulation frameworks the readability and ease of use of
mathematical expressions are essential components for the continuous
maintenance, modification, and extension of software. In this context, the
sparse matrix-matrix multiplication is of special interest. In this paper we
thoroughly analyze the single-core performance of sparse matrix-matrix
multiplication kernels in the Blaze Smart Expression Template (SET) framework.
We develop simple models for estimating the achievable maximum performance, and
use them to assess the efficiency of our implementations. Additionally, we
compare these kernels with several commonly used SET-based C++ libraries,
which, just as Blaze, aim at combining the requirements of high performance
with an elegant user interface. For the different sparse matrix structures
considered here, we show that our implementations are competitive or faster
than those of the other SET libraries for most problem sizes on a current Intel
multicore processor.
