The aim of this paper is to study the continuity correction for barrier
options in jump-diusion models. For this purpose, we express the pay-off a
barrier option in terms of the maximum of the underlying process. We then
condition with respect to the jump times and to the values of the underlying at
the jump times and rely on the connection between the maximum of the Brownian
motion and Bessel processes.
