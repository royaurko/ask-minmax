We consider the meta-equilibrium state of a composite system made up of
independent subsystems satisfying the additive form of external constraints, as
recently discussed by Abe [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 63}, 061105 (2001)]. We derive the
additive entropy $S$ underlying a composable entropy $\tilde{S}$ by identifying
the common intensive variable. The simplest form of composable entropy
satisfies Tsallis-type nonadditivity and the most general composable form is
interpreted as a monotonically increasing funtion $H$ of this simplest form.
This is consistent with the observation that the meta-equilibrium can be
equivalently described by the maximum of either $H[\tilde{S}]$ or $\tilde{S}$
and the intensive variable is same in both cases.
