Astronomy and related fields are at the forefront of science and technology;
answering fundamental questions and driving innovation. Although blue-skies
research like astronomy rarely contributes directly with tangible outcomes on a
short time scale, the pursuit of this research requires cutting-edge technology
and methods that can on a longer time scale, through their broader application
make a difference. A wealth of examples show how the study of astronomy
contributes to technology, economy and society by constantly pushing for
instruments, processes and software that are beyond our current capabilities.
In this essay we outline both the tangible and intangible reasons that
astronomy is an important part of society. Although we have focused mainly on
the technology and knowledge transfer, perhaps the most important contribution
is still the fact that astronomy makes us aware of how we fit into the vast
Universe.
