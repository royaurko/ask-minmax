We investigate the properties of the Extended Fock Basis (EFB) of Clifford
algebras introduced in [1]. We show that a Clifford algebra can be seen as a
direct sum of multiple spinor subspaces that are characterized as being left
eigenvectors of \Gamma. We also show that a simple spinor, expressed in Fock
basis, can have a maximum number of non zero coordinates that equals the size
of the maximal totally null plane (with the notable exception of vectorial
spaces with 6 dimensions).
