We propose and study properties of maximum likelihood estimators in the class
of conditional transformation models. Based on a suitable explicit
parameterisation of the unconditional or conditional transformation function,
we establish a cascade of increasingly complex transformation models that can
be estimated, compared and analysed in the maximum likelihood framework. Models
for the unconditional or conditional distribution function of any univariate
response variable can be set-up and estimated in the same theoretical and
computational framework simply by choosing an appropriate transformation
function and parameterisation thereof. The ability to evaluate the distribution
function directly allows us to estimate models based on the exact full
likelihood, especially in the presence of random censoring or truncation. For
discrete and continuous responses, we establish the asymptotic normality of the
proposed estimators. A reference software implementation of maximum
likelihood-based estimation for conditional transformation models allowing the
same flexibility as the theory developed here was employed to illustrate the
wide range of possible applications.
