The non-Gaussian quasi maximum likelihood estimator is frequently used in
GARCH models with intension to improve the efficiency of the GARCH parameters.
However, unless the quasi-likelihood happens to be the true one, non-Gaussian
QMLE methods suffers inconsistency even if shape parameters in the
quasi-likelihood are estimated. To correct this bias, we identify an unknown
scale parameter that is critical to the consistent estimation of non-Gaussian
QMLE, and propose a two-step non-Gaussian QMLE (2SNG-QMLE) for estimation of
the scale parameter and GARCH parameters. This novel approach is consistent and
asymptotically normal. Moreover, it has higher efficiency than the Gaussian
QMLE, particularly when the innovation error has heavy tails. Two extensions
are proposed to further improve the efficiency of 2SNG-QMLE. The impact of
relative heaviness of tails of the innovation and quasi-likelihood
distributions on the asymptotic efficiency has been thoroughly investigated.
Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical study confirm the advantages of the
proposed approach.
