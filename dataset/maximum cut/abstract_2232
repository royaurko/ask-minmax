A study of the dynamical fluctuation property of jets is carried out using
the Monte Carlo method. The results suggest that, the anisotropy of dynamical
fluctuations in the hadronic system inside jets, changes abruptly with the
variation of the cut parameter y_cut. A transition point exists, where these
fluctuations behave like those in soft hadronic collisions, i.e. being circular
in the transverse plane with respect to dynamical fluctuations.
