A non-monotonic energy dependence of the $K^{+} / \pi^{+}$ ratio with a sharp
maximum close to 30 A$\cdot$GeV is observed in central Pb+Pb collisions. Within
a statistical model of the early stage, this is interpreted as a sign of the
phase transition to a QGP, which causes a sharp change in the energy dependence
of the strangeness to entropy ratio. This observation naturally motivates us to
study the production of multistrange hyperons ($\Xi$, $\Omega$) as a function
of the beam energy. Furthermore it was suggested that the kinematic freeze-out
of $\Omega$ takes place directly at QGP hadronization. If this is indeed the
case, the transverse momentum spectra of the $\Omega$ directly reflect the
transverse expansion velocity of a hadronizing QGP. In this report we show
preliminary NA49 results on $\Omega^{-}$ and $\bar{\Omega}^{+}$ production in
central Pb+Pb collisions at 40 and 158 A$\cdot$GeV and compare them to
measurements of $\Xi^{-}$ and $\bar{\Xi}^{+}$ production in central Pb+Pb
collisions at 30, 40, 80 and 158 A$\cdot$GeV.
