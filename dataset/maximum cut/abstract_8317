A numerical likelihood approach to the determination of cosmic ray
anisotropies is presented which offers many advantages over other approaches.
It allows a wide range of statistically meaningful hypotheses to be compared
even when full sky coverage is unavailable, can be readily extended in order to
include measurement errors, and makes maximum unbiased use of all available
information.
