We will discuss the maximum entropy production (MaxEP) principle based on
Jaynes' information theoretical arguments, as was done by Dewar (2003, 2005).
With the help of a simple mathematical model of a non-equilibrium system, we
will show how to derive minimum and maximum entropy production. Furthermore,
the model will help us to clarify some confusing points and to see differences
between some MaxEP studies in the literature.
