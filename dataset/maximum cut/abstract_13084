Periodic and solitary travelling-wave solutions of an extended reduced
Ostrovsky equation are investigated. Attention is restricted to solutions that,
for the appropriate choice of certain constant parameters, reduce to solutions
of the reduced Ostrovsky equation. It is shown how the nature of the waves may
be categorized in a simple way by considering the value of a certain single
combination of constant parameters. The periodic waves may be smooth humps,
cuspons, loops or parabolic corner waves. The latter are shown to be the
maximum-amplitude limit of a one-parameter family of periodic smooth-hump
waves. The solitary waves may be a smooth hump, a cuspon, a loop or a parabolic
wave with compact support. All the solutions are expressed in parametric form.
Only in one circumstance can the variable parameter be eliminated to give a
solution in explicit form. In this case the resulting waves are either a
solitary parabolic wave with compact support or the corresponding periodic
corner waves.
