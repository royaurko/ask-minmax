The Kohn-Luttinger mechanism for superconductivity is investigated in a model
for the electron doped cuprates. The symmetry of the order parameter of the
superconducting phase is determined as a function of the geometry of the Fermi
surface together with the structure of the electron-hole susceptibility. It is
found to remain d_{x^2-y^2} wave within a large doping range. The shape of the
gap anisotropy evolves with doping, with the maximum gap moving away from (pi
,0), in good agreement with recent experiments. As the shift of the maximum
increases, a crossover to d_{xy}-symmetry is found.
