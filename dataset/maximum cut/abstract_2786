The interplay between magnetic vortex polarity, chirality and the curvature
of the underlying surface results in a dependence of the vortex polarity
switching efficiency on the vortex chirality. The switching is studied
numerically by applying a short Gauss pulse of the external magnetic field to a
spherical cap within its cut plane. The minimum field intensity required for
the switching essentially depends on the vortex chirality and it does not
depend on the initial vortex polarity. This effect decreases with the curvature
radius increasing and it vanishes in the planar limit.
