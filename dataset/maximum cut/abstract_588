We present a new study of polarized elastic muon-electron scattering. The
Born cross-section is calculated for arbitrary polarization of muon and
electron. The complete photonic O(alpha) radiative corrections are determined
for the case of longitudinally polarized muons and electrons. All calculations
are done by two methods: semianalytic, which allows an implementation of the
experimental cuts used for the analysis of MU-E scattering data from the beam
polarimeter of the SMC experiment at CERN and completely analytic, which is
used for cross checks The FORTRAN code MUELA realizes formulae of both
approaches. We prove that certain experimental cuts lead to negligible
radiative corrections in the muon beam polarization experiment.
