The aim of this paper is to compare numerically the performance of two
estimators based on Hyv\"arinen's local homogeneous scoring rule with that of
the full and the pairwise maximum likelihood estimators. In particular, two
different model settings, for which both full and pairwise maximum likelihood
estimators can be obtained, have been considered: the first order
autoregressive model (AR(1)) and the moving average model (MA(1)). Simulation
studies highlight very different behaviours for the Hyv\"arinen scoring rule
estimators relative to the pairwise likelihood estimators in these two
settings.
