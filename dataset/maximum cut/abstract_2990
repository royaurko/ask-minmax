One of the main issues affecting the Italian NHS is the healthcare deficit:
according to current agreements between the Italian State and its Regions,
public funding of regional NHS is now limited to the amount of regional deficit
and is subject to previous assessment of strict adherence to constraint on
regional healthcare balance sheet. Many Regions with previously uncontrolled
healthcare deficit have now to plan their "Piano di Rientro" (PdR) and submit
it for the approval of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finances. Those
Regions that will fail to comply to deficit constraints will suffer cuts on
their public NHS financing. A smart Health Planning can make sure health
spending is managed appropriately. Indeed a restructuring of the Italian
healthcare system has recently been enforced in order to cope for the clumsy
regional healthcare balance sheets. Half of total Italian healthcare
expenditure is accounted by hospital services which therefore configure as one
of the main restructuring targets. This paper provides a general framework for
planning a re-engineering of a hospital network. This framework is made of
economic, legal and healthcare constraints. We apply the general framework to
the particular case of Puglia region and explore a set of re-engineered
solutions which to different extent could help solve the difficult dilemma:
cutting costs without worsening the delivery of public healthcare services.
