We present details of the second part of the Southern Infrared Proper Motion
Survey (SIPS). Here accurate relative astrometry allows us to reduce the
minimum proper motion to 0.1 arcseconds per year. This yields 6904 objects with
proper motions between our minum cut and half an arcsecond a year. A small
overspill sample with proper motions greater than this is also included. We
examine our sample to identify interesting individual objects such as common
proper motion binaries, potential L dwarfs and candidate nearby stars. Finally
we show our survey is incomplete due to many factors, factors which we will
take into account when simulating these survey results in the next paper in
this series.
