The process of star formation from metal-free gas is investigated by
following the evolution of accreting protostars with emphasis on the properties
of massive objects. The main aim is to establish the physical processes that
determine the upper mass limit of the first stars. Although the consensus is
that massive stars were commonly formed in the first cosmic structures, our
calculations show that their actual formation depends sensitively on the mass
accretion rate and its time variation. Even in the rather idealized case in
which star formation is mainly determined by dot{M}acc, the characteristic mass
scale of the first stars is rather uncertain. We find that there is a critical
mass accretion rate dot{M}crit = 4 10^{-3} Msun/yr that separates solutions
with dot{M}acc< dot{M}crit in which objects with mass >> 100 Msun can form,
provided there is sufficient matter in the parent clouds, from others
(dot{M}acc > dot{M}crit) where the maximum mass limit decreases as dot{M}acc
increases. In the latter case, the protostellar luminosity reaches the
Eddington limit before the onset of hydrogen burning at the center via the
CN-cycle. This phase is followed by a rapid and dramatic expansion of the
radius, possibly leading to reversal of the accretion flow when the stellar
mass is about 100Msun. (abridged)
