We numerically implement a quasi-spherical approximation scheme for computing
gravitational waveforms for coalescing black holes, testing it against angular
momentum by applying it to Kerr black holes. As error measures, we take the
conformal strain and specific energy due to spurious gravitational radiation.
The strain is found to be monotonic rather than wavelike. The specific energy
is found to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the 1% level
expected from typical black-hole collisions, for angular momentum up to at
least 70% of the maximum, for an initial surface as close as $r=3m$.
