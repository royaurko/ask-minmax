In this article, the boundary singularity for stationary solutions of the
linearized Boltzmann equation with cut-off inverse power potential is analyzed.
In particular, for cut-off hard-potential cases, we establish the asymptotic
approximation for the gradient of the moments. Our analysis indicates the
logarithmic singularity of the gradient of the moments.
