We derive a fluctuation theorem for generalized work distributions, related
to bijective mappings of the phase spaces of two physical systems, and use it
to derive a two-sided constraint maximum likelihood estimator of their free
energy difference which uses samples from the equilibrium configurations of
both systems. As an application, we evaluate the chemical potential of a dense
Lennard-Jones fluid and study the construction and performance of suitable
maps.
