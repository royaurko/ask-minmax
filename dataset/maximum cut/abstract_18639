We present a near-infrared image of UY Aur, a 0.9" separated binary system,
using the Coronagraphic Imager with Adaptive Optics on the Subaru Telescope.
Thanks to adaptive optics, the spatial resolution of our image was ~0.1" in the
full width at half maximum of the point spread function, the highest achieved.
By comparison with previous measurements, we estimated that the orbital period
is ~1640 yrs and the total mass of the binary is ~1.73 solar mass. The observed
H-band magnitude of the secondary varies by as much as 1.3 mag within a decade,
while that of the primary is rather stable. This inconstancy may arise from
photospheric variability caused by an uneven accretion rate or from the
rotation of the secondary. We detected a half-ring shaped circumbinary disk
around the binary with a bright southwest part but a barely detectable
northeast portion. The brightness ratio is ~57. Its inner radius and
inclination are about 520 AU and 42, respectively. The disk is not uniform but
has remarkable features, including a clumpy structure along the disk,
circumstellar material inside the inner cavity, and an extended armlike
structure. The circumstellar material inside the cavity probably corresponds to
a clump or material accreting from the disk onto the binary. The armlike
structure is a part of the disk, created by the accretion from the outer region
of the disk or encounters with other stellar systems.
