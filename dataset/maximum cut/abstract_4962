A partial semimetric on V_n={1, ..., n} is a function f=((f_{ij})): V_n^2 ->
R_>=0 satisfying f_ij=f_ji >= f_ii and f_ij+f_ik-f_jk-f_ii >= 0 for all i,j,k
in V_n. The function f is a weak partial semimetric if f_ij >= f_ii is dropped,
and it is a strong partial semimetric if f_ij >= f_ii is complemented by f_ij
<= f_ii+f_jj.
  We describe the cones of weak and strong partial semimetrics via
corresponding weighted semimetrics and list their 0,1-valued elements,
identifying when they belong to extreme rays. We consider also related cones,
including those of partial hypermetrics, weighted hypermetrics, l_1-quasi
semimetrics and weighted/partial cuts.
