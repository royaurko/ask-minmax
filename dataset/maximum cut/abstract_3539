Using molecular dynamics simulations and integral equations (Rogers-Young,
Percus-Yevick and hypernetted chain closures) we investigate the thermodynamic
of particles interacting with continuous core-softened intermolecular
potential. Dynamic properties are also analyzed by the simulations. We show
that, for a chosen shape of the potential, the density, at constant pressure,
has a maximum for a certain temperature. The line of temperatures of maximum
density (TMD) was determined in the pressure-temperature phase diagram.
Similarly the diffusion constant at a constant temperature, $D$, has a maximum
at a density $\rho_{max}$ and a minimum at a density $\rho_{min}<\rho_{max}$.
In the pressure-temperature phase-diagram the line of extrema in diffusivity is
outside of TMD line. Although in this interparticle potential lacks
directionality, this is the same behavior observed in SPC/E water.
