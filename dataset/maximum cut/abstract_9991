We study the nucleation of quark matter drops at the center of cold
deleptonized neutron stars. This is relevant in the determination of the
critical mass $M_{cr}$ of hadronic stars above which it is possible a
transition to a quark star (strange or hybrid). We investigate the dependence
of $M_{cr}$ upon the parameters of the quark model (the Bag constant $B$, the
pairing gap $\Delta$, and the surface tension $\sigma$ of the quark-hadron
interphase) and for different parametrization of the hadronic equations of
state. The dependence of $M_{cr}$ on $B$, $\Delta$ and $\sigma$ is mild if the
parameters of the quark model correspond to hybrid stars, and strong if they
correspond to strange stars. For a large part of the parameter space
corresponding to hybrid stars, the critical mass is very close (but smaller
than) the maximum mass of hadronic stars, and therefore compatible with a
"mixed" population of compact stars (pure hadronic up to the critical mass and
hybrid above the critical mass). For very large $B$ the critical mass is never
smaller than the maximum mass of hadronic stars, implying that quark stars
cannot form through the here studied mechanism. The energy released in the
conversion is $3 \times 10^{52}$ erg - $4 \times 10^{53}$ erg, i.e. sufficient
to power a gamma ray burst.
