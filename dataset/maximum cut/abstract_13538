In this paper we present the results of our analysis of the growth and decay
of black holes possibly produced at the Large Hadron Collider, based on our
previous study of black holes in the context of the warped brane-world
scenario. The black hole mass accretion and decay is obtained as a function of
time, and the maximum black hole mass is obtained as a function of a critical
mass parameter. The latter occurs in our expression for the luminosity and is
related to the size of extra-dimensional corrections to Newton's law. Based on
this analysis, we argue against the possibility of catastrophic black hole
growth at the LHC.
