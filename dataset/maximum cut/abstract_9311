We investigate the one-dimensional interaction of a relativistic jet and an
external medium. Relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations show an anomalous
boost of the jet fluid in the boundary layer, as previously reported. We
describe the boost mechanism using an ideal relativistic fluid and
magnetohydrodynamic theory. The kinetic model is also examined for further
understanding. Simple scaling laws for the maximum Lorentz factor are derived,
and verified by the simulations.
