We report Meissner effect for type-II superconductors with a maximum Tc of 19
K, which is the highest value among those in new-carbon related
superconductors, found in the honeycomb arrays of multi-walled CNTs (MWNTs).
Drastic reduction of ferromagnetic catalyst and efficient growth of MWNTs by
deoxidization of catalyst make the finding possible. The weak magnetic
anisotropy, superconductive coherence length (- 7 nm), and disappearance of the
Meissner effect after dissolving array structure indicate that the graphite
structure of an MWNT and those intertube coupling in the honeycomb array are
dominant factors for the mechanism.
