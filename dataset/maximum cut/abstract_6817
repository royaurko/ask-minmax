We report the synthesis, x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility and
specific heat measurements on polycrystalline samples of undoped LiNi2P3O10 and
samples with non-magnetic impurity (Zn2+, S = 0) and magnetic impurity (Cu2+, S
= 1/2) at the Ni site. The magnetic susceptibility data show a broad maximum at
around 10 K and a small anomaly at about 7 K in the undoped sample.There is a
lambda-like anomaly in the specific heat at 7 K, possibly due to the onset of
antiferromagnetic ordering in the system. The magnetic entropy change at the
ordering temperature is close to the value corresponding to Rln(2S+1) expected
for an S = 1 system. The temperature corresponding to the broad maximum and the
ordering temperature both decrease on Zn and Cu substitutions and also in
applied magnetic fields.
