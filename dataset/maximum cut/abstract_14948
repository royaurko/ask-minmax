In this paper, we address the problem of characterizing the instances of the
multiterminal source model of Csisz\'ar and Narayan in which communication from
all terminals is needed for establishing a secret key of maximum rate. We give
an information-theoretic sufficient condition for identifying such instances.
We believe that our sufficient condition is in fact an exact characterization,
but we are only able to prove this in the case of the three-terminal source
model. We also give a relatively simple criterion for determining whether or
not our condition holds for a given multiterminal source model.
