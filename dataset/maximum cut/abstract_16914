The performance of several popular water models (TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP5P and
TIP4P/2005) is analysed. For that purpose the predictions for ten different
properties of water are investigated, namely: 1. vapour-liquid equilibria (VLE)
and critical temperature; 2. surface tension; 3. densities of the different
solid structures of water (ices); 4. phase diagram; 5. melting point
properties; 6. maximum in density at room pressure and thermal coefficients
$\alpha$ and $\kappa_T$; 7. structure of liquid water and ice; 8. equation of
state at high pressures; 9. diffusion coefficient; 10. dielectric constant. For
each property, the performance of each model is analysed in detail with a
critical discussion of the possible reason of the success or failure of the
model. A final judgement on the quality of these models is provided. TIP4P/2005
provides the best description of almost all properties of the list, with the
only exception of the dielectric constant. In the second position, TIP5P and
TIP4P yield an overall similar performance, and the last place with the poorest
description of the water properties is provided by TIP3P. The ideas leading to
the proposal and design of the TIP4P/2005 are also discussed in detail.
TIP4P/2005 is probably close to the best description of water that can be
achieved with a non polarizable model described by a single Lennard-Jones (LJ)
site and three charges.
