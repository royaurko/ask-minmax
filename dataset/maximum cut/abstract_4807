We analyze baryon number, strangeness and electric charge fluctuations as
well as their correlations in QCD at high temperature. We present results
obtained from lattice calculations performed with an improved staggered fermion
action (p4-action) at two values of the lattice cut-off with almost physical up
and down quark masses and a physical value for the strange quark mass. We
compare these results, with an ideal quark gas at high temperature and a hadron
resonance gas model at low temperature. We find that fluctuations and
correlations are well described by the former already for temperatures about
1.5 times the transition temperature. At low temperature qualitative features
of the lattice results are quite well described by a hadron resonance gas
model. Higher order cumulants, which become increasingly sensitive to the light
pions, however show deviations from a resonance gas in the vicinity of the
transition temperature.
