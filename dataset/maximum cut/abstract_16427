We make a comparison between results from numerically generated,
quasi-equilibrium configurations of compact binary systems of black holes in
close orbits, and results from the post-Newtonian approximation. The
post-Newtonian results are accurate through third PN order (O(v/c)^6 beyond
Newtonian gravity), and include rotational and spin-orbit effects, but are
generalized to permit orbits of non-zero eccentricity. Both treatments ignore
gravitational radiation reaction. The energy E and angular momentum J of a
given configuration are compared between the two methods as a function of the
orbital angular frequency \Omega. For small \Omega, corresponding to orbital
separations a factor of two larger than that of the innermost stable orbit, we
find that, if the orbit is permitted to be slightly eccentric, with e ranging
from \approx 0.03 to \approx 0.05, and with the two objects initially located
at the orbital apocenter (maximum separation), our PN formulae give much better
fits to the numerically generated data than do any circular-orbit PN methods,
including various ``effective one-body'' resummation techniques. We speculate
that the approximations made in solving the initial value equations of general
relativity numerically may introduce a spurious eccentricity into the orbits.
