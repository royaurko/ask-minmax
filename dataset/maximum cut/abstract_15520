A new method for the determination of the Alfven wave energy generated during
magnetic reconnection is introduced and used to analyze the results from
two-dimensional MHD simulations. It is found that the regions with strong
Alfven wave perturbations almost coincide with that where both magnetic-field
lines and flow-stream lines are bent, suggesting that this method is reliable
for identifying Alfven waves. The magnetic energy during magnetic reconnection
is mainly transformed into the thermal energy. The conversion rate to Alfven
wave energy from the magnetic energy is strongly correlated to the magnetic
reconnection rate. The maximum conversion rate at the time with the peak
reconnection rate is found to be only about 4% for the cases with the plasma
beta=0.01,0.1, and 1.0.
