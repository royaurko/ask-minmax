Final state average transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity at
the central rapidity unit of central Au-Au collisions at RHIC are studied
within a framework of lowest order perturbative QCD and Bjorken's
hydrodynamical picture. In particular, effects of initial minijet production
and the $pdV$ work during the subsequent evolution of the QGP are investigated.
Nuclear shadowing effects are included in a consistent manner, and the
dependence of the results on the minijet transverse momentum cut-off parameter
$p_0$ is shown.
