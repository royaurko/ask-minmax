In this paper, we find the internal stratification for terrestrial planets
with given mass-radius pairs, and use the core size and density to estimate
their maximum dipolar magnetic moment. We also comment on the temporal
evolution, although more information (e.g., core composition, mantle rheology
and history) is crucial in determining the state of the dynamo with planetary
age.
