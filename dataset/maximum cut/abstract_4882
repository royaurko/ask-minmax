The Einstein Telescope is a proposed third generation gravitational wave
detector that will operate in the region of 1 Hz to a few kHz. As well as the
inspiral of compact binaries composed of neutron stars or black holes, the
lower frequency cut-off of the detector will open the window to a number of new
sources. These will include the end stage of inspirals, plus merger and
ringdown of intermediate mass black holes, where the masses of the component
bodies are on the order of a few hundred solar masses. There is also the
possibility of observing intermediate mass ratio inspirals, where a stellar
mass compact object inspirals into a black hole which is a few hundred to a few
thousand times more massive. In this article, we investigate some of the data
analysis challenges for the Einstein Telescope such as the effects of increased
source number, the need for more accurate waveform models and the some of the
computational issues that a data analysis strategy might face.
