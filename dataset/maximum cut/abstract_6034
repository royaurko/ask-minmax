Within the framework of Hilbert space theory, we derive a maximum-power
variational principle applicable to classical spontaneous radiation from
prescribed harmonic current sources. Results are first derived in the paraxial
limit, then appropriately generalized to non-paraxial situations. The
techniques were developed within the context of undulator radiation from
relativistic electron beams, but are more broadly applicable.
