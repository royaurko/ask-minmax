We studied universality of Wishart ensembles whose covariance matrix has 2
distinct eigenvalues and the number of each of these eigenvalue goes to
infinity in the asymptotic limit. In this case, the limiting eigenvalue
distribution can be supported on 1 or 2 disjoint intervals. In our previous
work the case when the support consists of 2 intervals was studied. This paper
complements our previous analysis and studied the case when the support
consists of a single interval. By using Riemann-Hilbert analysis, we have shown
that under proper rescaling of the eigenvalues, the limiting correlation kernel
is given by the sine kernel and the Airy kernel in the bulk and the edge of the
spectrum respectively. As a consequence, the behavior of the largest eigenvalue
in this model is described by the Tracy-Widom distribution.
