This note illustrates the strategy of our paper on piecewise affine surface
homeomorphisms by giving a new proof of the finite multiplicity of the maximum
entropy measure of Anosov diffeomorphisms (here on surfaces). This approach
avoids the explicit construction of Markov partitions and will be applied
elsewhere to some non-uniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphisms.
