Artificial fragmentation of the matter density field causes the formation of
spurious groups of particles in N-body simulations of non-standard Dark Matter
(DM) models which are characterized by a small scale cut-off in the linear
matter power spectrum. These spurious halos alter the prediction of the mass
function in a range of masses where differences among DM models are most
relevant to observational tests. Using a suite of high resolution simulations
we show that the contamination of artificial groups of particles significantly
affect the statistics of halo spin, shape and virial state parameters. We find
that spurious halos have systematically larger spin values, are highly
elliptical or prolate and significantly deviate from virial equilibrium. These
characteristics allow us to detect the presence of spurious halos even in
non-standard DM models for which the low-mass end of the mass function remains
well behaved. We show that selecting halos near the virial equilibrium provides
a simple and effective method to remove the bulk of spurious halos from
numerical halo catalogs and consistently recover the halo mass function at low
masses.
