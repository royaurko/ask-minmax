We consider the scale at which gravity becomes strong in linearized General
Relativity coupled to the gauge-Higgs unified(GHU) model. We also discuss the
unitarity of S-matrix in the same framework. The Kaluza-Klein(KK) gauge bosons,
KK scalars and KK fermions in the GHU models can drastically change the strong
gravity scale and the unitarity violation scale. In particular we consider two
models GHU_SM and GHU_MSSM which have the zero modes corresponding to the
particle content of the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model, respectively. We find that the strong gravity scale could be lowered as
much as 10^13 (10^14) GeV in the GHU_SM (GHU_MSSM) for one extra dimension
taking 1 TeV as the compactification scale. It is also shown that these scales
are proportional to the inverse of the number of extra dimensions d. In the
d=10 case, they could be lowered up to 10^5 GeV for both models. We also find
that the maximum compactification scales of extra dimensions quickly converge
into one special scale M_O near Planck scale or equivalently into one common
radius R_0 irrespectively of d as the number of zero modes increases. It may
mean that all extra dimensions emerge with the same radius near Planck scale.
In addition, it is shown that the supersymmetry can help to remove the
discordance between the strong gravity scale and the unitarity violation scale.
