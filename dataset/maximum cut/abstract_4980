The primary objects of study in the ``knot theory of complex plane curves''
are C-links: links (or knots) cut out of a 3-sphere in the complex plane by
complex plane transverse and totally tangential. Transverse C-links are
naturally oriented. There are many natural classes of examples: links of
singularities; links at infinity; links of divides, free divides, tree divides,
and graph divides; and--most generally--quasipositive links. Totally tangential
C-links are unoriented but naturally framed; they turn out to be precisely the
real-analytic Legendrian links, and can profitably be investigated in terms of
certain closely associated transverse C-links.
  The knot theory of complex plane curves is attractive not only for its own
internal results, but also for its intriguing relationships and interesting
contributions elsewhere in mathematics. Within low-dimensional topology,
related subjects include braids, concordance, polynomial invariants, contact
geometry, fibered links and open books, and Lefschetz pencils. Within
low-dimensional algebraic and analytic geometry, related subjects include
embeddings and injections of the complex line in the complex plane, line
arrangements, Stein surfaces, and Hilbert's 16th problem.
