High transverse momentum neutral pion and charged hadron suppression pattern
with respect to reaction plane at RHIC and LHC energies in central and
semi-peripheral AA collisions are studied in a perturbative QCD based model,
CUJET2.0. CUJET2.0 has dynamical DGLV radiation kernel and Thoma-Gyulassy
elastic energy loss, with both being generalized to including multi-scale
running strong coupling as well as energy loss probability fluctuations, and
the full jet path integration is performed in a low $p_T$ flow data constrained
medium which has 2+1D viscous hydrodynamical expanding profile. We find that in
CUJET2.0, with only one control parameter, $\alpha_{max}$, the maximum coupling
strength, fixed to be 0.26, the computed nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$
in central and semi-peripheral AA collisions are consistent with RHIC and LHC
data at average $\chi^2/d.o.f.<1.5$ level. Simultaneous agreements with high
$p_T$ azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$ data are acquired given average $\alpha_{max}$
over in-plane and out-of-plane paths varying as little as 10\%, suggesting a
non-trivial dependence of the high $p_T$ single particle $v_2$ on the
azimuthally varied strong coupling.
