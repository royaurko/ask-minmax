The Solar and Heliospheric Obseratory/Michelson Doppler Imager--Debrecen Data
(SDD) sunspot catalogue provides an opportunity to study the details and
development of sunspot groups on a large statistical sample. The SDD data
allow, in particular, the differential study of the leading and following parts
with a temporal resolution of 1.5 hours. In this study, we analyse the
equilibrium distance of sunspot groups as well as the evolution of this
distance over the lifetime of the groups and the shifts in longitude associated
with these groups. We also study the asymmetry between the compactness of the
leading and following parts, as well as the time-profiles for the development
of the area of sunspot groups. A logarithmic relationship has been found
between the total area and the distance of leading-following parts of active
regions (ARs) at the time of their maximum area. In the developing phase the
leading part moves forward; this is more noticeable in larger ARs. The leading
part has a higher growth rate than the trailing part in most cases in the
developing phase. The growth rates of the sunspot groups depend linearly on
their maximum total umbral area. There is an asymmetry in compactness: the
number of spots tends to be smaller, while their mean area is larger in the
leading part at the maximum phase.
