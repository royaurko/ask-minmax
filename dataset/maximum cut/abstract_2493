We describe an application of generalised unitarity to the computation of
one-loop amplitudes with massive external fermions. We present analytic results
for the cut-constructible parts of the leading colour contributions to the
all-plus helicity configuration of the $t\bar{t}gg$ amplitude. Using a special
choice for the helicity basis of the massive fermions we are able to obtain
extremely compact analytic expressions. In particular we describe how one can
fix the divergent contributions from tadpole and wave-function renormalisation
using universal UV and IR behaviour.
