We consider the maximum process of a random walk with additive independent
noise in form of $\max_{i=1,\dots,n}(S_i+Y_i)$. The random walk may have
dependent increments, but its sample path is assumed to converge weakly to a
fractional Brownian motion. When the largest noise has the same order as the
maximal displacement of the random walk, we establish an invariance principle
for the maximum process in the Skorohod topology. The limiting process is the
maximum process of the fractional Brownian notion with shot noise generated by
Poisson point processes.
