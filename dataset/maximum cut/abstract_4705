In this paper we obtain several model structures on {\bf DblCat}, the
category of small double categories. Our model structures have three sources.
We first transfer across a categorification-nerve adjunction. Secondly, we view
double categories as internal categories in {\bf Cat} and take as our weak
equivalences various internal equivalences defined via Grothendieck topologies.
Thirdly, {\bf DblCat} inherits a model structure as a category of algebras over
a 2-monad. Some of these model structures coincide and the different points of
view give us further results about cofibrant replacements and cofibrant
objects. As part of this program we give explicit descriptions and discuss
properties of free double categories, quotient double categories, colimits of
double categories, several nerves, and horizontal categorification.
