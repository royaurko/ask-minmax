An ab-initio pseudopotential calculation using density functional theory
within the local density approximation has been performed to investigate the
electronic properties of TlSe which is of chain-like crystal geometry. The
energy bands and effective masses along high symmetry directions, the density
of states and valence charge density distributions cut through various planes
are presented. The results have been discussed in terms of previously existing
experimental and theoretical data, and comparisons with similar compounds have
been made.
