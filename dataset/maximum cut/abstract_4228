It is shown that direct photons provide a leading twist mechanism for
diffractive jet production in which the jets carry away all of the momentum
lost by the proton. Two-photon processes are thus expected to asymptotically
dominate "super-hard" pomeron events in $ep$ collisions. We report the expected
rates from these events for the recent ZEUS and H1 data cuts. We also estimate
the direct photon contribution to the "super-hard" pomeron events observed by
the CERN UA8 group for $p\bar p$ collisions.
