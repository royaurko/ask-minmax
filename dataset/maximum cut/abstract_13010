We study recent Deeply Virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) data within a dual
parameterization of the Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). This
parameterization allows to quantify the maximum amount of information, that can
be extracted from DVCS data, in a ``quintessence'' function. We present a
``zero step'' model for the latter solely based on the forward quark density,
providing a parameter free prediction for the imaginary part of the DVCS
amplitude. It is shown that the bulk effect of the $e p \to e p \gamma$ beam
helicity asymmetry can be understood within such a model.
