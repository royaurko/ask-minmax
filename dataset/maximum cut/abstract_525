We propose a new connection between maximum-power Curzon-Ahlborn thermal
cycles and maximum-work reversible cycles. This linkage is built through a
mapping between the exponents of a class of heat transfer laws and the
exponents of a family of heat capacities depending on temperature. This
connection leads to the recovery of known results and to a wide and interesting
set of new results for a class of thermal cycles. Among other results we find
that it is possible to use analytically closed expressions for maximum-work
efficiencies to calculate good approaches to maximum-power efficiencies.
