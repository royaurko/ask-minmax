The double-Kerr solution is generated using both a Backlund transformation
and the Belinskii-Zakharov inverse-scattering technique. We build a dictionary
between the parametrisations naturally obtained in the two methods and show
their equivalence. We then focus on the asymptotically flat double-Kerr system
obeying the axis condition which is Z_2^\phi invariant; for this system there
is an exact formula for the force between the two black holes, in terms of
their physical quantities and the coordinate distance. We then show that 1) the
angular velocity of the two black holes decreases from the usual Kerr value at
infinite distance to zero in the touching limit; 2) the extremal limit of the
two black holes is given by |J|=cM^2, where c depends on the distance and
varies from one to infinity as the distance decreases; 3) for sufficiently
large angular momentum the temperature of the black holes attains a maximum at
a certain finite coordinate distance. All of these results are interpreted in
terms of the dragging effects of the system.
