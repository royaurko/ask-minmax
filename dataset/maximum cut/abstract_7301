We have observed a large sample of compact planetary nebulae in the
near-infrared to determine how the 2^1P-2^1S HeI line at 2.058um varies as a
function of stellar effective temperature, Teff. The ratio of this line with HI
Br g at 2.166um has often been used as a measure of the highest Teff present in
a stellar cluster, and hence on whether there is a cut-off in the stellar
initial mass function at high masses. However, recent photoionisation modelling
has revealed that the behaviour of this line is more complex than previously
anticipated. Our work shows that in most aspects the photoionisation models are
correct. In particular, we confirm the weakening of the 2^1P-2^1S as Teff
increases beyond 40000K. However, in many cases the model underpredicts the
observed ratio when we consider the detailed physical conditions in the
individual planetary nebulae. Furthermore, there is evidence that there is
still significant 2^1P-2^1S HeI line emission even in the planetary nebulae
with very hot (Teff>100000K) central stars. It is clear from our work that this
ratio cannot be considered as a reliable measure of effective temperature on
its own.
