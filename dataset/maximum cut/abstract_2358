We investigate a general theory of the Z_2-twisted representations of vertex
operator superalgebras. Certain one-to-one correspondence theorems are
established. We also give an explicit realization of the Ising model SVOA and
its Z_2-twisted modules. As an application, we obtain the Gerald Hoehn's
Babymonster SVOA VB and its Z_2-twisted module VB_{tw} from the moonshine VOA
V^\nat by cutting off the Ising models. It is also shown in this paper that Aut
(VB) is finite.
