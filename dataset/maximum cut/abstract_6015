Let's have $n$ points in the space such that the maximum distance between any
of them is $a$. We prove that there exists a sphere of radius $r \leq a
\frac{\sqrt(6)}{4}$ that contains in its interior or on its surface all these
points. [This is a generalization of Jung's theorem that he designed for a
plane.]
