Measurement of the heavy neutral MSSM Higgs bosons H and A production in the
process gamma gamma --> A, H --> b anti-b at the Photon Linear Collider has
been considered in two independent analyses for the parameter range
corresponding to the so-called "LHC wedge". Significantly different conclusions
were obtained; signal to background ratio 36 vs 2. Here assumptions and results
of these two analyses are compared. We have found that differences in the final
results are mainly due to different assumptions on gamma-gamma-luminosity
spectra, jet definitions and selection cuts.
