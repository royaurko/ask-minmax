The field equations of general relativity are shown to derive from the
existence of a limit force or of a limit power in nature. The limits have the
value of c^4/4G and c^5/4G. The proof makes use of a result by Jacobson. All
known experimental data is consistent with the limits. Applied to the universe,
the limits predict its darkness at night and the observed scale factor. Some
experimental tests of the limits are proposed. The main counter-arguments and
paradoxes are discussed, such as the transformation under boosts, the force
felt at a black hole horizon, the mountain problem, and the contrast to
scalar--tensor theories of gravitation. The resolution of the paradoxes also
clarifies why the maximum force and the maximum power have remained hidden for
so long. The derivation of the field equations shows that the maximum force or
power plays the same role for general relativity as the maximum speed plays for
special relativity.
