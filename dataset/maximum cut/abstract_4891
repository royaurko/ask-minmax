In this paper, systems of linear differential equations with crisp real
coefficients and with initial condition described by a vector of fuzzy numbers
are studied. A new method based on the geometric representations of linear
transformations is proposed to find a solution. The most important difference
between this method and methods offered in previous papers is that the solution
is considered to be a fuzzy set of real vector-functions rather than a fuzzy
vector-function. Each member of the set satisfies the given system with a
certain possibility. It is shown that at any time the solution constitutes a
fuzzy region in the coordinate space, alfa-cuts of which are nested
parallelepipeds. Proposed method is illustrated on examples.
