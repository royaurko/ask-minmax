The results of an observation campaign of V0784 Ophiuchi over a time span of
two years have revealed a multi-periodic Blazhko effect. A Blazhko effect for
V0784 Ophiuchi has not been reported previously. From the observed light
curves, 60 pulsation maxima have been measured. The Fourier analyses of the
(O-C) values and of magnitudes at maximum light have revealed a main Blazhko
period of 24.51 days but also two other secondary Blazhko modulations with
periods of 34.29 and 31.07 days. A complete light curve Fourier analysis with
PERIOD04 has shown triplet structures based on main and secondary Blazhko
frequencies close to the reciprocal of Blazhko periods measured from the 60
pulsation maxima.
