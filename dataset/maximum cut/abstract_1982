Many empirical hurricane economic loss models consider only wind speed and
neglect storm size. These models may be inadequate in accurately predicting the
losses of super-sized storms, such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In this study,
we examined the dependencies of normalized U.S. hurricane loss on both wind
speed and storm size for 73 tropical cyclones that made landfall in the U.S.
from 1988 to 2012. A multi-variate least squares regression is used to
construct a hurricane loss model using both wind speed and size as predictors.
Using maximum wind speed and size together captures more variance of losses
than using wind speed or size alone. It is found that normalized hurricane loss
(L) approximately follows a power law relation with maximum wind speed (Vmax)
and size (R). Assuming L=10^c Vmax^a R^b, c being a scaling factor, the
coefficients, a and b, generally range between 4-12 and 2-4, respectively. Both
a and b tend to increase with stronger wind speed. For large losses, a weighted
regression model, with a being 4.28 and b being 2.52, produces a reasonable
fitting to the actual losses. Hurricane Sandy's size was about 3.4 times of the
average size of the 73 storms analyzed. Based on the weighted regression model,
Hurricane Sandy's loss would be 21 times smaller if its size were of the
average size with maximum wind speed unchanged. It is important to revise
conventional empirical hurricane loss models to include both maximum wind speed
and size as predictors.
