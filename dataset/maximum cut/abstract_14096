Influence of applied in-plane elastic strains on the static magnetic
configuration of a 530 nm magnetostrictive FeCuNbSiB thin film. The in-plane
strains are induced via the application of a voltage to a piezoelectric
actuator on which the film/substrate system was glued. A quantitative
characterization of the voltage dependence of the induced-strain at the surface
of the film was performed using a digital image correlation technique. MFM
images at remanence (H=0 Oe and U=0 V) clearly reveal the presence of weak
stripe domains. The effect of the voltage-induced strain shows the existence of
a threshold value above, which the break of the stripe configuration set in.
For a maximum strain of exx~0.5*10-3 we succeed in destabilizing the stripes
configuration helping the setting up of a complete homogeneous magnetic
pattern.
