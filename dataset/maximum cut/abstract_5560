Tennessee is one of the 26 lead state partners that volunteered to provide
leadership and guidance to states for the purpose of adoption of Next
Generation Science Standards (NGSS. As stated in the Tennessee Vision for STEM
Education (2009), "Tennessee recognizes the importance of science and aims to
commit to this understanding by becoming involved in the development, and
eventual adoption and implementation of NGSS." The present study correlates the
Tennessee State Science Standards to the NGSS for High School Biology/ Life
Sciences and examines the need for a dynamic set of standards that teach the
technical skills and critical thinking needed in these scientific fields. The
NGSS addresses a move from dated scientific quandaries and proposes standards
supported by cutting edge scientific research and literature. Partnerships
between scientists and educators allow for the information exchange necessary
to implement the changes in scientific research in K-12 instruction.
Professional development opportunities that include direct partnerships with
scientists foster the continued understanding and skills required to teach
science.
