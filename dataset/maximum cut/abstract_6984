Radio detection of cosmic-ray-induced air showers has come to a flight the
last decade. Along with the experimental efforts, several theoretical models
were developed. The main radio-emission mechanisms are established to be the
geomagnetic emission due to deflection of electrons and positrons in Earth's
magnetic field and the charge-excess emission due to a net electron excess in
the air shower front. It was only recently shown that Cherenkov effects play an
important role in the radio emission from air showers. In this article we show
the importance of these effects to extract quantitatively the position of the
shower maximum from the radio signal, which is a sensitive measure for the mass
of the initial cosmic ray. We also show that the relative magnitude of the
charge-excess and geomagnetic emission changes considerably at small observer
distances where Cherenkov effects apply.
