Exact one-dimensional solutions to the equations of fluid dynamics are
derived in the large-Pr and small-Pr limits (where Pr is the Prandtl number).
The solutions are analogous to the Pr = 3/4 solution discovered by Becker and
analytically capture the profile of shock fronts in ideal gases. The large-Pr
solution is very similar to Becker's solution, differing only by a scale
factor. The small-Pr solution is qualitatively different, with an embedded
isothermal shock occurring above a critical Mach number. Solutions are derived
for constant viscosity and conductivity as well as for the case in which
conduction is provided by a radiation field. For a completely general density-
and temperature-dependent viscosity and conductivity, the system of equations
in all three limits can be reduced to quadrature. The maximum error in the
analytical solutions when compared to a numerical integration of the finite-Pr
equations is O(1/Pr) for large Pr and O(Pr) for small Pr.
