The biggest challenge in hybrid systems verification is the handling of
differential equations. Because computable closed-form solutions only exist for
very simple differential equations, proof certificates have been proposed for
more scalable verification. Search procedures for these proof certificates are
still rather ad-hoc, though, because the problem structure is only understood
poorly. We investigate differential invariants, which define an induction
principle for differential equations and which can be checked for invariance
along a differential equation just by using their differential structure,
without having to solve them. We study the structural properties of
differential invariants. To analyze trade-offs for proof search complexity, we
identify more than a dozen relations between several classes of differential
invariants and compare their deductive power. As our main results, we analyze
the deductive power of differential cuts and the deductive power of
differential invariants with auxiliary differential variables. We refute the
differential cut elimination hypothesis and show that, unlike standard cuts,
differential cuts are fundamental proof principles that strictly increase the
deductive power. We also prove that the deductive power increases further when
adding auxiliary differential variables to the dynamics.
