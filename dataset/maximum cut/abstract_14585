ZnO nanowires have an enormous potential for applications as ultra-violet
(UV) photodetectors. Their mechanism of photocurrent generation is intimately
related with the presence of surface states where considerable efforts, such as
surface chemical modifications, have been pursued to improve their
photodetection capabilities. In this work, we report a step further in this
direction demonstrating that the photosensitivity and quality factor (Q factor)
of the photodetector are entirely tunable by an applied gate voltage. This
mechanism enables UV photodetection selectivity ranging from wavelengths from
tens of nanometers (full width at half maximum - FWHM) down to a narrow
detection of 3 nm. Such control paves the way for novel applications,
especially related to the detection of elements that have very sharp
luminescence.
