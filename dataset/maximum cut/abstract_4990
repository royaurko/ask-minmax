In this publication we present an extension of the Standard Model within the
framework of Connes' noncommutative geometry [1]. The model presented here is
based on a minimal spectral triple [7] which contains the Standard Model
particles, new vectorlike fermions and a new U(1) gauge subgroup. Additionally
a new complex scalar field appears that couples to the right-handed neutrino,
the new fermions and the standard Higgs particle. The bosonic part of the
action is given by the spectral action [1] which also determines relations
among the gauge couplings, the quartic scalar couplings and the Yukawa
couplings at a cut-off energy of ca. 10^(17) GeV. We investigate the
renormalisation group flow of these relations. The low energy behaviour allows
to constrain the Higgs mass, the mass of the new scalar and the mixing between
these two scalar fields.
