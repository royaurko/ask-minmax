The study of the distintive signatures of the ultra high energy events
recently seen by IceCube can allow to single the neutrino origin out. The
detection of tau neutrinos would be a clear way to prove that they come from
cosmic distances, but at the highest energies currently seen, about 1 PeV, an
experimental characterization of tau events is difficult. The study of the
fraction of the muon tracks seems more promising. In fact, for any initial
composition, because of the occurrence of flavor oscillations and despite their
uncertainties, the fraction of muon tracks in the cosmic neutrinos is smaller
than the one of atmospheric neutrinos, even hypothesizing an arbitrarily large
contribution from charmed mesons. A good understanding of the detection
efficiencies and the optimization of the analysis cuts, along with a reasonable
increase in the statistics, should provide us with a significant test of the
cosmic origin of these events.
