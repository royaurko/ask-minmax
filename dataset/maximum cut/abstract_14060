We consider error estimates in weak parametrised norms for stabilized finite
element approximations of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes' equations. These
weak norms can be related to the norms of certain filtered quantities, where
the parameter of the norm, relates to the filter width. Under the assumption of
the existence of a certain decomposition of the solution, into large eddies and
fine scale fluctuations, the constants of the estimates are proven to be
independent of both the Reynolds number and the Sobolev norm of the exact
solution. Instead they exhibit exponential growth with a coefficient
proportional to the maximum gradient of the large eddies. The error estimates
are on a posteriori form, but using Sobolev injections valid on finite element
spaces and the properties of the stabilization operators the residuals may be
upper bounded uniformly, leading to robust a priori error estimates.
