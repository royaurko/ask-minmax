We examine the reversible adsorption of hard spheres on a random site surface
in which the adsorption sites are uniformly and randomly distributed on a
plane. Each site can be occupied by one solute provided that the nearest
occupied site is at least one diameter away. We use a numerical method to
obtain the adsorption isotherm, i.e. the number of adsorbed particles as a
function of the bulk activity. The maximum coverage is obtained in the limit of
infinite activity and is known exactly in the limits of low and high site
density. An approximate theory for the adsorption isotherms, valid at low site
density, is developed by using a cluster expansion of the grand canonical
partition function. This requires as input the number of clusters of adsorption
site of a given size. The theory is accurate for the entire range of activity
as long as the site density is less than about 0.3 sites per particle area. We
also discuss a connection between this model and the vertex cover problem.
