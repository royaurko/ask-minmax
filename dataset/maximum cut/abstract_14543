In this paper we present a fast and efficient method to find partial weight
enumerator (PWE) for binary linear block codes by using the error impulse
technique and Monte Carlo method. This PWE can be used to compute an upper
bound of the error probability for the soft decision maximum likelihood decoder
(MLD). As application of this method we give partial weight enumerators and
analytical performances of the BCH(130,66), BCH(103,47) and BCH(111,55)
shortened codes; the first code is obtained by shortening the binary primitive
BCH (255,191,17) code and the two other codes are obtained by shortening the
binary primitive BCH(127,71,19) code. The weight distributions of these three
codes are unknown at our knowledge.
