Gamma Ray Burst sources are apparently evolving around us in a harder and
brighter samples at far and far redshift. The average output may range from a
near Supernova (nearest events) output to a billion time that power for most
distant events. Such a tuned evolution around us is not an anti-copernican
signature. It is a clear imprint of a off-axis (nearest sources) beaming versus
a rarest in-axis blazing (far redshift sources) by a thin relativistic beam
(Lorentz factor up ten thousand or above, corresponding to micro-nano steradian
solid angle). The main consequence is the rarer and rarer presences of hardest
gamma events (hundreds MeV, GeVs, tens GeVs), nearly one over a twenty,
partially opaque by IR-gamma cut-off, observed with difficulty at largest
redshift inside their thinner beamed jets. For this reason these rarest tens
GeV beamed events, even observed by EGRET and Fermi, are hardly seen at hundred
GeV by Cherenkov telescope (Magic,Hess,Veritas) on Earth. For the same reason
and because tens GeV neutrino energy is below Icecube thresholds (threshold
above hundreds GeV) we have not been observed yet a neutrino GRB. However if
the GRBs primaries contains tens GeV neutrino traces (at comparable GRB gamma
rate) their presence may rise in few years at Deep Core (a more dense array
inside ICECUBE) detector whose lower threshold, ranges just one or few tens GeV
energy. Moreover the very recent X ray persistent GRB110328, whose
understanding was first associated to a cannibal star AGN eating, but now
evolved to a cannibal AGN feeding beamed jet, it is, more naturally consistent
to our thin jet GRB (by few solar mass compact source, not any AGN) spinning,
precessing and blazing whose geometry is partially aligned and stable (than
other GRBs) to us: its decay law and its average output is fully consistent
with our earliest proposals.
