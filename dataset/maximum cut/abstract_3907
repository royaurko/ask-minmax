Plots of equivalent width (or neutral hydrogen column density) versus impact
parameter (between the galaxy and quasar line of sight) have been used to
support a variety of conclusions about the relationship between galaxies and
Ly\alpha absorbers. I 'observe' my simulated galaxies again (as in Linder 1998
astro-ph/9810162) except using M_B<-18. It is shown that an anticorrelation
between impact parameter and column density can occur largely as a result of
selection effects. The nearest galaxy is likely to be observed at an impact
parameter aro und a few hundred kpc whether it gives rise to absorption or not,
unless a strong absorption line is seen. Thus while it is clear that at least
some stronger (>10^{16} cm^{-2}) absorption lines arise in galaxies, making
such plots does not allow for a meaningful test of the relationship between
galaxies and weaker absorbers. While there is no reason to think that gas
around galaxies should be cut off at any particular column density, other
tests, such as those in which the absorption cross sections of galaxies are
examined for a wide range of galaxy properties, will be needed to establish the
relationship between absorbers and galaxies.
