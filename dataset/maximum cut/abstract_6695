We apply the maximum entropy principle to construct the natural invariant
density and Lyapunov exponent of one-dimensional chaotic maps. Using a novel
function reconstruction technique that is based on the solution of Hausdorff
moment problem via maximizing Shannon entropy, we estimate the invariant
density and the Lyapunov exponent of nonlinear maps in one-dimension from a
knowledge of finite number of moments. The accuracy and the stability of the
algorithm are illustrated by comparing our results to a number of nonlinear
maps for which the exact analytical results are available. Furthermore, we also
consider a very complex example for which no exact analytical result for
invariant density is available. A comparison of our results to those available
in the literature is also discussed.
