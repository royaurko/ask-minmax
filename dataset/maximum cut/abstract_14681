We derive the expression of the reference distribution function for
magnetically confined plasmas far from the thermodynamic equilibrium. The local
equilibrium state is fixed by imposing the minimum entropy production theorem
and the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle, subject to scale invariance
restrictions. After a short time, the plasma reaches a state close to the local
equilibrium. This state is referred to as the reference state. The aim of this
letter is to determine the reference distribution function (RDF) when the local
equilibrium state is defined by the above mentioned principles. We prove that
the RDF is the stationary solution of a generic family of stochastic processes
corresponding to an universal Landau-type equation with white parametric noise.
As an example of application, we consider a simple, fully ionized, magnetically
confined plasmas, with auxiliary Ohmic heating. The free parameters are linked
to the transport coefficients of the magnetically confined plasmas, by the
kinetic theory.
