We present simulations of magneto-acoustic wave propagation in a magnetic,
plane-parallel stratified solar model atmosphere, employing the CO5BOLD-code.
The tests are carried out for two models of the solar atmosphere, which are
similar to the ones used by Cally (2007) and Schunker & Cally (2006). The two
models differ only in the orientation of the magnetic field. A qualitative
comparison shows good agreement between the numerical results and the results
from ray theory. The tests are done in view of the application of the present
numerical code for the computation of energy fluxes of propagating acoustic
waves into a dynamically evolving magnetic solar atmosphere. For this, we
consider waves with frequencies above the acoustic cut-off frequency.
