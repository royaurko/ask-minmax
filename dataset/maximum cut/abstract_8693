We show that the ratio of different structure functions have a maximum which
depends on $x_B$ and $A$. We argue that these maxima are proportional to the
saturation scale. The analysis of leading and higher twist contributions for
different observables is given with the aim of determining the kinematic region
where high parton density effects could be seen experimentally.
