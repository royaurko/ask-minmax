We have analysed oscillations of the red giant star HD 186355 observed by the
NASA Kepler satellite. The data consist of the first five quarters of science
operations of Kepler, which cover about 13 months. The high-precision
time-series data allow us to accurately extract the oscillation frequencies
from the power spectrum. We find the frequency of the maximum oscillation
power, {\nu}_max, and the mean large frequency separation, {\Delta}{\nu}, are
around 106 and 9.4 {\mu}Hz respectively. A regular pattern of radial and
non-radial oscillation modes is identified by stacking the power spectra in an
echelle diagram. We use the scaling relations of {\Delta}{\nu} and {\nu}_max to
estimate the preliminary asteroseismic mass, which is confirmed with the
modelling result (M = 1.45 \pm 0.05 M_sun) using the Yale Rotating stellar
Evolution Code (YREC7). In addition, we constrain the effective temperature,
luminosity and radius from comparisons between observational constraints and
models. A number of mixed l = 1 modes are also detected and taken into account
in our model comparisons. We find a mean observational period spacing for these
mixed modes of about 58 s, suggesting that this red giant branch star is in the
shell hydrogen-burning phase.
