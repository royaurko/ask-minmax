An edge-operation on a graph $G$ is defined to be either the deletion of an
existing edge or the addition of a nonexisting edge. Given a family of graphs
$\cG$, the editing distance from $G$ to $\cG$ is the smallest number of
edge-operations needed to modify $G$ into a graph from $\cG$. In this paper, we
fix a graph $H$ and consider $\Forb(n,H)$, the set of all graphs on $n$
vertices that have no induced copy of $H$. We provide bounds for the maximum
over all $n$-vertex graphs $G$ of the editing distance from $G$ to
$\Forb(n,H)$, using an invariant we call the {\it binary chromatic number} of
the graph $H$. We give asymptotically tight bounds for that distance when $H$
is self-complementary and exact results for several small graphs $H$.
