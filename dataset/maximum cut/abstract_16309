This paper reports muon spin relaxation (MuSR) measurements of two single
crystals of the title high-Tc cuprate systems where static incommensurate
magnetism and superconductivity coexist. By zero-field MuSR measurements and
subsequent analyses with simulations, we show that (1) the maximum ordered Cu
moment size (0.36 Bohr magneton) and local spin structure are identical to
those in prototypical stripe spin systems with the 1/8 hole concentration; (2)
the static magnetism is confined to less than a half of the volume of the
sample, and (3) regions with static magnetism form nano-scale islands with the
size comparable to the in-plane superconducting coherence length. By
transverse-field MuSR measurements, we show that Tc of these systems is related
to the superfluid density, in the same way as observed in cuprate systems
without static magnetism. We discuss a heuristic model involving percolation of
these nanoscale islands with static magnetism as a possible picture to
reconcile heterogeneity found by the present MuSR study and long-range spin
correlations found by neutron scattering.
