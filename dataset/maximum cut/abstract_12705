Marginally unstable Holmboe modes for smooth density and velocity profiles
are studied. For a large family of flows and stratification that exhibit
Holmboe instability, we show that the modes with phase velocity equal to the
maximum or the minimum velocity of the shear are marginally unstable. This
allows us to determine the critical value of the control parameter R
(expressing the ratio of the velocity variation length scale to the density
variation length scale) that Holmboe instability appears R=2. We then examine
systems for which the parameter R is very close to this critical value. For
this case we derive an analytical expression for the dispersion relation of the
complex phase speed c(k) in the unstable region. The growth rate and the width
of the region of unstable wave numbers has a very strong (exponential)
dependence on the deviation of R from the critical value. Two specific examples
are examined and the implications of the results are discussed.
