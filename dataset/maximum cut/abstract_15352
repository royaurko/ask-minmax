Sliding window is one direct way to extend a successful recognition system to
handle the more challenging detection problem. While action recognition decides
only whether or not an action is present in a pre-segmented video sequence,
action detection identifies the time interval where the action occurred in an
unsegmented video stream. Sliding window approaches for action detection can
however be slow as they maximize a classifier score over all possible
sub-intervals. Even though new schemes utilize dynamic programming to speed up
the search for the optimal sub-interval, they require offline processing on the
whole video sequence. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for online
action detection based on 3D skeleton sequences extracted from depth data. It
identifies the sub-interval with the maximum classifier score in linear time.
Furthermore, it is invariant to temporal scale variations and is suitable for
real-time applications with low latency.
