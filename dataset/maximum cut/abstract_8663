The probability of destruction of a metastable vacuum state by the field of a
highly virtual particle with energy $E$ is calculated for a (3+1) dimensional
theory in the leading WKB approximation in the thin-wall limit. It is found
that the induced nucleation rate of bubbles, capable of expansion, is
exponentially small at any energy. The negative exponential power in the rate
reaches its maximum at the energy, corresponding to the top of the barrier in
the bubble energy, where it is a finite fraction of the same power in the
probability of the spontaneous decay of the false vacuum, i.e. at $E=0$.
