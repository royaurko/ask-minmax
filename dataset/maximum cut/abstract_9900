We prove parabolic Harnack inequalities on fractal-like metric measure
Dirichlet spaces that satisfy the volume doubling condition, the strong
Poincare inequality, and a cutoff Sobolev inequality. We show that the
parabolic Moser iteration method can be applied to obtain a parabolic Harnack
inequality for non-negative weak solutions of the heat equation associated with
a family of time-dependent non-symmetric local bilinear forms that are, in a
certain sense, controlled by a strongly local regular symmetric Dirichlet form.
In particular, we prove the local boundedness of local weak solutions. As
applications, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the associated heat kernel or
propagator, under local assumptions on the space. Further results include a
weighted Poincare inequality and a parabolic maximum principle.
