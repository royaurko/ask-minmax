We study experimentally the slow growth of a single crack in a fibrous
material and observe stepwise growth dynamics. We model the material as a
lattice where the crack is pinned by elastic traps and grows due to thermally
activated stress fluctuations. In agreement with experimental data we find that
the distribution of step sizes follows sub-critical point statistics with a
power law (exponent 3/2) and a stress-dependent exponential cut-off diverging
at the critical rupture threshold.
