We present results on the bottomonium spectrum at temperatures above and
below the deconfinement crossover temperature, $T_c$, from dynamical lattice
QCD simulations. The heavy quark is treated with a non-relativistic effective
field theory on the lattice and serves as a probe of the hot medium. Ensembles
with a finer spatial lattice spacing and a greater range of temperatures below
$T_c$ than those previously employed by this collaboration are used. In
addition, there are $N_f=2+1$ flavours of Wilson clover quark in the sea with
$M_\pi\approx400$ MeV and we perform a more careful tuning of the bottom quark
mass in this work. We calculate the spectral functions of S and P wave
bottomonium states using the maximum entropy method and confirm earlier
findings on the survival of the ground state S wave states up to at least
$2T_c$ and the immediate dissociation of the P wave states above $T_c$.
