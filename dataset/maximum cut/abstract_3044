This paper describes a partial parser that assigns syntactic structures to
sequences of part-of-speech tags. The program uses the maximum entropy
parameter estimation method, which allows a flexible combination of different
knowledge sources: the hierarchical structure, parts of speech and phrasal
categories. In effect, the parser goes beyond simple bracketing and recognises
even fairly complex structures. We give accuracy figures for different
applications of the parser.
