We report the results of a $^{45}$Sc nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study
on the quasi-one-dimensional compound Cu$_2$Sc$_2$Ge$_4$O$_{13}$ at
temperatures between 4 and 300 K. This material has been a subject of current
interest due to indications of spin gap behavior. The temperature-dependent NMR
shift exhibits a character of low-dimensional magnetism with a negative broad
maximum at $T_{max}$ $\simeq $ 170 K. Below $% T_{max}$, the NMR shifts and
spin lattice relaxation rates clearly indicate activated responses, confirming
the existence of a spin gap in Cu$_2$Sc$_2$Ge% $_4$O$_{13}$. The experimental
NMR data can be well fitted to the spin dimer model, yielding a spin gap value
of about 275 K which is close to the 25 meV peak found in the inelastic neutron
scattering measurement. A detailed analysis further points out that the nearly
isolated dimer picture is proper for the understanding of spin gap nature in
Cu$_2$Sc$_2$Ge$_4$O$_{13}$.
