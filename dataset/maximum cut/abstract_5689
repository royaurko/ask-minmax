Dark Energy models are here investigated and studied in the framework of the
Chern-Simons modified gravity model. We bring into focus the Holographic Dark
Energy (HDE) model with Granda-Oliveros cut-off, the Modified Holographic Ricci
Dark Energy (MHRDE) model and, moreover, a model with higher derivatives of the
Hubble parameter as well. The relevant expressions of the scale factor a(t) for
a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe are derived and studied, and in this
context, the evolution of the scale factor is shown to be similar to that one
displayed by the modified Chaplygin gas in two of the above models.
