The Modified dynamics (MOND) has been propounded as an alternative to Dark
matter. It imputes the mass discrepancy in galaxy systems to failure of
standard dynamics in the limit of small accelerations. After a brief
description of the MOND tenets, I discuss how its predictions now compare with
the data. I put special emphasis on rotation-curve analysis--whence comes the
most clear-cut support for MOND, and on the cores of rich x-ray clusters, where
MOND does not yet explain away the mass discrepancy. I then outline the MOND
program, especially work still left to do. This is followed by general comments
on cosmology and structure formation in MOND. I conclude with some incomplete
thoughts on the possible origin of MOND (as an effective theory); in particular
on the possibility that it comes about as a vacuum effect.
