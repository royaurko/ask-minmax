This paper studies the decoding capabilities of maximum distance profile
(MDP) convolutional codes over the erasure channel and compares them with the
decoding capabilities of MDS block codes over the same channel. The erasure
channel involving large alphabets is an important practical channel model when
studying packet transmissions over a network, e.g, the Internet.
