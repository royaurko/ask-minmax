Recently synthesis of superheavy nuclei has been achieved in hot fusion
reactions. A systematic theoretical calculation of alpha decay half-lives in
this region of the periodic system, may be useful in the identification of new
nuclei in these type of reactions. Alpha decay half-lives are obtained in the
framework of the barrier penetration theory, built with the use of proximity
and Coulomb forces. It is estimated from a classical viewpoint, a possible
angular momentum maximum value for odd and odd-odd nuclei alpha particles. The
masses of the nuclei are obtained from a macro-microscopic model, with the use
of the two center shell model. Decay half-lives are compared with experimental
results.
