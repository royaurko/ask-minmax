Takeuti and Titani have introduced and investigated a logic they called
intuitionistic fuzzy logic. This logic is characterized as the first-order
Goedel logic based on the truth value set [0,1]. The logic is known to be
axiomatizable, but no deduction system amenable to proof-theoretic, and hence,
computational treatment, has been known. Such a system is presented here, based
on previous work on hypersequent calculi for propositional Goedel logics by
Avron. It is shown that the system is sound and complete, and allows
cut-elimination. A question by Takano regarding the eliminability of the
Takeuti-Titani density rule is answered affirmatively.
