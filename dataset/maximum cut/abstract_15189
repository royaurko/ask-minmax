This paper presents a generalization of the $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed model
when multiple antennas are present at both the transmitter and receiver sides,
i.e, for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scenario. Using multivariate
statistical theory, the MIMO $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed model is defined. Its
probability density function (pdf) can be expressed in terms of the well-known
gamma-Wishart distribution and the moment generating function is carried out
from it. Closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function (cdf)
and the pdf of the maximum eigenvalue are derived. Like the single-input
single-output (SISO) model present in the literature, the MIMO $\kappa$-$\mu$
shadowed model allows the unification of some MIMO stochastic channels. In
fact, the MIMO Rayleigh, MIMO Nakagami-$m$, MIMO Rician, MIMO $\kappa$-$\mu$
and MIMO Rician-Shadowed models can be derived from it, and so their SISO
counterparts, i.e, the Rayleigh, Nakagami-$m$, Rician, $\kappa$-$\mu$ and
Rician-Shadowed, respectively.
