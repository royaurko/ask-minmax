The discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson is possible when experimental
cuts are applied which increase the ratio of signal and background
cross-sections. We present a study of the pp->H->WW signal cross-section at
hadron colliders which requires a selection of Higgs bosons with small
transverse momentum. We compare predictions for the efficiency of the
experimental cuts from a NNLO QCD calculation and the event generator MC@NLO
and are able to predict a reliable number for the cross-section after the
aplpication of such experimental cuts.
