We present extensive optical observations of the normal Type Ic supernova
(SN) 2007gr, spanning from about one week before maximum light to more than one
year thereafter. The optical light and color curves of SN 2007gr are very
similar to those of the broad-lined Type Ic SN 2002ap, but the spectra show
remarkable differences. The optical spectra of SN 2007gr are characterized by
unusually narrow lines, prominent carbon lines, and slow evolution of the line
velocity after maximum light. The earliest spectrum (taken at t=-8 days) shows
a possible signature of helium (He~I 5876 at a velocity of ~19,000 km s{-1}).
Moreover, the larger intensity ratio of the [O I] 6300 and 6364 lines inferred
from the early nebular spectra implies a lower opacity of the ejecta shortly
after the explosion. These results indicate that SN 2007gr perhaps underwent a
less energetic explosion of a smaller-mass Wolf-Rayet star (~ 8--9 Msun) in a
binary system, as favored by an analysis of the progenitor environment through
pre-explosion and post-explosion Hubble Space Telescope images. In the nebular
spectra, asymmetric double-peaked profiles can be seen in the [O~I] 6300 and
Mg~I] 4571 lines. We suggest that the two peaks are contributed by the
blueshifted and rest-frame components. The similarity in velocity structure and
the different evolution of the strength of the two components favor an
aspherical explosion with the ejecta distributed in a torus or disk-like
geometry, but inside the ejecta the O and Mg have different distributions.
