In this paper, we report an alternative approach of implementing a Schottky
collector bipolar transistor without doping the ultrathin SOI film. Using
different metal work function electrodes, the electrons and holes are induced
in an intrinsic silicon film to create the n emitter and the p base regions,
respectively. Using two-dimensional device simulation, the performance of the
proposed device has been evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the charge
plasma based bipolar transistor with Schottky collector exhibits a high current
gain and a better cut-off frequency compared to its conventional counterpart.
