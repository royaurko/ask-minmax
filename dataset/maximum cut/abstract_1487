Clustering a graph means identifying internally dense subgraphs which are
only sparsely interconnected. Formalizations of this notion lead to measures
that quantify the quality of a clustering and to algorithms that actually find
clusterings. Since, most generally, corresponding optimization problems are
hard, heuristic clustering algorithms are used in practice, or other approaches
which are not based on an objective function. In this work we conduct a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the qualitative behavior of greedy
bottom-up heuristics driven by cut-based objectives and constrained by
intracluster density, using both real-world data and artificial instances. Our
study documents that a greedy strategy based on local movement is superior to
one based on merging. We further reveal that the former approach generally
outperforms alternative setups and reference algorithms from the literature in
terms of its own objective, while a modularity-based algorithm competes
surprisingly well. Finally, we exhibit which combinations of cut-based inter-
and intracluster measures are suitable for identifying a hidden reference
clustering in synthetic random graphs.
