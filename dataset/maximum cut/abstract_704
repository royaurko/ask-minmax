In this article we obtain an explicit formula in terms of the partitions of
the positive integer $n$ to express the $n$-th term of a wide class of
sequences of numbers defined by recursion. Our proof is based only on
arithmetics. We compare our result with similar formulas obtained with
different approaches already in the XIX century. Examples are given for
Bernoulli, Euler and Fibonacci numbers.
