We present a simple and scalable technique for the fabrication of solution
processed & local gated carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNT-FETs).
The approach is based on directed assembly of individual single wall carbon
nanotube from dichloroethane via AC dielectrophoresis (DEP) onto pre-patterned
source and drain electrodes with a local aluminum gate in the middle.
Local-gated CNT-FET devices display superior performance compared to global
back gate with on-off ratios 10^4 and maximum subthreshold swings of 170
mV/dec. The local bottom-gated DEP assembled CNT-FETs will facilitate large
scale fabrication of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible
nanoelectronic devices.
