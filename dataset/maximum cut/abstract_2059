A recent paper showed how to construct a lens that focuses near field
radiation and hence produce resolution unlimited by wavelength. The
prescription requires lossless materials with negative refractive index: finite
loss cuts off the finer details of the image. In this paper we suggest
compensating for losses by introducing optical gain media into the lens design.
Calculations demonstrate a dramatic improvement in performance for a
silver/gain composite medium at optical frequencies.
