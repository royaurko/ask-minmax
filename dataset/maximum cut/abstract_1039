For many natural process of growth, with the growth rate independent of size
due to Gibrat law and with the growth process following a log-normal
distribution, the ratio between the time (D) for maximum value and the time (L)
for maximum growth rate (inflexion point) is then equal to the square root of
the base of the natural logarithm (e^{1/2}). On the logarithm scale this ratio
becomes one half ((1/2)). It remains an open question, due to lack of complete
data for various cases with restricted growth, whether this e^{1/2} ratio can
be stated as e^{1/2}-Law. Two established examples already published, one for
an epidemic spreading and one for droplet production, support however this
ratio. Another example appears to be the height of humain body. For boys the
maximum height occurs near 23 years old while the maximum growth rate is at the
age near 14, and there ratio is close to e^{1/2}. The main theoretical base to
obtain this conclusion is problem independent, provided the growth process is
restricted, such as public intervention to control the spreading of
communicable epidemics, so that an entropy is associated with the process and
the role of dissipation, representing the mechanism of intervention, is
maximized. Under this formulation the principle of maximum rate of entropy
production is used to make the production process problem independent.
