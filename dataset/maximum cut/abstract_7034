As lighting efficiency improves, it is useful to understand the theoretical
limits to luminous efficacy for light that we perceive as white. Independent of
the efficiency with which photons are generated, there exists a
spectrally-imposed limit to the luminous efficacy of any source of photons. We
find that, depending on the acceptable bandpass and---to a lesser extent---the
color temperature of the light, the ideal white light source achieves a
spectral luminous efficacy of 250--370 lm/W. This is consistent with previous
calculations, but here we explore the maximum luminous efficacy as a function
of photopic sensitivity threshold, color temperature, and color rendering
index; deriving peak performance as a function of all three parameters. We also
present example experimental spectra from a variety of light sources,
quantifying the intrinsic efficacy of their spectral distributions.
