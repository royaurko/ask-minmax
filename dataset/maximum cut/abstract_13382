In searches for gravitational waves emitted by known isolated pulsars in data
collected by a detector one can assume that the frequency of the wave, its
spindown parameters, and the position of the source in the sky are known, so
the almost monochromatic gravitational-wave signal we are looking for depends
on at most four parameters: overall amplitude, initial phase, polarization
angle, and inclination angle of the pulsar's rotation axis with respect to the
line of sight. We derive two statistics by means of which one can test whether
data contains such gravitational-wave signal: the $\mathcal{G}$-statistic for
signals which depend on only two unknown parameters (overall amplitude and
initial phase), and the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic for signals depending on all
four parameters. We study, by means of the Fisher matrix, the theoretical
accuracy of the maximum-likelihood estimators of the signal's parameters and we
present the results of the Monte Carlo simulations we performed to test the
accuracy of these estimators.
