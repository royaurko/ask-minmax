The electronic properties of multilayers of strongly correlated models for
cuprate superconductors are investigated using cluster dynamical mean-field
techniques. We focus on combinations of underdoped and overdoped layers and
find that the superconducting order parameter in the overdoped layers is
enhanced by the proximity effect of the strong pairing scale originating from
the underdoped layers. The enhanced order parameter can even exceed the maximum
value in uniform systems. This behavior is well reproduced in slave-boson
mean-field calculations which also find higher transition temperatures than in
the uniform system.
