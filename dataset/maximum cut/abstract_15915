Straightforward physical arguments are used to derive the properties of
Lyman-alpha forest absorbers. It is shown that many aspects of the current
physical picture of the forest, in particular the fact that the absorption
arises in extended structures of moderate overdensities which contain a large
fraction of the baryons in the universe, can be derived directly from the
observations without making any specific assumptions about the presence and
distribution of dark matter, the values of the cosmological parameters or the
mechanism for structure formation. The key argument is that along any line of
sight intersecting a gravitationally confined gas cloud, the size of the region
over which the density is of order the maximum density, is typically of order
the local Jeans length. This is true for overdense absorbers, regardless of the
shape of the cloud and regardless of whether the cloud as a whole is in
dynamical equilibrium. The simple analytic model is used to derive the mass
distribution of the photoionized gas directly from the observed column density
distribution. It is demonstrated that the shape of the column density
distribution, in particular the observed deviations from a single power-law,
and its evolution with redshift, reflect the shape of the matter distribution
and can be understood in terms of the growth of structure via gravitational
instability in an expanding universe.
