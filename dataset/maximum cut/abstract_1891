Entropy serves as a central observable which indicates uncertainty in many
chemical, thermodynamical, biological and ecological systems, and the principle
of the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) is widely supported in natural science.
Recently, entropy is employed to describe the social system in which human
subjects are interacted with each other, but the principle of the maximum
entropy has never been reported from this field empirically. By using
laboratory experimental data, we test the uncertainty of strategy type in
various competing environments with two person constant sum $2 \times 2$ game.
Empirical evidence shows that, in this competing game environment, the outcome
of human's decision-making obeys the principle of maximum entropy.
