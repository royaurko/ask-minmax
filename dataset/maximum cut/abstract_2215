Results of our next-to-leading order analytic calculation for longitudinally
polarized photoproduction of heavy quarks are presented. Certain differential
cross sections and the corresponding asymmetries are computed for energy ranges
accessible to CERN and HERA. We argue that determination of the polarized gluon
distribution is possible at both places: at HERA certain acceptance cuts are
necessary.
