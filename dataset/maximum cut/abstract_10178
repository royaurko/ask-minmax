We present a fully sampled map covering the Orion Hot Core and dense
molecular ridge, in the sub-millimeter J=6-5 rotational transition of 13CO, at
0.45 mm with a resolution of 13 arcsec and 0.5 km s^-1. The map covers 3 arc
min by 2arc min . The profile centered on the Hot Core peaks at 8.5 km s^-1 and
has a peak intensity of 40 K, corrected antenna temperature. It shows line
wings from 30 km s^-1 to -20 km s^-1. The map of intensity, integrated from 0
to +18 km s^-1, shows a prominent maximum <5 arcsec from the center of the
Orion Hot Core. The FWHP is 3 arcsec, larger than the regions containing
complex molecules. Single dish measurements of lines from the J=2-1 or J=1-0
transitions of CO isotopes show no such distinct maximum. Correcting for
optical depth 1.5 in the J=6-5 line of 13CO, and assuming that the level
populations are thermalized at 150 K, the beam averaged column density between
0 to +18 km s^-1 is N(13CO )=6.8 10^17 cm^-2 and N(CO)=5.2 10^19 cm-2. When
combined with published dust emission data, the CO/ H2 number ratio is 2
{\cdot} 10^-5, a factor of ~5 lower than the canonical value, 10^-4. For the
Orion South and Orion Ridge region, the column density of CO is <25% of that
found for the Hot Core but CO/H2 ratios are similar. Models of
Photodissociation Regions, PDRs, predict that CO lines from PDRs are only
marginally optically thick. Thus our map traces warm and dense molecular gas
rather than PDRs.
