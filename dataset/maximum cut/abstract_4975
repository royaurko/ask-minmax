We propose a new class of compact integrated optical circulators providing a
large isolation level while maintaining a straightforward technological
feasibility. Their layout is based on a nonreciprocal radial Bragg cavity
composed of concentric magneto-optical rings. The circulator ports are standard
rib waveguides, butt-coupled to the cavity by cutting through its outer rings.
The device is specifically designed for operation in a uniform external
magnetic field. Using a coupled-mode description of the complete
cavity/waveguide-port system, we explore the rich behaviour of cavity
circulators in presence of varying levels of direct port-to-port coupling. We
demonstrate numerically a strongly miniaturized two-dimensional cavity
circulator, with a total footprint of less than $(10\lambda)^2$, achieving a
20-dB isolation level at telecom frequencies over a bandwidth of 130 GHz. The
device is found to be very tolerant with respect to fabrication imperfections.
We finish with an outlook on three-dimensional versions of the proposed
nonreciprocal cavities.
