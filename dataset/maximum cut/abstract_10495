An equation of state of cold nuclear matter with an arbitrary isotopic
composition is studied within a relativistic mean-field approach with hadron
masses and coupling constants depending self-consistently on the scalar
mean-field. All hadron masses decrease universally with the scalar field
growth, whereas meson-nucleon coupling constants can vary differently. More
specifically we focus on two modifications of the KVOR model studied
previously. One extension of the model (KVORcut) demonstrates that the equation
of state stiffens if the increase of the scalar-field magnitude with the
density is bounded from above at some value for baryon densities above the
saturation nuclear density. This can be realized if the nucleon vector-meson
coupling constant changes rapidly as a function of the scalar field slightly
above the desired value. The other version of the model (MKVOR) utilizes a
smaller value of the nucleon effective mass at the nuclear saturation density
and a saturation of the scalar field in the isospin asymmetric matter induced
by a strong variation of the nucleon isovector-meson coupling constant as
function of the scalar field. A possibility of hyperonization of the matter in
neutron star interiors is incorporated. Our equations of state fulfill majority
of known empirical constraints including the pressure-density constraint from
heavy-ion collisions, direct Urca constraint, gravitational-baryon mass
constraint and the constraint on the maximum mass of the neutron stars.
