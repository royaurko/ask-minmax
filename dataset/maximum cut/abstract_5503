This paper is devoted to studying the structure of codimension one singular
holomorphic foliations on $({\mathbb C}^3,0)$ without invariant germs of
analytic surface. We focus on the so-called CH-foliations, that is, foliations
without saddle nodes in two dimensional sections. Considering a reduction of
singularities, we detect the possible existence of "nodal components", which
are a higher dimensional version of the nodal separators in dimension two. If
the foliation is without nodal components, we prove that all the leaves in a
neighborhood of the origin contain at least one germ of analytic curve at the
origin. We also study the structure of nodal components for the case of
"Relatively Isolated CH-foliations" and we show that they cut the dicritical
components or they exit the origin through a non compact invariant curve. This
allows us to give a precise statement of a local version of Brunella's
alternative: if we do not have an invariant surface, all the leaves contain a
germ of analytic curve or it is possible to detect the nodal components in the
generic points of the singular curves before doing the reduction of
singularities.
