As the main tracking detector of BESIII, the drift chamber works for accurate
measurements of the tracking and the momentum of the charged particles decayed
from the reaction of BEPCII e+ and e-. After operation six years, the drift
chamber is suffering from aging problems due to huge beam related background.
The gains of the cells in the first ten layers experience an obvious decrease,
reaching a maximum of about 29% for the first layer cells. Two calculation
methods for the gains change (Bhabha events and accumulated charges with 0.3%
aging ratio for inner chamber cells) get almost the same results. For the
Malter effect encountered by the inner drift chamber in Jan., 2012, about 0.2%
water vapor was added to MDC gas mixture to solve this cathode aging problem.
These results provide an important reference for MDC operation high voltage
setting and the upgrade of the inner drift chamber.
