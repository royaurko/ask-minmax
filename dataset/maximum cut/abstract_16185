The standard solar model was so reliable that it could predict the existence
of the massive neutrino. Helioseismology measurements were so precise that they
could determine the depth of the convection zone. This agreement between theory
and observation was the envy of all astrophysics -- until recently when
sophisticated three-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations of the solar
atmosphere reduced the metal content by a factor of almost two. Antia & Basu
(2005) suggested that a higher value of the solar neon abundance, Ne/O = 0.52,
would resolve this controversy. Drake & Testa (2005) presented strong evidence
in favor of this idea from a sample of 21 Chandra stars with enhanced values of
the neon abundance, Ne/O = 0.41. In this paper, we have analyzed solar active
region spectra from the archive of the Flat Crystal Spectrometer on Solar
Maximum Mission, a NASA mission from the 1980s, as well as full-Sun spectra
from the pioneering days of X-ray astronomy in the 1960s. These data seem
consistent with the standard neon-to-oxygen abundance value, Ne/O = 0.15
(Grevesse & Sauval 1998). If these results prove to be correct, than the
enhanced-neon hypothesis will not resolve the current controversy.
