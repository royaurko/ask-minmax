R-hadrons are massive, meta-stable particles predicted in several Super-
symmetry scenarios. Studies exploring the discovery potential of R-hadrons at
the ATLAS detector have mainly focused on gluino R-hadrons. These studies have
shown that gluino R-hadrons should be discovered in early running of the LHC,
that they are easily isolated by simple cuts and that their mass can be
measured to an accuracy of a few percent.
