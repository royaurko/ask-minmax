Under the assumption that the dijet excess seen by the CDF Collaboration near
150 Gev in Wjj production is due to the lightest technipion of the low-scale
technicolor process $\rho_T \rightarrow W \pi_T$, we study its observability in
LHC detectors with 1--20 inverse femtobarns of data. We describe interesting
new kinematic tests that can provide independent confirmation of this LSTC
hypothesis. We find that cuts similar to those employed by CDF, and recently by
ATLAS, cannot confirm the dijet signal. We propose cuts tailored to the LSTC
hypothesis and its backgrounds at the LHC that may reveal $\rho_T \rightarrow
\ell\nu jj$. Observation of the isospin-related channel $\rho^{pm}_T
\rightarrow Z \pi^{pm}_T \rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^- jj$ and of $\rho^{pm}_T
\rightarrow WZ$ in the three lepton plus neutrino and dilepton plus dijet modes
will be important confirmations of the LSTC interpretation of the CDF signal.
The $Z\pi_T$ channel is experimentally cleaner than $W\pi_T$ and its rate is
known from $W\pi_T$ by phase space. It can be discovered or excluded with the
collider data expected in 2012. The $WZ \rightarrow 3\ell\nu$ channel is
cleanest of all and its rate is determined from $W\pi_T$ and the LSTC parameter
$\sin\chi$. This channel and $WZ \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^- jj$ are discussed as
a function of $\sin\chi$.
