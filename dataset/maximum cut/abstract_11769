We present a numerical scheme for solving the time-independent nonlinear
Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two dimensions describing the Bose-Einstein
condensate of trapped interacting neutral atoms at zero temperature. The trap
potential is taken to be of the harmonic-oscillator type and the interaction
both attractive and repulsive. The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is numerically
integrated consistent with the correct boundary conditions at the origin and in
the asymptotic region. Rapid convergence is obtained in all cases studied. In
the attractive case there is a limit to the maximum number of atoms in the
condensate.
