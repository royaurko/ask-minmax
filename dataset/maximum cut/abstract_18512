This work is part of a systematic X-ray survey of the Taurus star forming
complex with XMM-Newton. We study the time series of all X-ray sources
associated with Taurus members, to statistically characterize their X-ray
variability, and compare the results to those for pre-main sequence stars in
the Orion Nebula Cluster and to expectations arising from a model where all the
X-ray emission is the result of a large number of stochastically occurring
flares. We find that roughly half of the detected X-ray sources show
variability above our sensitivity limit, and in ~ 26 % of the cases this
variability is recognized as flares. Variability is more frequently detected at
hard than at soft energies. The variability statistics of cTTS and wTTS are
undistinguishable, suggesting a common (coronal) origin for their X-ray
emission. We have for the first time applied a rigorous maximum likelihood
method in the analysis of the number distribution of flare energies on pre-main
sequence stars. In its differential form this distribution follows a power-law
with index alpha = 2.4 +- 0.5, in the range typically observed on late-type
stars and the Sun. The flare energy distribution is probably steep enough to
explain the heating of stellar coronae by nano-flares (alpha > 2), albeit
associated with a rather large uncertainty that leaves some doubt on this
conclusion.
