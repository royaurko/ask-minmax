Molecular motors and cytoskeletal filaments mostly work collectively under
opposing forces. This opposing force may be due to cargo carried by motors, or
resistance coming from cell membrane pressing against the cytoskeletal
filaments. Certain recent studies have shown that the collective maximum force
(stall force) generated by multiple cytoskeletal filaments or molecular motors
may not always be just a simple sum of stall force for individual filaments or
motors. To understand this phenomena of excess or deficit collective force
generation, we study a broad class of models of both cytoskeletal filaments and
molecular motors. We argue that the stall force generated by a group of
filaments or motors is additive, i.e., the stall force of N filaments(motors)
is N times the stall force of one filament (motor), when the system is in
equilibrium at stall. Consequently, we show that this additivity typically does
not hold when the system departs from equilibrium at stall. We thus present a
novel and unified understanding of existing models exhibiting such non-
addivity, and generalize our arguments by developing new models that
demonstrate this phenomena. We also propose a quantity similar to thermodynamic
efficiency to provide a simple understanding of deviation from stall-force
additivity for filament and motor collectives.
