The reconstruction and prediction of solar activity is one of the current
problems in dynamo theory and global climate modeling. We estimate the Total
Solar Irradiance for the next hundred years based on the Least Square Support
Vector Machine. We found that the next secular solar minimum will occur between
the years 2003 and 2063 with an average of 1365.4W/m2 close to the Dalton or
Modern minima. We calculate the radiative forcing between the modern maximum
and the 21st century minimum to be -0.1W/m2.
