This paper studies the pair production of the doubly charged Higgs boson of
the left-right symmetric models using multilepton final state in the vector
boson fusion (VBF)-like processes. The study is performed in the framework
consistent with the model's correction to the standard model $\rho_{EW}$
parameter. VBF topological cuts, number of leptons in the final state and $p_T$
cuts on the leptons are found to be effective in suppressing the background.
Significant mass reach can be achieved for exclusion/discovery of the doubly
charge Higgs boson for the upcoming LHC run with a luminosity of
$\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ fb$^{-1}$.
