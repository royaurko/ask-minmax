We show the results of two dimensional general relativistic inviscid and
isothermal hydrodynamical simulations comparing the behavior of co-rotating
(with respect to the black hole rotation) and counter-rotating circumbinary
quasi-Keplerian discs in the post merger phase of a supermassive binary black
hole system. While confirming the spiral shock generation within the disc due
to the combined effects of mass loss and recoil velocity of the black hole, we
find that the maximum luminosity of counter-rotating discs is a factor ~(2-12)
higher than in the co-rotating case, depending on the spin of the black hole.
On the other hand, the luminosity peak happens ~10 days later with respect to
the co-rotating case, for a binary with a total mass M~10^6 M_\odot. Although
the global dynamics of counter-rotating discs in the post merger phase of a
merging event is very similar to that for co-rotating discs, an important
difference has been found. In fact, increasing the spin of the central black
hole produces more luminous co-rotating discs while less luminous
counter-rotating ones.
