We give a definition and derive the equations of motion for the center of
mass and angular momentum of an axially symmetric, isolated system that emits
gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. A central feature of this
formulation is the use of Newman-Unti cuts at null infinity that are generated
by worldlines of the spacetime. We analyze some consequences of the results and
comment on the generalization of this work to general asymptotically flat
spacetimes.
