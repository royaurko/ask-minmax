We show for each positive integer $a$ that, if $\cM$ is a minor-closed class
of matroids not containing all rank-$(a+1)$ uniform matroids, then there exists
an integer $n$ such that either every rank-$r$ matroid in $\cM$ can be covered
by at most $r^n$ sets of rank at most $a$, or $\cM$ contains the
$\GF(q)$-representable matroids for some prime power $q$, and every rank-$r$
matroid in $\cM$ can be covered by at most $r^nq^r$ sets of rank at most $a$.
This determines the maximum density of the matroids in $\cM$ up to a polynomial
factor.
