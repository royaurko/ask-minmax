We study radiative decays of $\Upsilon$ to light quark jets in
nonrelativistic QCD by taking both the color singlet and color octet $b\bar b$
operators into consideration. The cut for quark jet energy and cut for the
angle between two quark jets are introduced. The sensitivity to the soft and
collinear singularities in the loop integrals are greatly reduced by these
cuts. With the jet energy cut of about 1 GeV, and the jet angle cut of about
$36^\circ$, the branching ratio for $\Upsilon\to\gamma q\bar q$ is found to be
$8.2\times 10^{-4}$ from color singlet contributions. The color octet
contributions could be much larger than that of color singlet, depending on the
estimate of the color octet matrix elements. This process may provide a new
test for the color octet mechanism in nonrelativistic QCD.
