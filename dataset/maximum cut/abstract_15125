Measurements of magneto-thermopower (S(H, T)) of interfacial delta doped
LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LTO/STO) heterostructure by an iso-structural
antiferromagnetic perovskite LaCrO$_3$ are reported. The thermoelectric power
of the pure LTO/STO interface at 300 K is $\approx$ 118 $\mu$V/K, but increases
dramatically on $\delta$-doping. The observed linear temperature dependence of
S(T) over the temperature range 100 K to 300 K is in agreement with the theory
of diffusion thermopower of a two-dimensional electron gas. The S(T) displays a
distinct enhancement in the temperature range (T $<$ 100 K) where the sheet
resistance shows a Kondo-type minimum. We attributed this maximum in S(T) to
Kondo scattering of conduction electron by localized impurity spins at the
interface. The suppression of S by a magnetic field, and the isotropic nature
of the suppression in out-of-plane and in-plane field geometries further
strengthen the Kondo model based interpretation of S(H, T).
