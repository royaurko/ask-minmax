I discuss the applicability of classical techniques to the study of the
dynamics of infrared, bosonic fields at the electroweak phase transition. I
present the lattice as a natural means of cutting off hard, nonclassical modes,
and discuss the problem of integrating out the excluded modes perturbatively. I
then apply the classical lattice technique to study the dynamics of the phase
interface (bubble wall) and the generation of Chern-Simons number in each phase
and on the bubble wall.
