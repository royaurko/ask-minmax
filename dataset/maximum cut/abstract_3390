Rapid uniform rotation of newborn neutron stars (protoneutron stars) is
studied for a range of internal temperatures and entropies per baryon predicted
by the existing numerical simulations. Calculations are performed using general
relativistic equations of hydrostatic equilibrium of rotating, axially
symmetric stars. Stability of rotating configurations with respect to mass
shedding and the axially symmetric perturbations is studied. Numerical
calculations are performed for a realistic dense matter equation of state,
under various assumptions concerning neutron star interior (large trapped
lepton number, no trapped lepton number, isentropic, isothermal). For
configurations with baryon mass well below the maximum one for the non-rotating
models, the mass shedding limit depends quite sensitively on the position of
the ``neutrinosphere''. The absolute upper limit on rotation frequency is, to a
good approximation, obtained for the maximum baryon mass of rotating
configurations. Empirical formula for the maximum rotation frequency of
uniformly rotating protoneutron stars is shown to be quite precise; it actually
coincides with that used for cold neutron stars. Evolutionary sequences at
fixed baryon mass and angular momentum, which correspond to evolution of
protoneutron stars into cold neutron stars are studied, and resulting
constraints on the maximum rotation frequency of solitary pulsars are
discussed.
