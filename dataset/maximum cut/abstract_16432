Captures of compact objects (COs) by massive black holes (MBHs) in galactic
nuclei will be an important source for LISA, the space-based gravitational-wave
(GW) detector. However, a large fraction of captures will not be individually
resolvable--either because they are too distant, have unfavorable orientation,
or have too many years to go before final plunge--and so will constitute a
source of ``confusion noise,'' obscuring other types of sources. Here we
estimate the shape and overall magnitude of the spectrum of confusion noise
from CO captures. The overall magnitude depends on the capture rates, which are
rather uncertain, so we present results for a plausible range of rates. We show
that the impact of capture confusion noise on the total LISA noise curve ranges
from insignificant to modest, depending on these rates. Capture rates at the
high end of estimated ranges would raise LISA's overall (effective) noise level
by at most a factor \sim 2. While this slightly elevated noise level would
somewhat decrease LISA's sensitivity to other classes of sources, overall, this
would be a pleasant problem for LISA to have: It would also imply that
detection rates for CO captures were at nearly their maximum possible levels
(given LISA's baseline design). This paper includes several other results that
should be useful in further studies of LISA capture sources, including (i) a
calculation of the total GW energy output from generic inspirals into Kerr
MBHs, and (ii) an approximate GW energy spectrum for a typical capture.
