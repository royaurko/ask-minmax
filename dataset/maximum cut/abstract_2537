In this article we present the cut Fock space approach to the D=d+1=2,
Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Quantum Mechanics (SYMQM). We start by briefly
introducing the main features of the framework. We concentrate on those
properties of the method which make it a convenient set up not only for
numerical calculations but also for analytic computations. In the main part of
the article a sample of results are discussed, namely, analytic and numerical
analysis of the D=2, SYMQM systems with SU(2) and SU(3) gauge symmetry.
