We present a model which contains three Abelian symmetries beyond the
standard model. One is anomalous {\it \` a la} Green-Schwarz, and
family-independent; the other two are family symmetries. All are broken at a
large scale by stringy effects. The model is predictive in the neutrino sector:
large mixing between $\nu_\mu-\nu_\tau$, and {\cal O}$(\lambda^3)$
$\nu_e-\nu_\mu$ mixings. Its natural cut-off is the gauge unification scale,
orders of magnitude below the perturbative string cut-off.
