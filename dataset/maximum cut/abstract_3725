In this paper, we propose to apply the parametrized
maximum-principle-preserving (MPP) flux limiter in [Xiong et. al., JCP, 2013]
to the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for solving the convection-diffusion
equations. The feasibility of applying the MPP flux limiters to the DG solution
of convection-diffusion problem is based on the fact that the cell averages for
the DG solutions are updated in a conservative fashion (by using flux
difference) even in the presence of diffusion terms. The main purpose of this
paper is to address the difficulty of obtaining higher than second order
accuracy while maintaining a discrete maximum principle for the DG method
solving convection diffusion equations. We found that the proposed MPP flux
limiter can be applied to arbitrarily high order DG method. Numerical evidence
is presented to show that the proposed MPP flux limiter method does not
adversely affect the desired high order accuracy, nor does it require
restrictive time steps. Numerical experiments including incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the high order accuracy preserving, the MPP
performance, and the robustness of the proposed method.
