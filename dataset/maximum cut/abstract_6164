It is shown that Josephson coupling in SFS junction due to electron-magnon
interaction remains at a distance, when the usual proximity effect decreases
exponentially. We obtain expression for the Josephson energy, which contain the
parameters of the magnon spectrum and allow to estimate the value of the
maximum superconducting current.
