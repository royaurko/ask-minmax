We study the empirical relation between an astronomical object's angular
momentum $J$ and mass $M$, $J=\beta M^\alpha$, the $J-M$ relation, using N-body
simulations. In particular, we investigate the time evolution of the $J-M$
relation to study how the initial power spectrum and cosmological model affect
this relation, and to test two popular models of its origin - mechanical
equilibrium and tidal torque theory. We find that in the $\Lambda$CDM model,
$\alpha$ starts with a value of $\sim 1.5$ at high redshift $z$, increases
monotonically, and finally reaches $5/3$ near $z=0$, whereas $\beta$ evolves
linearly with time in the beginning, reaches a maximum and decreases, and
stabilizes finally. A three-regime scheme is proposed to understand this newly
observed picture. We show that the tidal torque theory accounts for this time
evolution behaviour in the linear regime, whereas $\alpha=5/3$ comes from the
virial equilibrium of haloes. The $J-M$ relation in the linear regime contains
the information of the power spectrum and cosmological model. The $J-M$
relations for haloes in different environments and with different merging
histories are also investigated to study the effects of a halo's non-linear
evolution. An updated and more complete understanding of the $J-M$ relation is
thus obtained.
