The cause of enhanced acoustic power surrounding active regions, the acoustic
halo, is not as yet understood. We explore the properties of the enhanced
acoustic power observed near disk center from 21 to 27 January 2002, including
AR 9787. We find that (i) there exists a strong correlation of the enhanced
high frequency power with magnetic-field inclination, with greater power in
more horizontal fields, (ii) the frequency of the maximum enhancement increases
along with magnetic field strength, and (iii) the oscillations contributing to
the halos show modal ridges which are shifted to higher wavenumber at constant
frequency in comparison to the ridges of modes in the quiet-Sun.
