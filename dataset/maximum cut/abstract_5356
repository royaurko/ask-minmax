We prove that, if $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is an open bounded starshaped
domain of class $C^2$, the constancy over $\partial \Omega$ of the function
$$\varphi(y) = \int_0^{\lambda(y)} \prod_{j=1}^{n-1}[1-t \kappa_j(y)]\, dt$$
implies that $\Omega$ is a ball. Here $k_j(y)$ and $\lambda(y)$ denote
respectively the principal curvatures and the cut value of a boundary point $y
\in \partial \Omega$. We apply this geometric result to different symmetry
questions for PDE's: an overdetermined system of Monge-Kantorovich type
equations (which can be viewed as the limit as $p \to + \infty$ of Serrin's
symmetry problem for the $p$-Laplacian), and equations in divergence form whose
solutions depend only on the distance from the boundary in some subset of their
domain.
