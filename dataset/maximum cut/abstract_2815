The unique forward LHCb acceptance opens the possibility for performing
precision Standard Model (SM) processes in a kinematical regime beyond the
reach of both ATLAS and CMS experiments. In this article we discuss the
feasibility of performing $W^{\pm}j$ measurements with 14 TeV LHCb data. In
particular, we find that the leptonic asymmetry at high pseudorapidity, with
appropriate cuts on the associated jet, is sensitive to the $d$ quark PDF in a
region of Bjorken $x > 0.5$. We also comment on the impact of fiducial and
normalised cross section measurements.
