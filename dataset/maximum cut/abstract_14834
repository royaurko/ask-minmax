This paper considers the three dimensional Muskat problem in the stable
regime. We obtain a conservation law which provides an $L^2$ maximum principle
for the fluid interface. We also show global in time existence for strong and
weak solutions with initial data controlled by explicit constants. Furthermore
we refine the estimates from our paper \cite{PDPB} to obtain global existence
and uniqueness for strong solutions with larger initial data than we previously
had in 2D. Finally we provide global in time results in critical spaces, giving
solutions with bounded slope and time integrable bounded curvature.
