We propose a phenomenological model, comprising a microscopic \sof model plus
the on-site Hubbard interaction $U$ (``projected \sof model'') to understand
the interrelation between the d-wave-gap modulation observed by recent
angle-resolved photoemission experiments in the insulating antiferromagnet
Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ and the d-wave gap of high-Tc superconducting materials.
The on-site interaction $U$ is important in order to produce a Mott gap of the
correct order of magnitude, which would be absent in an exact \sof theory. The
projected \sof-model explains the gap characteristics, namely both the symmetry
and the different order of magnitude of the gap modulations between the \af and
the \sc phases. Furthermore, it is shown that the projected \sof theory can
provide an explanation for a recent observation [E. Pavarini et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 87, 47003 (2001)], i. e. that the maximum Tc observed in a large variety
of high-Tc cuprates scales with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping matrix
element $t'$.
