We introduce a notion of the Bergman-Shilov (or Shilov) boundary for some
subclasses of upper-semicontinuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space. It
is by definition the smallest closed subset of the given space on which all
functions of that subclass attain their maximum. For certain subclasses with
simple structure one can show the existence and uniqueness of the Shilov
boundary. Then we provide its relation to the set of peak points and establish
Bishop-type theorems. As an application we obtain a generalization of Bychkov's
theorem which gives a geometric characterization of the Shilov boundary for
$q$-plurisubharmonic functions on convex bounded domains. In the case of
bounded pesudoconvex domains with smooth boundary we also show that some parts
of the Shilov boundary for $q$-plurisubharmonic functions are foliated by
$q$-dimensional complex submanifolds.
