We derive a solvable resonant-level type model, to describe an impurity spin
coupled to zero-energy bound states localized at the edge of a one dimensional
d-wave superconductor. This results in a two-channel Kondo effect with a quite
unusual low-temperature thermodynamics. For instance, the local impurity
susceptibility yields a finite maximum at zero temperature (but no
logarithmic-divergence) due to the splitting of the impurity in two Majorana
fermions. Moreover, we make comparisons with the Kondo effect occurring in a
two dimensional d-wave superconductor.
