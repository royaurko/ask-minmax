We calculate Yukawa interactions at one-loop on intersecting D6 branes. We
demonstrate the non-renormalization theorem in supersymmetric configurations,
and show how Yukawa beta functions may be extracted. In addition to the usual
logarithmic running, we find the power-law dependence on the infra-red cut-off
associated with Kaluza-Klein modes. Our results may also be used to evaluate
coupling renormalization in non-supersymmetric cases.
