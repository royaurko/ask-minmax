One of the possible modes suggested for detecting the Higgs particle is
$pp\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow\ell^+\ell^-\nu\bar{\nu}$, where the Higgs appears
as a resonance on a Jacobian background. Unfortunately there are QCD background
processes which mimic the final state and we are obliged to impose stringent
kinematic cuts to remove them. However, in doing so we also remove a
significant fraction of the signal. In this report we suggest a method, based
on examining the distribution of the final state charged leptons, which could
allow us to relax our cuts and thus salvage the signal.
