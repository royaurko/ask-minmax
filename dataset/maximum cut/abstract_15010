Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit(CoSaMP) and Subspace Pursuit(SP) are
popular compressive sensing greedy recovery algorithms. In this letter, we
demonstrate that the CoSaMP algorithm can successfully reconstruct a $K$-sparse
signal from a compressed measurement ${\bf y}={\bf A x}$ by a maximum of $5K$
iterations if the sensing matrix ${\bf A}$ satisfies the Restricted Isometry
Constant (RIC) of $\delta_{4K} < \frac {1}{\sqrt{5}}$ and SP algorithm can
reconstruct within $6K$ iteration when RIC of $\delta_{3K} < \frac
{1}{\sqrt{5}}$ is satisfied. The proposed bound in convergence with respect to
number of iterations shows improvement over the existing bounds for Subspace
Pursuit and provides new results for CoSaMP.
