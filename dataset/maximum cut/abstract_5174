Global-local duality is the equivalence of seemingly different regulators in
eternal inflation. For example, the light-cone time cutoff (a global measure,
which regulates time) makes the same predictions as the causal patch (a local
measure that cuts off space). We show that global-local duality is far more
general. It rests on a redundancy inherent in any global cutoff: at late times,
an attractor regime is reached, characterized by the unlimited exponential
self-reproduction of a certain fundamental region of spacetime. An equivalent
local cutoff can be obtained by restricting to this fundamental region.
  We derive local duals to several global cutoffs of interest. The New Scale
Factor Cutoff is dual to the Short Fat Geodesic, a geodesic of fixed
infinitesimal proper width. Vilenkin's CAH Cutoff is equivalent to the
Hubbletube, whose width is proportional to the local Hubble volume. The famous
youngness problem of the Proper Time Cutoff can be readily understood by
considering its local dual, the Incredible Shrinking Geodesic.
