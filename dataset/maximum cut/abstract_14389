We study Fubini instantons of a self-gravitating scalar field. The Fubini
instanton describes the decay of a vacuum state under tunneling instead of
rolling in the presence of a tachyonic potential. The tunneling occurs from the
maximum of the potential, which is a vacuum state, to any arbitrary state,
belonging to the tunneling without any barrier. We consider two different types
of the tachyonic potential. One has only a quartic term. The other has both the
quartic and quadratic terms. We show that, there exist several kinds of new
O(4)-symmetric Fubini instanton solution, which are possible only if gravity is
taken into account. One type of them has the structure with $Z_2$ symmetry.
This type of the solution is possible only in the de Sitter background. We
discuss on the interpretation of the solutions with $Z_2$ symmetry.
