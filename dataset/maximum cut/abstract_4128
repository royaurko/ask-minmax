New families of exact general relativistic thick disks are constructed using
the ``displace, cut, fill and reflect'' method. A class of functions used to
``fill'' the disks is derived imposing conditions on the first and second
derivatives to generate physically acceptable disks. The analysis of the
function's curvature further restrict the ranges of the free parameters that
allow phisically acceptable disks. Then this class of functions together with
the Schwarzschild metric is employed to construct thick disks in isotropic,
Weyl and Schwarzschild canonical coordinates. In these last coordinates an
additional function must be added to one of the metric coefficients to generate
exact disks. Disks in isotropic and Weyl coordinates satisfy all energy
conditions, but those in Schwarzschild canonical coordinates do not satisfy the
dominant energy condition.
