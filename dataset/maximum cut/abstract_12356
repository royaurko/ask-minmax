Within the QED effective action approach, we study the propagation of
low-frequency light at finite temperature. Starting from a general effective
Lagrangian for slowly varying fields whose structure is solely dictated by
Lorentz covariance and gauge invariance, we derive the light cone condition for
light propagating in a thermalized QED vacuum. As an application, we calculate
the velocity shifts, i.e., refractive indices of the vacuum, induced by
thermalized fermions to one loop. We investigate various temperature domains
and also include a background magnetic field. While low-temperature effects to
one loop are exponentially damped by the electron mass, there exists a maximum
velocity shift of $-\delta v^2_{max}=\alpha/(3\pi)$ in the
intermediate-temperature domain $T\sim m$.
