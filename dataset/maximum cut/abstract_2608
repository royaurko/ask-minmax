Assuming an effective gravitational action with scale dependent coupling
constants, a consistency condition for the local form of the cut-off scale is
derived. The approach is applied to homogeneous cosmology and running couplings
with an ultraviolet fixed point. Within the given approach this allows to
derive bounds on the value of the fixed point.
