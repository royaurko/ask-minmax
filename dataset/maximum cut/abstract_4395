We present a complete calculation of weak boson fusion production of
colorless supersymmetric particles at the LHC, using the new matrix element
generator SUSY-MadGraph. The cross sections are small, generally at the
attobarn level, with a few notable exceptions which might provide additional
supersymmetric parameter measurements. We discuss in detail how to consistently
define supersymmetric weak couplings to preserve unitarity of weak gauge boson
scattering amplitudes to fermions, and derive sum rules for weak supersymmetric
couplings.
