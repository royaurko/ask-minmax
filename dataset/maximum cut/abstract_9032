We present a protocol for error characterization and its experimental
implementation with 4 qubits in liquid state NMR. The method is designed to
retrieve information about spatial correlations and scales as $O(n^w)$, where
$w$ is the maximum number of qubits that have non-negligible interaction. We
discuss the practical aspects regarding accuracy and implementation.
