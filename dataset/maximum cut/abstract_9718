We present a new method of estimating the dispersion of a distribution which
is based on the surprising property of a function that measures information
processing intensity. It turns out that this function has a maximum at its
fixed point. We use a fixed-point equation to estimate the parameter of the
distribution that is of interest to us. We illustrate the estimation method by
using the example of an exponential distribution. The codes of programs that
calculate the experimental values of the information processing intensity are
presented.
