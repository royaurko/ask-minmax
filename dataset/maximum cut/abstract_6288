We review selected methods of the Cosmic Microwave Background data analysis
appropriate for the analysis of the largest currently available data sets. We
focus on techniques of the time-ordered data manipulation and map making
algorithms based on the maximum-likelihood approach. The presented methods have
been applied to the MAXIMA data analysis (Hanany et al 2000) and the
description of the algorithms is illustrated with the examples drawn from that
experience. The more extensive presentation of the here-mentioned issues will
be given in the forthcoming paper (Stompor et al 2001).
