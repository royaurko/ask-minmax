Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and a terminal $s\in V$, a cut $X$ for $s$ is a
vertex set that contains $s$. We look for a cut that is small in two senses,
i.e., there are no more than $k$ vertices in $X$ and no more than $t$ edges
leaving $X$. Answering a question asked by Fomin et al. (arXiv:1304.6189), we
show the problem is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by either $k$ or
$t$.
