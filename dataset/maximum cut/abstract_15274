This paper studies the semi-analytic solution (SAS) of a power system's
differential-algebraic equation. A SAS is a closed-form function of symbolic
variables including time, the initial state and the parameters on system
operating conditions, and hence able to directly give trajectories on system
state variables, which are accurate for at least a certain time window. A
two-stage SAS-based approach for fast transient stability simulation is
proposed, which offline derives the SAS by the Adomian Decomposition Method and
online evaluates the SAS for each of sequential time windows until making up a
desired simulation period. When applied to fault simulation, the new approach
employs numerical integration only for the fault-on period to determine the
post-disturbance initial state of the SAS. The paper further analyzes the
maximum length of a time window for a SAS to keep its accuracy, and
accordingly, introduces a divergence indicator for adaptive time windows. The
proposed SAS-based new approach is validated on the IEEE 10-machine, 39-bus
system.
