Entropic forces in colloidal suspensions and in polymer-colloid systems are
of long-standing and continuing interest. Experiments show how entropic forces
can be used to control the self-assembly of colloidal particles. Significant
advances in colloidal synthesis made in the past two decades have enabled the
preparation of high quality nano-particles with well-controlled sizes, shapes,
and compositions, indicating that such particles can be utilized as "artificial
atoms" to build new materials. To elucidate the effects of the shape of
particles upon the magnitude of entropic interaction, we analyse the entropic
interactions of two cut-spheres. We show that the solvent induces a strong
directional depletion attraction among flat faces of the cut-spheres. Such an
effect highlights the possibility of using the shape of particles to control
directionality and strength of interaction.
