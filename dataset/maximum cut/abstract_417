Addressing a question of M. Stillman, it had been shown by Ein, Eisenbud, and
the contributor that in a projective space of dimension at most 5, every
arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve which is cut out by quadrics scheme-
theoretically also has its homogeneous ideal generated by quadrics. In this
note it is shown that this is not the case in higher dimensional spaces.
