A side-to-side comparison is established between the nuclear recoil energy
spectrum from CDMS germanium bolometers and its low-energy equivalent for
events in the inner bulk volume of a CoGeNT germanium diode. Acknowledging the
orthogonality of the background cuts possible with each type of detector and
following an examination of the uncertainties in these searches, a suggestive
agreement between these spectra is observed.
