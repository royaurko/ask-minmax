Based on the analysis of 5 fb^-1 of data at the LHC, the ATLAS and CMS
collaborations have presented evidence for a Higgs boson with a mass in the 125
GeV range. We consider the 125 GeV neutral Higgs pair production process in the
context of large-extra-dimensions(LED) model including the Kaluza-Klein(KK)
excited gravitons at the LHC. We take into account the LED effects coming from
gluon-gluon fusion and quark-antiquark collision channels as well as their
corresponding next-to-leading order(NLO) QCD loop induced corrections. We
analyse their impacts on both the total cross section and some key
distributions. Indeed,pp -> HH has the clear advantage of a lower standard
model(SM) background compare to process like pp -> jj, though its SM prediction
is very small, it is shown that the LED model raises the cross section of Higgs
pair production compare to its SM prediction and enhance the transverse
momentum(pHT) and invariant mass(MHH) Distributions especially at high scales
of pH T and MHH. By including the NLO QCD loop corrections, the scale
dependence of total cross section can be reduced obviously. Choose suitable
decay modes like HH -> bbrr or HH -> bbmumu and some simple cuts, we can
strongly reduce the SM background but keep most of the LED effects, leading
Higgs pair production a promising channel to search LED effects.
