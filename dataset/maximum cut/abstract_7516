We study the observability of the squarks and gluinos in CMS at LHC.
Classical E_T^miss + jets final state as well as a number of additional
multilepton signatures (0 leptons, 1 lepton, 2 leptons of the same sign, 2
leptons of the opposite sign and 3 leptons) are investigated . The detection of
these sparticles relies on the observation of an excess of events over Standard
Model background expectations. The study is made in the framework of a minimal
SU(5) mSUGRA model as a function of m_0, m_1/2 for 4 sets of model parameters :
tan(beta) = 2 or 35 and sign(mu) = +/- 1 and for fixed value of A_0 = 0. The
CMS detector response is modelled using CMSJET 4.51 fast MC code (non-GEANT).
The results obtained are presented as 5 sigma detection contours in the m_0,
m_1/2 planes and with optimized selection cuts in various regions of the
parameter space. The result of these investigations is that with integrated
luminosity L=10^5 pb^-1 the squark and gluino mass reach is about 2.5 TeV and
covers most of the interesting parts of parameter space according to neutralino
relic density expectations. The influence of signal and background
cross-section uncertainties on the reach contours is estimated. The effect of
pile-up on signal and background is also discussed. This effect is found to be
insignificant for E_T^miss and single lepton signatures, whilst only a minor
deterioration is seen for multilepton final states.
