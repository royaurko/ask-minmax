This work reports on the magnetic interlayer coupling between two amorphous
CoFeB layers, separated by a thin Ru spacer. We observe an antiferromagnetic
coupling which oscillates as a function of the Ru thickness x, with the second
antiferromagnetic maximum found for x=1.0 to 1.1 nm. We have studied the
switching of a CoFeB/Ru/CoFeB trilayer for a Ru thickness of 1.1 nm and found
that the coercivity depends on the net magnetic moment, i.e. the thickness
difference of the two CoFeB layers. The antiferromagnetic coupling is almost
independent on the annealing temperatures up to 300 degree C while an annealing
at 350 degree C reduces the coupling and increases the coercivity, indicating
the onset of crystallization. Used as a soft electrode in a magnetic tunnel
junction, a high tunneling magnetoresistance of about 50%, a well defined
plateau and a rectangular switching behavior is achieved.
