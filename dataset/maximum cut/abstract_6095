We study the bandwidth and the pathwidth of multi-dimensional grids. It can
be shown for grids, that these two parameters are equal to a more basic graph
parameter, the vertex boundary width. Using this fact, we determine the
bandwidth and the pathwidth of three-dimensional grids, which were known only
for the cubic case. As a by-product, we also determine the two parameters of
multi-dimensional grids with relatively large maximum factors.
