Uncertainties on low-$x$ PDFs are crucial for the standard model benchmark
processes of $W$ and $Z$ production at the LHC. The current level of PDF
uncertainty is critically reviewed and the possibility of reducing this
uncertainty using early LHC data is investigated taking into account realistic
expectations for measurement accuracy, kinematic cuts and backgrounds.
