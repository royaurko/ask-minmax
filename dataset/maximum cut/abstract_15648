We report on an unidentified gamma-ray signal found in the region around the
BL Lac object 1ES 0229+200. It was recognized serendipitously in our analysis
of 6.2 years of Fermi-LAT data at a distance less than 3{\deg} away from the
blazar. The observed excess of counts manifests itself as an unexpected local
maximum in the test statistic map. Although several Fermi-LAT sources have been
identified in this area we were not able to link them to the position of this
residual signal. A clear association with sources visible in other wavebands
was not successful either. We briefly discuss characteristics of this
unresolved phenomenon. Our results suggest a steep energy spectrum and a
point-like nature of this candidate gamma-ray emitter.
