Low energy polarized electronic Raman scattering of the electron doped
superconductor Nd_1.85Ce_0.15CuO_4 (T_c=22 K) has revealed a nonmonotonic
d_{x^2-y^2} superconducting order parameter. It has a maximum gap of 4.4 k_BT_c
at Fermi surface intersections with antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone (the ``hot
spots'') and a smaller gap of 3.3 k_BT_c at fermionic Brillouin zone
boundaries. The gap enhancement in the vicinity of the ``hot spots'' emphasizes
role of antiferromagnetic fluctuations and similarity in the origin of
superconductivity for electron- and hole-doped cuprates.
