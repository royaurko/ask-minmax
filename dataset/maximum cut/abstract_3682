A graph $G$ is said to be a $k$-degenerate graph if any subgraph of $G$
contains a vertex of degree at most $k$. Let $\kappa$ be any non-negative
function on the vertex set of $G$. We first define a $\kappa$-degenerate graph.
Next we give an efficient algorithm to determine whether a graph is
$\kappa$-degenerate. We revisit the concept of dynamic monopolies in graphs.
The latter notion is used in formulation and analysis of spread of influence
such as disease or opinion in social networks. We consider dynamic monopolies
with (not necessarily positive) but integral threshold assignments. We obtain a
sufficient and necessary relationship between dynamic monopolies and
generalized degeneracy. As applications of the previous results we consider the
problem of determining the maximum size of $\kappa$-degenerate (or
$k$-degenerate) induced subgraphs in any graph. We obtain some upper and lower
bounds for the maximum size of any $\kappa$-degenerate induced subgraph in
general and regular graphs. All of our bounds are constructive.
