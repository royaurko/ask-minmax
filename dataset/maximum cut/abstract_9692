Three major properties of the chaotic dynamics of the standard map, namely,
the measure \mu of the main connected chaotic domain, the maximum Lyapunov
exponent L of the motion in this domain, and the dynamical entropy h = \mu L
are studied as functions of the stochasticity parameter K. The perturbations of
the domain due to emergence and disintegration of islands of stability, upon
small variations of K, are considered in particular. By means of extensive
numerical experiments, it is shown that these perturbations are isentropic (at
least approximately). In other words, the dynamical entropy does not fluctuate,
while local jumps in \mu and L are significant.
