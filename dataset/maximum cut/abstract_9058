The beta Weibull distribution was introduced by Famoye et al. (2005) and
studied by these contributors. However, they do not give explicit expressions for
the moments. We now derive explicit closed form expressions for the cumulative
distribution function and for the moments of this distribution. We also give an
asymptotic expansion for the moment generating function. Further, we discuss
maximum likelihood estimation and provide formulae for the elements of the
Fisher information matrix. We also demonstrate the usefulness of this
distribution on a real data set.
