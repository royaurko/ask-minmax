We have measured the dielectric constant and the pyroelectric current of
orthorhombic (space group $Pbam$) NdCrTiO$_5$ polycrystalline samples. The
dielectric constant and the pyroelectric current show features associated with
ferroelectric transitions at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature
($T_{\text{N}}$ = 21 K). The effect of magnetic fields is to enhance the
features almost linearly up to the maximum measured field (7 T) with a
spontaneous polarization value of $\sim 3.5 \mu$C/m$^2$. Two possible
scenarios, the linear magnetoelectric effect and multiferroicity
(antiferromagnetism + ferroelectricity), are discussed as possible explanations
for the observations.
