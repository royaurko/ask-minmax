The analytical models that predict thermal and mechanical responses of
microactuator have been developed. These models are based on electro thermal
and thermo mechanical analysis of the microbeam. Also, Finite Element Analysis
(FEA) is used to evaluate microactuator tip deflection. Analytical and Finite
Element results are compared with experimental results in literature and show
good agreement in low input voltages. A dimensional variation of beam lengths,
beam lengths ratios and gap are introduced in analytical and FEA models to
explore microactuator performance. An electrothermally driven polysilicon
microactuator similar to Pan's actuator architecture has been studied in this
paper. This microactuator generates deflection through asymmetric heating of
the hot and cold polysilicon arms with different lengths. For this
microactuator architecture, an optimal beam length ratio equal to 0.46 has been
obtained to achieve maximum tip deflection. . As it was expected, the results
show decreasing air gap increase microactuator tip deflection. It is also found
that for microactuators with longer hot arms, microactuator tip deflections are
more sensitive to beam length ratios and air gap.
