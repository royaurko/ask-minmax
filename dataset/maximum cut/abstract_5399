We study the spectral disjointness of the powers of a rank-one
transformation. For a large class of rank-one constructions, including those
for which the cutting and stacking parameters are bounded, and other examples
such as rigid generalized Chacon's maps and Katok's map, we prove that
different positive powers of the transformation are pairwise spectrally
disjoint on the continuous part of the spectrum. Our proof involves the
existence, in the weak closure of {U_T^k: k in Z}, of "sufficiently many"
analytic functions of the operator U_T. Then we apply these disjointness
results to prove Sarnak's conjecture for the (possibly non-uniquely ergodic)
symbolic models associated to these rank-one constructions: All sequences
realized in these models are orthogonal to the M\"obius function.
