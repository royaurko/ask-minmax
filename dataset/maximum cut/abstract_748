We study the asymptotic behavior of low-lying eigenvalues of spatially
cut-off $P(\phi)_2$-Hamiltonian under semi-classical limit. The corresponding
classical equation of the $P(\phi)_2$-field is a nonlinear Klein-Gordon
equation which is an infinite dimensional Newton's equation. We determine the
semi-classical limit of the lowest eigenvalue of the spatially cut-off
$P(\phi)_2$-Hamiltonian in terms of the Hessian of the potential function of
the Klein-Gordon equation. Moreover, we prove that the gap of the lowest two
eigenvalues goes to 0 exponentially fast under semi-classical limit when the
potential function is double well type. In fact, we prove that the exponential
decay rate is greater than or equal to the Agmon distance between two zero
points of the symmetric double well potential function. The Agmon distance is a
Riemannian distance on the Sobolev space $H^{1/2}(\RR)$ defined by a Riemannian
metric which is formally conformal to $L^2$-metric. Also we study basic
properties of the Agmon distance and instanton.
