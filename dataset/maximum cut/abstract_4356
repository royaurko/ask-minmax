In the linear moose framework, which naturally emerges in deconstruction
models, we show that there is a unique solution for the vanishing of the $S$
parameter at the lowest order in the weak interactions. We consider an
effective gauge theory based on $K$ SU(2) gauge groups, $K+1$ chiral fields and
electroweak groups $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)_Y$ at the ends of the chain of the
moose. $S$ vanishes when a link in the moose chain is cut. As a consequence one
has to introduce a dynamical non local field connecting the two ends of the
moose. Then the model acquires an additional custodial symmetry which protects
this result. We examine also the possibility of a strong suppression of $S$
through an exponential behavior of the link couplings as suggested by Randall
Sundrum metric.
