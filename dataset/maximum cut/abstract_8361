We study the effect of strong electron-electron interactions on the
persistent current in a multichannel ring with the aid of Bosonization and the
Bethe ansatz equation discussed by Sutherland and Tsvelik. The interaction acts
differently on a single and multichannel ring. If, in the first case, the
current is suppressed, then in the second case the current may be enhanced.
With the interaction the current is proportional to square of the number of
channels. The maximum effect corresponds to medium values of the interaction,
where $U\sim V_F$. The new phenomenon of the fractional p/q- Aharonov-Bohm
effect appears for interacting electrons on the multichannel ring.
