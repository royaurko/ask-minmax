We report on transient adhesion and conductance phenomena associated with tip
wetting in mechanical contacts produced by the indentation of a clean W(111)
tip into a Au(111) surface. A combination of atomic force microscopy and
scanning tunneling microscopy was used to carry out indentation and to image
residual impressions in ultra-high vacuum. The ~7 nm radii tips used in these
experiments were prepared and characterized by field ion microscopy in the same
instrument. The very first indentations of the tungsten tips show larger
conductance and pull-off adhesive forces than subsequent indentations. After
~30 indentations to a depth of ~1.7 nm, the maximum conductance and adhesion
forces reach steady-state values approximately 12x and 6x smaller than their
initial value. Indentation of W(111) tips into Cu(100) was also performed to
investigate the universality of tip wetting phenomena with a different
substrate. We propose a model from contact mechanics considerations which
quantitatively reproduces the observed decay rate of the conductance and
adhesion drops with a 1/e decay constant of 9-14 indentation cycles. The
results show that the surface composition of an indenting tip plays an
important role in defining the mechanical and electrical properties of
indentation contacts.
