These lecture notes give a pedagogical introduction to the use of dispersion
relations in loop calculations. We first derive dispersion relations which
allow us to recover the real part of a physical amplitude from the knowledge of
its absorptive part along the branch cut. In perturbative calculations, the
latter may be constructed by means of Cutkosky's rule, which is briefly
discussed. For illustration, we apply this procedure at one loop to the photon
vacuum-polarization function induced by leptons as well as to the $\gamma f\bar
f$ vertex form factor generated by the exchange of a massive vector boson
between the two fermion legs. We also show how the hadronic contribution to the
photon vacuum polarization may be extracted from the total cross section of
hadron production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation measured as a function of energy.
Finally, we outline the application of dispersive techniques at the two-loop
level, considering as an example the bosonic decay width of a high-mass Higgs
boson.
