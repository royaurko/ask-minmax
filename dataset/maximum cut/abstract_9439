In this paper we introduce and study a new complexity measure for finite
words. For positive integer $d$ special scattered subwords, called
super-$d$-subwords, in which the gaps are of length at least $(d-1)$, are
defined. We give methods to compute super-$d$-complexity (the total number of
different super-$d$-subwords) in the case of rainbow words (with pairwise
different letters) by recursive algorithms, by mahematical formulas and by
graph algorithms. In the case of general words, with letters from a given
alphabet without any restriction, the problem of the maximum value of the
super-$d$-complexity of all words of length $n$ is presented.
