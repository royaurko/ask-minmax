The cosmic-ray streaming instability creates strong magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence in the precursor of a SN shock. The level of turbulence determines
the maximum energy of cosmic-ray particles accelerated by the diffusive shock
acceleration mechanism. The present consideration continues our work Ptuskin &
Zirakashvili (2003). It is assumed that the Kolmogorov type nonlinear wave
interactions together with the ion-neutral collisions restrict the amplitude of
random magnetic field. As a result, the maximum energy of accelerated particles
strongly depends on the age of a SNR. The average spectrum of cosmic rays
injected in the interstellar medium over the course of adiabatic SNR evolution
(the Sedov stage) is approximately $Q(p)p^{2}\propto p^{-2}$ at energies larger
than 10-30 Gev/nucleon and with the maximum particle energy that is close to
the knee position in cosmic ray spectrum observed at $\sim4\times10^{15}$ eV.
At earlier stage of SNR evolution - the ejecta dominated stage described by the
Chevalier-Nadyozhin solution, the particles are accelerated to higher energies
and have rather steep power-law distribution on momentum. These results suggest
that the knee may mark the transition from the ejecta-dominated to the
adiabatic evolution of SNR shocks which accelerate cosmic rays.
