The question was raised as to whether the cut number of a 3-manifold X is
bounded from below by 1/3 beta_1(X). We show that the answer to this question
is `no.' For each m>0, we construct explicit examples of closed 3-manifolds X
with beta_1(X)=m and cut number 1. That is, pi_1(X) cannot map onto any
non-abelian free group. Moreover, we show that these examples can be assumed to
be hyperbolic.
