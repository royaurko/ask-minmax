The driving engine of the Free Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) is an L-band
superconducting accelerator. It is designed to operate in burst mode with 800
microsecond pulse duration at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The maximum
accelerated beam current during the macropulse is 9 mA. Our analysis shows that
the FLASH technology has great potential since it is possible to construct a
FLASH like free electron laser operating at the wavelength of 13.5 and 6.8
nanometer with an average power up to 2.6 kW. Such a source meets the physical
requirements for the light source for the next generation lithography.
