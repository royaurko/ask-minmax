Fermi LAT has detected gamma ray emissions from the core of Cen A. More
recently, a new component in the gamma ray spectrum from the core has been
reported in the energy range of 4 GeV to tens of GeV. We show that the new
component and the HESS detected spectrum of gamma rays from the core at higher
energy have possibly a common origin in photo-disintegration of heavy nuclei.
Assuming the cosmic rays are mostly Fe nuclei inside the core and their
spectrum has a low energy cut-off at 52 TeV in the wind frame moving with a
Doppler factor 0.25 with respect to the observer on earth, the cosmic ray
luminosity required to explain the observed gamma ray flux above 1 GeV is found
to be $1.5\times 10^{43}$ erg/sec.
