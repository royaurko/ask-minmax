Numerical simulations of fully developed turbulence driven by a modulated
energy input rate or driving force are performed within two dynamical cascade
models, the GOY shell model and a reduced wave vector set approximation of the
Navier-Stokes equation (REWA). The frequency behavior of the system response is
studied and compared with predictions from a variable range mean-field theory,
which excludes turbulent fluctuations. In agreement with the mean-field
approach we find a constant response amplitude for low driving frequencies and
a 1/w-decay of the amplitude for high frequencies. In the mean-field theory,
the finite cascade time scale had lead to an oscillating behavior of the
response amplitude as a function of the driving frequency. In the simulations
of both models we observe the main maximum. The higher maxima and minima are
completely washed out by fluctuations.
