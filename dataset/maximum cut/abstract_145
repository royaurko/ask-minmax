The cross section for Higgs+jet production in bottom quark annihilation is
calculated through NLO QCD. The five-flavour scheme is used to derive this
contribution to the Higgs+jet production cross section which becomes
numerically important in the MSSM for large values of tan(beta). We present
numerical results for a proton collider with 14 TeV center-of-mass energy. The
NLO matrix elements for d(sigma)/d(pT) are then combined with the total
inclusive cross section in order to derive the integrated cross section with a
maximum cut on pT at next-to-next-to-leading order.
