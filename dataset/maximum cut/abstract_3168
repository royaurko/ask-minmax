We show a new lower bound for the maximum number of runs in a string. We
prove that for any e > 0, (a -- e)n is an asymptotic lower bound, where a =
56733/60064 = 0.944542. It is superior to the previous bound 0.927 given by
Franek et al. Moreover, our construction of the strings and the proof is much
simpler than theirs.
