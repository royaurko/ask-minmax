The two objects 1SWASP J150822.80-054236.9 and 1SWASP J160156.04+202821.6
were initially detected from their SuperWASP archived light curves as candidate
eclipsing binaries with periods close to the short-period cut-off of the
orbital period distribution of main sequence binaries, at ~0.2 d. Here, using
INT spectroscopic data, we confirm them as double-lined spectroscopic and
eclipsing binaries, in contact configuration. Following modelling of their
visual light curves and radial velocity curves, we determine their component
and system parameters to precisions between ~2 and 11%. The former system
contains 1.07 and 0.55 M_sun components, with radii of 0.90 and 0.68 R_sun
respectively; its primary exhibits pulsations with period 1/6 the orbital
period of the system. The latter contains 0.86 and 0.57 M_sun components, with
radii of 0.75 and 0.63R_sun respectively.
