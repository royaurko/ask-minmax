The purpose of this paper is to discuss the construction of a linear
operator, referred to as the bubble transform, which maps scalar functions
defined on a bounded domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ into a collection of
functions with local support. In fact, for a given simplicial triangulation of
$\Omega$, the associated bubble transform produces a decomposition of functions
on $\Omega$ into a sum of functions with support on the corresponding
macroelements. The transform is bounded in both $L^2$ and the Sobolev space
$H^1$, it is local, and it preserves the corresponding continuous piecewise
polynomial spaces. As a consequence, this transform is a useful tool for
constructing local projection operators into finite element spaces such that
the appropriate operator norms are bounded independently of polynomial degree.
The transform is basically constructed by two families of operators, local
averaging operators and rational trace preserving cut--off operators.
