We provide a general method to prove the existence and compute efficiently
elimination orderings in graphs. Our method relies on several tools that were
known before, but that were not put together so far: the algorithm LexBFS due
to Rose, Tarjan and Lueker, one of its properties discovered by Berry and
Bordat, and a local decomposition property of graphs discovered by Maffray,
Trotignon and Vu\vskovi\'c. We use this method to prove the existence of
elimination orderings in several classes of graphs, and to compute them in
linear time. Some of the classes have already been studied, namely
even-hole-free graphs, square-theta-free Berge graphs, universally signable
graphs and wheel-free graphs. Some other classes are new. It turns out that all
the classes that we study in this paper can be defined by excluding some of the
so-called Truemper configurations. For several classes of graphs, we obtain
directly bounds on the chromatic number, or fast algorithms for the maximum
clique problem or the coloring problem.
