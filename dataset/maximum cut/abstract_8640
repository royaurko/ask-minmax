We show how string breaking on the lattice, treated as a mixing effect, can
be related to decay rates for heavy quark systems. We use this to make a
preliminary calculation of the energy split at maximum mixing for static quarks
in QCD from the decay rate for $\Upsilon(4S)\to B{\bar B}$. We extend the
calculation to achieve rough estimates for the contributions of channels
involving $B, B^*, B_s and B_s^*$ mesons to the width of the $\Upsilon(5S)$.
