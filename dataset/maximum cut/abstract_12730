Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality (in terms of correlation
functions) of two qutrits is studied in detail by employing tritter
measurements. A uniform formula for the maximum value of this inequality for
tritter measurements is obtained. Based on this formula, we show that
non-maximally entangled states violate the Bell-CHSH inequality more strongly
than the maximally entangled one. This result is consistent with what was
obtained by Ac{\'{i}}n {\it et al} [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 65}, 052325 (2002)] using
the Bell-Clauser-Horne inequality (in terms of probabilities).
