We report on Mid-Infrared (MIR) observations of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC
1068, obtained with ISOCAM in low-resolution spectro-imaging mode. The spatial
resolution (around 5 arcsec) allows us to disentangle the circumnuclear
starburst regions from the emission of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The
global spatial distribution of the Unidentified Infrared Bands (UIBs) is
similar to the cold dust component, traced by the 450 microns emission and the
gaseous component obtained from the CO(1-0) map. However, a shift between the
maximum of the UIB and 450 microns emission is clearly seen in our maps. The
UIBs in the MIR (5-16 microns) originate almost exclusively from the starburst
regions in the galactic disk with an emission peaking at the extremity of the
stellar/ gaseous bar at a distance of 1 kpc from the AGN. The spectrum of the
nucleus is characterized over the whole 5-16 microns range by a strong
continuum which can be fitted with a power law of index -1.7. Moreover, the
high [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio (>2.5) in the nuclear region argues for a hard
radiation field from the AGN. Observations indicate that the AGN in NGC 1068
contributes less than 5% to the total integrated UIB emission even though its
hot dust continuum contributes as much as 75% to the total MIR flux. On the
contrary, the nuclear contribution to the cold dust emission decreases
considerably at submillimeter wavelengths and does not represent more than 25%
of the total integrated emission at 450 microns.
