We study finite (physical) volume and scaling violation effects of Landau
gauge ghost propagator as well as of the running coupling alpha_s(p) in the
SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We consider lattices with physical sizes between 3
and 7 fm and values of spacing a between 0.2 and 0.07 fm. To fix the gauge we
apply an efficient gauge fixing method aimed at finding extrema as close as
possible to the global maximum of the gauge functional. We show that finite
volume effects turn out to be rather small for momenta |p| > 0.6 GeV. The
relative scaling violations for alpha_s(p) do not exceed 10% within the bare
coupling range beta=4/g_0^2 \in [2.30, 2.55] for the same momentum region and
decreases quickly with increasing |p|. Our results testify in favor of the
decoupling behavior.
