The distributional transform (DT) is amongst the computational methods used
for estimation of high-dimensional multivariate normal copula models with
discrete responses. Its advantage is that the likelihood can be derived
conveniently under the theory for copula models with continuous margins, but
there has not been a clear analysis of the adequacy of this method. We
investigate the small-sample and asymptotic efficiency of the method for
estimating high-dimensional multivariate normal copula models with univariate
Bernoulli, Poisson, and negative binomial margins, and show that the DT
approximation leads to biased estimates when there is more discretisation. For
a high-dimensional discrete response, we implement a maximum simulated
likelihood method, which is based on evaluating the multidimensional integrals
of the likelihood with randomized quasi Monte Carlo methods. Efficiency
calculations show that our method is nearly as efficient as maximum likelihood
for fully specified high-dimensional multivariate normal copula models. Both
methods are illustrated with spatially aggregated count data sets, and it is
shown that there is a substantial gain on efficiency via the maximum simulated
likelihood method.
