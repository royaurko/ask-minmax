This is the summary report of the Top Quark Kinematics working group prepared
for Snowmass 2013. We survey the current state of theoretical predictions for
top pair differential distributions, in both boosted and un-boosted regimes,
and present an overview of uncertainties and prospects for top spin
correlations. We study the prospects for measuring the inclusive SM top pair
production asymmetry AFC at LHC 14 as a function of systematic error, and show
that some improvement over current systematic uncertainties, as customarily
handled, is required for observing a SM-size asymmetry. Cuts on top pair
invariant mass and rapidity do not substantially alter this conclusion. We
summarize the conclusions of contributed studies on alternate LHC measurements
of the ttbar production asymmetry, in ttbar+jet final states and in forward top
production at LHCb, both of which show good prospects for observing SM-size
asymmetries in 50 fb-1 of data at LHC14.
