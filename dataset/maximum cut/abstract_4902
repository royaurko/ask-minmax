Point source searches with the IceCube neutrino telescope have been
restricted to one hemisphere, due to the exclusive selection of upward going
events as a way of rejecting the atmospheric muon background. We show that the
region above the horizon can be included by suppressing the background through
energy-sensitive cuts. This approach improves the sensitivity above PeV
energies, previously not accessible for declinations of more than a few degrees
below the horizon due to the absorption of neutrinos in Earth. We present
results based on data collected with 22 strings of IceCube, extending its field
of view and energy reach for point source searches. No significant excess above
the atmospheric background is observed in a sky scan and in tests of source
candidates, including the Active Galactic Nuclei Centaurus A and 3C279. Upper
limits are reported, which for the first time cover point sources in the
southern sky up to EeV energies.
