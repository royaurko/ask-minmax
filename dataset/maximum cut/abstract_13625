We study the effect of a strong magnetic field on the properties of neutron
stars with a quark-hadron phase transition. It is shown that the magnetic field
prevents the appearance of a quark phase, enhances the leptonic fraction,
decreases the baryonic density extension of the mixed phase and stiffens the
total equation of state, including both the stellar matter and the magnetic
field contributions. Two parametrisations of a density dependent static
magnetic field, increasing, respectively, fast and slowly with the density and
reaching $2-4\times 10^{18}$G in the center of the star, are considered. The
compact stars with strong magnetic fields have maximum mass configurations with
larger masses and radius and smaller quark fractions. The parametrisation of
the magnetic field with density has a strong influence on the star properties.
