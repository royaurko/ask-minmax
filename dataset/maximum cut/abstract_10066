A scheme is analyzed for effcient generation of vacuum ultraviolet radiation
through four-wave mixing processes assisted by the technique of Stark-chirped
rapid adiabatic passage. These opportunities are associated with pulse
excitation of laddertype short-wavelength two-photon atomic or molecular
transitions so that relaxation processes can be neglected. In this three-laser
technique, a delayed-pulse of strong oR-resonant infrared radiation sweeps the
laser-induced Stark-shift of a two-photon transition in a such way that
facilitates robust maximum two-photon coherence induced by the first
ultraviolet laser. A judiciously delayed third pulse scatters at this coherence
and generates short-wavelength radiation. A theoretical analysis of these
problems based on the density matrix is performed. A numerical model is
developed to carry out simulations of a typical experiment. The results
illustrate a behavior of populations, coherence and generated radiation along
the medium as well as opportunities of effcient generation of deep (vacuum)
ultraviolet radiation.
