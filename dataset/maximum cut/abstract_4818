Two component model for a description of the electromagnetic nucleon
structure functions in low-x region, based on generalized vector dominance and
color dipole approaches is briefly described. The model operates with the
mesons of rho-family having the mass spectrum which is equidistant on square
mass and takes into account the nondiagonal transitions in meson-nucleon
scattering. The special cut-off factors are introduced in the model, to exclude
the gamma-qq-V transitions in the case of the narrow qq-pairs. For the color
dipole part of the model the well known FKS-parameterization is used.
