We present numerical results on the capacities of two-qubit unitary
operations for creating entanglement and increasing the Holevo information of
an ensemble. In all cases tested, the maximum values calculated for the
capacities based on the Holevo information are close to the capacities based on
the entanglement. This indicates that the capacities based on the Holevo
information, which are very difficult to calculate, may be estimated from the
capacities based upon the entanglement, which are relatively straightforward to
calculate.
