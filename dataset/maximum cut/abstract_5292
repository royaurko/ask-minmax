The lepton pair production via the quark-antiquark annihilation subprocess in
collisions of beam antiproton with the proton target at E_beam = 14 GeV (which
corresponds to the center-of-mass energy of the p pbar system E_cm = 5.3 GeV)
is studied on the basis of the event sample simulated by PYTHIA6 generator and
PandaRoot package. Different kinematical variables which may be useful for
design of the muon system and the electromagnetic calorimeter of the detector
of PANDA experiment at FAIR, as well as for the study of proton structure
functions in the available x-Q2 kinematical region, are considered. The
problems due to the presence of fake leptons that appear from meson decays, as
well as due to the contribution of background QCD processes and minimum bias
events, are also discussed. The set of cuts which allows one to separate the
events with the signal lepton pairs from different kind of background events
are proposed.
