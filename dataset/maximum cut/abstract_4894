To improve the accuracy of the e+e- -> pi+pi-gamma Radiative Return method,
one has to control the theoretical uncertainty of the final-state photon
emission. It is of particular importance at DAPHNE for the analysis, where cuts
are relaxed to cover the threshold region. By means of Monte Carlo generator
PHOKHARA we compare several final-state radiation models and present results,
relevant for a meson factory running at sqrt{s}=1 GeV.
