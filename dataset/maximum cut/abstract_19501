We present all X-ray and radio observations of the Type IIn supernova SN
2010jl. The X-ray observations cover a period up to day 1500 with Chandra,
XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Swift-XRT. The Chandra observations after 2012 June, the
XMM-Newton observation in 2013 November, and most of the Swift-XRT observations
until 2014 December are presented for the first time. All the spectra can be
fitted by an absorbed hot thermal model except for \chandra spectra on 2011
October and 2012 June when an additional component is needed. Although the
origin of this component is uncertain, it is spatially coincident with the
supernova and occurs when there are changes to the supernova spectrum in the
energy range close to that of the extra component, indicating that the emission
is related to the supernova. The X-ray light curve shows an initial plateau
followed by a steep drop starting at day $\sim 300$. We attribute the drop to a
decrease in the circumstellar density. The column density to the X-ray emission
drops rapidly with time, showing that the absorption is in the vicinity of the
supernova. We also present Very Large Array radio observations of SN 2010jl.
Radio emission was detected from \sn from day 570 onwards. The radio light
curves and spectra suggest that the radio luminosity was close to its maximum
at the first detection. The velocity of the shocked ejecta derived assuming
synchrotron self absorption is much less than that estimated from the optical
and X-ray observations, suggesting that free-free absorption dominates.
