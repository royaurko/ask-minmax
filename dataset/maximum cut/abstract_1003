We provide a comprehensive presentation of the Hierarchical Reference Theory
(HRT) in the smooth cut-off formulation. A simple and self-consistent
derivation of the hierarchy of differential equations is supplemented by a
comparison with the known sharp cut-off HRT. Then, the theory is applied to a
hard core Yukawa fluid (HCYF): a closure, based on a mean spherical
approximation ansatz, is studied in detail and its intriguing relationship to
the self consistent Ornstein-Zernike approximation is discussed. The asymptotic
properties, close to the critical point are investigated and compared to the
renormalization group results both above and below the critical temperature.
The HRT free energy is always a convex function of the density, leading to flat
isotherms in the two-phase region with a finite compressibility at coexistence.
This makes HRT the sole liquid-state theory able to obtain directly fluid-fluid
phase equilibrium without resorting to the Maxwell construction. The way the
mean field free energy is modified due to the inclusion of density fluctuations
suggests how to identify the spinodal curve. Thermodynamic properties and
correlation functions of the HCYF are investigated for three values of the
inverse Yukawa range: z=1.8, z=4 and z=7 where Monte Carlo simulations are
available. The stability of the liquid-vapor critical point with respect to
freezing is also studied.
