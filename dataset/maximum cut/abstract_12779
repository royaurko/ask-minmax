The near-infrared integral field spectrograph SINFONI at the ESO VLT opens a
new window for the study of central supermassive black holes. With a near-IR
spatial resolution similar to HST optical and the ability to penetrate dust it
provides the possibility to explore the low-mass end of the M-sigma relation
(sigma<120km/s) where so far very few black hole masses were measured with
stellar dynamics. With SINFONI we observed the central region of the
low-luminosity elliptical galaxy NGC4486a at a spatial resolution of ~0.1arcsec
in the K band. The stellar kinematics was measured with a maximum penalised
likelihood method considering the region around the CO absorption band heads.
We determined a black hole mass of M_BH=1.25^{+0.75}_{-0.79} x 10^7 M_sun (90%
C.L.) using the Schwarzschild orbit superposition method including the full
2-dimensional spatial information. This mass agrees with the predictions of the
M-sigma relation, strengthening its validity at the lower sigma end.
