We present bounds for the sparseness and for the degrees of the polynomials
in the Nullstellensatz. Our bounds depend mainly on the unmixed volume of the
input polynomial system. The degree bounds can substantially improve the known
ones when this polynomial system is sparse, and they are, in the worst case,
simply exponential in terms of the number of variables and the maximum degree
of the input polynomials.
