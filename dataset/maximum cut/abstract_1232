We report on analysis of the poorly studied source 2RXP J130159.6-635806 at
different epochs with ASCA, Beppo-SAX, XMM-Newton, and INTEGRAL. The source
shows coherent X-ray pulsations at a period ~700s with an average spin up rate
of about dnu/dt ~ 2x10^{-13} Hz/s. A broad band (1-60 keV) spectral analysis of
2RXP J130159.6-635806 based on almost simultaneous XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL data
demonstrates that the source has a spectrum typical of an accretion powered
X-ray pulsar, i.e. an absorbed power law with a high energy cut-off with a
photon index Gamma ~ 0.5-1.0 and a cut-off energy of ~25 keV. The long term
behaviour of the source, its spectral and timing properties, tend to indicate a
high mass X-ray binary with Be companion. We also report on the identification
of the likely infrared counterpart to 2RXP J130159.6-635806. The interstellar
reddening does not allow us to strongly constrain the spectral type of the
counterpart. The latter is, however, consistent with a Be star, the kind of
which is often observed in accretion powered X-ray pulsars.
