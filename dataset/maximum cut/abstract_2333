This is a brief review of recent progress in constructing solutions to the
matrix model Virasoro equations. These equations are parameterized by a degree
n polynomial W_n(x), and the general solution is labeled by an arbitrary
function of n-1 coefficients of the polynomial. We also discuss in this general
framework a special class of (multi-cut) solutions recently studied in the
context of \cal N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories.
