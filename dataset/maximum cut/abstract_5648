In this paper we prove Homological Projective Duality for crepant categorical
resolutions of several classes of linear determinantal varieties. By this we
mean varieties that are cut out by the minors of a given rank of a n x m matrix
of linear forms on a given projective space. As applications, we obtain pairs
of derived-equivalent Calabi-Yau manifolds, and address a question by A. Bondal
asking whether the derived category of any smooth projective variety can be
fully faithfully embedded in the derived category of a smooth Fano variety.
Moreover we discuss the relation between rationality and categorical
representability in codimension two for determinantal varieties.
