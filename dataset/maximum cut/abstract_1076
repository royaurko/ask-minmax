Cut a Jacobi matrix into two pieces by removing the n-th column and n-th row.
We give neccessary and sufficient conditions for the spectra of the original
matrix plus the spectra of the two submatrices to uniqely determine the
original matrix. Our result contains Hostadt's original result as a special
case.
