We study the microcanonical description of string gases in the presence of
D-branes. We obtain exact expressions for the single string density of states
and draw the regions in phase space where asymptotic approximations are valid.
We are able to describe the whole range of energies including the SYM phase of
the D-branes and we remark the importance of the infrared cut-off used in the
high energy approximations. With the complete expression we can obtain the
density of states of the multiple string gas and study its thermal properties,
showing that the Hagedorn temperature is maximum for every system and there is
never a phase transition whenever there is thermal contact among the strings
attached to different D-branes.
