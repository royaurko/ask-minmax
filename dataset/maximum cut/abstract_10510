The ISOGAL mid-infrared survey of areas close to the Galactic Plane aims to
determine their stellar content and its possible bearing on the history of the
Galaxy. The NGC6522 and Sgr I Baade's Windows of low obscuration towards the
inner parts of the Bulge represent ideal places in which to calibrate and
understand the ISOGAL colour-magnitude diagrams.
  The survey observations were made with the ISOCAM instrument of the ISO
satellite. The filter bands chosen were LW2(~7 microns) and LW3(~15 microns).
  The results presented here show that most of the detected objects are late
M-type giants on the AGB, with a cut-off for those earlier than M3-M4. The most
luminous members of these two Bulge fields at 7 microns are the Mira variables.
However, it is evident that they represent the end of a sequence of increasing
15 micron dust emission which commences with M giants of earlier sub-type.
  In observations of late-type giants the ISOCAM 15 micron band is mainly
sensitive to the cool silicate or aluminate dust shells which overwhelm the
photospheric emission. However, in ordinary M-giant stars, the 7 micron band is
not strongly affected by dust emission and may be influenced instead by
absorption. The nu2 band of water at 6.25 microns and the SiO fundamental at
7.9 microns are likely contribitors to this effect.
  A group of late M stars has been found which vary little or not at all but
have infrared colours typical of well-developed dust shells. Their luminosities
are similar to those of 200-300 day Miras but they have slightly redder
[7]-[15] colours which form an extension of the ordinary M giant sequence.
  The Mira dust shells show a mid-infrared [7]-[15] colour-period relation. ca
