Recently, we have performed research on the subject of the cosmological
constant problem. The scenario is based on two postulates for inflationary
theory: one is that inflaton $\phi$ can interact with radiation (relativistic
particles); the other is that radiation will be created continuously during and
after the epoch of inflation. According to these postulates and from a
"macroscopic perspective", we discover that radiation can be viewed as a
product of the interaction between $\dot{\phi}$ and some "effective kinetic
frictional force" that exists in inflaton dynamics. Deducing and surmising from
"effective friction", we obtain conclusions of two special types of expanding
universe: A Type I universe will finally enter an expanding course after a
special time $t_{*}$ with uniformly rolling $\dot{\phi}(t_{*})$ due to the
balance between $V^{'}(\phi(t))$, 3H(t)\dot{\phi}(t_{*}) and the "effective
kinetic frictional force". In this result, the expanding course will see
particles created continuously. Additionally, for a Type II universe, $\phi$
will be at rest after $t_{r}$ inside a region named the "stagnant zone" that is
formed by the "maximum effective static frictional force". Consistent with
this, inflaton potential will survive as a relic $V(\phi(t_{r}))$, playing the
role of the effective cosmological constant $\Lambda$ .
