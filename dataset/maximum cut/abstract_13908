We describe and test an easy-to-implement two-step high-order compact (2SHOC)
scheme for the Laplacian operator and its implementation into an explicit
finite-difference scheme for simulating the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation
(NLSE). Our method relies on a compact `double-differencing' which is shown to
be computationally equivalent to standard fourth-order non-compact schemes.
Through numerical simulations of the NLSE using fourth-order Runge-Kutta, we
confirm that our scheme shows the desired fourth-order accuracy. A computation
and storage requirement comparison is made between the 2SHOC scheme and the
non-compact equivalent scheme for both the Laplacian operator alone, as well as
when implemented in the NLSE simulations. Stability bounds are also shown in
order to get maximum e?cffiency out of the method. We conclude that the modest
increase in storage and computation of the 2SHOC schemes are well worth the
advantages of having the schemes compact, and their ease of implementation
makes their use very useful for practical implementations.
