The detection and the measurement of the production cross section of a light
Higgs boson at the CERN Large Hadron Collider demand the accurate prediction of
the background distributions of photon pairs. To improve this theoretical
prediction, we present the soft-gluon resummed calculation of the $p p \to
\gamma \gamma X$ cross section, including the exact one loop $g g \to \gamma
\gamma g$ contribution. By incorporating the known fixed order results and the
leading terms in the higher order corrections, the resummed cross section
provides a reliable prediction for the inclusive diphoton invariant mass and
transverse momentum distributions. Given our results, we propose the search for
the Higgs boson in the inclusive diphoton mode with a cut on the transverse
momentum of the photon pair, without the requirement of an additional tagged
jet.
