CUORE-0 is a cryogenic detector that uses an array of tellurium dioxide
bolometers to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of ^{130}Te. We present
the first data analysis with 7.1 kg y of total TeO_2 exposure focusing on
background measurements and energy resolution. The background rates in the
neutrinoless double-beta decay region of interest (2.47 to 2.57 MeV) and in the
{\alpha} background-dominated region (2.70 to 3.90 MeV) have been measured to
be 0.071 \pm 0.011 and 0.019 \pm 0.002 counts/keV/kg/y, respectively. The
latter result represents a factor of 6 improvement from a predecessor
experiment, Cuoricino. The results verify our understanding of the background
sources in CUORE-0, which is the basis of extrapolations to the full CUORE
detector. The obtained energy resolution (full width at half maximum) in the
region of interest is 5.7 keV. Based on the measured background rate and energy
resolution in the region of interest, CUORE-0 half-life sensitivity is expected
to surpass the observed lower bound of Cuoricino with one year of live time.
