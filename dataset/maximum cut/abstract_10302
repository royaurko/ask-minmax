We used the GEOS database to study the Blazhko effect of galactic RRab stars.
The database is continuously enriched by maxima supplied by amateur astronomers
and by a dedicated survey by means of the two TAROT robotic telescopes. The
same value of the Blazhko period is observed at different values of the
pulsation periods and different values of the Blazhko periods are observed at
the same value of the pulsation period. There are clues suggesting that the
Blazhko effect is changing from one cycle to the next. The secular changes in
the pulsation and Blazhko periods of Z CVn are anticorrelated. The diagrams of
magnitudes against phases of the maxima clearly show that the light curves of
Blazhko variables can be explained as modulated signals, both in amplitude and
in frequency. The closed curves describing the Blazhko cycles in such diagrams
have different shapes, reflecting the phase shifts between the epochs of the
brightest maximum and the maximum O-C. Our sample shows that both clockwise and
anticlockwise directions are possible for similar shapes. The improved
observational knowledge of the Blazhko effect, in addition to some
peculiarities of the light curves, have still to be explained by a satisfactory
physical mechanism.
