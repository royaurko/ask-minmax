Motivated by the recent developments in the Space Shift Keying (SSK) and
Spatial Modulation (SM) systems which employ Time-Orthogonal Pulse Shaping
(TOPS) filters to achieve transmit diversity gains, we propose TOPS for
Space-Time Block Codes (STBC). We show that any STBC whose set of weight
matrices partitions into P subsets under the equivalence relation termed as
Common Support Relation can be made P -group decodable by properly employing
TOPS waveforms across space and time. Furthermore, by considering some of the
well known STBCs in the literature we show that the order of their Maximum
Likelihood decoding complexity can be greatly reduced by the application of
TOPS.
