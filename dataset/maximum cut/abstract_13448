We investigate the effect of a new triple-alpha reaction rate from Ogata et
al. (2009) on helium ignition conditions on accreting neutron stars and on the
properties of the subsequent type I X-ray burst. We find that the new rate
leads to significantly lower ignition column density for accreting neutron
stars at low accretion rates. We compare the results of our ignition models for
a pure helium accretor to observations of bursts in ultra-compact X-ray binary
(UCXBs), which are believed to have nearly pure helium donors. For mdot > 0.001
mdot_Edd, the new triple-alpha reaction rate from Ogata et al. (2009) predicts
a maximum helium ignition column of ~ 3 x 10^9 g cm^{-2}, corresponding to a
burst energy of ~ 4 x 10^{40} ergs. For mdot ~ 0.01 mdot_Edd at which
intermediate long bursts occur, the predicted burst energies are at least a
factor of 10 too low to explain the observed energies of such bursts in UCXBs.
This finding adds to the doubts cast on the triple-alpha reaction rate of Ogata
et al. (2009) by the low-mass stellar evolution results of Dotter & Paxton
(2009).
