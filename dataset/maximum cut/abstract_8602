I study a fresh inflationary model with an increasing F-cosmological
parameter. The model provides sufficiently e-folds to solve the
flatness/horizon problem and the density fluctuations agree with experimental
values. The temperature increases during fresh inflation and reach its maximum
value when inflation ends. I find that entropy perturbations always remain
below $10^{-4}$ during fresh inflation and become negligible when fresh
inflation ends. Hence, the adiabatic fluctuations dominate the primordial
spectrum at the end of fresh inflation.
