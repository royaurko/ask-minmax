The analytical expressions of the Joule-Thomson coefficient for homogeneous
and harmonically trapped three-dimensional ideal anyons which obey Haldane
fractional exclusion statistics are derived. For an ideal Fermi gas, the
Joule-Thomson coefficient is negative, which means that there is no maximum
Joule-Thomson inversion temperature. With careful study, it is found that there
exists a Joule-Thomson inversion temperature in the fractional exclusion
statistics model. Furthermore, the relations between the Joule-Thomson
inversion temperature and the statistical parameter $g$ are investigated.
