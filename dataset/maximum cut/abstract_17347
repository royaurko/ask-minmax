Interference alignment (IA) is a cooperative transmission strategy that,
under some conditions, achieves the interference channel's maximum number of
degrees of freedom. Realizing IA gains, however, is contingent upon providing
transmitters with sufficiently accurate channel knowledge. In this paper, we
study the performance of IA in multiple-input multiple-output systems where
channel knowledge is acquired through training and analog feedback. We design
the training and feedback system to maximize IA's effective sum-rate: a
non-asymptotic performance metric that accounts for estimation error, training
and feedback overhead, and channel selectivity. We characterize effective
sum-rate with overhead in relation to various parameters such as
signal-to-noise ratio, Doppler spread, and feedback channel quality. A main
insight from our analysis is that, by properly designing the CSI acquisition
process, IA can provide good sum-rate performance in a very wide range of
fading scenarios. Another observation from our work is that such overhead-aware
analysis can help solve a number of practical network design problems. To
demonstrate the concept of overhead-aware network design, we consider the
example problem of finding the optimal number of cooperative IA users based on
signal power and mobility.
