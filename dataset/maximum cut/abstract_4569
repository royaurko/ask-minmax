We perform the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations for ground states
of even Mg isotopes using the Skyrme force and a density-dependent zero-range
pairing force. The HFB equation is solved in a three-dimensional cartesian
mesh, and a convergence of deformation is carefully examined with respect to a
cut-off radius for a check of the calculations. We discuss systematics of the
two-neutron separation energy, deformation and root-mean-square radius. We have
found that 36,38,40Mg have appreciable static deformation, where 40Mg is a
two-neutron drip-line nucleus in our calculation, and the deformations of the
neutron and proton are different in these three nuclei. The deformation
property is analyzed on the basis of the single-particle diagram. It is shown
that N=28 is not a closed shell in Mg as well as Si.
