VRI photometry of the type Ia supernova 2002bo is presented. This SN exploded
in a dusty region of the host galaxy NGC 3190, thus, subtraction of a template
frame was necessary to obtain reliable photometry. We used a template frame of
NGC 3190 taken during the course of our galaxy imaging project, fortunately,
just a few days before SN 2002bo was discovered. The aim of this project is to
collect template frames of nearby galaxies that are potential hosts of bright
SNe. Subtraction of pre-SN images helped us to exclude the background light
contamination of the host galaxy. The maximum occurred at JD 2452346, with
maximal V brightness of 13.58. MLCS analysis led to T0(B)=JD 2452346.1 pm 0.8
(fiducial B-maximum), E(B-V)=0.24 pm 0.02, mu0=32.46 pm 0.06, Delta=-0.14 pm
0.04. E(B-V)=0.24(2) indicates a significant extinction in the host galaxy as
the galactic reddening is negligible toward NGC 3190. The accepted value of
Delta indicates that SN 2002bo was a slightly overluminous SN by about 0.14
relative to fiducial SN Type Ia. The distance turned out to be 31.0 pm 3 Mpc.
In addition, the heavily obscured SN 2002cv was also detected on the I frame
taken on JD 2452434 (June 8, 2002), and a variable star is found in the field,
very close to the host galaxy.
