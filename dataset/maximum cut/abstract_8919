The thermal entanglement in a two-spin-qutrit system with two spins coupled
by exchange interaction under a magnetic field in an arbitrary direction is
investigated. Negativity, the measurement of entanglement, is calculated. We
find that for any temperature the evolvement of negativity is symmetric with
respect to magnetic field. The behavior of negativity is presented for four
different cases. The results show that for different temperature, different
magnetic field give maximum entanglement. Both the parallel and antiparallel
magnetic field cases are investigated qualitatively (not quantitatively) in
detail, we find that the entanglement may be enhanced under an antiparallel
magnetic field.
