In this paper we propose two numerical algorithms to derive the extremal
principal eigenvalue of the bi-Laplacian operator under Navier boundary
conditions or Dirichlet boundary conditions. Consider a non-homogeneous hinged
or clamped plate $\Omega$, the algorithms converge to the density functions on
$\Omega$ which they yield the maximum or minimum basic frequency of the plate.
