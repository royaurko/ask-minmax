We study adaptation of a haploid asexual population on a fitness landscape
defined over binary genotype sequences of length $L$. We consider greedy
adaptive walks in which the population moves to the fittest among all single
mutant neighbors of the current genotype until a local fitness maximum is
reached. The landscape is of the rough mount Fuji type, which means that the
fitness value assigned to a sequence is the sum of a random and a deterministic
component. The random components are independent and identically distributed
random variables, and the deterministic component varies linearly with the
distance to a reference sequence. The deterministic fitness gradient $c$ is a
parameter that interpolates between the limits of an uncorrelated random
landscape ($c = 0$) and an effectively additive landscape ($c \to \infty$).
When the random fitness component is chosen from the Gumbel distribution,
explicit expressions for the distribution of the number of steps taken by the
greedy walk are obtained, and it is shown that the walk length varies
non-monotonically with the strength of the fitness gradient when the starting
point is sufficiently close to the reference sequence. Asymptotic results for
general distributions of the random fitness component are obtained using
extreme value theory, and it is found that the walk length attains a
non-trivial limit for $L \to \infty$, different from its values for $c=0$ and
$c = \infty$, if $c$ is scaled with $L$ in an appropriate combination.
