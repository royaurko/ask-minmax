The picture of the heliopause (HP) -- the boundary between the domains of the
sun and the local interstellar medium (LISM) -- as a pristine interface with a
large rotation in the magnetic field fails to describe recent Voyager 1 (V1)
spacecraft data. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the global
heliosphere reveal that the rotation angle of the magnetic field across the HP
at V1 is small. Particle-in-cell simulations, based on cuts through the MHD
model at the location of V1, suggest that the sectored region of the
heliosheath (HS) produces large-scale magnetic islands that reconnect with the
interstellar magnetic field and mix LISM and HS plasma. Cuts across the
simulation data reveal multiple, anti-correlated jumps in the number densities
of LISM and HS particles at the magnetic separatrices of the islands, similar
to those observed by V1. A model is presented, based on both the observations
and simulation data, of the HP as a porous, multi-layered structure threaded by
magnetic fields. This model further suggests that, contrary to the conclusions
of recent papers, V1 has already crossed the HP.
