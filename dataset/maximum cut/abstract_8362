We study resonant tunnelling through double-barrier structures under an
applied bias voltage, in which nonlinearities due to self-interaction of
electrons in the barrier regions are included. As an approximation, we concern
ourselves with thin barriers simulated by $\delta$-function potentials. This
approximation allows for an analytical expression of the transmission
probability through the structure. We show that the typical peaks due to
resonant tunneling decrease and broaden as nonlinearity increases. The main
conclusion is that nonlinear effects degrade the peak-to-valley ratio but
improve the maximum operation frequency of the resonant tunnelling devices.
