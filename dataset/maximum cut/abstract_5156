We present event distributions for the polymer translocation obtained by
extensive Langevin dynamics simulations. Such distributions have not been
reported previously and they provide new understanding of the stochastic
characteristics of the process. We extract at a high length scale resolution
distributions of polymer segments that continuously traverse through a
nanoscale pore. The obtained log-normal distributions together with the
characteristics of polymer translocation suggest that it is describable as a
multiplicative stochastic process. In spite of its clear out-of-equilibrium
nature the forced translocation is surprisingly similar to the unforced case.
We find forms for the distributions almost unaltered with a common cut-off
length. We show that the individual short-segment and short-time movements
inside the pore give the scaling relations $\tau \sim N^\alpha$ and $\tau \sim
f^{-\beta}$ for the polymer translocation.
