We study a two Higgs doublet model extended by vectorlike leptons mixing with
one family of standard model leptons. Generated flavor violating couplings
between heavy and light leptons can dramatically alter the decay patterns of
heavier Higgs bosons. We focus on $pp \to H \to \nu_4 \nu_\mu \to W \mu
\nu_\mu$, where $\nu_4$ is a new neutral lepton, and study possible effects of
this process on the measurements of $pp \to WW$ and $H \to WW$ since it leads
to the same final states. We discuss predictions for contributions to $pp \to
WW$ and $H \to WW$ and their correlations from the region of the parameter
space that satisfies all available constraints including precision electroweak
observables and from pair production of vectorlike leptons. Large
contributions, close to current limits, favor small $\tan \beta $ region of the
parameter space. We find that, as a result of adopted cuts in experimental
analyses, the contribution to $pp \to WW$ can be an order of magnitude larger
than the contribution to $H \to WW$. Thus, future precise measurements of
$pp\to WW$ will further constrain the parameters of the model. In addition, we
also consider possible contributions to $pp\to WW$ from the heavy Higgs decays
into a new charged lepton $e_4$ ($H\to e_4 \mu \to W \mu \nu_\mu$), exotic SM
Higgs decays, and pair production of vectorlike leptons.
