A breast neoplasia is often marked by the presence of microcalcifications and
massive lesions in the mammogram: hence the need for tools able to recognize
such lesions at an early stage. Our collaboration, among italian physicists and
radiologists, has built a large distributed database of digitized mammographic
images and has developed a Computer Aided Detection (CADe) system for the
automatic analysis of mammographic images and installed it in some Italian
hospitals by a GRID connection. Regarding microcalcifications, in our CADe
digital mammogram is divided into wide windows which are processed by a
convolution filter; after a self-organizing map analyzes each window and
produces 8 principal components which are used as input of a neural network
(FFNN) able to classify the windows matched to a threshold. Regarding massive
lesions we select all important maximum intensity position and define the ROI
radius. From each ROI found we extract the parameters which are used as input
in a FFNN to distinguish between pathological and non-pathological ROI. We
present here a test of our CADe system, used as a second reader and a
comparison with another (commercial) CADe system.
