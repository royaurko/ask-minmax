The 2014 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa is the largest outbreak
of the genus Ebolavirus to date. To better understand the spread of infection
in the affected countries, it is crucial to know the number of secondary cases
generated by an infected index case in the absence and presence of control
measures, i.e., the basic and effective reproduction number. In this study, I
describe the EBOV epidemic using an SEIR
(susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model and fit the model to the most
recent reported data of infected cases and deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and
Liberia. The maximum likelihood estimates of the basic reproduction number are
1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50-1.52) for Guinea, 2.53 (95% CI:
2.41-2.67) for Sierra Leone and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.57-1.60) for Liberia. The model
indicates that in Guinea and Sierra Leone the effective reproduction number
might have dropped to around unity by the end of May and July 2014,
respectively. In Liberia, however, the model estimates no decline in the
effective reproduction number by end-August 2014. This suggests that control
efforts in Liberia need to be improved substantially in order to stop the
current outbreak.
