I summarize in terms of evolutionary population synthesis models our current
understanding of stellar populations in different environments, from star
clusters in nearby galaxies to distant galaxies in clusters or seen through
gravitational lenses. Constraints on the age of the stellar populations in
clusters and galaxies derived from comparing predicted and observed spectral
energy distributions are examined and contrasted with the maximum ages allowed
by cosmological models at the corresponding redshift.
