Four is the maximum number of texture zeros allowed in the Yukawa coupling
matrix of three massive neutrinos. These completely fix the high scale CP
violation needed for leptogenesis in terms of that accessible at laboratory
energies. $\mu\tau$ symmetry drastically reduces such allowed textures. Only
one form of the light neutrinos mass matrix survives comfortably while another
is marginally allowed.
