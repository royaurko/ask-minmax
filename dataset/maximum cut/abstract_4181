We examine the production of a new $Z'$ gauge boson in association with
photons or jets at future hadron supercolliders as a probe of its couplings to
fermions. Associated jet production is found to be rather insensitive to these
couplings and suffers from large uncertainties as well as substantial
backgrounds. On the other hand, the ratio of rates for associated photon $Z'$
production to that of conventional $Z'$ production has a rather clean signature
(once appropriate cuts are made), and is found to be quite sensitive to the
choice of extended electroweak model, while being simultaneously insensitive to
structure function uncertainties and QCD corrections. Rates at both the SSC and
LHC are significant for $Z'$ masses in the 1 TeV range.
