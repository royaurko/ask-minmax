LSQ14bdq and SN 2006oz are super-luminous, hydrogen-poor, SNe with
double-humped light curves. We show that a Quark-Nova (QN; explosive transition
of the neutron star to a quark star) occurring in a massive binary,
experiencing two Common Envelope (CE) phases, can quantitatively explain the
light curves of LSQ14bdq and SN 2006oz. The more massive component (A) explodes
first as a normal SN, yielding a Neutron Star which ejects the hydrogen
envelope of the companion when the system enters its first CE phase. During the
second CE phase, the NS spirals into and inflates the second He-rich CE. In the
process it gains mass and triggers a Quark-Nova, outside of the CO core,
leaving behind a Quark Star. The first hump in our model is the QN shock
re-energizing the expanded He-rich CE. The QN occurs when the He-rich envelope
is near maximum size (~ 1000R_sun) and imparts enough energy to unbind and
eject the envelope. Subsequent merging of the Quark Star with the CO core of
component B, driven by gravitational radiation, turns the Quark star to a Black
Hole. The ensuing Black Hole accretion provides sufficient power for the second
brighter and long lasting hump. Our model suggests a possible connection
between SLSNe-I and type Ic-BL SNe which occur when the Quark Nova is triggered
inside the CO core. We estimate the rate of QNe in massive binaries during the
second CE phase to be ~ 5x10^(-5) of that of core-collapse SNe.
