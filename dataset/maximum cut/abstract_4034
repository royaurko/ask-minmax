Silver films were deposited at room temperature onto H-passivated Si(111)
surfaces. Their electronic properties have been analyzed by angle-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy. Submonolayer films were semiconducting and the
onset of metallization was found at a Ag coverage of $\sim$0.6 monolayers. Two
surface states were observed at $\bar{\Gamma}$-point in the metallic films,
with binding energies of 0.1 and 0.35 eV. By measurements of photoelectron
angular distribution at the Fermi level in these films, a cross-sectional cut
of the Fermi surface was obtained. The Fermi vector determined along different
symmetry directions and the photoelectron lifetime of states at the Fermi level
are quite close to those expected for Ag single crystal. In spite of this
concordance, the Fermi surface reflects a sixfold symmetry rather than the
threefold symmetry of Ag single crystal. This behavior was attributed to the
fact that these Ag films are composed by two domains rotated 60$^o$.
