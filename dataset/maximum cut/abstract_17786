Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green's function, multiple-scattering theory is
an efficient site-centered, electronic-structure technique for addressing an
assembly of $N$ scatterers. Wave-functions are expanded in a spherical-wave
basis on each scattering center and indexed up to a maximum orbital and
azimuthal number $L_{max}=(l,m)_{max}$, while scattering matrices, which
determine spectral properties, are truncated at $L_{tr}=(l,m)_{tr}$ where phase
shifts $\delta_{l>l_{tr}}$ are negligible. Historically, $L_{max}$ is set equal
to $L_{tr}$; however, a more proper procedure retains free-electron and
single-site contributions for $L_{max}>L_{tr}$ with $\delta_{l>l_{tr}}$ set to
zero [Zhang and Butler, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 46}, 7433]. We present a numerically
efficient and accurate \emph{augmented}-KKR Green's function formalism that
solves the KKR secular equations by matrix inversion [$\mathcal{R}^3$ process
with rank $N(l_{tr}+1)^2$] and includes higher-order $L$ contributions via
linear algebra [$\mathcal{R}^2$ process with rank $N(l_{max}+1)^2$].
Augmented-KKR yields properly normalized wave-functions, numerically cheaper
basis-set convergence, and a total charge density and electron count that
agrees with Lloyd's formula. For fcc Cu, bcc Fe and L$1_0$ CoPt, we present the
formalism and numerical results for accuracy and for the convergence of the
total energies, Fermi energies, and magnetic moments versus $L_{max}$ for a
given $L_{tr}$.
