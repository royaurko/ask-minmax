In this paper, the study of bivariate generalised beta type I and II
distributions is extended to the complex matrix variate case, for which the
corresponding density functions are found. In addition, for complex bimatrix
variate beta type I distributions, several basic properties, including the
joint eigenvalue density and the maximum eigenvalue distribution, are studied.
