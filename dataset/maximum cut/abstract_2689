Known results on the generalized Davenport constant related to zero-sum
sequences over a finite abelian group are extended to the generalized Noether
number related to the rings of polynomial invariants of an arbitrary finite
group. An improved general upper bound is given on the degrees of polynomial
invariants of a non-cyclic finite group which cut out the zero vector.
