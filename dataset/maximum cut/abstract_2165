A new approach to the analysis of soft and semihard hadron processes is
suggested. In the frame of the Quark-Gluon String Model the interaction of
valence quarks and diquarks and sea quarks (antiquarks) of colliding hadrons is
taken into account. This one is calculated as the exchange by one
nonpertubative gluon, i.e., the cut-off parameter in the gluonic propagator is
included. This one allows us to analise the inclusive hadron spectra in hadron
collisions at transverse momenta up to 3-4 Gev/c.
