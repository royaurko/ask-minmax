New results of a search for the ultra-rare decay $\mu \to e \gamma$ by the
MEG collaboration are reported in this contribution. The data were taken during
2009 and correspond to approximately 6.5 10$^{13}$ muon stopped on target. A
maximum likelihood analysis sets an upper limit at 90\% C.L. on the branching
ratio, BF($\mu \to e \gamma$) $< $1.5 10$^{-11}$. The results presented here
are preliminary.
