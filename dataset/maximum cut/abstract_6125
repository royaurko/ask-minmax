The objective of the paper is to identify and investigate all possible types
of asymptotic behavior for the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown
parameters in the second-order linear stochastic ordinary differential equation
driven by Gaussian white noise. The emphasis is on the non-ergodic case, when
the roots of the corresponding characteristic equation are not both in the left
half-plane.
