An extension of the notion of concurrence introduced by Wooters is used to
quantify the entanglement of certain multipartite pure states, namely, the BCS
state of superconducting compounds. This leads to a definition of the
macrocanonical entanglement of pairing (MEP) for which we compute an analytical
formula in terms of two adimensional numbers, the cut-off and gap numbers,
which depend on measurable physical quantities. We find that strongly coupled
BCS elements like Pb and Nb have much larger MEP values than more conventional
BCS transition metal superconductors.
