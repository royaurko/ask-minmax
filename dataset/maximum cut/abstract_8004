We calculate the Casimir energy-momentum tensor induced in a scalar field by
a macroscopic ultrastatic spherically-symmetric long-throated traversable
wormhole, and examine whether this exotic matter is sufficient to stabilise the
wormhole itself. The Casimir energy-momentum tensor is obtained (within the
$\mathbb{R}\times S_2$ throat) by a mode sum approach, using a sharp energy
cut-off and the Abel-Plana formula; Lorentz invariance is then restored by use
of a Pauli-Villars regulator. The massless conformally-coupled case is found to
have a logarithmic divergence (which we renormalise) and a conformal anomaly,
the thermodynamic relevance of which is discussed. Provided the throat radius
is above some fixed length, the renormalised Casimir energy-density is seen to
be negative by all timelike observers, and almost all null rays; furthermore,
it has sufficient magnitude to stabilise a long-throated wormhole far larger
than the Planck scale, at least in principle. Unfortunately, the renormalised
Casimir energy-density is zero for null rays directed exactly parallel to the
throat, and this shortfall prevents us from stabilising the ultrastatic
spherically-symmetric wormhole considered here. Nonetheless, the negative
Casimir energy does allow the wormhole to collapse extremely slowly, its
lifetime growing without bound as the throat-length is increased. We find that
the throat closes slowly enough that its central region can be safely traversed
by a pulse of light.
