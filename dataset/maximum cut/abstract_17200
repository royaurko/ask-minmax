We present theory and algorithms to perform an all-sky coherent search for
periodic signals of gravitational waves in narrow-band data of a detector. Our
search is based on a statistic, commonly called the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic,
derived from the maximum-likelihood principle in Paper I of this series. We
briefly review the response of a ground-based detector to the
gravitational-wave signal from a rotating neuron star and the derivation of the
$\mathcal{F}$-statistic. We present several algorithms to calculate efficiently
this statistic. In particular our algorithms are such that one can take
advantage of the speed of fast Fourier transform (FFT) in calculation of the
$\mathcal{F}$-statistic. We construct a grid in the parameter space such that
the nodes of the grid coincide with the Fourier frequencies. We present
interpolation methods that approximately convert the two integrals in the
$\mathcal{F}$-statistic into Fourier transforms so that the FFT algorithm can
be applied in their evaluation. We have implemented our methods and algorithms
into computer codes and we present results of the Monte Carlo simulations
performed to test these codes.
