In the framework of spherical geometry for jellium and local spin density
approximation, we have obtained the equilibrium $r_s$ values,
$\bar{r}_s(N,\zeta)$, of neutral and singly ionized "generic" $N$-electron
clusters for their various spin polarizations, $\zeta$. Our results reveal that
$\bar{r}_s(N,\zeta)$ as a function of $\zeta$ behaves differently depending on
whether $N$ corresponds to a closed-shell or an open-shell cluster. That is,
for a closed-shell one, $\bar{r}_s(N,\zeta)$ is an increasing function of
$\zeta$ over the whole range $0\le\zeta\le 1$, and for an open-shell one, it
has a decreasing part corresponding to the range $0<\zeta\le\zeta_0$, where
$\zeta_0$ is a polarization that the cluster assumes in a configuration
consistent with Hund's first rule.
  In the context of the stabilized spin-polarized jellium model, our
calculations based on these equilibrium $r_s$ values, $\bar{r}_s(N,\zeta)$,
show that instead of the maximum spin compensation (MSC) rule, Hund's first
rule governs the minimum-energy configuration. We therefore conclude that the
increasing behavior of the equilibrium $r_s$ values over the whole range of
$\zeta$ is a necessary condition for obtaining the MSC rule for the
minimum-energy configuration; and the only way to end up with an increasing
behavior over the whole range of $\zeta$ is to break the spherical geometry of
the jellium background. This is the reason why the results based on simple
jellium with spheroidal or ellipsoidal geometries show up MSC rule.
