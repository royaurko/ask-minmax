The ability to manipulate or separate a biological small particle, such as a
living cell and embryo, is fundamental needed to many biological and medical
applications. The insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) trapping is composed
of conductless tetragon structures in micro-chip. In this study, a lower
conductive material of photoresist was adopted as a structure in open-top
microchannel instead of a metallic wire to squeeze the electric field in a
conducting solution, therefore, creating a high field gradient with a local
maximum. The microchip with the open-top microchannels was designed and
fabricated herein. The insulator-based DEP trapping microchip with the open-top
microchannels was designed and fabricated in this work. The cells trapped by
DEP force could be further treated or cultured in the open-top microchannel ;
however, those trapped in the microchip with enclosed microchannels could not
be proceeded easily.
