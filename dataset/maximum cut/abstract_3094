We make remarks on the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) for studies of the
spectral function of hadronic correlators in finite temperature lattice QCD. We
discuss the virtues and subtlety of MEM in the cases that one does not have
enough number of data points such as at finite temperature. Taking these points
into account, we suggest several tests which one should examine to keep the
reliability for the results, and also apply them using mock and lattice QCD
data.
