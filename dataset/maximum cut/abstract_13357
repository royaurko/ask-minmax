We give a necessary and sufficient geometric structural condition for a
stable codimension 1 integral varifold on a smooth Riemannian manifold to
correspond to an embedded smooth hypersurface away from a small set of
generally unavoidable singularities; when this condition is satisfied, the
singular set is empty if the dimension of the varifold is 6 or smaller,
discrete if the dimension is 7 and has Hausdorff codimension at least 7 if the
dimension is 8 or larger. No initial smallness assumption on the singular set
is necessary for these conclusions. The work in particular settles the long
standing question, left open by the Schoen-Simon Regularity Theory, as to which
weakest size hypothesis on the singular set guarantees the validity of the
above conclusions. An optimal strong maximum principle for stationary
codimension 1 integral varifolds follows.
