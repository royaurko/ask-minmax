We consider Standard Model Higgs boson production through gluon--gluon fusion
in hadron collisions. We combine the calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading
order QCD corrections to the inclusive cross section with the resummation of
multiple soft-gluon emissions at small transverse momenta up to
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The calculation is implemented in
the numerical program HRes and allows us to retain the full kinematics of the
Higgs boson and of its decay products. We present selected numerical results
for the signal cross section at the LHC (\sqrt{s}=8 TeV), in the H->2gamma,
H->WW->lnu lnu and H->ZZ->4l decay channels by using the nominal cuts applied
in current Higgs boson searches by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations.
