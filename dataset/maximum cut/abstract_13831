Boxicity of a graph H, denoted by box(H), is the minimum integer k such that
H is an intersection graph of axis-parallel k-dimensional boxes in R^k. In this
paper, we show that for a line graph G of a multigraph, box(G) <=
2\Delta(\lceil log_2(log_2(\Delta)) \rceil + 3) + 1, where \Delta denotes the
maximum degree of G. Since \Delta <= 2(\chi - 1), for any line graph G with
chromatic number \chi, box(G) = O(\chi log_2(log_2(\chi))). For the
d-dimensional hypercube H_d, we prove that box(H_d) >= (\lceil log_2(log_2(d))
\rceil + 1)/2. The question of finding a non-trivial lower bound for box(H_d)
was left open by Chandran and Sivadasan in [L. Sunil Chandran and Naveen
Sivadasan. The cubicity of Hypercube Graphs. Discrete Mathematics,
308(23):5795-5800, 2008]. The above results are consequences of bounds that we
obtain for the boxicity of fully subdivided graphs (a graph which can be
obtained by subdividing every edge of a graph exactly once).
