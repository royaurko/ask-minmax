On a nonrelativistic contact four-fermion model we have shown that the simple
Lambda-cut-off prescription together with definite fine-tuning of the Lambda
dependency of "bare"quantities lead to self-adjoint semi-bounded Hamiltonian in
one-, two- and three-particle sectors. The fixed self-adjoint extension and
exact solutions in two-particle sector completely define three-particle
problem. The renormalized Faddeev equations for the bound states with Fredholm
properties are obtained and analyzed.
