In this work, we study analytically the Schr\"odinger equation for the
potential of a dipolar ion (non-pure dipole) V(r)=q/r+Dcos{\theta}/r2 in the
case of 2D systems using the separation of variables and the Mathieu equations
for the angular part. We give the expressions of eigenenergies and
eigenfunctions and we study the dependence of these solutions according to the
dipole moment D. The condition of reality for the energies E_{n,m} imposes that
the dipole moment must not exceed a maximum value otherwise the corresponding
bound state disappears. We have also found that the s states (m=0) can no
longer exist in the system as soon as the dipole term is present.
