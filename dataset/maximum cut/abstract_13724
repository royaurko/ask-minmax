In this work the growth of density perturbations in Kantowski-Sachs
cosmologies with a positive cosmological constant is studied, using the 1+3 and
1+1+2 covariant formalisms. For each wave number we obtain a closed system for
scalars formed from quantities that are zero on the background and hence are
gauge-invariant. The solutions to this system are then analyzed both
analytically and numerically. In particular the effects of anisotropy and the
behaviour close to a bounce in the cosmic scale factor are considered. We find
that typically the density gradient in the bouncing directions experiences a
local maximum at or slightly after the bounce.
