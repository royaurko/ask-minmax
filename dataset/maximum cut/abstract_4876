Experimental prospects for studying high-energy photon-photon and
photon-proton interactions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are
discussed. Cross sections are calculated for many electroweak and beyond the
Standard Model processes. Selection strategies based on photon interaction
tagging techniques are studied. Assuming a typical LHC multipurpose detector,
various signals and their irreducible backgrounds are presented after applying
acceptance cuts. Prospects are discussed for the Higgs boson search, detection
of supersymmetric particles and of anomalous quartic gauge couplings, as well
as for the top quark physics.
