We have carried out 2-D simulations of core-collapse supernova explosions.
The local neutrino radiation field is assumed to have its maximum value either
at the symmetry (polar) axis or on the equatorial plane. These lead to the
prolate and oblate explosions, respectively. We find that the gain of the
explosion energy in the prolate explosion evolves more predominately than that
in the oblate one when the total neutrino luminosity is given. Namely, the
prolate explosion is more energetic than the oblate one.
  One of the contributors (Shimizu et al. 2001) showed for the first time that
globally anisotropic neutrino radiation produces more powerful explosion than
the spherical neutrino radiation does. In our previous study (Madokoro et al.
2003), we improved the numerical code of Shimizu et al. and demonstrated that
the globally anisotropic neutrino radiation yields more energetic explosion
than spatially-fluctuated neutrino radiation does. Together with the result of
this paper, we conclude that the globally anisotropic (prolate) neutrino
radiation is the most effective way of increasing the explosion energy among
various types of explosions investigated in these studies. We discuss the
reason for this. Our result is suggestive of the fact that the expanding
materials of SN1987A is observed to have a prolate geometry.
