Direct numeric simulation of the Biot-Savart equation readily resolves the
17/5 spectrum of the Kelvin-wave cascade from the 11/3 spectrum of the
non-local (in the wavenumber space) cascade scenario by L'vov and Nazarenko.
This result is a clear-cut visualisation of the unphysical nature of the 11/3
solution, which was established earlier on the grounds of symmetry.
