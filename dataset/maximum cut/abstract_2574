We employ cut and paste contact topological techniques to classify some tight
contact structures on the closed, oriented genus-2 surface times the interval.
A boundary condition is specified so that the Euler class of the of the contact
structure vanishes when evaluated on each boundary component. We prove that
there exists a unique, non-product tight contact structure in this case.
