The usual configuration of uniaxial whispering gallery mode resonators is a
disk shaped geometry where the optic axis points along the symmetry axis, a so
called z-cut resonator. Recently x-cut resonators, where the optic axis lies in
the equatorial plane, became of interest as they enable extremely broadband
second harmonic generation. In this paper we report on the properties of a more
generalized system, the so called angle-cut resonator, where the optic axis
exhibits an arbitrary angle against the symmetry axis. We show experimentally
that the modal structure and quality factors are similar to common resonators
but that the polarization properties differ quite significantly: due to the
asymmetry the polarization depends on the equatorial position and is, in
general, elliptical.
