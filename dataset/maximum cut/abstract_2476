The rising algebra is a subalgebra of the group algebra of the symmetric
group S_n, gotten by lumping together permutations having the same number of
rising sequences. This well-known algebra arises naturally when studying riffle
shuffles. Here we introduce a number of other subalgebras that arise naturally
when studying `ruffles', which are like riffles except that after cutting the
deck you turn over the bunch of cards that were on the bottom.
