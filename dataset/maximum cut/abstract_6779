Let $E_d(n)$ be the maximum number of pairs that can be selected from a set
of $n$ points in $R^d$ such that the midpoints of these pairs are convexly
independent. We show that $E_2(n)\geq \Omega(n\sqrt{\log n})$, which answers a
question of Eisenbrand, Pach, Rothvo\ss, and Sopher (2008) on large convexly
independent subsets in Minkowski sums of finite planar sets, as well as a
question of Halman, Onn, and Rothblum (2007). We also show that
$\lfloor\frac{1}{3}n^2\rfloor\leq E_3(n)\leq \frac{3}{8}n^2+O(n^{3/2})$.
  Let $W_d(n)$ be the maximum number of pairwise nonparallel unit distance
pairs in a set of $n$ points in some $d$-dimensional strictly convex normed
space. We show that $W_2(n)=\Theta(E_2(n))$ and for $d\geq 3$ that
$W_d(n)\sim\frac12\left(1-\frac{1}{a(d)}\right)n^2$, where $a(d)\in N$ is
related to strictly antipodal families. In fact we show that the same
asymptotics hold without the requirement that the unit distance pairs form
pairwise nonparallel segments, and also if diameter pairs are considered
instead of unit distance pairs.
