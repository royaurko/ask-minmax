We determine analytically the distribution of conductances of quasi
one-dimensional disordered electron systems, neglecting electron-electron
interaction, for all strengths of disorder. We find that in the crossover
region between the metallic and insulating regimes, P(g) is highly asymmetric,
given by ``one-sided'' log-normal distribution. For larger disorder, the tail
of the log-normal distribution is cut-off for g > 1 by a Gaussian.
