Wireless physical-layer security is an emerging field of research aiming at
preventing eavesdropping in an open wireless medium. In this paper, we propose
a novel waveform design approach to minimize the likelihood that a message
transmitted between trusted single-antenna nodes is intercepted by an
eavesdropper. In particular, with knowledge first of the eavesdropper's channel
state information (CSI), we find the optimum waveform and transmit energy that
minimize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of
the eavesdropper's maximum-SINR linear filter, while at the same time provide
the intended receiver with a required pre-specified SINR at the output of its
own max-SINR filter. Next, if prior knowledge of the eavesdropper's CSI is
unavailable, we design a waveform that maximizes the amount of energy available
for generating disturbance to eavesdroppers, termed artificial noise (AN),
while the SINR of the intended receiver is maintained at the pre-specified
level. The extensions of the secure waveform design problem to multiple
intended receivers are also investigated and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) -an
approximation technique based on convex optimization- is utilized to solve the
arising NP-hard design problems. Extensive simulation studies confirm our
analytical performance predictions and illustrate the benefits of the designed
waveforms on securing single-input single-output (SISO) transmissions and
multicasting.
