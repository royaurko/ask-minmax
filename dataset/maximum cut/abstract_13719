For any given integer $r \geq 1$ and a quasitoric braid
$\beta_r=(\sigma_r^{-\epsilon} \sigma_{r-1}^{\epsilon}...$ $
\sigma_{1}^{(-1)^{r}\epsilon})^3$ with $\epsilon=\pm 1$, we prove that the
maximum degree in $z$ of the HOMFLYPT polynomial $P_{W_2(\hat\beta_r)}(v,z)$ of
the doubled link $W_2(\hat\beta_r)$ of the closure $\hat\beta_r$ is equal to
$6r-1$. As an application, we give a family $\mathcal K^3$ of alternating
knots, including $(2,n)$ torus knots, 2-bridge knots and alternating pretzel
knots as its subfamilies, such that the minimal crossing number of any
alternating knot in $\mathcal K^3$ coincides with the canonical genus of its
Whitehead double. Consequently, we give a new family $\mathcal K^3$ of
alternating knots for which Tripp's conjecture holds.
