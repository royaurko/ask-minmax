Spatial heterogeneity plays an important role in complex ecosystem dynamics
and, thus, is an important consideration in harvesting theory. However, little
is known about how spatial effects can influence predictions derived from a
non-spatial harvest model. Here, we extended the Schaefer model, a classical
non-spatial harvest model that is used in resource management to a
spatially-explicit harvest model by integrating environmental heterogeneities
as well as species migrations between patches. By comparing the outputs of both
models, we aimed to examine the effects of spatial heterogeneity on maximum
sustainable yields (MSY). When spatial heterogeneity existed, we found that the
Schaefer model tended to overestimate MSY. By assuming a well-mixed population,
we showed that the Schaefer model always overestimated the MSY, regardless of
the number of patches, and that the degree of overestimation becomes
significant when spatial heterogeneity is marked. Collectively, these results
highlight the importance of explicitly considering differences in spatial
structure to prevent overharvesting resources.
