The neutralino-proton cross section is examined for supergravity models with
R-parity invariance with universal and non-universal soft breaking. The region
of parameter space that dark matter detectors are currently (or will be
shortly) sensitive i.e. $(0.1-10)\times 10^{-6}$ pb, is examined. For universal
soft breaking (mSUGRA), detectors with sensitivity
$\sigma_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}-p} \geq 1 \times 10^{-6}$ pb will be able to
sample parts of the parameter space for $\tan \beta \stackrel{>}{\sim} 25$.
Current relic density bounds restrict $m_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}} \leq 120$ GeV
for the maximum cross sections, which is below where astronomical uncertainties
about the Milky Way are relevant. Nonuniversal soft breaking models can allow
much larger cross sections and can sample the parameter space for $\tan \beta
\stackrel{>}{\sim} 4$. In such models, $m_0$ can be quite large reducing the
tension between proton decay bounds and dark matter analysis. We note the
existance of two new domains where coannihilation effects can enter, i.e. for
mSUGRA at large $\tan \beta$, and for nonuniversal models with small $\tan
\beta$.
