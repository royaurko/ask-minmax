Considering the static solutions of the D-dimensional nonlinear Schroedinger
equation with trap and attractive two-body interactions, the existence of
stable solutions is limited to a maximum critical number of particles, when D
is greater or equal 2. In case D=2, we compare the variational approach with
the exact numerical calculations. We show that, the addition of a positive
three-body interaction allows stable solutions beyond the critical number. In
this case, we also introduce a dynamical analysis of the conditions for the
collapse.
