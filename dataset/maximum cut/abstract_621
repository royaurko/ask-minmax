We improve some ancient results of Velickovic on the cut and
choose (c&c) game on complete Boolean algebras.
 (1) If Nonempty has a winning strategy for c&c game on $B$ then $B$ is
semiproper.
 (2) If Nonempty has a winning strategy and $B$ has $2^{\aleph _0}$ -c.c. then
Nonempty has a winning strategy in the descending chain game.
 (3) Cons ($B$ is $\aleph _1$-distributive implies Nonempty has a winning
strategy in c&c on $B$ )
  We also give some new examples of forcings where Nonempty has or does not
have a winning strategy in c&c game.
