We report near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of twelve
``Branch-normal'' Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) which cover the wavelength region
from 0.8-2.5 microns. Our sample more than doubles the number of SNe Ia with
published NIR spectra within three weeks of maximum light. The epochs of
observation range from thirteen days before maximum light to eighteen days
after maximum light. A detailed model for a Type Ia supernovae is used to
identify spectral features. The Doppler shifts of lines are measured to obtain
the velocity and, thus, the radial distribution of elements.
  The NIR is an extremely useful tool to probe the chemical structure in the
layers of SNe Ia ejecta. This wavelength region is optimal for examining
certain products of the SNe Ia explosion that may be blended or obscured in
other spectral regions. We identify spectral features from MgII, CaII, SiII,
FeII, CoII, NiII and possibly MnII. We find no indications for hydrogen, helium
or carbon in the spectra. The spectral features reveal important clues about
the physical characteristics of SNe Ia. We use the features to derive upper
limits for the amount of unburned matter, to identify the transition regions
from explosive carbon to oxygen burning and from partial to complete silicon
burning, and to estimate the level of mixing during and after the explosion.
