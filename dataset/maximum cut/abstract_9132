A new iron pnictide LiFeP superconductor was found. The compound crystallizes
into a Cu2Sb structure containing an FeP layer showing superconductivity with
maximum Tc of 6K. This is the first 111 type iron pnictide superconductor
containing no arsenic. The new superconductor is featured with itinerant
behavior at normal state that could helpful to understand the novel
superconducting mechanism of iron pnictide compounds.
