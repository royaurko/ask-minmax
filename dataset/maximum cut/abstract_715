We extend the notion of generalized unitarity cuts to accommodate loop
integrals with higher powers of propagators. Such integrals frequently arise in
for example integration-by-parts identities, Schwinger parametrizations and
Mellin-Barnes representations. The method is applied to reduction of integrals
with doubled and tripled propagators and direct extract of integral
coefficients at one and two loops. Our algorithm is based on degenerate
multivariate residues and computational algebraic geometry.
