In this paper, the asymptotic performance of the lattice sequential decoder
for LAttice Space-Time (LAST) coded MIMO channel is analyzed. We determine the
rates achievable by lattice coding and sequential decoding applied to such a
channel. The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) under lattice sequential
decoding is derived as a function of its parameter---the bias term, which is
critical for controlling the amount of computations required at the decoding
stage. Achieving low decoding complexity requires increasing the value of the
bias term. However, this is done at the expense of losing the optimal tradeoff
of the channel. In this work, we derive the tail distribution of the decoder's
computational complexity in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. Our analysis
reveals that the tail distribution of such a low complexity decoder is
dominated by the outage probability of the channel for the underlying coding
scheme. Also, the tail exponent of the complexity distribution is shown to be
equivalent to the DMT achieved by lattice coding and lattice sequential
decoding schemes. We derive the asymptotic average complexity of the sequential
decoder as a function of the system parameters. In particular, we show that
there exists a cut-off multiplexing gain for which the average computational
complexity of the decoder remains bounded.
