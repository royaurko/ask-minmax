The main paradigm of smoothed analysis on graphs suggests that for any large
graph $G$ in a certain class of graphs, perturbing slightly the edges of $G$ at
random (usually adding few random edges to $G$) typically results in a graph
having much "nicer" properties. In this work we study smoothed analysis on
trees or, equivalently, on connected graphs. Given an $n$-vertex connected
graph $G$, form a random supergraph $G^*$ of $G$ by turning every pair of
vertices of $G$ into an edge with probability $\frac{\epsilon}{n}$, where
$\epsilon$ is a small positive constant. This perturbation model has been
studied previously in several contexts, including smoothed analysis, small
world networks, and combinatorics.
  Connected graphs can be bad expanders, can have very large diameter, and
possibly contain no long paths. In contrast, we show that if $G$ is an
$n$-vertex connected graph then typically $G^*$ has edge expansion
$\Omega(\frac{1}{\log n})$, diameter $O(\log n)$, vertex expansion
$\Omega(\frac{1}{\log n})$, and contains a path of length $\Omega(n)$, where
for the last two properties we additionally assume that $G$ has bounded maximum
degree. Moreover, we show that if $G$ has bounded degeneracy, then typically
the mixing time of the lazy random walk on $G^*$ is $O(\log^2 n)$. All these
results are asymptotically tight.
