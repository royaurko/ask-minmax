We analyse the wavelet shrinkage algorithm of Donoho and Johnstone in order
to assess the quality of the reconstruction of a signal obtained from noisy
samples. We prove deviation bounds for the maximum of the squares of the error,
and for the average of the squares of the error, under the assumption that the
signal comes from a H"older class, and the noise samples are independent, of 0
mean, and bounded. Our main technique is Talgrand's isoperimetric theorem. Our
bounds refine the known expectations for the average of the squares of the
error.
