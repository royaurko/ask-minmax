We construct three families of general magnetostatic axisymmetric exact
solutions of Einstein-Maxwell equations in spherical coordinates, prolate, and
oblates. The solutions obtained are then presented in the system of generalized
spheroidal coordinates which is a generalization of the previous systems. The
method used to build such solutions is the well-known complex potential
formalism proposed by Ernst, using as seed solutions vacuum solutions of the
Einstein field equations. We show explicitly some particular solutions among
them a magnetized Erez-Rosen solution and a magnetized Morgan-Morgan solution,
which we interpret as the exterior gravitational field of a finite dislike
source immersed in a magnetic field. From them we also construct using the well
known "displace, cut and reflect" method exact solutions representing
relativistic thin disks of infinite extension. We then analyze the motion of
electrically charged test particles around these fields for equatorial circular
orbits and we discuss their stability against radial perturbations. For
magnetized Morgan-Morgan fields we find that inside of disk the presence of
magnetic field provides the possibility of to find relativist charged particles
moving in both prograde and retrograde direction.
