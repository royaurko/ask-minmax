Recently developed chiral nucleon-nucleon (NN) forces at next-to-leading
order (NLO) that describe NN phase shifts up to about 100 MeV fairly well have
been applied to 3N and 4N systems. Faddeev-Yakubovsky equations have been
solved rigorously. The chiral NLO forces depend on a momentum cut-off \Lambda
lying between 540-600 MeV/c. The resulting 3N and 4N binding energies are in
the same range as found using standard NN potentials. In additon, low-energy 3N
scattering observables are very well reproduced like for standard NN forces.
Surprisingly, the long standing A_y-puzzle is resolved at NLO. The cut-off
dependence of the scattering observables is rather mild.
