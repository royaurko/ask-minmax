The key point limits to define the {\it statistical model} describing the
data distribution. Hence, it turns out that the characteristics related to the
so-called. Inverse Tully-Fisher relation and the Direct relation are maximum
likelyhood (ML) estimators of different statistical models, and we obtain
coherent distance estimates as long as the same model is used for the
calibration of the TF relation and for the determination of distances. The
choice of the model is motivated by reasons of {\it robustness} of statistics,
which depends on selection effects in observation.
