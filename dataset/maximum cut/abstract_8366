We investigate the effects of electron correlations on the ground state
energy and the chemical potential of a droplet confined by a parabolic
potential at high magnetic fields. We demonstrate the importance of
correlations in estimating the transition field at which the first edge
reconstruction of the maximum density droplet occurs in the spin polarized
regime.
