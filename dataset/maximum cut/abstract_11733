We study the influence of filament elasticity on the motion of collective
molecular motors. It is found that for a backbone flexibility exceeding a
characteristic value (motor stiffness divided through the mean displacement
between attached motors), the ability of motors to produce force reduces as
compared to rigidly coupled motors, while the maximum velocity remains
unchanged. The force-velocity-relation in two different analytic approximations
is calculated and compared with Monte-Carlo simulations. Finally, we extend our
model by introducing motors with a strain-dependent detachment rate. A
remarkable crossover from the nearly hyperbolic shape of the Hill curve for
stiff backbones to a linear force-velocity relation for very elastic backbones
is found. With realistic model parameters we show that the backbone flexibility
plays no role under physiological conditions in muscles, but it should be
observable in certain in vitro assays.
