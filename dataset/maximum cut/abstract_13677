The stability of radially anisotropic spherical stellar systems in modified
Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is explored by means of numerical simulations
performed with the N-body code N-MODY. We find that Osipkov-Merritt MOND models
require for stability larger minimum anisotropy radius than equivalent
Newtonian systems (ENSs) with dark matter, and also than purely baryonic
Newtonian models with the same density profile. The maximum value for stability
of the Fridman-Polyachenko-Shukhman parameter in MOND models is lower than in
ENSs, but higher than in Newtonian models with no dark matter. We conclude that
MOND systems are substantially more prone to radial-orbit instability than ENSs
with dark matter, while they are able to support a larger amount of kinetic
energy stored in radial orbits than purely baryonic Newtonian systems. An
explanation of these results is attempted, and their relevance to the MOND
interpretation of the observed kinematics of globular clusters, dwarf
spheroidal and elliptical galaxies is briefly discussed.
