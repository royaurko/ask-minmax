A system of two static quarks, at fixed distances r, and two light quarks is
studied on an anisotropic lattice. Excitations by operators emphasizing quark
or gluon degrees of freedom are examined. The maximum entropy method is applied
in the spectral analysis. These simulations ultimately aim at learning about
mechanisms of hadronic interaction.
