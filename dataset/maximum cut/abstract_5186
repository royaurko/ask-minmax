MOST observations and model analysis of the Herbig Ae star HD 34282 (V1366
Ori) reveal {\delta}-Scuti pulsations. 22 frequencies are observed, 10 of which
confirm those previously identified by Amado et al. (2006), and 12 of which are
newly discovered in this work. We show that the weighted-average frequency in
each group fits the radial p-mode frequencies of viable models. We argue that
the observed pulsation spectrum extends just to the edge to the acoustic
cut-off frequency and show that this also is consistent with our best-fitting
models.
