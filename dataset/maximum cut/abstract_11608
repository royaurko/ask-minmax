The two-point autocorrelation function of ultra-high energy cosmic ray
(UHECR) arrival directions has a broad maximum around 25 degrees, combining the
data with energies above $4\times 10^{19}$ eV (in the HiRes energy scale) of
the HiRes stereo, AGASA, Yakutsk and SUGAR experiments. This signal is not or
only marginally present analyzing events of a single experiment, but becomes
significant when data from several experiments are added. Both the energy
dependence of the signal and its angular scale might be interpreted as first
signatures of the large-scale structure of UHECR sources and of intervening
magnetic fields.
