Inelastic neutron scattering measurements demonstrate that the magnetic
interactions in antiferromagnetic LaFeAsO are two-dimensional. Spin wave
velocities within the Fe layer and the magnitude of the spin gap are similar to
the \textit{A}Fe$_2$As$_2$ based materials. However, the ratio of interlayer
and intralayer exchange is found to be less than $\sim 10^{-4}$ in LaFeAsO,
very similar to the cuprates, and $\sim$ 100 times smaller than that found in
\textit{A}Fe$_2$As$_2$ compounds. The results suggest that the effective
dimensionality of the magnetic system is highly variable in the parent
compounds of the iron arsenides and weak 3-D interactions may limit the maximum
attainable superconducting $T_{c}$.
