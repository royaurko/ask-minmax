We consider Standard Model Higgs boson production by gluon--gluon fusion in
hadron collisions. We present a calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading
order QCD corrections to the cross section in the H->WW->lnu lnu and H->ZZ->4l
decay channels. The calculation is implemented in the parton level Monte Carlo
program HNNLO and allows us to apply arbitrary cuts on the final state leptons
and the associated jet activity. We present selected numerical results for the
signal cross section at the LHC, by using all the nominal cuts proposed for the
forthcoming Higgs boson search.
