The Zeno time has been calculated for a metastable two level atom tunneling
through a interacting thermal magnetic field. The process of weak measurement
has been utilized for the the estimation of the timescale. The temperature
dependence of the Zeno time has been shown. From the calculation it is evident
that the Zeno time decreases with the increase of temperature. Moreover, the
result restricts the Zeno time to a maximum limiting value, irrespective of how
frequent is the measurement process.
