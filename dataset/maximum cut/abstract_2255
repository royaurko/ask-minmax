The cross section for the production of the lightest neutral Higgs boson in
association with a high-pT hadronic jet, calculated in the framework of the
minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), is presented. The expectations
for the hadronic cross section at the Large Hadron Collider are discussed using
reasonable kinematical cuts. In particular the contributions from superpartner
loops to the cross section and their dependence on the parameters of the MSSM
are investigated and found to be significant. Comparisons show that the
production rate for h0 + jet in the MSSM can differ widely from the
corresponding standard-model prediction.
