Solutions of LiCl and of NaCl in ultrapure water were studied through
Rayleigh/Brillouin scattering as a function of the concentration (molarity, M)
of dissolved salt from 0.2M to extremely low concentration (2.10^-17 M ). The
Landau-Placzek ratio, R/B, of the Rayleigh scattering intensity over the total
Brillouin, was measured thanks to the dynamically controlled stability of the
used Fabry-Perot interferometer. It was observed that the R/B ratio follows two
stages as a function of increasing dilution rate: after a strong decrease
between 0.2M and 2.10^-5 M, it increases to reach a maximum between 10^-9 M and
10^-16 M. The first stage corresponds to the decrease of the Rayleigh
scattering by the ion concentration fluctuations with the decrease of salt
concentration. The second stage, at lower concentrations, is consistent with
the increase of the Rayleigh scattering by long-lived sub-microscopic bubbles
with the decrease of ion concentration. The origin of these sub-microscopic
bubbles is the shaking of the solutions which was carried out after each
centesimal dilution. The very long lifetime of the sub-microscopic bubbles and
the effects of aging originate in the electric charge of bubbles. The increase
of R/B with the decrease of the low salt concentration corresponds to the
increase of the sub-microscopic bubble size with the decrease of concentration,
that is imposed by the bubble stability due to the covering of the surface
bubble by negative ions.
