We show magnetotransport results on Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ ($0.0 \leq
x \leq 0.13$) single crystals. We identify the low temperature resistance step
at 23 K in the parent compound with the onset of filamentary superconductivity
(FLSC), which is suppressed by an applied magnetic field in a similar manner to
the suppression of bulk superconductivity (SC) in doped samples. FLSC is found
to persist across the phase diagram until the long range antiferromagnetic
order is completely suppressed. A significant suppression of FLSC occurs for
$0.02<x<0.04$, the doping concentration where bulk SC emerges. Based on these
results and the recent report of an electronic anisotropy maximum for 0.02
$\leq x \leq$ 0.04 [Science 329, 824 (2010)], we speculate that, besides spin
fluctuations, orbital fluctuations may also play an important role in the
emergence of SC in iron-based superconductors.
