The standard implementation of the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) follows Bryan
and deploys a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to limit the dimensionality of
the underlying solution space apriori. Here we present arguments based on the
shape of the SVD basis functions and numerical evidence from a mock data
analysis, which show that the correct Bayesian solution is not in general
recovered with this approach. As a remedy we propose to extend the search basis
systematically, which will eventually recover the full solution space and the
correct solution. In order to adequately approach problems where an
exponentially damped kernel is used, we provide an open-source implementation,
using the C/C++ language that utilizes high precision arithmetic adjustable at
run-time. The LBFGS algorithm is included in the code in order to attack
problems without the need to resort to a particular search space restriction.
