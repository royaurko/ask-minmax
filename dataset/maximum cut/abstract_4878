We consider the type-IIB background generated by the strong-coupling limit of
Nc D5 branes wrapped on S2, and focus our attention on a special class of
solutions that exhibit walking behavior. We compute numerically the spectrum of
scalar fluctuations around vacua of this class. Besides two cuts, and sequences
of single poles converging on one of the branch points, the spectrum contains
one isolated scalar, the mass of which is suppressed by the length of the
walking region. Approximate scale-invariance symmetry in the walking region
suggests that this be interpreted as a light dilaton, the pseudo-Goldstone
boson of dilatations.
