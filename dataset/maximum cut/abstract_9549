Reradiation of a spatially non-uniform ultrashort electromagnetic pulse
interacting with the linear chain of multielectron atoms is studied in the
framework of sudden perturbation approximation. Angular distributions of the
reradiation spectrum for arbitrary number of atoms are obtained. It is shown
that interference effects for the photon radiation amplitudes lead to appearing
of "diffraction" maximums. The obtained results can be extended to the case of
two- and three-dimensional crystal lattices and atomic chains. The approach
developed allows also to take into account thermal vibrations of the lattice
atoms.
