Aims. This work investigates the potential of using the wavelength-dependence
of galaxy structural parameters (S\'ersic index, n, and effective radius, Re)
to separate galaxies into distinct types. Methods. A sample of nearby galaxies
with reliable visual morphologies is considered, for which we measure
structural parameters by fitting multi-wavelength single-S\'ersic models.
Additionally, we use a set of artificially redshifted galaxies to test how
these classifiers behave when the signal-to-noise decreases. Results. We show
that the wavelength-dependence of n may be employed to separate
visually-classified early- and late-type galaxies, in a manner similar to the
use of colour and n. Furthermore, we find that the wavelength variation of n
can recover galaxies that are misclassified by these other morphological
proxies. Roughly half of the spiral galaxies that contaminate an early-type
sample selected using (u-r) versus n can be correctly identified as late-types
by N, the ratio of n measured in two different bands. Using a set of
artificially-redshifted images, we show that this technique remains effective
up to z ~ 0.1. N can therefore be used to achieve purer samples of early-types
and more complete samples of late-types than using a colour-n cut alone. We
also study the suitability of R, the ratio of Re in two different bands, as a
morphological classifier, but find that the average sizes of both early- and
late-type galaxies do not change substantially over optical wavelengths.
