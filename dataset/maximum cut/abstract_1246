We study numerically statistical properties and dynamical disease propagation
using a percolation model on a one dimensional small world network. The
parameters chosen correspond to a realistic network of school age children. We
found that percolation threshold decreases as a power law as the short cut
fluctuations increase. We found also the number of infected sites grows
exponentially with time and its rate depends logarithmically on the density of
susceptibles. This behavior provides an interesting way to estimate the
serology for a given population from the measurement of the disease growing
rate during an epidemic phase. We have also examined the case in which the
infection probability of nearest neighbors is different from that of short
cuts. We found a double diffusion behavior with a slower diffusion between the
characteristic times.
