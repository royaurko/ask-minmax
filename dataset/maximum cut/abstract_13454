We study all-carbon-hydrogen molecular transistors where zigzag graphene
nanoribbons play the role of three metallic electrodes connected to a
ring-shaped 18-annulene molecule. Using the nonequilibrium Green function
formalism combined with density functional theory, recently extended to
multiterminal devices, we show that the proposed nanostructures exhibit
exponentially small transmission when the source and drain electrodes are
attached in a configuration that ensures destructive interference of electron
paths around the ring. The third electrode, functioning either as an attached
infinite-impedance voltage probe or as an "air-bridge" top gate covering half
of molecular ring, introduces dephasing that brings the transistor into the
"on" state with its transmission in the latter case approaching the maximum
limit for a single conducting channel device. The current through the latter
device can also be controlled in the far-from-equilibrium regime by applying a
gate voltage.
