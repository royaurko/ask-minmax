In 4-dimensional General Relativity, black holes are described by the Kerr
solution and are subject to the bound $|a_*| \le 1$, where $a_*$ is the black
hole spin parameter. If current black hole candidates are not the black holes
predicted in General Relativity, this bound does not hold and $a_*$ might
exceed 1. In this letter, I relax the Kerr black hole hypothesis and I find
that the value of the spin parameter of the super-massive black hole candidates
in galactic nuclei cannot be higher than about 1.2. A higher spin parameter
would not be consistent with a radiative efficiency $\eta > 0.15$, as observed
at least for the most luminous AGN. While a rigorous proof is lacking, I
conjecture that the bound $|a_*| \lesssim 1.2$ is independent of the exact
nature of these objects.
