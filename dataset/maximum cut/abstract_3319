We study asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators for Heston
models based on continuous time observations of the log-price process. We
distinguish three cases: subcritical (also called ergodic), critical and
supercritical. In the subcritical case, asymptotic normality is proved for all
the parameters, while in the critical and supercritical cases, non-standard
asymptotic behavior is described.
