We study the Kondo temperature ($T_K$) of a single molecule break junction.
By employing a numerical renormalization group calculations we have found that
$T_K$ depends dramatically upon the position of the molecule in the wire formed
between the contacts. We show that $T_K$ exhibits strong \emph{oscillations}
when the parity of the left {and/or} right number of atomic sites ($N_L,N_R$)
is changed. For a given set of parameters, the maximum value of $T_K$ occurs
for ($odd,odd$) combination, while its minimum values is observed for
($even,even$).
  These oscillations are fully understood in terms of the effective
hybridization function.
