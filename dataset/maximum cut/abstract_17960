Supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) are high mass X-ray binaries
associated with OB supergiant companions and characterised by an X-ray flaring
behaviour whose dynamical range reaches 5 orders of magnitude on timescales of
a few hundred to thousands of seconds. Current investigations concentrate on
finding possible mechanisms to inhibit accretion in SFXTs and explain their
unusually low average X-ray luminosity. We present the Swift observations of an
exceptionally bright outburst displayed by the SFXT IGR J17544-2619 on 2014
October 10 when the source achieved a peak luminosity of $3\times10^{38}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. This extends the total source dynamic range to $\gtrsim$10$^6$, the
largest (by a factor of 10) recorded so far from an SFXT. Tentative evidence
for pulsations at a period of 11.6 s is also reported. We show that these
observations challenge, for the first time, the maximum theoretical luminosity
achievable by an SFXT and propose that this giant outburst was due to the
formation of a transient accretion disc around the compact object.
