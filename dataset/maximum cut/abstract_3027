We present the properties of the supernova SN 1995ah discovered in a Blue
Compact Dwarf galaxy (BCD) around 10 days after the maximum. This is the first
supernova event observed in a BCD. The photometric and spectroscopic data
suggest that SN 1995ah is a Type II supernova and could belong to the rare
Bright SNII Linear subclass, for which <M(R)>~<M(B)>=-18.9+-0.6 at maximum
light.
