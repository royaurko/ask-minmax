We have obtained simultaneous optical and near infrared observations of 4U
1543-47 during its 2002 outburst. The most striking feature of the outburst
light curve is the secondary maximum which appears after the object transitions
into the low-hard state. This secondary maximum is much stronger in the
infrared bands than optical. We suggest that the origin of the secondary
maximum flux may be synchrotron radiation associated with a jet. Close infrared
monitoring may lead to reliable triggers for simultaneous multiwavelength
campaigns to study jet formation processes.
