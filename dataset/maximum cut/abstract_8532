We fabricate ferromagnetic nanowires with constrictions whose cross section
can be reduced gradually from 100 nm to the atomic scale and eventually to the
tunneling regime by means of electromigration. These devices are mechanically
stable against magnetostriction and magnetostatic effects. We measure
magnetoresistances ~ 0.3% for 100*30 nm^2 constrictions, increasing to a
maximum of 80% for atomic-scale widths. These results are consistent with a
geometrically-constrained domain wall trapped at the constriction. For the
devices in the tunneling regime we observe large fluctuations in MR, between
-10 and 85%.
