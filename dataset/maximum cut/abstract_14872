We present a theoretical investigation of an integrated nonlinear light
source for coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) based on silicon
nitride waveguides. Wavelength tunable and temporally synchronized signal and
idler pulses are obtained by using seeded four-wave mixing. We find that the
calculated input pump power needed for nonlinear wavelength generation is more
than one order of magnitude lower than in previously reported approaches based
on optical fibers. The tuning range of the wavelength conversion was calculated
to be 1418 nm to 1518 nm (idler) and 788 nm to 857 nm (signal), which
corresponds to a coverage of vibrational transitions from 2350 cm$^{-1}$ to
2810 cm$^{-1}$. A maximum conversion efficiency of 19.1% at a peak pump power
of 300 W was obtained.
