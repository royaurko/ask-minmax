Fermionic third generation top partners are generic in composite Higgs
models. They are likely to decay into third generation quarks and electroweak
bosons. We propose a novel cut-and-count-style analysis in which we cross
correlate the model-dependent single and model-independent pair production
processes for the top partners $X_{5/3}$ and $B$. In the class of composite
Higgs models we study, $X_{5/3}$ is very special as it is the lightest exotic
fermion. A constraint on the mass of $X_{5/3}$ directly extends to constrains
on all top partner masses. By combining jet substructure methods with
conventional reconstruction techniques we show that in this kind of final state
a smooth interpolation between the boosted and unboosted regime is possible. We
find that a reinterpretation of existing searches can improve bounds on the
parameter space of composite Higgs models. Further, at 8 TeV a combined search
for $X_{5/3}$ and $B$ in the $l+\rm{jets}$ final state can be more sensitive
than a search involving same-sign dileptons.
