This volume contains the proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Model-Based
Testing (MBT 2013), which was held on March 17, 2013 in Rome, Italy, as a
satellite event of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of
Software, ETAPS 2013.
  The workshop is devoted to model-based testing of both software and hardware.
Model-based testing uses models describing the required behavior of the system
under consideration to guide such efforts as test selection and test results
evaluation. Testing validates the real system behavior against models and
checks that the implementation conforms to them, but is capable also to find
errors in the models themselves.
  The first MBT workshop was held in 2004, in Barcelona. At that time MBT
already had become a hot topic, but the MBT workshop was the first event
devoted mostly to this domain. Since that time the area has generated enormous
scientific interest, and today there are several specialized workshops and more
broad conferences on software and hardware design and quality assurance
covering model based testing. MBT has become one of the most powerful system
analysis tools, one of the latest cutting-edge topics related is applying MBT
in security analysis and testing. MBT workshop tries to keep up with current
trends.
