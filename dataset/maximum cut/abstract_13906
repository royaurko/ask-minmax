The ground state properties of a paramagnetic Mott insulator are investigated
in the presence of an external electrical field using the inhomogeneous
Gutzwiller approximation for a single band Hubbard model in a slab geometry.
The metal insulator transition is shifted towards higher Hubbard repulsions by
applying an electric field perpendicular to the slab. The spatial distribution
of site dependent quasiparticle weight shows that the quasiparticle weight is
maximum in few layers beneath the surface. Moreover only at higher Hubbard
repulsion, larger than the bulk critical U, the electric field will be totally
screened only for centeral cites. Our results show that by presence of an
electric field perpendicular to a thin film made of a strongly correlated
material, states near the surface will remain metallic while the bulk becomes
insulating after some critical U. In contrast, in the absence of the electric
field the surface becomes insulating before the bulk.
