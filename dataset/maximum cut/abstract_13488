We compare different methods for performing analytical continuation of
spectral data from the imaginary time or frequency axis to the real frequency
axis for the optical conductivity sigma(omega). We compare the maximum entropy
(MaxEnt), singular value decomposition (SVD), sampling and Pade methods for
analytical continuation. We also study two direct methods for obtaining
sigma(0). For the MaxEnt approach we focus on a recent modification. The data
are split up in batches, a separate MaxEnt calculation is done for each batch
and the results are averaged. For the problems studied here, we find that
typically the SVD, sampling and modified MaxEnt methods give comparable
accuracy, while the Pade approximation is usually less reliable.
