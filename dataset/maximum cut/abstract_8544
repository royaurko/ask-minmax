We present the renormalization group analysis for the problem of a spin-S
impurity in nearly ferromagnetic Fermi liquid. We evaluate the renormalization
group function that governs the temperature behavior of the invariant charge to
the second order of both weak and strong coupling expansions. It allows us to
determine behavior of the zero field magnetic susceptibility of impurity at low
and high temperatures. We predict that derivative of the susceptibility with
temperature should always have the maximum.
