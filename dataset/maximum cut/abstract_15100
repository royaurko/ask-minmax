The decay of a detonation wave from its initial CJ velocity to its final,
steady state velocity upon encountering a finite thickness or diameter charge
is investigated numerically and theoretically. The numerical simulations use an
ideal gas equation of state and pressure dependent reaction rate in order to
ensure a stable wave structure. The confinement is also treated as an ideal gas
with variable impedance. The velocity decay along the centerline is extracted
from the simulations and compared to predictions base on a front evolution
equation that uses the steady state detonation velocity-front curvature
relation ($D_n-\kappa$). This model fails to capture the finite signaling speed
of the leading rarefaction resulting from the interaction with the yielding
confinement. This signaling speed is verified to be the maximum signal velocity
occurring in the ideal ZND wave structure of the initial CJ velocity. A simple
heuristic model based on the rarefaction generated by a one-dimensional
interaction between the post-shock state and the confinement is proposed to
provide an approximate description of the rest of the relaxation to steady
state velocity.
