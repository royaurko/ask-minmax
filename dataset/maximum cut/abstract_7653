The estimation of the backgrounds for gluino signals in focus point
supersymmetry is extended by including the backgrounds from the production of
four third generation quarks in the analysis. We find that these backgrounds
are negligible if one uses the strong selection criteria proposed in the
literature (including this analysis) for heavy gluino searches. Softer
selection criteria often recommended for lighter gluino searches yield
backgrounds which are small but numerically significant. We have also repeated
the more conventional background calculations and compared our results with the
other groups. We find that the size of the total residual background estimated
by different groups using different event generators and hard kinematical cuts
agree approximately. In view of the theoretical uncertainties in the leading
order signal and background cross sections mainly due to the choice of the QCD
scale, the gluino mass reach at the LHC cannot be pinpointed. However,
requiring a signal with $\rm\geq 3$ tagged b-jets (instead of the standard
choice of $\rm\geq 2$) it is shown that gluino masses close to 2 TeV can be
probed at the LHC for a range of reasonable choices of the QCD scale for an
integrated luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$.
