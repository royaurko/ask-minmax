The genetic code is considered to be universal. In order to test if some
statistical properties of the coding bacterial genome were due to inherent
properties of the genetic code, we compared the autocorrelation function, the
scaling properties and the maximum entropy of the distribution of distances of
amino acids in sequences obtained by translating protein-coding regions from
the genome of Borrelia burgdorferi, under different genetic codes. Overall our
results indicate that these properties are very stable to perturbations made by
altering the genetic code. We also discuss the evolutionary likely implications
of the present results.
