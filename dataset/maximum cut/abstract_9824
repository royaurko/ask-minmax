Algebraic space-time coding allows for reliable data exchange across fading
multiple-input multiple-output channels. A powerful technique for decoding
space-time codes in Maximum-Likelihood (ML) decoding, but well-performing and
widely-used codes such as the Golden code often suffer from high ML-decoding
complexity. In this article, a recursive algorithm for decoding general
algebraic space-time codes of arbitrary dimension is proposed, which reduces
the worst-case decoding complexity from $O(|S|^{n^2})$ to $O(|S|^n)$.
