The Goldberger-Wise mechanism of stabilizing modulus in the Randall-Sundrum
braneworld,by introducing a bulk scalar field with quartic interaction terms
localized at the 3-branes has been extremely popular as a stabilizing mechanism
when the back-reaction of the scalar field on the geometry is negligibly small.
In this note we re-examine the mechanism by an exact analysis without resorting
to the approximations adopted by Goldberger and Wise. An exact calculation of
the stabilization condition indicates the existence of closely spaced minimum
and a maximum for the potential and also brings out some new features involved
in the context of stabilization of such braneworld models.
