We present fully nonparametric estimates of the frequency function of
elliptical galaxy intrinsic shapes under the axisymmetric and triaxial
hypotheses. If elliptical galaxies are assumed to be oblate or prolate, the
frequency function of intrinsic shapes is negative for axis ratios near unity
due to the lack of apparently round galaxies. Both axisymmetric hypotheses are
found to be inconsistent at the 99 percent level with the data. Triaxial
intrinsic shapes are fully consistent with the data; a number of possible
triaxial frequency functions are presented, some of which exhibit strong
bimodality. We also compute the ``maximum entropy'' distribution of intrinsic
shapes under the triaxial hypothesis.
