Accurate theoretical calculations of slepton pair production processes at
threshold are necessary for an accurate determination of slepton masses. We
discuss the gauge invariant calculation of these processes for selectron and
smuon pairs, including finite width effects and Coulomb corrections. Energy
cuts to reduce irreducible supersymmetric backgrounds are presented.
