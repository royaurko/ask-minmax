Solar mini-dimmings can be detect in the Extreme Ultra-Violet coro- nal
eruptions. Here, sequences of 171 A images taken by Solar Dynamic Observa-
tory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembaly on 13 June 2010 are used. In this special
day, both of coronal mass ejection and prominence were observed. The average
velocities and accelerations of 500 mini-dimmings which were detected using on
feature based classifier (Alipour et al 2012) are studied. The large number of
mini-dimmings shows positive accelerations in the beginning times as similar as
Coronal Mass Ejections. On the the start time of prominence eruptions, the
number of mini-dimmings is increased to a maximum values. There is a positive
correlation between the kinematics of mini- dimmings and both CME and
prominences. This study can be extended to understand the exact relationship of
CMEs and mini-dimmings.
