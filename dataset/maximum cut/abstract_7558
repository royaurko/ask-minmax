We present a study of s-channel single top quark production at the upgraded
Tevatron $p\bar{p}$ collider, including the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD
corrections to the production and the decay of the top quark. The "modified"
narrow width approximation was adopted to preserve the spin of the top quark in
its production and decay. We discuss the effect of the different $O(\alpha_s)$
contributions on the inclusive cross section as well as various kinematic
distributions after imposing the relevant cuts to select s-channel single top
signal events. In particular the $O(\alpha_s)$ decay contribution, while small
in size, has a significant impact on several distributions. With the help of
the best-jet algorithm to reconstruct the top quark we demonstrate that it is
possible to study kinematical and spin correlations in s-channel single top
events. We furthermore compare top quark spin measurements in two different
basis and show how NLO corrections have to be taken into consideration in
searches for the Higgs boson through $W^{\pm}H$ associated production at the
Tevatron.
