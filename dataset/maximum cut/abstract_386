A testing device in turning including, in particular, a six-component
dynamometer, is used to measure the complete torque of the cutting actions, in
a case of self-excited vibrations. For the tests, the used tool was a noncoated
carbide tool (TNMA 160412) without chip breaker. The cutting material is a
chrome molybdenum alloy type (ASI 4140). The cylindrical test tubes have a
diameter of 120 mm and a length of 30 mm. For the first time, we present an
analysis of forces and moments for different depths of cut and different feed
rates.
