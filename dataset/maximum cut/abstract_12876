Given a homogeneous component of an exterior algebra, we characterize those
subspaces in which every nonzero element is decomposable. In geometric terms,
this corresponds to characterizing the projective linear subvarieties of the
Grassmann variety with its Plucker embedding. When the base field is finite, we
consider the more general question of determining the maximum number of points
on sections of Grassmannians by linear subvarieties of a fixed (co)dimension.
This corresponds to a known open problem of determining the complete weight
hierarchy of linear error correcting codes associated to Grassmann varieties.
We recover most of the known results as well as prove some new results. In the
process we obtain, and utilize, a simple generalization of the Griesmer-Wei
bound for arbitrary linear codes.
