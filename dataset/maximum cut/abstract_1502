We present next-to-leading order QCD predictions for cross sections and for a
comprehensive set of distributions in diphoton + 2-jet production at the Large
Hadron Collider. We consider the contributions from loop amplitudes for two
photons and four gluons, but we neglect top quarks. We use BlackHat together
with SHERPA to carry out the computation. We use a Frixione cone isolation for
the photons. We study standard sets of cuts on the jets and the photons, and
also sets of cuts appropriate for studying backgrounds to Higgs-boson
production via vector-boson fusion.
