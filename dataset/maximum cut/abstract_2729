It is often stated that heat baths with finite degrees of freedom i.e.,
finite baths, are sources of Tsallis distributions for the classical
Hamiltonian systems. By using well-known fundamental statistical mechanical
expressions, we rigorously show that Tsallis distributions with fat tails are
possible \textit{only} for finite baths with constant negative heat capacity
while constant positive heat capacity finite baths yield decays with sharp
cut-off with no fat tails. However, the correspondence between Tsallis
distributions and finite baths holds at the expense of violating equipartition
theorem for finite classical systems at equilibrium. Finally, we comment on the
implications of the finite bath for the recent attempts towards a
$q$-generalized central limit theorem.
