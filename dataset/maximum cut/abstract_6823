We study the coupling of magneto-acoustic waves to Alven waves using 2.5D
numerical simulations. In our experiment, a fast magnetoacoustic wave of a
given frequency and wavenumber is generated below the surface. The magnetic
field in the domain is assumed homogeneous and inclined. The efficiency of the
conversion to Alfven waves near the layer of equal acoustic and Alfven speeds
is measured calculating their energy flux. The particular amplitude and phase
relations between the oscillations of magnetic field and velocity help us to
demonstrate that the waves produced after the transformation and reaching upper
atmosphere are indeed Alfven waves. We find that the conversion from fast
magneto-acoustic waves to Alfven waves is particularly important for the
inclination and azimuth angles of the magnetic field between 55 and 65 degrees,
with the maximum shifted to larger inclinations for lower frequency waves. The
maximum Alfven flux transmitted to the upper atmosphere is about 2-3 times
lower than the corresponding acoustic flux.
