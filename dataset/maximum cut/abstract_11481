In this paper we present and discuss for the first time a large data set of
UBVRI night sky brightness measurements collected at ESO-Paranal from April
2000 to September 2001. A total of about 3900 images obtained on 174 different
nights with FORS1 were analysed using an automatic algorithm specifically
designed for this purpose. This led to the construction of an unprecedented
database that allowed us to study in detail a number of effects such as
differential zodiacal light contamination, airmass dependency, daily solar
activity and moonlight contribution. Particular care was devoted to the
investigation of short time scale variations and micro-auroral events. The
typical dark time night sky brightness values found for Paranal are similar to
those reported for other astronomical dark sites at a similar solar cycle
phase. The zenith-corrected values averaged over the whole period are 22.3,
22.6, 21.6 20.9 and 19.7 mag arcsec-2 in U, B, V, R and I respectively. In
particular, there is no evidence of light pollution either in the broadband
photometry or in the high-airmass spectra we have analysed. Finally, possible
applications for the exposure time calculators are discussed.
