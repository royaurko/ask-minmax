The diluted kagome lattice, in which bonds are randomly removed with
probability $1-p$, consists of straight lines that intersect at points with a
maximum coordination number of four. If lines are treated as semi-flexible
polymers and crossing points are treated as crosslinks, this lattice provides a
simple model for two-dimensional filamentous networks. Lattice-based effective
medium theories and numerical simulations for filaments modeled as elastic
rods, with stretching modulus $\mu$ and bending modulus $\kappa$, are used to
study the elasticity of this lattice as functions of $p$ and $\kappa$. At
$p=1$, elastic response is purely affine, and the macroscopic elastic modulus
$G$ is independent of $\kappa$. When $\kappa = 0$, the lattice undergoes a
first-order rigidity percolation transition at $p=1$. When $\kappa > 0$, $G$
decreases continuously as $p$ decreases below one, reaching zero at a
continuous rigidity percolation transition at $p=p_b \approx 0.605$ that is the
same for all non-zero values of $\kappa$. The effective medium theories predict
scaling forms for $G$, which exhibit crossover from bending dominated response
at small $\kappa/\mu$ to stretching-dominated response at large $\kappa/\mu$
near both $p=1$ and $p=p_b$, that match simulations with no adjustable
parameters near $p=1$. The affine response as $p\rightarrow 1$ is identified
with the approach to a state with sample-crossing straight filaments treated as
elastic rods.
