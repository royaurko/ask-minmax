The capillary instability of a LC cylinder in magnetic field is considered
using an energy approach. The boundary problem is solved in the linear
approximation of the anisotropy $\chi_a$ of the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$.
The effect of anisotropy, in the region $1\gg|\chi|>|\chi_a|\gg \chi^2$, can be
strong enough to counteract and even reverse the tendency of the field to
enhance stabilization by enlarging the cut--off wave number $k_s$ beyond the
conventional one set by Rayleigh.
