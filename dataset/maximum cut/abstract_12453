In this paper, we describe a way to construct a class of dark energy models
that admit late time de Sitter attractor solution. In the canonical scalar and
Born-Infeld scalar dark energy models, we show mathematically that a simple
sufficient condition for the existence of a late time de Sitter like attractor
solution is that the potentials of the scalar field have non-vanishing minimum
while this condition becomes that the potentials have non-vanishing maximum for
the phantom models. These attractor solutions correspond to an equation of
state $w=-1$ and a cosmic density parameter $\Omega_{\phi}=1$, which are
important features for a dark energy model that can meet the current
observations.
