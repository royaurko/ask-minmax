The WMAP and Planck observations show that the quadrupole and octopole
orientations of the CMB might align with each other. We reveal that the
quadrupole--octopole alignment is a natural implication of the primordial power
spectrum in an anisotropic spacetime. The primordial power spectrum is
presented with a dipolar modulation. We obtain the privileged plane by
employing the ``power tensor'' technique. At this plane, there is the maximum
correlation between quadrupole and octopole. The probability for the alignment
is much larger than what in the isotropic universe. We find that this model
would lead to deviations from the statistical isotropy only for low--\(\ell\)
multipoles.
