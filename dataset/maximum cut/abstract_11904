We study the effect of electrostatic interactions on the distribution
function of the end-to-end distance of a single polyelectrolyte chain in the
rodlike limit. The extent to which the radial distribution function of a
polyelectrolyte is reproduced by that of a wormlike chain with an adjusted
persistence length is investigated. Strong evidence is found for a universal
scaling formula connecting the effective persistence length of a
polyelectrolyte with its linear charge density and the Debye screening of its
self-interaction. An alternative definition of the electrostatic persistence
length is proposed based on matching of the maximum of the distribution with
that of an effective wormlike chain, as opposed to the traditional matching of
the first or the second moments of the distributions. It is shown that this
definition provides a more accurate probe of the affinity of the distribution
to that of the wormlike chains, as compared to the traditional definition. It
is also found that the length of a polyelectrolyte segment can act as a crucial
parameter in determining its elastic properties.
