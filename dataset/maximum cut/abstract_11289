It is shown that the modern equations of state for neutron star matter based
on microscopic calculations of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter are
compatible with the lower bound on the maximum neutron-star mass for a certain
range of hyperon coupling constants, which are constrained by the binding
energies of hyperons in symmetric nuclear matter. The hyperons are included by
means of the relativistic Hartree-- or Hartree--Fock approximation. The
obtained couplings are also in satisfactory agreement with hypernuclei data in
the relativistic Hartree scheme. Within the relativistic Hartree--Fock
approximation hypernuclei have not been investigated so far.
