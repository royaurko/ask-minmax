We consider a class of nonlocal games that are related to binary constraint
systems (BCSs) in a manner similar to the games implicit in the work of Mermin
[N.D. Mermin, "Simple unified form for the major no-hidden-variables theorems,"
Phys. Rev. Lett., 65(27):3373-3376, 1990], but generalized to n binary
variables and m constraints. We show that, whenever there is a perfect
entangled protocol for such a game, there exists a set of binary observables
with commutations and products similar to those exhibited by Mermin. We also
show how to derive upper bounds strictly below 1 for the the maximum entangled
success probability of some BCS games. These results are partial progress
towards a larger project to determine the computational complexity of deciding
whether a given instance of a BCS game admits a perfect entangled strategy or
not.
