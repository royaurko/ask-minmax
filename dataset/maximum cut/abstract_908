We show, in different ways, that in the ubiquitous phenomenon of black body
radiation there exists a minimum and maximum temperature. These limiting values
are so small and large respectively, that they are of no practical use, except
in an extreme situation of black hole evaporation where they lead to maximum
and minimum mass.
