We generalize and solve the $\roman{mod}\,q$ analogue of a problem of
Littlewood and Offord, raised by Vaughan and Wooley, concerning the
distribution of the $2^n$ sums of the form $\sum_{i=1}^n\varepsilon_ia_i$,
where each $\varepsilon_i$ is $0$ or $1$. For all $q$, $n$, $k$ we determine
the maximum, over all reduced residues $a_i$ and all sets $P$ consisting of
$k$ arbitrary residues, of the number of these sums that belong to $P$.
