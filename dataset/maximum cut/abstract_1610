This paper presents, for the first time, a Geometry of Interaction (GoI)
interpretation using Hughes-vanGlabbeek (HvG) proof-nets for multiplicative
additive linear logic (MALL). Our GoI captures dynamically HvG's geometric
correctness criterion--the toggling cycle condition--in terms of algebraic
operators. Our new ingredient is a scalar extension of the *-algebra in
Girard's *-ring of partial isometries over a boolean polynomial ring with
literals of eigenweights as indeterminates. In order to capture feedback
arising from cuts, we construct a finer grained execution formula. The
expansion of this execution formula is longer than that for collections of
slices for multiplicative GoI, hence is harder to prove termination. Our GoI
gives a dynamical, semantical account of boolean valuations (in particular,
pruning sub-proofs), conversion of weights (in particular, alpha-conversion),
and additive (co)contraction, peculiar to additive proof-theory. Termination of
our execution formula is shown to correspond to HvG's toggling criterion. The
slice-wise restriction of our execution formula (by collapsing the boolean
structure) yields the well known correspondence, explicit or implicit in
previous works on multiplicative GoI, between the convergence of execution
formulas and acyclicity of proof-nets. Feedback arising from the execution
formula by restricting to the boolean structure yields definability of
eigenweights among cuts from the rest of the eigenweights.
