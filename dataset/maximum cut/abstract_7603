We extend work of Davis and Januszkiewicz by considering {\it omnioriented}
toric manifolds, whose canonical codimension-2 submanifolds are independently
oriented. We show that each omniorientation induces a canonical stably complex
structure, which is respected by the torus action and so defines an element of
an equivariant cobordism ring. As an application, we compute the complex
bordism groups and cobordism ring of an arbitrary omnioriented toric manifold.
We consider a family of examples $B_{i,j}$, which are toric manifolds over
products of simplices, and verify that their natural stably complex structure
is induced by an omniorientation. Studying connected sums of products of the
$B_{i,j}$ allows us to deduce that every complex cobordism class of dimension
>2 contains a toric manifold, necessarily connected, and so provides a positive
answer to the toric analogue of Hirzebruch's famous question for algebraic
varieties. In previous work, we dealt only with disjoint unions, and ignored
the relationship between the stably complex structure and the action of the
torus. In passing, we introduce a notion of connected sum $#$ for simple
$n$-dimensional polytopes; when $P^n$ is a product of simplices, we describe
$P^n# Q^n$ by applying an appropriate sequence of {\it pruning operators}, or
hyperplane cuts, to $Q^n$.
