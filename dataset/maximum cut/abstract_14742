The ANTARES collaboration reported the results of a search for point-like
neutrino sources using data taken in the period 2007-2010. An unbinned maximum
likelihood based all-sky search yielded a cluster of 9 (5) events within a cone
of 3 (1) degrees around (R.A., Dec) = (-46.5deg, -65.0deg). The trial factor
corrected p-value of 2.6% (2.2 sigma) is not significant enough to claim the
observation of an astrophysical point source. However, it currently constitutes
the most significant localized neutrino excess observed by ANTARES. Here we
present a multi-wavelength analysis including optical to X-ray archival data
and a dedicated analysis of gamma-ray data from Fermi-LAT. In order to cover
the TeV domain, dedicated observations with the H.E.S.S. telescope array were
carried out. We present these data and discuss implications of the results in
terms of signatures for a cosmic-ray acceleration site.
