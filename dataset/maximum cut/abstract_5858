The determination of neutron star masses is reviewed in light of a new
measurement of 1.97 M$_\odot$ for PSR J1614-2230 and an estimate of 2.4
M$_\odot$ for the black widow pulsar. Using a simple analytic model related to
the so-called maximally compact equation of state, model-independent upper
limits to thermodynamic properties in neutron stars, such as energy density,
pressure, baryon number density and chemical potential, are established which
depend upon the neutron star maximum mass. Using the largest well-measured
neutron star mass, 1.97 M$_\odot$, it is possible to show that the energy
density can never exceed about 2 GeV, the pressure about 1.3 GeV, and the
baryon chemical potential about 2.1 GeV. Further, if quark matter comprises a
significant component of neutron star cores, these limits are reduced to 1.3
GeV, 0.9 GeV, and 1.5 GeV, respectively. We also find that the maximum binding
energy of any neutron star is about 25% of the rest mass. Neutron matter
properties and astrophysical constraints additionally imply an upper limit to
the neutron star maximum mass of about 2.4 M$_\odot$. A measured mass of 2.4
M$\odot$ would be incompatible with hybrid star models containing {\it
significant} proportions of exotica in the form of hyperons, Bose condensates
or quark matter.
