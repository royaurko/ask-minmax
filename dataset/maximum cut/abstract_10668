We present Spitzer 16 micron imaging of the Great Observatories Origins Deep
Survey (GOODS) fields. We survey 150 square arcminutes in each of the two GOODS
fields (North and South), to an average 3 sigma depth of 40 and 65 micro-Jy
respectively. We detect about 1300 sources in both fields combined. We validate
the photometry using the 3-24 micron spectral energy distribution of stars in
the fields compared to Spitzer spectroscopic templates. Comparison with ISOCAM
and AKARI observations in the same fields show reasonable agreement, though the
uncertainties are large. We provide a catalog of photometry, with sources cross
correlated with available Spitzer, Chandra, and HST data. Galaxy number counts
show good agreement with previous results from ISOCAM and AKARI, with improved
uncertainties. We examine the 16 to 24 micron flux ratio and find that for most
sources it lies within the expected locus for starbursts and infrared luminous
galaxies. A color cut of S_{16}/S_{24}>1.4 selects mostly sources which lie at
1.1<z<1.6, where the 24 micron passband contains both the redshifted 9.7 micron
silicate absorption and the minimum between PAH emission peaks. We measure the
integrated galaxy light of 16 micron sources, and find a lower limit on the
galaxy contribution to the extragalactic background light at this wavelength to
be 2.2\pm 0.2$ nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}.
