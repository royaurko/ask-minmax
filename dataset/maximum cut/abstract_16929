We have examined instigating events at the Sun that may be responsible for
two of the most recent outer heliospheric kHz emissions detected by the
University of Iowa plasma wave detector on Voyager 1 starting at 2004.64 and
2006.39, respectively. These interplanetary events have been followed outward
from the Sun using plasma and cosmic ray data from Ulysses and Voyagers 1 and
2. For both intervals of kHz emissions, events originating near the Sun that
turn out to be the most intense events in this 11-year solar cycle as observed
by the plasma and cosmic ray variations in the outer heliosphere, reach V1 and
V2 which are near the heliospheric termination shock at almost the same time
that the two kHz radio emissions turn-on. These two events which originate near
the Sun about 2003.89 (the 2003 Halloween event) and at 2005.71, are also
unusual in that they develop solar wind ram pressure waves in the outer
heliosphere with maximum pressures ~6-8 times the average solar wind pressure
when they reach the heliospheric termination shock. We believe that this study
suggests a possible new paradigm for the origin of these latest kHz emissions.
This new paradigm is different from the current one describing earlier kHz
events. It is related to the strength of these pressure waves in the outer
heliosphere and involves the arrival of these large pressure waves at the
heliospheric termination shock rather than the arrival of a shock at the
heliopause as is the current paradigm.
