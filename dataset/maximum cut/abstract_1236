We discuss zeta functions, and traces of the associated weighted evolution
operators for intermittent Hamiltonian systems in general and for the Sinai
billiard in particular. The intermittency of this billiard is utilized so that
the zeta functions may be approximately expressed in terms of the probability
distribution of laminar lengths. In particular we study a one-parameter family
of weights. Depending on the parameter the trace can be dominated by branch
cuts in the zeta function or by isolated zeros. In the former case the time
dependence of the trace is dominated by a powerlaw and in the latter case by an
exponential. A phase transition occurs when the leading zero collides with a
branch cut. The family considered is relevant for the calculation of resonance
spectra, semiclassical spectra and topological entropy.
