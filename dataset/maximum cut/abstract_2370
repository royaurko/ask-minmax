A term calculus for the proofs in multiplicative-additive linear logic is
introduced and motivated as a programming language for channel based
concurrency. The term calculus is proved complete for a semantics in linearly
distributive categories with additives. It is also shown that proof equivalence
is decidable by showing that the cut elimination rewrites supply a confluent
rewriting system modulo equations.
