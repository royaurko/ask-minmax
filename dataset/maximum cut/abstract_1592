Establishing a distance between genomes is a significant problem in
computational genomics, because its solution can be used to establish
evolutionary relationships including phylogeny.
  The "double cut and join" (DCJ) model of chromosomal rearrangement proposed
by Yancopoulos et al. has received attention as it can model inversions,
translocations, fusion and fission on a multichromosomal genome that may
contain both linear and circular chromosomes. In this paper, we realize the DCJ
operator as a group action on the space of multichromosomal genomes. We study
this group action, deriving some properties of the group and finding
group-theoretic analogues for the key results in the DCJ theory.
