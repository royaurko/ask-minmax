We report the results of Suzaku broad band X-ray observations of the two
narrow-line radio galaxies (NLRGs), 3C 403 and IC 5063. Combined with the
Swift/BAT spectra averaged for 58 months, we are able to accurately constrain
their spectral properties over the 0.5--200 keV band. The spectra of both
nuclei are well represented with an absorbed cut-off power law, an absorbed
reflection component from cold matter with an iron-K emission line, and an
unabsorbed soft component, which gives a firm upper limit for the scattered
emission. The reflection strength normalized to the averaged BAT flux is R =
\Omega/2\pi ~ 0.6 in both targets, implying that their tori have a sufficiently
large solid angle to produce the reprocessed emission. A numerical torus model
with an opening angle of ~ 50 deg well reproduces the observed spectra. We
discuss the possibility that the amount of the normal gas responsible for
Thomson scattering is systematically smaller in radio galaxies compared with
Seyfert galaxies.
