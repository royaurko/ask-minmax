We compute the differential distributions of two three-jet event-shape
observables at the next-to-leading order accuracy at fixed values of the DIS
kinematic variables. The observable $\Kout$ measures the out-of-event-plane
momentum. The other observable $y_3$ is the maximum value of the $\ycut$
resolution variable for which an event is classified as three-jet event. We
also show the dependence of the fixed-order predictions on the renormalisation
and factorisation scales. The radiative corrections are in general large and
depend on the value of the DIS kinematic range.
