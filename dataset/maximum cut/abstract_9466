We discuss the theory of certain partially ordered sets that capture the
structure of commutation classes of words in monoids. As a first application,
it follows readily that counting words in commutation classes is #P-complete.
We then apply the partially ordered sets to Coxeter groups. Some results are a
proof that enumerating the reduced words of elements of Coxeter groups is
#P-complete, a recursive formula for computing the number of commutation
classes of reduced words, as well as stronger bounds on the maximum number of
commutation classes than were previously known. This also allows us to improve
the known bounds on the number of primitive sorting networks.
