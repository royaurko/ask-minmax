The necessary and sufficient condition of the channel capacity is rigorously
formulated for the N-user discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (MAC).
The essence of the formulation is to invoke an {\em elementary} MAC where sizes
of input alphabets are not greater than the size of output alphabet. The main
objective is to demonstrate that the channel capacity of an MAC is achieved by
an elementary MAC included in the original MAC. The proof is quite
straightforward by the very definition of the elementary MAC. Moreover it is
proved that the Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the elementary MAC are strictly
sufficient and obviously necessary for the channel capacity. The latter proof
requires some steps such that for the elementary MAC every solution of the
Kuhn-Tucker conditions reveals itself as local maximum on the domain of all
possible input probability distributions and then it achieves the channel
capacity. As a result, in respect of the channel capacity, the MAC in general
can be regarded as an aggregate of a finite number of elementary MAC's.
