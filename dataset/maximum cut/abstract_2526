We consider whether Wt production can be considered as a distinct production
process at the LHC, separate from top pair production with which it interferes.
We argue that this problem can be meaningfully addressed in an MC@NLO
calculation, and give two definitions of the Wt mode whose difference measures
the degree of interference between Wt and top pair production. These are then
implemented in the MC@NLO software framework, and results given which
demonstrate that it is indeed legitimate to isolate the Wt process, subject to
adequate cuts.
