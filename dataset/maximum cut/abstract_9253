A goal of the PHENIX experiment is to obtain the polarized gluon distribution
function in the proton. Double helicity asymmetry in multi-particle production
with polarized proton-proton collision is measured at midrapidity with RHIC Run
2005 data. This result excludes the maximum positive gluon polarization
("GRSV-max").
