We calculate the pretzelosity distribution ($h_{1T}^{\perp}$), which is one
of the eight leading twist transverse momentum dependent parton distributions
(TMDs), in the light-cone formalism. We find that this quantity has a simple
relation with the quark orbital angular momentum distribution, thus it may
provide a new possibility to access the quark orbital angular momentum inside
the nucleon. The pretzelosity distribution can manifest itself through the
$\sin(3\phi_h-\phi_S)$ asymmetry in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering
process. We calculate the $\sin(3\phi_h-\phi_S)$ asymmetry at HERMES, COMPASS
and JLab kinematics, and present our prediction on different targets including
the proton, deuteron and neutron targets. Inclusion of transverse momentum cut
in data analysis could significantly enhance the $\sin(3\phi_h-\phi_S)$
asymmetry for future measurements.
