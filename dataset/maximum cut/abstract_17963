We present a detailed investigation on the evolution of observed net vertical
current using a time series of vector magnetograms of the active region (AR)
NOAA 11158 obtained from Helioseismic Magnetic Imager. We also discuss the
relation of net current to the observed eruptive events. The AR evolved from
$\beta\gamma$ to $\beta\gamma\delta$ configuration over a period of 6 days. The
AR had two sub-regions of activity with opposite chirality: one dominated by
sunspot rotation producing a strong CME, the other showing large shear motions
producing a strong flare. The net current in each polarity over the CME
producing sub-region increased to a maximum and then decreased when the
sunspots got separated. The time profile of net current in this sub-region
followed the time profile of the rotation rate of the S-polarity sunspot of the
same sub-region. The net current in the flaring sub-region showed a sudden
increase at the time of the strong flare and remained unchanged till the end of
the observation, while the sunspots maintained their close proximity. The
systematic evolution of the observed net current is seen to follow the time
evolution of total length of strongly sheared polarity inversion lines in both
the sub-regions. The observed photospheric net current could be explained as an
inevitable product of the emergence of a twisted flux rope, from a higher
pressure confinement below the photosphere into the lower pressure environment
of the photosphere.
