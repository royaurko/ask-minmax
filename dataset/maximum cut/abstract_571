We reconsider the recent derivation by de Rafael and Taron of bounds on the
slope of the Isgur-Wise function. We argue that one must be careful to include
cuts starting below the heavy meson pair production threshold, arising from
heavy quark-antiquark bound states, and that if such cuts are properly
accounted for then no constraints may be derived.
