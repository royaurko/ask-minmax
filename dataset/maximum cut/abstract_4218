The effect of the most general \z3gt vertex in the reaction $e^+e^- \ra
3\gamma$ is studied with a particular attention to LEP searches. We give exact
analytical expressions including realistic cuts for the signal and present a
detailed analysis based on a Monte Carlo that includes the effect of the
irreducible $3\gamma$ QED cross section. As special applications we discuss the
effect of heavy scalars, fermions and gauge bosons and comment on the
``monopole" connection.
