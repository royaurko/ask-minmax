The photometric and spectroscopic observations of nearby type IIP supernova
2004dj are presented. The $^{56}$Ni mass estimated from the light curve is
$\approx0.02 M_{\odot}$. This estimate is found to be consistent with the
H$\alpha$ luminosity. SN2004dj reveals a strong asymmetry of the H$\alpha$
emission line at the nebular epoch with the shift of the maximum of -1600 km
s$^{-1}$. A similar asymmetric component is detected in H$\beta$, [O I] and [Ca
II] lines. The line asymmetry is interpreted as a result of the asymmetry of
$^{56}$Ni ejecta. The H$\alpha$ profile and its evolution are reproduced in the
model of the asymmetric bipolar $^{56}$Ni and spherical hydrogen distributions.
The mass of the front $^{56}$Ni jet is comparable to the central component and
twice as larger compared to the rear $^{56}$Ni jet. We note that the asymmetric
bipolar structure of of $^{56}$Ni ejecta is revealed also by SN1999em, another
type IIP supernova.
