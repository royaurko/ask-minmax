Effective field theory (EFT) has been recently used for the calculation of
neutron-deuteron radiative capture at very low energies.We present here the use
of EFT to calculate the two-body photodisintegration of the triton, considering
the three-body force. The calculated cross section shows sharp rising from
threshold to maximum about 0.88 mb at 13 MeV and decreasing slightly to about
0.81 mb at 19 MeV, in agreement with the experimental data. Our results are in
good agreement with the experimental data and the other calculations using
modern realistic two- and three-nucleon forces, like AV18/UrbanaIX potential.
