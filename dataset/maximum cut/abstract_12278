We present results of the all-sky search for gravitational-wave signals from
spinning neutron stars in the data of the EXPLORER resonant bar detector. Our
data analysis technique was based on the maximum likelihood detection method.
We briefly describe the theoretical methods that we used in our search. The
main result of our analysis is an upper limit of ${\bf 2\times10^{-23}}$ for
the dimensionless amplitude of the continuous gravitational-wave signals coming
from any direction in the sky and in the narrow frequency band from 921.00 Hz
to 921.76 Hz.
