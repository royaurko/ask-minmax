We investigate the permeability of lipid membranes for fluorescence dyes and
ions. We find that permeability reaches a maximum close to the chain melting
transition of the membranes. Close to transitions, fluctuations in area and
compressibility are high, leading to an increased likelihood of spontaneous
lipid pore formation. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) reveals the
permeability for rhodamine dyes across 100 nm vesicles. Using FCS, we find that
the permeability of vesicle membranes for fluorescence dyes is within error
proportional to the excess heat capacity. To estimate defect size we measure
the conductance of solvent-free planar lipid bilayer. Microscopically, we show
that permeation events appear as quantized current events. Further, we
demonstrate that anesthetics lead to a change in membrane permeability that can
be predicted from their effect on heat capacity profiles. Depending on
temperature, the permeability can be enhanced or reduced. We demonstrate that
anesthetics decrease channel conductance and ultimately lead to 'blocking' of
the lipid pores in experiments performed at or above the chain melting
transition. Our data suggest that the macroscopic increase in permeability
close to transitions and microscopic lipid channel formation are the same
physical process.
