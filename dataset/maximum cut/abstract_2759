In this paper we construct charged thin-shell wormholes in (2+1)-dimensions
applying the cut-and -paste technique implemented by Visser, from a BTZ black
hole which was discovered by Banados, Teitelboim and Zanelli, and the surface
stress are determined using the Darmois-Israel formalism at the wormhole
throat. We analyzed the stability of the shell considering phantom-energy or
generalised Chaplygin gas equation of state for the exotic matter at the
throat. We also discussed the linearized stability of charged thin-shell
wormholes around the static solution.
