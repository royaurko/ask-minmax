We have selected quasars with X-ray colors suggestive of a low energy
cut-off, from the ROSAT PSPC pointed archive. We examine the radio and optical
properties of these 13 quasars. Five out of the seven quasars with good optical
spectra show associated optical absorption lines, with two having high delta-v
candidate systems. Two other cut-off quasars show reddening associated with the
quasar. We conclude that absorption is highly likely to be the cause of the
X-ray cut-offs, and that the absorbing material associated with the quasars,
not intervening along the line-of-sight. The suggestion that Gigahertz Peaked
Sources are associated with X-ray cut-offs remains unclear with this expanded
sample.
