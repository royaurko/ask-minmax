This paper presents the set of measurements of ultra-high energy air shower
radio emission at frequency 32 MHz in period of 2008-2012. The showers are
selected by geomagnetic and azimuth angles and then by the energy in three
intervals: 3*10^16 3*10^17 eV, 3*10^17 6*10^17 eV and 6*10^17 5*10^18 eV. In
each energy interval average lateral distribution function using mathematically
averaged data from antennas with di?fferent directions are plotted. In the
paper, using experimental data the dependence of radio signal averaged
amplitude from geomagnetic angle, the shower axis distance and the energy are
determined. Depth of maximum of cosmic ray showers Xmax for the given energy
range is evaluated. The evaluation is made according QGSJET model calculations
and average lateral distribution function shape.
