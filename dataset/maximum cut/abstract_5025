We consider one-loop amplitudes of a Higgs boson coupled to gluons in the
limit of a large top quark mass. We treat the Higgs as the real part of a
complex field phi that couples to the self-dual field strengths and compute the
one-loop corrections to the phi-NMHV amplitude, which contains one gluon of
positive helicity whilst the remaining three have negative helicity. We use
four-dimensional unitarity to construct the cut-containing contributions and a
hybrid of Feynman diagram and recursive based techniques to determine the
rational piece. Knowledge of the phi-NMHV contribution completes the analytic
calculation of the Higgs plus four gluon amplitude. For completeness we also
include expressions for the remaining helicity configurations which have been
calculated elsewhere. These amplitudes are relevant for Higgs plus jet
production via gluon fusion in the limit where the top quark is large compared
to all other scales in the problem.
