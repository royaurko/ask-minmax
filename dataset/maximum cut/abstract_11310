We report on the analysis of high-speed photometry of the dwarf-nova
HS1804+67 through its outburst cycle with eclipse mapping techniques. Eclipse
maps show evidences of the formation of a spiral structure in the disc at the
early stages of the outburst and reveal how the disc expands during the rise
until its fills most of the primary Roche lobe at maximum light. During the
decline phase, the disc becomes progressively fainter as the cooling front
moves inwards from the outer regions, until only a small bright region around
the white dwarf is left at minimum light. The variable part of the uneclipsed
light is possibly due to emission in a wind emanating from the inner parts of
the disc. The emission from this region is sensitive to the mass accretion
rate.
