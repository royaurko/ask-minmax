We study the second virial coefficient, $B(T)$, for simple real gases at high
temperature. Theoretical arguments imply that there exists a certain
temperature, $T_i$, for each gas, for which this coefficient is a maximum.
However, the experimental data clearly exhibits this maximum only for the
Helium gas. We argue that this is so because few experimental data are known in
the region where these maxima should appear for other gases. We make different
assumptions to estimate $T_i$. First, we adopt an empirical formulae for
$B(T)$. Secondly, we assume that the intermolecular potential is the
Lennard-Jones one and later we interpolate the known experimental data of
$B(T)$ for Ar, He, Kr, H_2, N_2, O_2, Ne and Xe with simple polynomials of
arbitrary powers, combined or not with exponentials. With these assumptions we
estimate the values of $T_i$ for these gases and compare them.
