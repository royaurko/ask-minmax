We generalize previous work on early photoionization to CDM models with
Omega<1. Such models have received recent interest because the excess power in
the large-scale galaxy distribution is phenomenologically fit if the ``shape
parameter" Gamma=h Omega_0 is about 0.25. It has been argued that such models
may require early reionization to suppress small-scale anisotropies in order to
be consistent with experimental data. We find that if the cosmological constant
lambda=0, the extent of this suppression is quite insensitive to Omega_0. Given
a sigma_8-normalization today, the loss of small-scale power associated with a
lower Omega_0 is partially canceled by higher optical depth from longer
lookback times and by structures forming at higher redshifts before the
universe becomes curvature-dominated. The maximum angular scale on which
fluctuations are suppressed decreases when Omega_0 is lowered, but this effect
is also rather weak and unlikely to be measurable in the near future. For flat
models, on the other hand, where lambda_0 = 1-Omega_0, the negative effects of
lowering Omega_0 dominate, and early reionization is not likely to play a
significant role if Omega_0<<1. The same applies to CDM models where the
effective Gamma is lowered by increasing the number of relativistic particle
species.
