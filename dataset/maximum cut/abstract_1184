Common approach is used to calculate band due to strong-coupling large
polaron (SCLP) photodissociation in ARPES and in optical conductivity (OC)
spectra. It is based on using the coherent-states representation for the phonon
field in SCLP. The calculated positions of both band maximums are universal
functions of one parameter - the SCLP binding energy Ep: ARPES band maximum
lies at binding energy about 3.2Ep; the OC band maximum is at the photon energy
about 4.2Ep. The half-widths of the bands are mainly determined by Ep and
slightly depend on Frohlich electron-phonon coupling constant: for its value
6-8 the ARPES band half-width is 1.7-1.3Ep and the OC band half-width is
2.8-2.2Ep. Using these results one can predict approximate position of ARPES
band maximum and half-width from the maximum of mid-IR OC band and vice versa.
Comparison of the results with experiments leads to a conclusion that
underdoped cuprates contain SCLPs with Ep=0.1-0.2 eV that is in good conformity
with the medium parameters in cuprates. The values of the polaron binding
energy determined from experimental ARPES and OC spectra of the same material
are in good conformity too: the difference between them is within 10 percent.
