Signal-background interference effects are studied for H --> WW and H --> ZZ
searches in gluon fusion at the LHC. More specifically, the interference in the
channels with semileptonic weak boson pair decay is analysed for light and
heavy Higgs masses with minimal and realistic experimental selection cuts. In
the semileptonic decay modes, the interference is affected by tree-level
background contributions enhanced by 1/e^2 relative to the gluon-fusion
continuum background in the fully leptonic decay modes.We find that for both
light and heavy Higgs masses the interference with the loop-induced weak-boson
pair background dominates over the interference with the tree-level weak-boson
plus jets background for a range of selection cuts. We therefore conclude that
higher-order background contributions can induce leading interference effects.
With appropriate background suppression cuts the interference can be reduced
below the 10% level for heavy Higgs masses, and to the per mille level for the
light SM Higgs.
