A spectroscopic follow-up of SWIRE sources from the Lockman Validation Field
has allowed the determination of the SWIRE 24 micron Luminosity Function (LF).
The spectroscopic sample was chosen above a 24 micron flux limit at 260 microJy
and an r-band optical limit of r<21. A spectroscopic completeness of 82.5% was
achieved. We found the median redshift for the sample to be z_med=0.29.
Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) and Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)
techniques were employed to fit a parametric LF. Our result of the local LF
(LLF) is consistent with the local 25 micron determination from Shupe et al.
1998. We split the sample at a redshift of z_split=0.36 and find strong
evidence for galaxy evolution.
