In this paper, a notion of Schauder equivalence relation $\mathbb R^\mathbb
N/L$ is introduced, where $L$ is a linear subspace of $\mathbb R^\mathbb N$ and
the unit vectors form a Schauder basis of $L$. The main theorem is to show that
the following conditions are equivalent:
  (1) the unit vector basis is boundedly complete;
  (2) $L$ is $F_\sigma$ in $\mathbb R^\mathbb N$;
  (3) $\mathbb R^\mathbb N/L$ is Borel reducible to $\mathbb R^\mathbb
N/\ell_\infty$.
  We show that any Schauder equivalence relation generalized by basis of
$\ell_2$ is Borel bireducible to $\mathbb R^\mathbb N/\ell_2$ itself, but it is
not true for bases of $c_0$ or $\ell_1$. Furthermore, among all Schauder
equivalence relations generated by sequences in $c_0$, we find the minimum and
the maximum elements with respect to Borel reducibility.
  We also show that $\mathbb R^\mathbb N/\ell_p$ is Borel reducible to $\mathbb
R^\mathbb N/J$ iff $p\le 2$, where $J$ is James' space.
