We compute four-point scattering amplitudes in $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCQCD with
general external matter configurations using $\mathcal{N}=1$ superspace Feynman
diagrams, at one loop in the general case and up to two loops in the
fundamental sector. In the pure adjoint sector at one loop we confirm exact
agreement with the corresponding amplitudes in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory,
supporting the idea that a closed subsector of the SCQCD might be exactly
integrable. External matter in the fundamental representation breaks dual
conformal invariance already at one loop and also the maximum transcendentality
principle at two loops.
