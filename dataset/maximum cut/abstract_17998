We analyze trends in maximum, minimum and mean temperatures (Tx, Tn, and
Tavg, respectively), diurnal temperature range (DTR) and precipitation from 18
stations (1250-4500 m asl) for their overlapping period of record (1995-2012),
and separately, from six stations of their long term record (1961-2012). We
apply Mann-Kendall test on serially independent time series to assess existence
of a trend while true slope is estimated using Sen s slope method. Further, we
statistically assess the spatial scale (field) significance of local climatic
trends within ten identified sub-regions of UIB and analyze whether the
spatially significant (field significant) climatic trends qualitatively agree
with a trend in discharge out of corresponding sub-region. Over the recent
period (1995-2012), we find a well agreed and mostly field significant cooling
(warming) during monsoon season i.e. July-October (March-May and November),
which is higher in magnitude relative to long term trends (1961-2012). We also
find ... The observed hydroclimatic trends, being driven by certain changes in
the monsoonal system and westerly disturbances, indicate dominance
(suppression) of nival (glacial) runoff regime, altering substantially the
overall hydrology of UIB in future. These findings largely contribute to
address the hydroclimatic explanation of the Karakoram Anomaly.
