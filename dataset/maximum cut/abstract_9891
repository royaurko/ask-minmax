We provide estimates for the flux and maximum frequency of radiation produced
when the magnetic field in a relativistic, highly magnetized, jet is dissipated
and particles are accelerated using general considerations. We also provide
limits on the jet Lorentz factor and magnetization parameter from the observed
flux. Furthermore, using the Lorentz invariance of scalar quantities produced
with electromagnetic tensor, we provide constraints on particle acceleration,
and general features of the emergent radiation. We find that the spectrum below
the peak softens with decreasing frequency. This spectral feature might be one
way of identifying a magnetic jet.
