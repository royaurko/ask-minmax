We present a set of algebraic functions for evaluating the coefficients of
the scalar integral basis of a general one-loop amplitude. The functions are
derived from unitarity cuts, but the complete cut-integral procedure has been
carried out in generality so that it never needs to be repeated. Where the
master integrals are known explicitly, the results here can be used as a black
box with tree-level amplitudes as input and one-loop amplitudes as output.
