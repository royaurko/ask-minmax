Using the optical reference geometry approach, we have derived in the
following, a general expression for the ellipticity of a slowly rotating fluid
configuration using Newtonian force balance equation in the conformally
projected absolute 3-space, in the realm of general relativity. Further with
the help of Hartle-Thorne (H-T) metric for a slowly rotating compact object, we
have evaluated the centrifugal force acting on a fluid element and also
evaluated the ellipticity and found that the centrifugal reversal occurs at
around $R/R_s \approx 1.45$, and the ellipticity maximum at around $R/R_s
\approx 2.75$. The result has been compared with that of Chandrasekhar and
Miller which was obtained in the full 4-spacetime formalism.
