Recently, it has been observed that terminated low-density-parity-check
(LDPC) convolutional codes (or spatially-coupled codes) appear to approach
capacity universally across the class of binary memoryless channels. This is
facilitated by the "threshold saturation" effect whereby the belief-propagation
(BP) threshold of the spatially-coupled ensemble is boosted to the maximum
a-posteriori (MAP) threshold of the underlying constituent ensemble.
  In this paper, we consider the universality of spatially-coupled codes over
intersymbol-interference (ISI) channels under joint iterative decoding. More
specifically, we empirically show that threshold saturation also occurs for the
considered problem. This can be observed by first identifying the EXIT curve
for erasure noise and the GEXIT curve for general noise that naturally obey the
general area theorem. From these curves, the corresponding MAP and the BP
thresholds are then numerically obtained. With the fact that regular LDPC codes
can achieve the symmetric information rate (SIR) under MAP decoding,
spatially-coupled codes with joint iterative decoding can universally approach
the SIR of ISI channels. For the dicode erasure channel, Kudekar and Kasai
recently reported very similar results based on EXIT-like curves.
