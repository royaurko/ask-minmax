Engineered Na0.75CoO2 is considered a prime candidate to achieve high
efficiency thermoelectric systems to regenerate electricity from waste heat. In
this work, three elements with outmost electronic configurations, (1) an open d
shell (Ni), (2) a closed d shell (Zn), and (3) an half fill f shell (Eu) with a
maximum unpaired electrons, were selected to outline the dopants' effects on
electronic and crystallographic structures of Na0.75CoO2. Systematic ab initio
density functional calculations showed that the formation energy of these
dopants was found to be lowest when residing on sodium layer and ranked as -1.1
eV, 0.44 eV and 3.44 eV for Eu, Ni and Zn respectively. Furthermore Ni was also
found to be stable when substituting Co ion. As these results show great
harmony with existing experimental data, they provide new insights into the
fundamental principle of dopant selection for manipulating the physical
properties in the development of high performance sodium cobaltate based
thermoelectric materials.
