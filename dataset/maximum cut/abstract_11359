ROSAT HRI observations of 3C 273 reveal X-ray emission all along the
optically visible jet with the peak of emission at the inner end. Whereas the
X-ray emission from the innermost knot A is consistent with a continuation of
the radio-to-optical synchrotron continuum, a second population of particles
with higher maximum energy has to be invoked to explain the X-ray emission from
knots B, C and D in terms of synchrotron radiation. Inverse Compton emission
could account for the X-ray flux from the hot spot. We detect a faint X-ray
halo with a characteristic scale of 29 kpc and particle density on the order of
6 x 10^4 m^-3, higher than previously thought.
