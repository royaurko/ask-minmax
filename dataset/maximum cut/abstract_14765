We demonstrate alpha-particle detection in an n-type 4H-SiC Schottky diode
detector up to an unprecedented temperature of 500 {\deg}C using an Am-241 disc
source. The measured spectra were used to calculate the electron-hole pair
creation energy in 4H-SiC and its non-bandgap contribution, which are both
found to decrease with increasing temperature. The full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of the measured alpha-energy peaks was found to increase exponentially
with temperature due to an exponential increase of leakage current. For our
measurement system, above 300 {\deg}C, where the leakage current was 10-6 A,
this increase exceeded the FWHM at room temperature.
