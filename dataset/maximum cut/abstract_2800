A simple C++ class structure for construction of a Monte Carlo event
generators which can produce unweighted events within relativistic phase space
is presented. The generator is self-adapting to the provided matrix element and
acceptance cuts. The program is designed specially for exclusive processes and
includes, as an example of such an application, implementation of the model for
exclusive production of meson pairs $pp \rightarrow p M^+M^- p $ in high energy
proton-proton collisions.
