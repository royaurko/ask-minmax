It is now believed that pulsars comprise the fastest population of stars in
the galaxy. With inferred mean, root-mean-square, and maximum 3-D pulsar speeds
of $\sim$300-500 km/s, $\sim$500 km/s, and $\sim$2000 km/s, respectively, the
question of the origin of such singular proper motions becomes acute. What
mechanism can account for speeds that range from zero to twice the galactic
escape velocity? We speculate that a major vector component of a neutron star's
proper motion comes from the hydrodynamic recoil of the nascent neutron star
during the supernova explosion in which it is born. Recently, theorists have
shown that asymmetries and instabilities are a natural aspect of supernova
dynamics. In this paper, we highlight two phenomena: 1) the ``Brownian-like''
stochastic motion of the core in response to the convective ``boiling'' of the
mantle of the protoneutron star during the post-bounce, pre-explosion accretion
phase, and 2) the asymmetrical bounce and explosion of an aspherically
collapsing Chandrasekhar core.In principle,either phenomenon can leave the
young neutron star with a speed of hundreds of kilometers per second.
