Experiments and numerical data on the correlation length for large S disagree
strongly with the theoretical prediction based on the effective field theory
prescription of the magnon physics. The reason is that for large S, at any
accessible correlation lengths, the cut-off effects from the non-magnon scales
become large and can not be treated by an effective field theory. We study
these effects in a spin-wave expansion. The corrected prediction connects the
renormalized classical and the classical scaling regions smoothly and comes
close to the data.
