Experiments done with single photon in the early 1990's produced a surprising
result: that single photon pass through a photon tunnel barrier with a group
velocity faster than the vacuum speed of light. Recently, a series of
experiments revealed that electromagnetic wave was able to travel at a group
velocity faster than $c$. These phenomena have been observed in dispersive
media. We think all particles can be divided into three kinds in nature: The
first kind of particle is its velocity in the range of $0\leq v < c$, e.g.
electron, atom and so on. The second kind of particle is its velocity in the
range of $0\leq v < c_{m}$, e.g. photon. The third kind of particle is its
velocity in the range of $c\leq v < c_{m}$ ($c_{m}$ is the maximum velocity in
universe), e.g. tachyon. The first kind of particle is described by the special
relativity. In this paper, we give some new kinematic and dynamic equations to
describe the second and third kinds particles.
