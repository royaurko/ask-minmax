The decay dynamics of the classical electromagnetic field in a leaky optical
resonator supporting a single mode coupled to a structured continuum of modes
(reservoir) is theoretically investigated, and the issue of threshold condition
for lasing in presence of an inverted medium is comprehensively addressed.
Specific analytical results are given for a single-mode microcavity resonantly
coupled to a coupled resonator optical waveguide (CROW), which supports a band
of continuous modes acting as decay channels. For weak coupling, the usual
exponential Weisskopf-Wigner (Markovian) decay of the field in the bare
resonator is found, and the threshold for lasing increases linearly with the
coupling strength. As the coupling between the microcavity and the structured
reservoir increases, the field decay in the passive cavity shows non
exponential features, and correspondingly the threshold for lasing ceases to
increase, reaching a maximum and then starting to decrease as the coupling
strength is further increased. A singular behavior for the "laser phase
transition", which is a clear signature of strong non-Markovian dynamics, is
found at critical values of the coupling between the microcavity and the
reservoir.
