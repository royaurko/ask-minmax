Deep-inelastic diffractive scaling violations have provided fundamental
insight into the QCD pomeron, suggesting a single gluon inner structure rather
than that of a perturbative two-gluon bound state. This paper derives a
high-energy, transverse momentum cut-off, confining solution of QCD. The
pomeron, in first approximation, is a single reggeized gluon plus a ``wee
parton'' component that compensates for the color and particle properties of
the gluon. This solution corresponds to a supercritical phase of Reggeon Field
Theory.
  Beginning with the multi-regge behavior of massive quark and gluon
amplitudes, reggeon unitarity is used to derive a reggeon diagram description
of a wide class of multi-regge amplitudes, including those describing the
formation and scattering of bound-state Regge poles. When quark and gluon
masses are taken to zero, a logarithmic divergence is produced by helicity-flip
reggeon interactions containing the infra-red quark triangle anomaly. With the
gauge symmetry partially broken, this divergence selects the bound states and
amplitudes of a confining theory. Both the pomeron and hadrons have an
anomalous color parity wee-parton component. For the pomeron the wee parton
component determines that it carries negative color charge parity and that the
leading singularity is an isolated Regge pole.
