Two emergent properties in aggregation theory are investigated, namely
horizontal maxitivity and comonotonic maxitivity (as well as their dual
counterparts) which are commonly defined by means of certain functional
equations. We completely describe the function classes axiomatized by each of
these properties, up to weak versions of monotonicity in the cases of
horizontal maxitivity and minitivity. While studying the classes axiomatized by
combinations of these properties, we introduce the concept of quasi-polynomial
function which appears as a natural extension of the well-established notion of
polynomial function. We give further axiomatizations for this class both in
terms of functional equations and natural relaxations of homogeneity and median
decomposability. As noteworthy particular cases, we investigate those
subclasses of quasi-term functions and quasi-weighted maximum and minimum
functions, and provide characterizations accordingly.
