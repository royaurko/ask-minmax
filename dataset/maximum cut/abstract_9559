The multiple attribute mixed type decision making is performed by four
methods, that is, the relative approach degree of grey TOPSIS method, the
relative approach degree of grey incidence, the relative membership degree of
grey incidence and the grey relation relative approach degree method using the
maximum entropy estimation, respectively. In these decision making methods, the
grey incidence degree in four-dimensional Euclidean space is used. The final
arrangement result is obtained by weighted Borda method. An example illustrates
the applicability of the proposed approach.
