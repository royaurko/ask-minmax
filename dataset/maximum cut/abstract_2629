The stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation and modified Popov theory are shown
to provide an ab initio description of finite temperature, weakly-interacting
two-dimensional Bose gas experiments. Using modified Popov theory, a systematic
approach is developed in which the momentum cut-off inherent to classical field
methods is removed as a free parameter. This is shown to yield excellent
agreement with the recent experiment of Hung et al. [Nature, 470, 236 (2011)],
verifying that the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation captures the observed
universality and scale-invariance.
