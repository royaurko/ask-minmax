We present the characterization and calibration of the slow-scan observation
mode of the Infrared Camera (IRC) on-board AKARI. The IRC slow-scan
observations were operated at the S9W (9 $\mu$m) and L18W (18 $\mu$m) bands. We
have developed a toolkit for data reduction of the IRC slow-scan observations.
We introduced a "self-pointing reconstruction" method to improve the positional
accuracy to as good as 1". The sizes of the point spread functions were derived
to be $\sim6"$ at the S9W band and $\sim7"$ at the L18W bands in full width at
half maximum. The flux calibrations were achieved with the observations of 3
and 4 infrared standard stars at the S9W and L18W bands, respectively. The flux
uncertainties are estimated to be better than 20% from comparisons with the
AKARI IRC PSC and the WISE preliminary catalog.
