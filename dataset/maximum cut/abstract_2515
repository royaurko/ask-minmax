Heavy nuclei introduce a new scale into the pQCD description of hard
processes on nuclei, the saturation scale, and the familiar linear
k_\perp-factorization breaks down. It is replaced by a new concept, the
nonlinear k_\perp-factorization. Here we give a brief overview how topological
cross sections for hard processes on nuclei are obtained from nonlinear
k_\perp-factorization.
