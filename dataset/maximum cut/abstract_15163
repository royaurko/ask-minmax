Here we present a simple, but nevertheless, instructive model for the star
formation efficiency in turbulent molecular clouds. The model is based on the
assumption of log-normal density distribution which reflects the turbulent
nature of the interstellar medium (ISM). Together with the number count of
cloud cores, which follows a Salpeter-like core mass function (CMF), and the
minimum mass for the collapse of individual cloud cores, given by the local
Jeans mass, we are able to derive the SFE for clouds as a function of their
Jeans masses. We find a very generic power-law, SFE \propto
(M_cloud/M_J)^{-0.26} and a maximum SFE_max \sim 1/3 for the Salpeter case.
This result is independent of the turbulent Mach number but fairly sensitive to
variations of the CMF.
