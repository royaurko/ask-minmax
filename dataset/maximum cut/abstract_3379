This paper generalizes asymptotic properties obtained in the
observation-driven times series models considered by \cite{dou:kou:mou:2013} in
the sense that the conditional law of each observation is also permitted to
depend on the parameter. The existence of ergodic solutions and the consistency
of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) are derived under easy-to-check
conditions. The obtained conditions appear to apply for a wide class of models.
We illustrate our results with specific observation-driven times series,
including the recently introduced NBIN-GARCH and NM-GARCH models, demonstrating
the consistency of the MLE for these two models.
