In the Korean traditional board game Yut-Nori, teams compete by moving their
pieces on the two-dimensional game board, and the team whose all pieces
complete a round trip on the board wins. In every round, teams throw four
wooden sticks of the shape of half-cut cylinder and the number of sticks that
show belly sides, i.e., the flat sides, determines the number of steps the
team's piece can advance on the board. It is possible to pile up one team's
pieces if their sites are identical so that pieces as a group can move together
afterwards (piling). If a piece of the opponent team is at the new site of one
team's piece, the piece is caught and removed from the board, and the team is
given one more chance to throw sticks and proceed (catching). For a simplicity,
we simulate this game on one-dimensional board with the same number of sites as
the original game, and show that catching is more advantageous strategy than
piling to win. We also study the avalanche-size distribution in thermodynamic
limit to find that it follows an exponential form.
