Vertex symmetry for interacting fermions will be shown to lead to a
Lagrangian exhibiting $SU(2N)_W$ invariance associated with the subgroup
$SU(2N)_q \times SU(2N)_{\bar{q}}$ generated by $C$-odd and $C$-even spin
operators. Approximate $SU(6)_W$ vertex symmetry as well as chiral invariance
will then be shown to follow from a principle of maximum smoothness
(M\"oller-Rosenfeld) of the bound state quark wave function.
