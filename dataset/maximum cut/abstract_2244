We show that the twist decomposition of non-local scalar off-cone
QCD-operators, which in $x-$space is infinite, after Fourier transformation
with the singular functions $1/(x^2 - {\text{i}} \epsilon)^\lambda$ for
$\lambda = 1$ and 2 terminates at leading and sub-leading twist, respectively.
Therefore, only a finite number of twists contribute to the target mass
corrections of light-cone dominated scattering processes. Their explicit
expressions may be read off directly from the twist decomposition in $x-$space.
