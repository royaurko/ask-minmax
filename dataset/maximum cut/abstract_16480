We call a state ``vacuum bounded'' if every measurement performed outside a
specified interior region gives the same result as in the vacuum. We compute
the maximum entropy of a vacuum-bounded state with a given energy for a
one-dimensional model, with the aid of numerical calculations on a lattice. For
large energies we show that a vacuum-bounded system with length $L_in$ and a
given energy has entropy no more than $S^rb + (1/6) \ln S^rb$, where $S^rb$ is
the entropy in a rigid box with the same size and energy. Assuming that the
state resulting from the evaporation of a black hole is similar to a
vacuum-bounded state, and that the similarity between vacuum-bounded and rigid
box problems extends from 1 to 3 dimensions, we apply these results to the
black hole information paradox. Under these assumptions we conclude that large
amounts of information cannot be emitted in the final explosion of a black
hole.
  We also consider vacuum-bounded states at very low energies and come to the
surprising conclusion that the entropy of such a state can be much higher than
that of a rigid box state with the same energy. For a fixed $E$ we let $L_in'$
be the length of a rigid box which gives the same entropy as a vacuum-bounded
state of length $L_in$. In the $E\to 0$ limit we conjecture that the ratio
$L_in'/L_in$ grows without bound and support this conjecture with numerical
computations.
