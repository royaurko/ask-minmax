The generalization of the BGK relaxation model to the special relativity
setting is revisited here. We deal with several issues related to this
relativistic kinetic model which seem to have been overlooked in the previous
physical literature, including the unique determination of associated physical
parameters, classical, ultra-relativistic and hydrodynamical limits, maximum
entropy principles and the analysis of the linearized operator.
