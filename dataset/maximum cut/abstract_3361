We prove polynomial upper and lower bounds on the expected size of the
maximum agreement subtree of two random binary phylogenetic trees under both
the uniform distribution and Yule-Harding distribution. This positively answers
a question posed in earlier work. Determining tight upper and lower bounds
remains an open problem.
