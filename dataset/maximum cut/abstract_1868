We study extremal statistics and return intervals in stationary long-range
correlated sequences for which the underlying probability density function is
bounded and uniform. The extremal statistics we consider e.g., maximum relative
to minimum are such that the reference point from which the maximum is measured
is itself a random quantity. We analytically calculate the limiting
distributions for independent and identically distributed random variables, and
use these as a reference point for correlated cases. The distributions are
different from that of the maximum itself i.e., a Weibull distribution,
reflecting the fact that the distribution of the reference point either
dominates over or convolves with the distribution of the maximum. The
functional form of the limiting distributions is unaffected by correlations,
although the convergence is slower. We show that our findings can be directly
generalized to a wide class of stochastic processes. We also analyze return
interval distributions, and compare them to recent conjectures of their
functional form.
