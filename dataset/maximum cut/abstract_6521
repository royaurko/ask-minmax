The AMP Markov property is a recently proposed alternative Markov property
for chain graphs. In the case of continuous variables with a joint multivariate
Gaussian distribution, it is the AMP rather than the earlier introduced LWF
Markov property that is coherent with data-generation by natural
block-recursive regressions. In this paper, we show that maximum likelihood
estimates in Gaussian AMP chain graph models can be obtained by combining
generalized least squares and iterative proportional fitting to an iterative
algorithm. In an appendix, we give useful convergence results for iterative
partial maximization algorithms that apply in particular to the described
algorithm.
