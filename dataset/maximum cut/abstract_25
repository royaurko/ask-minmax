The amplitudes of the quadrupole and octopole measured from the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) appear to be lower than expected according to
the concordance Lambda CDM cosmology. However, the pseudo-Cl estimator used by
the WMAP team is non-optimal. In this paper, we discuss the effects of Galactic
cuts on pseudo-Cl and quadratic maximum likelihood estimators. An application
of a quadratic maximum likelihood estimator to Galaxy subtracted maps produced
by the WMAP team and Tegmark, de Oliveira-Costa and Hamilton (2003) shows that
the amplitudes of the low multipoles are stable to different Galactic cuts. In
particular, the quadrupole and octopole amplitudes are found to lie in the
ranges 176 - 250 (micro K)**2 794 - 1183 (micro K)**2 (and more likely to be at
the upper ends of these ranges) rather than the values of 123 (micro K)**2 and
611 (micro K)**2 found by the WMAP team. These results indicate that the
discrepancy with the concordance Lambda CDM model at low multipoles is not
particularly significant and is in the region of a few percent. This conclusion
is consistent with an analysis of the low amplitude of the angular correlation
function computed from quadratic maximum likelihood power spectrum estimates.
