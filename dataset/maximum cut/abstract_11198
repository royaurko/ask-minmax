The calibration of the Type Ia supernova distances using HST observations of
Cepheid variables is discussed. A new maximum likelihood method of calibration
is applied to derive the PL relation for a composite sample of Cepheids in the
LMC and in the SNIa host galaxies NGC5253 and IC4182. Our results show that the
calibration of the Cepheid PL relation is robust both to sampling error and to
luminosity and period selection effects. Hence, the outstanding uncertainty in
deriving estimates of $H_0$ from SNIa remains the dispersion of the SNIa
luminosity function, and not unresolved systematic errors in its Cepheid
calibration.
