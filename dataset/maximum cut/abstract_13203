A system of 'telegrapher's' equations for a number of long lines joined into
a network is studied. Explicit formulas for Fourier transforms of current and
voltage are derived. These formulas are very suitable for computer application
as well as for the analytical study of processes o networks. As an example, the
availability of formulas aids the derivation of explicit formulas for maxima of
current amplitude over the given class of admissible external influences. These
values may be used to indicate the characteristic of network robustness to
excess voltage or electromagnetic impulse. The approach is based on the
operational solution already proposed by the contributor for more general partial
differential equations on graphs.
