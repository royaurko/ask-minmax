We construct a cut-off version of nonpertubative closed Bosonic string field
theory in the light-cone gauge with imaginary string coupling constant. We show
that the partition function is a continuous function of the string coupling
constant, and conjecture a relation between the formal power series expansion
of this partition function and Riemann Surfaces.
