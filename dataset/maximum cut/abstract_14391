Association rule mining is an important data-mining technique that finds
interesting association among a large set of data items. Since it may disclose
patterns and various kinds of sensitive knowledge that are difficult to find
otherwise, it may pose a threat to the privacy of discovered confidential
information. Such information is to be protected against uncontributorized access.
Many strategies had been proposed to hide the information. Some use distributed
databases over several sites, data perturbation, clustering, and data
distortion techniques. Hiding sensitive rules problem, and still not
sufficiently investigated, is the requirement to balance the confidentiality of
the disclosed data with the legitimate needs of the user. The proposed approach
uses the data distortion technique where the position of the sensitive items is
altered but its support is never changed. The size of the database remains the
same. It uses the idea of representative rules to prune the rules first and
then hides the sensitive rules. Advantage of this approach is that it hides
maximum number of rules however, the existing approaches fail to hide all the
desired rules, which are supposed to be hidden in minimum number of passes. The
paper also compares of the proposed approach with existing ones.
