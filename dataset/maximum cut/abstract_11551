We consider filters for the detection and extraction of compact sources on a
background. We make a one-dimensional treatment (though a generalization to two
or more dimensions is possible) assuming that the sources have a Gaussian
profile whereas the background is modeled by an homogeneous and isotropic
Gaussian random field, characterized by a scale-free power spectrum. Local peak
detection is used after filtering. Then, a Bayesian Generalized Neyman-Pearson
test is used to define the region of acceptance that includes not only the
amplification but also the curvature of the sources and the a priori
probability distribution function of the sources. We search for an optimal
filter between a family of Matched-type filters (MTF) modifying the filtering
scale such that it gives the maximum number of real detections once fixed the
number density of spurious sources. We have performed numerical simulations to
test theoretical ideas.
