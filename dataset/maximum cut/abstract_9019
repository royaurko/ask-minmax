The magnetic field distribution in the barrier of small planar Josephson
tunnel junctions is numerically simulated in the case when an external magnetic
field is applied perpendicular to the barrier plane. The simulations allow for
heuristic analytical solutions for the Josephson static phase profile from
which the dependence of the maximum Josephson current on the applied field
amplitude is derived. The most common geometrical configurations are considered
and, when possible, the theoretical findings are compared with the experimental
data.
