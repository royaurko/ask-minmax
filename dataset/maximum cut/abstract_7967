Let S be a K3 surface and assume for simplicity that it does not contain any
(-2)-curve. Using coherent systems, we express every non-simple
Lazarsfeld-Mukai bundle on S as an extension of two sheaves of some special
type, that we refer to as generalized Lazarsfeld-Mukai bundles. This has
interesting consequences concerning the Brill-Noether theory of curves C lying
on S. From now on, let g denote the genus of C and A be a complete linear
series of type g^r_d on C such that d<= g-1 and the corresponding Brill-Noether
number is negative. First, we focus on the cases where A computes the Clifford
index; if r>1 and with only some completely classified exceptions, we show that
A coincides with the restriction to C of a line bundle on S. This is a
refinement of Green and Lazarsfeld's result on the constancy of the Clifford
index of curves moving in the same linear system. Then, we study a conjecture
of Donagi and Morrison predicting that, under no hypothesis on its Clifford
index, A is contained in a g^s_e which is cut out from a line bundle on S and
satisfies e<= g-1. We provide counterexamples to the last inequality already
for r=2. A slight modification of the conjecture, which holds for r=1,2, is
proved under some hypotheses on the pair (C,A) and its deformations. We show
that the result is optimal (in the sense that our hypotheses cannot be avoided)
by exhibiting, in the Appendix, some counterexamples obtained jointly with
Andreas Leopold Knutsen.
