We have analysed archived Ginga data on the Z source Sco X-2 (GX349+2). We
present the first detailed investigation of its X-ray fast-time variability, as
a function of position in the Z track. During the two-day observation over the
period 5-7 March 1989, the source was in the so-called flaring branch, and the
lower part of the so-called normal branch. We found broad peaked noise with a
centroid frequency and width of ~4-7 Hz and ~6-12 Hz respectively. The peaked
noise was strongest in the lower flaring branch, with a maximum fractional rms
amplitude of ~3 %. We conclude that it is not a manifestation of atoll source
high frequency noise, as had been suggested, and compare it with the power
spectral features seen in other Z sources. We find that the peaked noise is
markedly different to the quasi-periodic oscillations found in the normal and
flaring branches of Sco X-1; however it bears some resemblance to that seen in
the flaring branch of Cyg X-2 at low overall intensities.
