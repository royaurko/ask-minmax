From archived and recent high speed photometry of VW Hyi we find Dwarf Nova
Oscillations (DNOs) occasionally present throughout outburst, evolving from
14.06 s period at maximum to > 40 s near the end of outburst. A relatively slow
increase of period is followed by rapid increase and subsequent decrease.
  Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) are seen at periods of hundreds of
seconds. For the first time, an evolution of QPO period is seen, steadily
increasing during the final decline of an outburst. The occasional presence of
two DNOs, separated in frequency by the QPO frequency, suggests reprocessing of
the rotating DNO beam by a `wall' rotating progradely in the disc at the QPO
period.
