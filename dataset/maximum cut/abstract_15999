We discuss the long-term evolution of the broad double-peaked H alpha profile
of the LINER/Seyfert 1 nucleus of NGC 1097. Besides the previously known
variation of the relative intensities of the blue and red peaks, the profile
has recently shown an increasing separation between the two peaks, at the same
time as the integrated flux has decreased. We successfully model these
variations using a precessing asymmetric accretion disk with a varying
emissivity law. We interpret the emissivity variation as due to the fact that
the source of ionization is getting dimmer, causing the region of maximum
emission to drift inwards (and thus to regions of higher velocities). In
addition, in the last 3 yrs of observations, the central wavelength of the
double-peaked line has shifted to bluer wavelengths, which may be due to a wind
from the disk. It is the first time that such evolution is observed so clearly,
giving additional support for an accretion disk as the origin of the
double-peaked profile in NGC 1097.
