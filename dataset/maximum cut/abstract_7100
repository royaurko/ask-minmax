We address the question of how the electrocaloric effect in epitaxial thin
films of the prototypical ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ is affected by the clamping
to the substrate and by substrate-induced misfit strain. We use molecular
dynamics simulations and a first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian to
calculate the adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T$ under different epitaxial
constraints. Our results demonstrate that, consistent with phenomenological
theory, clamping by the substrate reduces the maximum $\Delta T$ compared to
bulk BaTiO$_3$. On the other hand, compressive misfit-strain leads to a strong
increase of $\Delta T$ and shifts the maximum of the electrocaloric effect to
higher temperatures. A rather small compressive strain of $-0.75$% is
sufficient to obtain a $\Delta T$ that is larger than the corresponding bulk
value.
