We investigate the prospects of supersymmetry searches at the LHC with 7 TeV
energy. A new set of selection cuts is proposed based on event shapes to
control backgrounds. Our preliminary studies show that it is possible to
minimize backgrounds to a significantly low level and conservative estimate
suggests that the mass reach can be extended to $\sim$ 1.1 TeV for luminosity
1/fb with a reasonable signal-to-background ratio.
