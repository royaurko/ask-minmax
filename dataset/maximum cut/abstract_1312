Recently interesting data on $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ in Au-Au collisions ($\eta=-\ln
\tan (\theta/2)$) with the centrality cuts have been reported by PHOBOS
Collaboration. Their data are usually divided by the number of participants
(nucleons) in collisions. Instead of this way, using the total multiplicity
$N_{ch} = \int (dN_{ch}/d\eta)d\eta$, we find that there is scaling phenomenon
among $(N_{ch})^{-1}dN_{ch}/d\eta = dn/d\eta$ with different centrality cuts at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 130$ GeV. To explain this scaling behavior of $dn/d\eta$, we
consider the stochastic approach called the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with two
sources. Moreover, comparisons of $dn/d\eta$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 130$ GeV with
that at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV have been made. A possible detection method
of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) thorough $dn/d\eta$ is presented.
