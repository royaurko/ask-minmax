We extend the notion of thin multiple Heegaard splittings of a link in a
3-manifold to take into consideration not only compressing disks but also
cut-disks for the Heegaard surfaces. We prove that if H is a c-strongly
compressible bridge surface for a link K contained in a closed orientable
irreducible 3-manifold M then one of the following is satisfied:
  H is stabilized,
  H is meridionally stabilized,
  H is perturbed, a component of K is removable, M contains an essential
meridional surface.
