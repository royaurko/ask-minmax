AgapeZ1 is the brightest and the shortest duration microlensing candidate
event found in the Agape data. It occured only 42" from the center of M31. Our
photometry shows that the half intensity duration of the event6 is 4.8 days and
at maximum brightness we measure a stellar magnitude of R=18.0 with B-R=0.80
mag color. A search on HST archives produced a single resolved star within the
projected event position error box. Its magnitude is R=22.
