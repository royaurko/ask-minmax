We analyse the structure of one-loop self-energy graphs for the rho meson in
real time formulation of finite temperature field theory. We find the
discontinuities of these graphs across the unitary and the Landau cuts. These
contributions are identified with different sources of medium modification
discussed in the literature. We also calculate numerically the imaginary and
the real parts of the self-energies and construct the spectral function of the
rho meson, which are compared with an earlier determination. A significant
contribution arises from the unitary cut of the pi-omega loop, that was ignored
so far in the literature.
