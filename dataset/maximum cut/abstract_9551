We propose a full-rate iterated space-time code construction, to design
2n-dimensional codes from n-dimensional cyclic algebra based codes. We give a
condition to determine whether the resulting codes satisfy the full-diversity
property, and study their maximum likelihood decoding complexity with respect
to sphere decoding. Particular emphasis is given to the cases n = 2, sometimes
referred to as MIDO (multiple input double output) codes, and n = 3. In the
process, we derive an interesting way of obtaining division algebras, and study
their center and maximal subfield.
