We investigate theoretically an angle dependence of enhancement of polar
magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) obtained thanks to a deposition of a
paramagnetic Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor (DMS) layer on one-dimensional
photonic crystal layer. Our transfer matrix method based calculations conducted
for TE and TM polarizations of the incident light predict up to an order of
magnitude stronger MOKE for a (Ga,Fe)N DMS layer when implementing the proposed
design. The maximum enhancement for TE and TM polarization occurs for the light
incidence at the normal and at the Brewster angle, respectively. This indicates
a possibility of tuning of the MOKE enhancement by adjustment of the
polarization and the incidence angle of the light.
