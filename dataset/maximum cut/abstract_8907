It is shown that the system of two three-level atoms in $\Lambda$
configuration in a cavity can evolve to a long-lived maximum entangled state if
the Stokes photons vanish from the cavity by means of either leakage or
damping. The difference in evolution picture corresponding to the general model
and effective model with two-photon process in two-level system is discussed.
