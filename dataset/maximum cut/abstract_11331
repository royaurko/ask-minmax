We calculate the secondary anisotropies in the CMB produced by inhomogeneous
reionization from simulations in which the effects of radiative and stellar
feedback effects on galaxy formation have been included. This allows to
self-consistently determine the beginning ($z_i\approx 30$), the duration ($
\delta z\approx 20$) and the (nonlinear) evolution of the reionization process
for a critical density CDM model. In addition, from the simulated spatial
distribution of ionized regions, we are able to calculate the evolution of the
two-point ionization correlation function, $C_\chi$, and obtain the power
spectrum of the anisotropies, $C_\ell$, in the range $5000 < \ell < 10^6$. The
power spectrum has a broad maximum around $\ell \approx 30000$, where it
reaches the value $2\times 10^{-12}$. We also show that the angular correlation
function $C(\theta)$ is not Gaussian, but at separation angles $% \theta
\lower.5ex\hbox{\ltsima} 10^{-4}$ rad it can be approximated by a modified
Lorentzian shape; at larger separations an anticorrelation signal is predicted.
Detection of signals as above will be possible with future mm-wavelength
interferometers like ALMA, which appears as an optimum instrument to search for
signatures of inhomogeneous reionization.
