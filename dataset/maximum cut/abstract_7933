Galactic black hole transients show many interesting phenomena during
outburst decays. We present simultaneous X-ray (RXTE, Swift, and INTEGRAL), and
optical/near-infrared (O/NIR) observations (SMARTS) of the X-ray transient XTE
J1752-223 during its outburst decay in 2010. The multiwavelength observations
over 150 days in 2010 cover the transition from soft to hard spectral state. We
discuss the evolution of radio emission is with respect to the O/NIR light
curve which shows several flares. One of those flares is bright and long,
starting about 60 days after the transition in X-ray timing properties. During
this flare, the radio spectral index becomes harder. Other smaller flares occur
along with the X-ray timing transition, and also right after the detection of
the radio core. We discuss the significances of these flares. Furthermore,
using the simultaneous broadband X-ray spectra including INTEGRAL, we find that
a high energy cut-off with a folding energy near 250 keV is necessary around
the time that the compact jet is forming. The broad band spectrum can be fitted
equally well with a Comptonization model. In addition, using photoelectric
absorption edges in the XMM-Newton RGS X-ray spectra and the extinction of red
clump giants in the direction of the source, we find a lower limit on the
distance of > 5 kpc.
