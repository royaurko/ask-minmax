We measure the resistivity and Hall angle of the electron-doped
superconductor Pr_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_4 as a function of doping and temperature. The
resistivity Rho_xx at temperatures 100K < T < 300K is mostly sensitive to the
electrons. Its temperature behavior is doping independent over a wide doping
range and even for non superconducting samples. On the other hand,the
transverse resistivity rho_xy, or the Hall angle theta_H where cot(theta_H) =
rho_xx/rho_xy, is sensitive to both holes and electrons. Its temperature
dependence is strongly influenced by doping, and cot(theta_H) can be used to
identify optimum doping (the maximum Tc) even well above the critical
temperature. These results lead to a conclusion that in electron doped cuprates
holes are responsible for the superconductivity.
