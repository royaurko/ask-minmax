We present a study of black hole threshold phenomena for a self-gravitating,
massive complex scalar field in spherical symmetry. We construct Type I
critical solutions dynamically by tuning a one-parameter family of initial data
composed of a boson star and a massless real scalar field. The real field is
used to perturb the boson star via a gravitational interaction which results in
a {\em significant} transfer of energy. The resulting critical solutions, which
show great similarity with unstable boson stars, persist for a finite time
before dispersing or forming a black hole. We extend the stability analysis of
Gleiser and Watkins [Nucl. Phys. B319, 733 (1989)], providing a method for
calculating the radial dependence of boson star modes of nonzero frequency. We
find good agreement between our critical solutions and boson star modes. For
critical solutions less than 90% of the maximum boson star mass $M_{\rm max}
\simeq 0.633 M_{Pl}^2/m$, a small halo of matter appears in the tail of the
solution. This halo appears to be an artifact of the collision between the
original boson star and the real field, and does not belong to the true
critical solution. It seems that unstable boson stars are unstable to dispersal
in addition to black hole formation. Given the similarity in macroscopic
stability between boson and neutron stars, we suggest that neutron stars at or
beyond the point of instability may also be unstable to explosion.
