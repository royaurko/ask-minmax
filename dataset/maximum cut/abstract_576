Assuming the length of the $3\pi$ cut to be finite and approximating the
integrated amplitude by a constant, we derive an expression for the $\pi
N\bar{N}$ form factor which is very close to that given by a simple pole. The
specific predictions of the obtained form factor for the region of small
momentum transfer are discussed along the lines of the Goldberger-Treiman
relation.
