Let G be a group acting faithfully on a set X. The distinguishing number of
the action of G on X is the smallest number of colors such that there exists a
coloring of X where no nontrivial group element induces a color-preserving
permutation of X. In this paper, we show that if G is nilpotent of class c or
supersolvable of length c then G always acts with distinguishing number at most
c+1. We obtain that all metacyclic groups act with distinguishing number at
most 3; these include all groups of squarefree order. We also prove that the
distinguishing number of the action of the general linear group over a field K
on the vector space K^n is 2 if K has at least n+1 elements.
