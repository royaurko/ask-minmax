A standard way to approximate the distance between any two vertices $p$ and
$q$ on a mesh is to compute, in the associated graph, a shortest path from $p$
to $q$ that goes through one of $k$ sources, which are well-chosen vertices.
Precomputing the distance between each of the $k$ sources to all vertices of
the graph yields an efficient computation of approximate distances between any
two vertices. One standard method for choosing $k$ sources, which has been used
extensively and successfully for isometry-invariant surface processing, is the
so-called Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), which starts with a random vertex as
the first source, and iteratively selects the farthest vertex from the already
selected sources.
  In this paper, we analyze the stretch factor $\mathcal{F}_{FPS}$ of
approximate geodesics computed using FPS, which is the maximum, over all pairs
of distinct vertices, of their approximated distance over their geodesic
distance in the graph. We show that $\mathcal{F}_{FPS}$ can be bounded in terms
of the minimal value $\mathcal{F}^*$ of the stretch factor obtained using an
optimal placement of $k$ sources as $\mathcal{F}_{FPS}\leq 2 r_e^2
\mathcal{F}^*+ 2 r_e^2 + 8 r_e + 1$, where $r_e$ is the ratio of the lengths of
the longest and the shortest edges of the graph. This provides some evidence
explaining why farthest point sampling has been used successfully for
isometry-invariant shape processing. Furthermore, we show that it is
NP-complete to find $k$ sources that minimize the stretch factor.
