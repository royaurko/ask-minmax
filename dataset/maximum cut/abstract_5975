Distributional sources of cosmic walls crossed by cosmic strings from
Riemann-Cartan (RC) Geometry. The matter density of the planar wall is maximum
at the point where the cosmic string crosses the cosmic wall. Cartan torsion is
has a support on the cosmic string given by the Dirac $ \delta $-function. Off
the sources are left with a torsionless vacuum.
