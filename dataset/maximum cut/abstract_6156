The notion of a $\delta$-minimum edge-colouring was introduced by J-L.
Fouquet (in his french PhD Thesis \cite{FouPhD}). Here we present some
structural properties of $\delta$-minimum edge-colourings, partially taken from
the above thesis. The paper serves as an auxiliary tool for another paper
submitted by the contributors to Graphs and Combinatorics.
