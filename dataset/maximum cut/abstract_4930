Electroweak radiative corrections give rise to large negative,
double-logarithmically enhanced corrections in the TeV region. These are partly
compensated by real radiation and, moreover, affected by selecting
isospin-noninvariant external states. We investigate the impact of real gauge
boson radiation more quantitatively by considering different restricted final
state configurations. We consider successively a massive abelian gauge theory,
a spontaneously broken SU(2) theory and the electroweak Standard Model. We find
that details of the choice of the phase space cuts, in particular whether a
fraction of collinear and soft radiation is included, have a strong impact on
the relative amount of real and virtual corrections.
