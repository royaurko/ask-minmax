Artificial monolayer black phosphorus, the so-called phosphorene has
attracted global interest with its distinguished anisotropic optoelectronic and
electronic properties. Here, we unraveled the shear-induced direct to indirect
gap transition and anisotropy diminution in phosphorene based on
first-principles calculations. Lattice dynamic analysis demonstrated that
phosphorene can sustain up to 10% applied shear strain. The band gap of
phosphorene experiences a direct to indirect transition when 5% shear strain is
applied. The electronic origin of direct to indirect gap transition from 1.54
eV at ambient condition to 1.22 eV at 10% shear strains for phosphorene was
explored and the anisotropy diminution in phosphorene is discussed by
calculating the maximum sound velocities, effective mass and decomposed charge
density, which signals the undesired shear-induced direct to indirect gap
transition in the applications of phosphorene for electronics and
optoelectronics. On the other hand, the shear-induced electronic anisotropy
properties suggest that phosphorene can be applied as the switcher in the nano
electronic applications.
