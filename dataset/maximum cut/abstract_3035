We tested the ejector-propeller model of the Be/X-ray binary LSI+61303 (V 615
Cas, GT 0236+620) by using the parameters predicted by the model in the
calculations of the X-ray and radio variability. The results are: (1) in terms
of the Ejector-Propeller model, the X-ray maximum is due to the periastron
passage; (2) the radio outburst can be really a result of the transition from
the propeller to ejector regimes; (3) the radio outburst will delay with
respect to the X-ray maximum every orbital period. The proposed scenario seems
to be in good agreement with the observations.
