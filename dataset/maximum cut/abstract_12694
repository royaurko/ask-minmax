Ab initio calculations including electron correlation are still extremely
costly except for the smallest atoms and molecules. Therefore, our purpose in
the present study is to employ a bond-order correlation approach to obtain, via
equilibrium molecular energies, molecular dissociation energies and heats of
formation for some 20 molecules containing C, H, and O atoms, with a maximum
number of electrons around 40. Finally, basis set choice is shown to be
important in the proposed procedure to include electron correlation effects in
determining thermodynamic properties. With the optimum choice of basis set, the
average percentage error for some 20 molecules is approximately 20% for heats
of formation. For molecular dissociation energies the average error is much
smaller: ~0.4.
