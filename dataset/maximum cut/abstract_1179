I make the first estimates of maximum elastic quadrupole deformations
sustainable by alternatives to conventional neutron stars. Solid strange quark
stars might sustain maximum ellipticities (dimensionless quadrupoles) up to a
few times $10^{-4}$ rather than a few times $10^{-7}$ for conventional neutron
stars, and hybrid quark-baryon or meson-condensate stars might sustain up to
$10^{-5}$. Most of the difference is due to the shear modulus, which can be up
to $10^{33}$ erg/cm$^3$ rather than $10^{30}$ erg/cm$^3$ in the inner crust of
a conventional neutron star. Maximum solid strange star ellipticities are
comparable to upper limits obtained for several known pulsars in a recent
gravitational-wave search by LIGO. Maximum ellipticities of the more robust
hybrid model will be detectable by LIGO at initial design sensitivity. A large
shear modulus also strengthens the case for starquakes as an explanation for
frequent pulsar glitches.
