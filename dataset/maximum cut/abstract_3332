Correlations have been studied between longitudinal and latitudinal shifts of
sunspot groups in the period 1986-1998. This study is based on the Debrecen
Photoheliographic Data (DPD). The latitudinal distribution of the correlation
values exhibits the expected Coriolis-pattern on the entire period:
negative/positive correlations in the northern/southern hemispheres, gradually
disappearing toward the equator. The yearly distributions, however, show an
interesting cycle dependence: after the unambiguous Coriolis patterns during
the growing phase of the cycle the latitudinal dependence of the correlations
gets ambiguous at the activity maximum. This may be related to the Gnevyshev
gap, the depression of the cycle time-profile at the maximum.
