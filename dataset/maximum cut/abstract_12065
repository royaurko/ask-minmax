We model a microscopic heat engine as a particle hopping on a one-dimensional
lattice in a periodic sawtooth potential, with or without load, assisted by the
thermal kicks it gets from alternately placed hot and cold thermal baths. We
find analytic expressions for current and rate of heat flow when the engine
operates at steady state. Three regions are identified where the model acts
either as a heat engine or as a refrigerator or as neither of the two. At
quasistatic limit both efficiency of the engine and coefficient of performance
of the refrigerator go to that for Carnot engine and Carnot refrigerator,
respectively. We investigate efficiency of the engine at two operating
conditions (at maximum power and at optimum value with respect to energy and
time) and compare them with those of the endoreversible and Carnot engines.
