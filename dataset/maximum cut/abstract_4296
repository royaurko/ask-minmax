Gribov approach to high-energy interactions of hadrons and nuclei is reviewed
and applied to calculation of particle production in heavy-ions collisions. It
is pointed out that the AGK (Abramovsky, Gribov, Kancheli) cutting rules is a
powerful tool to investigate particle spectra in these processes. It leads, in
the Glauber approximation, to a simple formula for the density of hadrons
produced in the central rapidity region in nucleus-nucleus interactions. An
estimate of this density for RHIC and LHC is presented and compared with
results of Monte-Carlo calculations. It is shown that the Glauber approximation
substantially overestimate particle densities compared to the results of the
complete Gribov theory. This is due to extra shadowing in the system, related
to large mass diffraction which leads to a strong decrease of particle
densities at mid rapidities. Our method of calculation of these effects has
been applied to the problem of shadowing of nuclear structure functions and a
good agreement with experimental data has been obtained.
