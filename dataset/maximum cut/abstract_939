The $n$-dimensional $p$-filiform Leibniz algebras of maximum length have
already been studied with $0\leq p\leq 2$. For Lie algebras whose nilindex is
equal to $n-2$ there is only one characteristic sequence, $(n-2,1,1)$, while in
Leibniz theory we obtain two possibilities: $(n-2,1,1)$ and $(n-2,2)$. The
first case (the 2-filiform case) is already known. The present paper deals with
the second case, i.e., quasi-filiform non Lie Leibniz algebras of maximum
length. Therefore this work completes the study of maximum length of Leibniz
algebras with nilindex $n-p$ with $0 \leq p \leq 2$.
