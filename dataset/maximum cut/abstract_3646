We endorse the comment on our recent paper [En{\ss}lin and Weig, Phys. Rev. E
82, 051112 (2010)] by Iatsenko, Stefanovska and McClintock [Phys. Rev. E 85
033101 (2012)] and we try to clarify the origin of the apparent controversy on
two issues. The aim of the minimal Gibbs free energy approach to provide a
signal estimate is not affected by their Comment. However, if one wants to
extend the method to also infer the a posteriori signal uncertainty any
tempering of the posterior has to be undone at the end of the calculations, as
they correctly point out. Furthermore, a distinction is made here between
maximum entropy, the maximum entropy principle, and the so-called maximum
entropy method in imaging, hopefully clarifying further the second issue of
their Comment paper.
