Ongoing calculations on the QCDOC supercomputer at Brookhaven National
Laboratory and the APEnext installation at the University of Bielefeld aim to
determine the critical temperature of the QCD phase transition as well as the
equation of state with almost realistic quark masses. We will discuss
preliminary results of the quark mass and cut-off dependence of order
parameters, susceptibilities, static quark potentials and the critical
temperature in (2+1)-flavor QCD. All these quantities are of immediate interest
for heavy ion phenomenology.
