We discuss exclusive double diffractive (EDD) production of Higgs boson and
heavy quark - heavy antiquark pairs at high energies. Differential
distributions for $c \bar c$ at $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.96 GeV and for $b \bar b$ at
$\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV are shown and discussed. Irreducible leading-order $b \bar
b $ background to Higgs production is calculated in several kinematical
variables. The signal-to-background ratio is shown and several improvements are
suggested by imposing cuts on $b$ ($\bar b$) transverse momenta and rapidities.
