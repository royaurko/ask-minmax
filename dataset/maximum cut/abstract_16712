Recently, Hellerman and Schnabl considered the dynamics of unstable D-branes
in the background of a linear dilaton. Remarkably, they were able to construct
light-like tachyon solutions which interpolate smoothly between the
perturbative and nonperturbative vacua, without undergoing the wild
oscillations that plague time-like solutions. In their analysis, however, the
full structure of the initial value problem for the nonlocal dynamical
equations was not considered. In this paper, therefore, we reexamine the
nonlinear dynamics of light-like tachyon condensation using a combination of
numerical and analytical techniques. We find that for the p-adic string the
monotonic behaviour obtained previously relied on a special choice of initial
conditions near the unstable maximum. For generic initial conditions the wild
oscillations come back to haunt us. Interestingly, we find an "island of
stability" in initial condition space that leads to sensible evolution at late
times. For the string field theory case, on the other hand, we find that the
evolution is completely stable for generic choices of initial data. This
provides an explicit example of a string theoretic system that admits
infinitely many initial data but is nevertheless nonperturbatively stable.
Qualitatively similar dynamics are obtained in nonlocal cosmologies where the
Hubble damping plays a role very analogous to the dilaton gradient.
