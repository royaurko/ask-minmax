In succession to the first paper (arXiv 1406.6204v5), the impurity-atom
concentrations when the Fermi levels are either at the valence band maximum
(VBM) or the conduction band minimum (CBM) were identified for diamond, cubic
boron nitride (cBN), and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using the
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) scheme using the local density approximation
(LDA). In the present paper, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was
used instead of the LDA for exchange-correlation. The impurity atoms were B and
N for diamond, Be, Si, and C for cBN, and Be for hBN; these impurity atoms were
known in the first paper to form degenerate states by increased impurity-atom
concentrations. The impurity-atom concentrations when the Fermi level was
located either at the VBM or the CBM were as follows: (i) the B concentration
was 0.27 at.% in B-doped diamond, (ii) the N concentration was 0.25 at.% in
N-doped diamond, (iii) the concentration of Be substituting B was 0.88 at.% in
cBN, (iv) the concentration of Si substituting B was 0.06 at.% in cBN, (v) the
concentration of C substituting B was 0.07 at.% in cBN, (vi) the concentration
of C substituting N was 0.88 at.% in cBN, and (vii) the concentration of Be
substituting B was 1.80 at.% in hBN. The values of (iv) and (v) were
significantly smaller than the corresponding values in paper I, but it was
attributed to the input parameters used in the present paper, hence it was
concluded that the computed concentrations were not sensitive to the GGA used.
