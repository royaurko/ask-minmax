In applications, reinforced random walks are often used to model the
influence of past choices among a finite number of possibilities on the next
choice. For instance, in an urn model with balls of two colors (red and green),
the probability of drawing a red ball at time $n+1$ is a function of the
proportion of red balls at time $n$, and this proportion changes after each
draw. The most famous example is Polya's urn. This function, called the choice
function, can be known up to a finite dimensional parameter. In this paper, we
study two estimators of this parameter, the maximum likelihood estimator and a
weighted least squares estimator which is less efficient but is closer to the
calibration techniques used in the applied literature. In general, the model is
an inhomogeneous Markov chain and because of this inhomogeneity, it is not
possible to estimate this parameter on a single path, even if it were infinite.
Therefore we assume that we can observe i.i.d.~experiments, each of a
predetermined finite length. This is coherent with the experimental set-up we
are interested in: the selection of a path by laboratory ants. We study our
estimators in a general framework and then restrict to a particular model in
order to do a simulation study and an application to a an experiment with ants.
Our findings do not contradict the biological literature, but we give
statistical significance to the values of the parameter found therein. In
particular we compute Bootstrap confidence intervals.
