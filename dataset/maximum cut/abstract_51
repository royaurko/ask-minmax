Multipoles are the pieces we obtain by cutting some edges of a cubic graph.
As a result of the cut, a multipole $M$ has dangling edges with one free end,
which we call semiedges. Then, every 3-edge-coloring of a multipole induces a
coloring or state of its semiedges, which satisfies the Parity Lemma.
Multipoles have been extensively used in the study of snarks, that is, cubic
graphs which are not 3-edge-colorable. Some results on the states and structure
of the so-called color complete and color closed multipoles are presented. In
particular, we give lower and upper linear bounds on the minimum order of a
color complete multipole, and compute its exact number of states. Given two
multipoles $M_1$ and $M_2$ with the same number of semiedges, we say that $M_1$
is reducible to $M_2$ if the state set of $M_2$ is a non-empty subset of the
state set of $M_1$ and $M_2$ has less vertices than $M_1$. The function $v(m)$
is defined as the maximum number of vertices of an irreducible multipole with
$m$ semiedges. The exact values of $v(m)$ are only known for $m\le 5$. We prove
that tree and cycle multipoles are irreducible and, as a byproduct, that $v(m)$
has a linear lower bound.
