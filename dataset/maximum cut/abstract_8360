The capacitance of a double-heterojunction structure with a wide GaAs undoped
layer embedded between two selectively doped AlGaAs barriers is calculated
self-consistently as a function of intensity of the in-plane magnetic field.
With increasing field intensity the capacitance initially increases and after
reaching a maximum decreases toward a high field limit which is less than its
zero field value. This behaviour is attributed to 'breathing', or charge
redistribution, of the 2D electron gas at individual heterojunctions due to a
combination of the confining potential and the magnetic field.
