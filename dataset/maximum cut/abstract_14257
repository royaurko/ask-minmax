We study the gravity dual of a Lifshitz field theory in the context of a RSII
brane-world scenario, taking into account the effects of the extra dimension
through the contribution of the electric part of the Weyl tensor. We study the
thermodynamical behavior of such asymptotically Lifshitz black holes. It is
shown that the entropy imposes the critical exponent $z$ to be bounded from
above. This maximum value of $z$ corresponds to a positive infinite entropy as
long as the temperature is kept positive. The stability and phase transition
for different spatial topologies are also discussed.
