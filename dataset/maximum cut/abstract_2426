In this work we attempt to show in a clear and simple manner the fundamental
ideas of the Renormalization Theory. With that intention we use two well-known
problems of the Physic and Engeneering undergraduate students, the calculation
of the electrostatic and vector potential of a infinite line charge density and
current, respectively. We still employ different regularization methods
(cut-off, dimensional and zeta function) and the arising of the scale parameter
is consider.
