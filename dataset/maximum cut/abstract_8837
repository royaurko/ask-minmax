We study the structure of newly born neutron stars (protoneutron stars)
within the finite temperature Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone theoretical approach
including also hyperons. We find that for purely nucleonic stars both finite
temperature and neutrino trapping reduce the value of the maximum mass. For
hyperonic stars the effect is reversed, because neutrino trapping shifts the
appearance of hyperons to larger baryon density and stiffens considerably the
equation of state.
