ROSAT High Resolution Imager (HRI) data from eight observations have been
co-added to obtain an effective exposure of 230 ksec. We have identified a
number of features and regions with excess X-ray brightness over that from a
circularly symmetric model of the well known hot gas component. A prominent
`spur' extends 4' from the vicinity of knot A towards the south-west. The
brightness to the south and east of this spur is significantly higher than that
to the north and west. Excess brightness is also found to the East of the
nucleus, with a local maximum centered on the eastern radio lobe 3' from the
core.
  There are two well known relationships between radio and x-ray emission for
radio galaxies in clusters: coincidence of emissions because the X-rays come
from inverse Compton or synchrotron processes; and anti-coincidence caused by
exclusion of hot gas from radio entities. We present a radio/X-ray comparison
to determine if either of these relationships can be isolated in M87. The
greatest obstacle we face is the unknown projection which affects both bands.
