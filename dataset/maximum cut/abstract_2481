We propose a mechanism for optical energy squeezing and anomalous light
tunneling through arbitrarily-shaped plasmonic ultranarrow channels and bends
connecting two larger plasmonic metal-insulator-metal waveguides. It is shown
how a proper design of sub-wavelength optical channels at cut-off, patterned by
plasmonic implants and connecting larger plasmonic waveguides, may allow
enhanced resonant transmission, inspired by the anomalous properties of
epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterials. The resonant tunneling is shown to be
only weakly dependent on the channel length and its specific geometry, such as
possible presence of abruptions and bends.
