The seismic potential of any regional seismogenic area is analyzed in terms
of the "open physical system" inflow - outflow energy balance model
(Thanassoulas, 2008, Part - I). Following the magnitude determination method
presented by Thanassoulas, (2008, Part - II) any region of any arbitrary area
extent is assumed as being a potential seismogenic region. Consequently, the
capability for the generation of a maximum magnitude future EQ at each virtual
seismogenic region is investigated all over Greece at certain times. The later
results are used to compile maps of the seismic potential / maximum expected EQ
magnitude for Greece at 5 year's intervals ranging from 1970 to 2000. The
comparison of these seismic potential maps / maximum expected EQ magnitude to
the corresponding seismicity (M>6R) for each corresponding 5 years period
reveals their tight interrelation. Therefore, the calculated seismic potential
/ maximum expected EQ magnitude, due to its drastic change in time in any
seismogenic region, is a dynamic in time parameter which indicates the seismic
energy charge status of each seismogenic area.
