GRAVITY is the four-beam, near- infrared, AO-assisted, fringe tracking,
astrometric and imaging instrument for the Very Large Telescope Interferometer
(VLTI). It is requiring the development of one of the most complex instrument
software systems ever built for an ESO instrument. Apart from its many
interfaces and interdependencies, one of the most challenging aspects is the
overall performance and stability of this complex system. The three infrared
detectors and the fast reflective memory network (RMN) recorder contribute a
total data rate of up to 20 MiB/s accumulating to a maximum of 250 GiB of data
per night. The detectors, the two instrument Local Control Units (LCUs) as well
as the five LCUs running applications under TAC (Tools for Advanced Control)
architecture, are interconnected with fast Ethernet, RMN fibers and dedicated
fiber connections as well as signals for the time synchronization. Here we give
a simplified overview of all subsystems of GRAVITY and their interfaces and
discuss two examples of high-level applications during observations: the
acquisition procedure and the gathering and merging of data to the final FITS
file.
