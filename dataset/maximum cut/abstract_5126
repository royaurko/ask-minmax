We report results on the Coulomb-gauge ghost propagator and the color-Coulomb
potential computed in two lattice gauge-field ensembles: (1) configurations
derived from our recently proposed Yang-Mills vacuum wave functional in 2+1
dimensions, and (2) lattices generated by Monte Carlo simulations of the
three-dimensional Euclidean SU(2) lattice gauge theory with the Wilson action.
We observe remarkable agreement between the ghost propagators in both
ensembles, but some differences in the potentials. Those originate from rare
configurations with very small values of the lowest eigenvalue of the
Coulomb-gauge Faddeev-Popov operator. If the same cuts on such exceptional
configurations are applied in both ensembles, then the color-Coulomb potentials
are also in reasonably good agreement.
