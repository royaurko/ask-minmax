The errors-in-variables (EIV) regression model, being more realistic by
accounting for measurement errors in both the dependent and the independent
variables, is widely adopted in applied sciences. The traditional EIV model
estimators, however, can be highly biased by outliers and other departures from
the underlying assumptions. In this paper, we develop a novel nonparametric
regression approach - the robust compound regression (RCR) analysis method for
the robust estimation of EIV models. We first introduce a robust and efficient
estimator called least sine squares (LSS). Taking full advantage of both the
new LSS method and the compound regression analysis method developed in our own
group, we subsequently propose the RCR approach as a generalization of those
two, which provides a robust counterpart of the entire class of the maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) solutions of the EIV model, in a 1-1 mapping.
Technically, our approach gives users the flexibility to select from a class of
RCR estimates the optimal one with a predefined regression efficiency criterion
satisfied. Simulation studies and real-life examples are provided to illustrate
the effectiveness of the RCR approach.
