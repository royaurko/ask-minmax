In this paper, we introduce a new multivariate discrete distribution which
called multivariate unification of generalized Apostol type distribution
(UGAT). Several prop- erties are studied as, moments, probability generating
function and other properties. Also, reliability study of distribution are
introduced. Maximum likelihood method is used to estimate parameters and
numerical method is used to obtain (MLEs).
