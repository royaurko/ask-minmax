We present the studies of electrical transport and magnetic interactions in
Zn_{1-x}Mn_{x}GeAs_{2} crystals with low Mn content 0 \leq x \leq 0.043. We
show that the ionic-acceptor defects are mainly responsible for the strong
p-type conductivity of our samples. We found that the negative
magnetoresistance (MR) with maximum values of about -50% is related to the weak
localization phenomena. The magnetic properties of Zn1-xMnxGeAs2 samples show
that the random Mn-distribution in the cation sites of the host lattice occurs
only for the sample with the lowest Mn-content, x=0.003. The samples with
higher Mn-content show a high level of magnetic frustration. Nonzero
Curie-Weiss temperature observed in all our samples indicates that weak
ferromagnetic (for x=0.003) or antiferromagnetic (for x>0.005) interactions
with |{\Theta}|<3 K are present in this system. The RKKY model, used to
estimate the Mn-hole exchange integral Jpd for the diluted
Zn/0.997/Mn/0.003/GeAs/2/ sample, makes possible to estimate the value of Jpd
=(0.75+/-0.09) eV.
