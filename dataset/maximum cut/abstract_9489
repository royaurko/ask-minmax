We study the weak convergence (in the high-frequency limit) of the parameter
estimators of power spectrum coefficients associated with Gaussian, spherical
and isotropic random fields. In particular, we introduce a Whittle-type
approximate maximum likelihood estimator and we investigate its asympotic weak
consistency and Gaussianity, in both parametric and semiparametric cases.
