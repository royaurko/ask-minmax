For the sum process $X=X^1+X^2$ of a bivariate L\'evy process $(X^1,X^2)$
with possibly dependent components, we derive a quintuple law describing the
first upwards passage event of $X$ over a fixed barrier, caused by a jump, by
the joint distribution of five quantities: the time relative to the time of the
previous maximum, the time of the previous maximum, the overshoot, the
undershoot and the undershoot of the previous maximum. The dependence between
the jumps of $X^1$ and $X^2$ is modeled by a L\'evy copula. We calculate these
quantities for some examples, where we pay particular attention to the
influence of the dependence structure. We apply our findings to the ruin event
of an insurance risk process.
