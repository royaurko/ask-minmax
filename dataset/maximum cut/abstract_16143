We present simulations of quasar colors, magnitudes, and numbers at redshifts
5<z<10 based on our discovery of ten new high-redshift quasars and the cloning
of lower redshift Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars. The ten quasars have
redshifts ranging from z=4.7 to z=5.3 and i-magnitudes of 20.21 to 20.94. The
natural diversity of spectral features in the cloned sample allows more
realistic simulation of the quasar locus width than previously possible with
synthetic template spectra. Colors are generated for the z>6 epoch taking
advantage of the new UKIDSS near-infrared filter set, and we examine the
redshift intervals of maximum productivity, discussing color selection and
survey depth issues. On the basis of the SDSS sample, we find that the surface
density of z>4.7 quasars increases by a factor of 3X by extending 0.7
i-magnitudes deeper than the SDSS spectroscopic survey limit of i=20.2 --
correspondingly we predict a total of ~400 faint quasars in the SDSS main area
that have redshift z>4.7 and magnitudes $<20.9.
