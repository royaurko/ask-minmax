A Toy model which introduces the different limiting velocities for each
particleis discussed: the differentiation of the universal limiting velocity is
implemented throgh the coupling with external tensor or vector field, something
like Higgs scalar field. GZK cut-off discussion could be altered due to the
violation of Lorentz symmetry.
