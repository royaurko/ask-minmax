We have used a large sample of low-inclination spiral galaxies with
radially-resolved optical and near-infrared photometry to investigate trends in
star formation history with radius as a function of galaxy structural
parameters. A maximum likelihood method was used to match all the available
photometry of our sample to the colours predicted by stellar population
synthesis models. The use of simplistic star formation histories, uncertainties
in the stellar population models and regarding the importance of dust all
compromise the absolute ages and metallicities derived in this work, however
our conclusions are robust in a relative sense. We find that most spiral
galaxies have stellar population gradients, in the sense that their inner
regions are older and more metal rich than their outer regions. Our main
conclusion is that the surface density of a galaxy drives its star formation
history, perhaps through a local density dependence in the star formation law.
The mass of a galaxy is a less important parameter; the age of a galaxy is
relatively unaffected by its mass, however the metallicity of galaxies depends
on both surface density and mass. This suggests that galaxy mass-dependent
feedback is an important process in the chemical evolution of galaxies. In
addition, there is significant cosmic scatter suggesting that mass and density
may not be the only parameters affecting the star formation history of a
galaxy.
