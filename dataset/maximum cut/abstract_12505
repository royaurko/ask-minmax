In this article we apply the technique proposed in Deng-Hou-Yu (Comm. PDE,
2005) to study the level set dynamics of the 2D quasi-geostrophic equation.
Under certain assumptions on the local geometric regularity of the level sets
of $\theta$, we obtain global regularity results with improved growth estimate
on $| \nabla^{\bot} \theta |$. We further perform numerical simulations to
study the local geometric properties of the level sets near the region of
maximum $| \nabla^{\bot} \theta |$. The numerical results indicate that the
assumptions on the local geometric regularity of the level sets of $\theta$ in
our theorems are satisfied. Therefore these theorems provide a good explanation
of the double exponential growth of $| \nabla^{\bot} \theta |$ observed in this
and past numerical simulations.
