{Abridged version for ArXiv}. We provide direct constraints on the origin of
the [Ne II] emission in 15 young stars using high-spatial and spectral
resolution observations with VISIR at the VLT that allow us to study the
kinematics of the emitting gas. In addition we compare the [Ne II] line with
optical forbidden lines observed for three stars with UVES. The [Ne II] line
was detected in 7 stars, among them the first confirmed detection of [Ne II] in
a Herbig Be star, V892 Tau. In four cases, the large blueshifted lines indicate
an origin in a jet. In two stars, the small shifts and asymmetric profiles
indicate an origin in a photo-evaporative wind. CoKu Tau 1, seen close to
edge-on, shows a spatially unresolved line centered at the stellar rest
velocity, although cross-dispersion centroids move within 10 AU from one side
of the star to the other as a function of wavelength. The line profile is
symmetric with wings extending up to about +-80 km/s. The origin of the [Ne II]
line could either be due to the bipolar jet or to the disk. For the stars with
VLT-UVES observations, in several cases, the optical forbidden line profiles
and shifts are very similar to the profile of the [Ne II] line, suggesting that
the lines are emitted in the same region. A general trend observed with VISIR
is a lower line flux when compared with the fluxes obtained with Spitzer. We
found no correlation between the line full-width at half maximum and the line
peak velocity. The [Ne II] line remains undetected in a large part of the
sample, an indication that the emission detected with Spitzer in those stars is
likely extended.
