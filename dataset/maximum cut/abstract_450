We apply recent results on regularity for general integro-differential
equations to derive a priori estimates in H\"older spaces for the space
homogeneous Boltzmann equation in the non cut-off case. We also show an a
priori estimate in $L^\infty$ which applies in the space inhomogeneous case as
well, provided that the macroscopic quantities remain bounded.
