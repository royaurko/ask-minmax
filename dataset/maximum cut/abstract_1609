We use a regular arrangement of kirigami elements to demonstrate an inverse
design paradigm for folding a flat surface into complex target configurations.
We first present a scheme using arrays of disclination defect pairs on the dual
to the honeycomb lattice; by arranging these defect pairs properly with respect
to each other and choosing an appropriate fold pattern a target stepped surface
can be designed. We then present a more general method that specifies a fixed
lattice of kirigami cuts to be performed on a flat sheet. This single
"pluripotent" lattice of cuts permits a wide variety of target surfaces to be
programmed into the sheet by changing the folding directions.
