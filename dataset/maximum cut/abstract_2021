Normal forms allow the use of a restricted class of coordinate
transformations (typically homogeneous polynomials) to put the bifurcations
found in nonlinear dynamical systems into a few standard forms. We investigate
here the consequences of relaxing the restrictions of the form of the
coordinate transformations. In the Duffing equation, a logarithmic
transformation can remove the nonlinearity: in one interpretation, the
nonlinearity is replaced by a branch cut leading to a Poincare section. When
the linearized problem is autonomous with diagonal Jordan form, we can remove
all nonlinearities order by order using these singular coordinate
transformations.
