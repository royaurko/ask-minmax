We present here the computer model of the distribution of the luminosity,
produced by old isolated neutron stars and black holes accreting from the
interstellar medium in the Galaxy in R-Z plane. We show, that the luminosity
distributions have a torus-like structure, with the maximum at $\approx 5-6
kpc$.
