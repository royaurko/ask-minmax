We use first-principles calculations to extract two essential microscopic
parameters, the charge-transfer energy and the inter-cell oxygen-oxygen
hopping, which correlate with the maximum superconducting transition
temperature $\Tcmax$ across the cuprates. We explore the superconducting state
in the three-band model of the copper-oxygen planes using cluster Dynamical
Mean-Field Theory. We find that the variation in the charge-transfer energy
largely accounts for the empirical trend in $\Tcmax$, resolving a long-standing
contradiction with theoretical calculations.
