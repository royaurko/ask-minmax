We study the non-equilibrium behavior of three-dimensional spin glasses in
the Migdal-Kadanoff approximation, that is on a hierarchical lattice. In this
approximation the model has an unique ground state and equilibrium properties
correctly described by the droplet model. Extensive numerical simulations show
that this model lacks aging in the remanent magnetization as well as a maximum
in the magnetic viscosity in disagreement with experiments as well as with
numerical studies of the Edwards-Anderson model. This result strongly limits
the validity of the droplet model (at least in its simplest form) as a good
model for real spin glasses.
