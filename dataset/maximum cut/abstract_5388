The classical Hurwitz numbers of degree n together with the Hurwitz numbers
of the seamed surfaces of degree n give rise to the Klein topological field
theory. We extend this construction to the Hurwitz numbers of all degrees at
once. The corresponding Cardy-Frobenius algebra is induced by arbitrary Young
diagrams and arbitrary bipartite graphs. It turns out to be isomorphic to the
algebra of differential operators from arXiv:1210.6955 which serves a model for
open-closed string theory. The operator associated with the Young diagram of
the transposition of two elements coincides with the cut-and-join operator
which gives rise to relations for the classical Hurwitz numbers. We prove that
the operators corresponding to arbitrary Young diagrams and bipartite graphs
also give rise to relations for the Hurwitz numbers.
