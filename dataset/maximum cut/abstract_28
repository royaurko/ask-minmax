Fracture in a disordered lattice system is studied. In our system, particles
are initially arranged on the triangular lattice and each nearest-neighbor pair
is connected with a randomly chosen soft or hard Hookean spring. Every spring
has the common threshold of stress at which it is cut. We make an initial crack
and expand the system perpendicularly to the crack. We find that the maximum
stress in the stress-strain curve is larger than those in the systems with soft
or hard springs only (uniform systems). Energy required to advance fracture is
also larger in some disordered systems, which indicates that the fracture
toughness improves. The increase of the energy is caused by the following two
factors. One is that the soft spring is able to hold larger energy than the
hard one. The other is that the number of cut springs increases as the fracture
surface becomes tortuous in disordered systems.
