We give an overview of results on shape optimization for low eigenvalues of
the Laplacian on bounded planar domains with Neumann and Steklov boundary
conditions. These results share a common feature: they are proved using methods
of complex analysis. In particular, we present modernized proofs of the
classical inequalities due to Szego and Weinstock for the first nonzero Neumann
and Steklov eigenvalues. We also extend the inequality for the second nonzero
Neumann eigenvalue, obtained recently by Nadirashvili and the contributors, to
non-homogeneous membranes with log-subharmonic densities. In the homogeneous
case, we show that this inequality is strict, which implies that the maximum of
the second nonzero Neumann eigenvalue is not attained in the class of
simply-connected membranes of a given mass. The same is true for the second
nonzero Steklov eigenvalue, as follows from our results on the
Hersch-Payne-Schiffer inequalities.
