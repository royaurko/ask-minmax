This second paper of two companion papers on the estimation of power spectra
specializes to the topic of estimating galaxy power spectra at large, linear
scales using maximum likelihood methods. As in the first paper, the aims are
pedagogical, and the emphasis is on concepts rather than technical detail. The
paper covers most of the salient issues, including selection functions,
likelihood functions, Karhunen-Loeve compression, pair-integral bias, Local
Group flow, angular or radial systematics (arising for example from
extinction), redshift distortions, quadratic compression, decorrelation, and
disentanglement. The procedures are illustrated with results from the IRAS PSCz
survey. Most of the PSCz graphics included in this paper have not been
published elsewhere.
