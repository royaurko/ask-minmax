In this paper we prove that C(4)-T(4)-P, C(3)-T(6)-P and C(6)-P small
cancellation groups are translation dis crete in the strongest possible sense
and that in these groups for any $g$ and any $n$ there is an algorithm deciding
whether or not the equation $ x^n=g$ has a solution. There is also an algorithm
for calculating for each $g$ the maximum $n$ such that $g$ is an $n$-th power
of some element. We also note that these groups cannot contain isomorphic
copies of the gr oup of $p$-adic fractions and so in particular of the group of
rational numbers. Besides we show that for C''(4)-T(4) and C''(3)-T(6) groups
all translation numbers are rational and have bounded denominators.
