We explore the role of a holographic Wilsonian cut-off in simple probe brane
models with chiral symmetry breaking/restoration phase transitions. The
Wilsonian cut-off allows us to define supergravity solutions for off-shell
configurations and hence to define a potential for the chiral condensate. We
pay particular attention to the need for configurations whose action we are
comparing to have the same IR and UV boundary conditions. We exhibit new first
and second order phase transitions with changing cut-off. We derive the
effective potential for the condensate including mean field and BKT type
continuous transitions.
