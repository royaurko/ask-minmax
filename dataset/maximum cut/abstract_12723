We provide some new properties of entanglement of formation. In particular,
we obtain an additive lower bound for entanglement of formation. Subsequently
we develop the concept of local orthogonality of ensembles which leads to the
mixed states with distillable entanglement equal to entanglement of formation.
Then we consider thermodynamical analogies within the entanglement processing
domain. Especially, we exploit analogy entanglement -- energy. In this scheme
the total entanglement i.e. the amount of singlet pairs needed for local
preparation of a state corresponds to internal energy while the free
entanglement defined as the number of pairs which can be recovered from the
state (distillable entanglement) is the counterpart of free energy. In
particular, it leads us to the question about ``temperature'' of entanglement.
We also propose a scheme of the search of representative state for given
entanglement which can be viewed as an analogue of the Jaynes maximum entropy
principle.
