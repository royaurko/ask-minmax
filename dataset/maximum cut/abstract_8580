We suggest that 'axial lines' defined by (Hillier and Hanson, 1984) as lines
of uninterrupted movement within urban streetscapes or buildings, appear as
ridges in isovist fields (Benedikt, 1979). These are formed from the maximum
diametric lengths of the individual isovists, sometimes called viewsheds, that
make up these fields (Batty and Rana, 2004). We present an image processing
technique for the identification of lines from ridges, discuss current
strengths and weaknesses of the method, and show how it can be implemented
easily and effectively.
