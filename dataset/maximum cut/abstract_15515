This paper aims to study different estimation procedures based on
$\varphi-$divergences. The dual representation of $\varphi-$divergences based
on the Fenchel-Legendre duality provides a way to estimate
$\varphi-$divergences by a simple plug-in of the empirical distribution without
any smoothing technique. Resulting estimators are thoroughly studied
theoretically and with simulations showing that the so called minimum
$\varphi-$divergence estimator (MD$\varphi$DE) is generally non robust and
behaves similarly to the maximum likelihood estimator. We give some arguments
supporting the non robustness property, and give insights on how to modify the
classical approach. A new class of $\varphi-$divergences estimators is
presented. We study consistency and robustness properties from an influence
function point of view of the new estimators. We also invoke the Basu-Lindsay
approach for approximating $\varphi-$divergences and provide a comparison
between these approaches. The so called dual $\varphi-$divergence is also
discussed and compared to our new estimator. A full simulation study of all
these approaches is given in order to compare efficiency and robustness of all
mentioned estimators showing encouraging results in favor of our new class of
minimum dual $\varphi-$divergences.
