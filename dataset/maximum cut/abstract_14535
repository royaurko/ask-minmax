In this paper we discuss the field enhancement due to surface plasmons
resonances of metallic nanostructures, in particular nano spheres on top of a
metal, and find maximum field enhancement of the order of 10^2, intensities
enhancement of the order of 10^4. Naturally these fields can produce temporal
fields of the order of 0.5V/{\AA} that yield field emission of electrons.
Although the fields enhancements we calculated are factor of 10 smaller than
those reported in recent experiments, our results explain very well the
experimental data. Very large atomic fields destabilize the system completely
emitting ions, at least for static field, and produce electric breakdown. In
any case, we prove that the data are striking and can solve problems in
providing stabilized current of static fields for which future experiments
should be done for obtaining pulsed beams of electrons.
