Some of the rapidly oscillating (roAp) stars, have frequencies which are
larger than the theoretical acoustic cut-off frequency. We have computed models
and adiabatic frequencies for pulsating Ap stars with T(tau) laws based on
Kurucz model atmospheres and on the Hopf's purely radiative relation. We
compare the values of the cut-off frequency derived from expressions for the
potential from Vorontsov & Zarkhov (1989), from Gough (1986), and from the
approximation of an isothermal atmosphere. Kurucz model atmospheres increase
the theoretical acoustic cut-off frequency for roAp stars by about 200 mu$Hz,
which is closer to the observations. We compare our computations with
observations of the 3 roAp stars HD 24712, alphaCir, and HD 134214. For alpha
Cir we find models with Kurucz atmospheres which have indeed a cut-off
frequency beyond the largest observed frequency. For HD 24712 only models which
are hotter by about 100 K and less luminous by nearly 10% than what is actually
the most probable value would have an acoustic cut-off frequency large enough.
One may thus speculate that the old controversy about a mismatch between
observed largest frequencies and theoretical cut-off frequencies of roAp star
models is resolved. However, the model atmospheres have to be refined by
investigating NLTE effects, among others, before a definite conclusion can be
drawn.
