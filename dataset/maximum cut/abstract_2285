We have done a fast simulation analysis of the charged Higgs signal at LHC in
the 1 and 3 prong hadronic $\tau$-jet channels along with the $t \bar t$
background. The $\tau$ polarization was effectively used to suppress the
background in both the channels. Combining this with appropriate cuts on the
$p_T$ of the $\tau$-jet, the missing $E_T$ and the azimuthal angle between them
reduces the background below the signal level. Consequently one gets a viable
charged higgs signal up to a mass range of 600-700 GeV at moderate to large
$\tan\beta$.
