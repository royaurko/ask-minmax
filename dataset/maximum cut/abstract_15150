Fish schools are able to display a rich variety of collective states and
behavioural responses when they are confronted to threats. However a school's
response to perturbations may be different depending on its collective state.
Here we use a previously developed data-driven fish school model to investigate
how a single or a small number of perturbing individuals affect the long-term
behaviour of a school depending on its collective state. These perturbing fish
are characterised by a set of attraction and alignment parameters different
from those of the main population. We find that the responsiveness of the
school to the perturbation is maximum near the transition region between
milling and schooling states where the school exhibits multistability and
regularly shifts between these two states. We also find that a significant
school's response to a perturbation only happens below a certain threshold of
the noise to social interactions ratio.
