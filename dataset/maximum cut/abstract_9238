In this paper we study a skew product map $F$ with a measure $\mu$ of
positive entropy. We show that if on the fibers the map are $C^{1+\alpha}$
diffeomorphisms with nonzero Lyapunov exponents, then $F$ has ergodic measures
of intermediate entropies. To construct these measures we find a set on which
the return map is a skew product with horseshoes along fibers. We can control
the average return time and show the maximum entropy of these measures can be
arbitrarily close to $h_\mu(F)$.
