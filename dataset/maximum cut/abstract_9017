In this work, we consider a recently proposed entropy S (called varentropy)
defined by a variational relationship dI=beta*(d<x>-<dx>) as a measure of
uncertainty of random variable x. By definition, varentropy underlies a
generalized virtual work principle <dx>=0 leading to maximum entropy
d(I-beta*<x>)=0. This paper presents an analytical investigation of this
maximizable entropy for several distributions such as stretched exponential
distribution, kappa-exponential distribution and Cauchy distribution.
