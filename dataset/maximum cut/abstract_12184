We study theoretically two spatially separate quasi-one-dimensional atomic
Fermi gases in a double-well trap. By tuning independently their spin
polarizations, a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid or a
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid may be formed in each well. We seek
the possibility of creating a spatially tunable atomic Josephson junction
between two superfluids, which is supposed to be realizable via building a weak
link at given positions of the double-well barrier. We show that within
mean-field theory the maximum Josephson current is proportional to the order
parameter in two wells. Thus, the spatial inhomogeneity of the FFLO order
parameter in one well may be directly revealed through the current measurement
with the position-tunable link. We anticipate that this type of Josephson
measurements can provide a useful evidence for the existence of exotic FFLO
superfluids. Possible experimental realizations of the Josephson measurements
in atomic Fermi gases are discussed.
