We show that the corays to a ray in a complete non-compact Finsler manifold
contain geodesic segments to level sets of Busemann functions. Moreover, we
characterize the set of co-points to a ray as the cut locus of such set levels.
The structure theorem of the co-points set on a surface, namely that is a local
tree, and other properties follows immediately from the known results about cut
locus. We point out that our Main Theorems are new even for Riemannian
manifolds.
