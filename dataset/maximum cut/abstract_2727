In this paper, we proposed another new form of type-2 fuzzy data
points(T2FDPs) that is perfectly normal type-2 data points(PNT2FDPs). These
kinds of brand-new data were defined by using the existing type-2 fuzzy set
theory(T2FST) and type-2 fuzzy number(T2FN) concept since we dealt with the
problem of defining complex uncertainty data. Along with this restructuring, we
included the fuzzification(alpha-cut operation), type-reduction and
defuzzification processes against PNT2FDPs. In addition, we used interpolation
B-soline curve function to demonstrate the PNT2FDPs.
