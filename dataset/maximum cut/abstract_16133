We present extinction curves that include data down to far ultraviolet
wavelengths (FUV; 1050 - 1200 A) for nine Galactic sight lines. The FUV
extinction was measured using data from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic
Explorer. The sight lines were chosen for their unusual extinction properties
in the infrared through the ultraviolet; that they probe a wide range of dust
environments is evidenced by the large spread in their measured ratios of
total-to-selective extinction, R_V = 2.43 - 3.81. We find that extrapolation of
the Fitzpatrick & Massa relationship from the ultraviolet appears to be a good
predictor of the FUV extinction behavior. We find that predictions of the FUV
extinction based upon the Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis (CCM) dependence on R_V
give mixed results. For the seven extinction curves well represented by CCM in
the infrared through ultraviolet, the FUV extinction is well predicted in three
sight lines, over-predicted in two sight lines, and under-predicted in 2 sight
lines. A Maximum Entropy Method analysis using a simple three component grain
model shows that seven of the nine sight lines in the study require a larger
fraction of grain materials to be in dust when FUV extinction is included in
the models. Most of the added grain material is in the form of small (radii <
200 A) grains.
