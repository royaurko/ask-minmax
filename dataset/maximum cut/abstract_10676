We report the detection of gamma-ray pulsations from the high-magnetic-field
rotation-powered pulsar PSR J1119-6127 using data from the Fermi Large Area
Telescope. The gamma-ray light curve of PSR J1119-6127 shows a single, wide
peak offset from the radio peak by 0.43 pm 0.02 in phase. Spectral analysis
suggests a power law of index 1.0 pm 0.3 with an energy cut-off at 0.8 pm 0.2
GeV. The first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. We
discuss the emission models of PSR J1119-6127 and demonstrate that despite the
object's high surface magnetic field---near that of magnetars---the field
strength and structure in the gamma-ray emitting zone are apparently similar to
those of typical young pulsars. Additionally, we present upper limits on the
\gam-ray pulsed emission for the magnetically active PSR J1846-0258 in the
supernova remnant Kesteven 75 and two other energetic high-B pulsars, PSRs
J1718-3718 and J1734-3333. We explore possible explanations for the
non-detection of these three objects, including peculiarities in their emission
geometry.
