Processes of one- and two-pion production in NN collisions in connection with
excitation of intermediate dibaryon resonances are considered. In particular,
relative contributions of the conventional meson-exchange and dibaryon
excitation mechanisms in the reaction pp --> d{\pi}$^+$ are investigated in
detail. It is shown that inclusion of the intermediate isovector dibaryon
resonances allows to essentially improve the description of experimental data
for this reaction, provided the soft short-range cut-off parameters in the
{\pi}NN and {\pi}N{\Delta} vertices are used. Manifestation and importance of
intermediate isoscalar and isovector dibaryons in the two-pion production
processes are also demonstrated. The possibility of investigating the isovector
dibaryon resonances in reactions pp --> d{\pi}{\pi} and pp --> pp{\pi}{\pi} is
discussed. An explanation of the observed strong differences between two-pion
production cross sections in pn and pp collisions based in part on the analysis
of dibaryon structure is suggested.
