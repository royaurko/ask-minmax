We examine the detection of the intermediate-mass Higgs boson (IMH) at LHC
through the associate production channel pp-->t+(anti-t)+H+X-->l+photon+
photon+X'. It is shown that by applying kinematic cuts or b-tagging on the
final state jets, the main backgrounds of W(-->l+nu)+photon+photon+(n-jet) can
be reduced substantially without significant loss of signals. It is possible to
detect the Higgs boson at LHC through the pp-->t+(anti-t)+H+X channel using a
modest photon detector with mass resolution of about 3% of the photon pair
invariant mass.
