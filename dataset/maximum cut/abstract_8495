We discuss microscopic aspects of odd-parity triplet pair in orbital
degenerate systems. From the concept of off-diagonal long-range order, a pair
state is unambiguously defined as the eigenstate with the maximum eigenvalue of
pair correlation function. Performing this scheme by a numerical technique, we
clarify that the odd-parity triplet pair occurs as an out-of-phase combination
of local triplets induced by Hund's rule coupling for the lattice including two
sites in the unit cell.
