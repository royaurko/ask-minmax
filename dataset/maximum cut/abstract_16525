We have developed a completely new type of general-purpose CCD data
acquisition system which enables one to drive any type of CCD using any type of
clocking mode. A CCD driver system widely used before consisted of an analog
multiplexer (MPX), a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and an operational
amplifier. A DAC is used to determine high and low voltage levels and the MPX
selects each voltage level using a TTL clock. In this kind of driver board, it
is difficult to reduce the noise caused by a short of high and low level in MPX
and also to select many kinds of different voltage levels. Recent developments
in semiconductor IC enable us to use a very fast sampling ($\sim$ 10MHz) DAC
with low cost. We thus develop the new driver system using a fast DAC in order
to determine both the voltage level of the clock and the clocking timing. We
use FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) to control the DAC. We have
constructed the data acquisition system and found that the CCD functions well
with our new system. The energy resolution of Mn K$\alpha$ has a full-width at
half-maximum of $\simeq$ 150 eV and the readout noise of our system is $\simeq$
8 e$^-$.
