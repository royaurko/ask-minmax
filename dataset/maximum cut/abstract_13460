We develop an analytical device model for graphene bilayer field-effect
transistors (GBL-FETs) with the back and top gates. The model is based on the
Boltzmann equation for the electron transport and the Poisson equation in the
weak nonlocality approximation for the potential in the GBL-FET channel. The
potential distributions in the GBL-FET channel are found analytically. The
source-drain current in GBL-FETs and their transconductance are expressed in
terms of the geometrical parameters and applied voltages by analytical formulas
in the most important limiting cases. These formulas explicitly account for the
short-gate effect and the effect of drain-induced barrier lowering. The
parameters characterizing the strength of these effects are derived. It is
shown that the GBL-FET transconductance exhibits a pronounced maximum as a
function of the top-gate voltage swing. The interplay of the short-gate effect
and the electron collisions results in a nonmonotonic dependence of the
transconductance on the top-gate length.
