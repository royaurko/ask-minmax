We generalize the hydrodynamic lattice gas model to include arbitrary numbers
of particles moving in each lattice direction. For this generalization we
derive the equilibrium distribution function and the hydrodynamic equations,
including the equation of state and the prefactor of the inertial term that
arises from the breaking of galilean invariance in these models. We show that
this prefactor can be set to unity in the generalized model, therby effectively
restoring galilean invariance. Moreover, we derive an expression for the
kinematic viscosity, and show that it tends to decrease with the maximum number
of particles allowed in each direction, so that higher Reynolds numbers may be
achieved. Finally, we derive expressions for the statistical noise and the
Boltzmann entropy of these models.
