We consider quasi maximum likelihood (QML) estimation for general
non-Gaussian discrete-ime linear state space models and equidistantly observed
multivariate L\'evy-driven continuoustime autoregressive moving average
(MCARMA) processes. In the discrete-time setting, we prove strong consistency
and asymptotic normality of the QML estimator under standard moment assumptions
and a strong-mixing condition on the output process of the state space model.
In the second part of the paper, we investigate probabilistic and analytical
properties of equidistantly sampled continuous-time state space models and
apply our results from the discrete-time setting to derive the asymptotic
properties of the QML estimator of discretely recorded MCARMA processes. Under
natural identifiability conditions, the estimators are again consistent and
asymptotically normally distributed for any sampling frequency. We also
demonstrate the practical applicability of our method through a simulation
study and a data example from econometrics.
