In the QCD factorization (QCDF) approach we study the direct $CP$ violation
in
$\bar{B}^{0}\rightarrow\rho^0(\omega)\rho^0(\omega)\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$
via the $\rho-\omega$ mixing mechanism. We find that the $CP$ violation can be
enhanced by double $\rho-\omega$ mixing when the masses of the $\pi^+\pi^-$
pairs are in the vicinity of the $\omega$ resonance, and the maximum $CP$
violation can reach 28{\%}. We also compare the results from the naive
factorization and the QCD factorization.
