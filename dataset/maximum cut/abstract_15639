In this paper, we study a random field constructed from the two-dimensional
Gaussian free field by modifying the variance along the scales in the
neighborhood of each point. The construction can be seen as a local martingale
transform and is akin to the time-inhomogeneous branching random walk. In the
case where the variance takes finitely many values, we compute the first order
of the maximum and the log-number of high points. These quantities were
obtained by Bolthausen, Deuschel & Giacomin and Daviaud in the case where the
variance is constant on all scales. The proof relies on a truncated second
moment method proposed by Kistler, which streamlines the proof of the previous
results. We also discuss possible extensions of the construction to the
continuous Gaussian free field.
