It is known that every loopless cubic graph is 4-edge choosable. We prove the
following strengthened result.
  Let G be a planar cubic graph having b cut-edges. There exists a set F of at
most 5b/2 edges of G with the following property. For any function L which
assigns to each edge of F a set of 4 colours and which assigns to each edge in
E(G)-F a set of 3 colours, the graph G has a proper edge colouring where the
colour of each edge e belongs to L(e).
