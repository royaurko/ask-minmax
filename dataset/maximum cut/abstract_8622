The Xi_c+ lifetime is measured using 9.0 fb^{-1} of e+ e- annihilation data
collected on and just below the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the CLEO II.V
detector at CESR. The Xi_c+ lifetime is measured using an unbinned maximum
likelihood fit. The preliminary result for the Xi_c+ lifetime is (503 +- 47
(stat.) +- 18 (syst.)) fs.
