We study high-energy proton-nucleus collisions within the Colour Glass
Condensate framework, and compute the probabilities of having a definite number
of scatterings in the nucleus with a momentum transfer larger than a given cut.
Various properties of the distribution in the number of multiple scatterings
are investigated, and we conclude that events with monojets are very unlikely,
except for extreme values of the saturation scale Qs.
