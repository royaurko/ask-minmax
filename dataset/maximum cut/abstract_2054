We use the two cut-off renormalization group (RG) method to study the
spin-Peierls model in one-dimension for the entire phonon frequency range. We
integrate out the phonon and solve the effective Fermion system via mean field
and RG methods. We make use of the symmetry that the Neel, dimerization, and
spin current order parameters form an SU(2) triplet based on resolving the
Fermion into left and right movers. We present the phase diagram and discuss
its implications for the organic charge-transfer salt (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$.
