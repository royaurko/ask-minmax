\noindent The b-chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\phi(G)$, is the
largest integer $k$ that $G$ admits a proper coloring by $k$ colors, such that
each color class has a vertex that is adjacent to at least one vertex in each
of the other color classes. El Sahili and Kouider [About b-colorings of regular
graphs, Res. Rep. 1432, LRI, Univ. Orsay, France, 2006] asked whether it is
true that every $d$-regular graph $G$ of girth at least 5 satisfies
$\phi(G)=d+1$. Blidia, Maffray, and Zemir [On b-colorings in regular graphs,
Discrete Appl. Math. 157 (2009), 1787-1793] showed that the Petersen graph
provides a negative answer to this question, and then conjectured that the
Petersen graph is the only exception. In this paper, we investigate a
strengthened form of the question.
  The edge connectivity of a graph $G$, denoted by $\lambda(G)$, is the minimum
cardinality of a subset $U$ of $E(G)$ such that $G\setminus U$ is either
disconnected or a graph with only one vertex. A $d$-regular graph $G$ is called
super-edge-connected if every minimum edge-cut is the set of all edges incident
with a vertex in $G$, i.e., $\lambda(G)=d$ and every minimum edge-cut of $G$
isolates a vertex. We show that if $G$ is a $d$-regular graph that contains no
4-cycle, then $\phi(G)=d+1$ whenever $G$ is not super-edge-connected.
