We consider the problem of online audio source separation. Existing
algorithms adopt either a sliding block approach or a stochastic gradient
approach, which is faster but less accurate. Also, they rely either on spatial
cues or on spectral cues and cannot separate certain mixtures. In this paper,
we design a general online audio source separation framework that combines both
approaches and both types of cues. The model parameters are estimated in the
Maximum Likelihood (ML) sense using a Generalised Expectation Maximisation
(GEM) algorithm with multiplicative updates. The separation performance is
evaluated as a function of the block size and the step size and compared to
that of an offline algorithm.
