VLTI/AMBER and VLTI/PIONIER observations of the LBV HR Car show an
interferometric signature that could not possibly be explained by an extended
wind, more or less symmetrically distributed around a single object. Instead,
observations both in the Br$\gamma$ line and the H-band continuum are best
explained by two point sources (or alternatively one point source and one
slightly extended source) at about 2 mas separation and a contrast ratio of
about 1:5. These observations establish that HR Car is a binary, but further
interpretation will only be possible with future observations to constrain the
orbit. Under the assumption that the current separation is close to the maximum
one, the orbital period can be estimated to be of the order of 5 years, similar
as in the $\eta$ Car system. This would make HR Car the second such LBV binary.
