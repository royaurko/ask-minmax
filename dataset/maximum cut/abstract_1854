We calculate the maximum mass of the class of compact stars described by
Vaidya-Tikekar \cite{VT01} model. The model permits a simple method of
systematically fixing bounds on the maximum possible mass of cold compact stars
with a given value of radius or central density or surface density. The
relevant equations of state are also determined. Although simple, the model is
capable of describing the general features of the recently observed very
compact stars. For the calculation, no prior knowledge of the equation of state
(EOS) is required. This is in contrast to the earlier calculations for maximum
mass which were done by choosing first the relevant EOSs and using those to
solve the TOV equation with appropriate boundary conditions. The bounds
obtained by us are comparable and, in some cases, more restrictive than the
earlier results.
