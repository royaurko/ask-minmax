We estimate the experimental accuracies to which the Ke4 parameters will be
measured at DAPHNE. We consider the accuracies obtainable using asymmetries,
and the maximum likelihood method. We find the current determinations of the
relevant parameters will be improved by a factor of five to ten after a year of
running at the anticipated luminosity of DAPHNE.
