Recent discoveries show steady improvements in life expectancy during modern
decades. Does this support that humans continue to live longer in future? We
recently put forward the maximum survival tendency, as found in survival curves
of industrialized countries, which is described by extended Weibull model with
age-dependent stretched exponent. The maximum survival tendency suggests that
human survival dynamics may possess its intrinsic limit, beyond which survival
is inevitably forbidden. Based on such tendency, we develop the model and
explore the patterns in the maximum lifespan limits from industrialized
countries during recent three decades. This analysis strategy is simple and
useful to interpret the complicated human survival dynamics.
