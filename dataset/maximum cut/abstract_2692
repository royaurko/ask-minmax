Recent CDF and D0 measurements of the top quark forward-backward asymmetry at
the Tevatron present deviations between 1-sigma and 2-sigma from QCD
predictions and a cut M_inv > 450 GeV on the events increases this deviation to
3.4 sigma in the CDF measurement. The inclusion of electroweak contributions of
order alpha^2 and order alpha alphas^2 enlarges the theoretical prediction from
QCD by a factor ~ 1.2 and diminishes the observed deviations. The calculation
method is shortly discussed and numerical results are compared to the
experimental data.
