Analyses of observable supernova neutrino oscillation effects require the
calculation of the electron (anti)neutrino survival probability P_ee along a
given supernova matter density profile. We propose a simple analytical
prescription for P_ee, based on a double-exponential form for the crossing
probability and on the concept of maximum violation of adiabaticity. In the
case of two-flavor transitions, the prescription is shown to reproduce
accurately, in the whole neutrino oscillation parameter space, the results of
exact numerical calculations for generic (realistic or power-law) profiles. The
analytical approach is then generalized to cover three-flavor transitions with
(direct or inverse) mass spectrum hierarchy, and to incorporate Earth matter
effects. Compact analytical expressions, explicitly showing the symmetry
properties of P_ee, are provided for practical calculations.
