We investigate the formation of the H I Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta lines in
an equatorial coronal streamer. Particular attention is paid to frequency
redistribution for the scattering of the incident radiation. The properties of
the spectral lines are studied. The coronal model is given by a global 2.5-D
three fluid solar wind model with alpha particles. The emergent intensities and
line profiles are calculated from the solution of the statistical equilibrium
and radiative transfer equations for an hydrogen atom with 11 energy levels
under non local thermodynamic equilibrium. The formation of the lines results
from radiative excitation, collisional excitation, and takes into account the
coupling with all other transitions between the hydrogen energy levels. We
present new estimates of the radiative and collisional contributions of the
Lyman line intensities within the streamer. It is also shown that within the
streamer, the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Lyman-beta line is a
better indicator of the plasma temperature than that of Lyman-alpha. These
results show that care should be taken when inferring the proton temperature
from the Lyman-alpha line profile as observed in coronal streamers, e.g. by the
Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer or the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of
Emitted Radiation experiments on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory.
