We report on our findings based on the analysis of observations of the Type
II-L supernova LSQ13cuw within the framework of currently accepted physical
predictions of core-collapse supernova explosions. LSQ13cuw was discovered
within a day of explosion, hitherto unprecedented for Type II-L supernovae.
This motivated a comparative study of Type II-P and II-L supernovae with
relatively well-constrained explosion epochs and rise times to maximum
(optical) light. From our sample of twenty such events, we find evidence of a
positive correlation between the duration of the rise and the peak brightness.
On average, SNe II-L tend to have brighter peak magnitudes and longer rise
times than SNe II-P. However, this difference is clearest only at the extreme
ends of the rise time versus peak brightness relation. Using two different
analytical models, we performed a parameter study to investigate the physical
parameters that control the rise time behaviour. In general, the models
qualitatively reproduce aspects of the observed trends. We find that the
brightness of the optical peak increases for larger progenitor radii and
explosion energies, and decreases for larger masses. The dependence of the rise
time on mass and explosion energy is smaller than the dependence on the
progenitor radius. We find no evidence that the progenitors of SNe II-L have
significantly smaller radii than those of SNe II-P.
