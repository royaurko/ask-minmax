The spectroscopic properties of an open large Bunimovich cavity are studied
numerically in the framework of the effective Hamiltonian formalism. The cavity
is opened by attaching leads to it in four different ways. In some cases,
short-lived and long-lived resonance states coexist. The short-lived states
cause traveling waves in the transmission while the long-lived ones generate
superposed fluctuations. The traveling waves oscillate as a function of energy.
They are not localized in the interior of the large chaotic cavity. In other
cases, the transmission takes place via standing waves with an intensity that
closely follows the profile of the resonances. In all considered cases, the
phase rigidity fluctuates with energy. It is mostly near to its maximum value
and agrees well with the theoretical value for the two-channel case. As shown
in the foregoing paper \cite{1}, all cases are described well by the Poisson
kernel when the calculation is restricted to an energy region in which the
average $S$ matrix is (nearly) constant.
