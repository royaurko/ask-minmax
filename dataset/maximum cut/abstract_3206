Let P_{n,d,D} denote the graph taken uniformly at random from the set of all
labelled planar graphs on {1,2,...,n} with minimum degree at least d(n) and
maximum degree at most D(n). We use counting arguments to investigate the
probability that P_{n,d,D} wll contain given components and subgraphs, showing
exactly when this is bounded away from 0 and 1 as n tends to infinity.
