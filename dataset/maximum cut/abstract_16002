This paper is the fourth in a series presenting spectrophotometry of 51
globular cluster candidates, that were detected by Mochejska et al. in the
nearby galaxy M33 using the data collected by the DIRECT project. The frames of
M33 in this study were taken as part of the BATC Multicolor Sky Survey. We
obtained the spectral energy distributions of these candidates in 13
intermediate-band filters. By comparing the integrated photometric measurements
with theoretical stellar population synthesis models of Bruzual & Charlot, we
estimated their ages. The BC96 models provide the evolution in time of the
spectrophotometric properties of simple stellar populations for a wide range of
stellar metallicity. Our results show that half of the candidates are younger
than 10^8 years, whose age degeneracy is not pronounced. We also find that
globular clusters formed continuously in M33 from ~4*10^6 -- 10^{10} years. Our
results are in agreement with Chandar et al., who estimated ages for 35
globular clusters candidates in common by comparing the photometric
measurements to integrated colors from theoretical models by Bertelli et al.
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test shows that the maximum value of the absolute
difference of estimated ages between Chandar et al. and us is 0.48, and the
significance level probability is 100.00 per cent.
