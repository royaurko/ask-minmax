Excitation of surface-waves at terahertz frequencies, on a suspended graphene
sheet, is studied by a full-wave electromagnetic solver, in order to evaluate
the effects of spatial dispersion when the infinite sheet is cut into various
sizes and shapes at the microscopic scale. General considerations about the
spatially dispersive anisotropic conductivity of graphene are used to select
the conductivity response to be provided as input in a simulation of surface
plasmons launched by the near field of a wire antenna, which is placed at
sub-micrometric distances from a graphene micro-disk. The spatial dispersion of
the graphene patch is shown to play a significant role not only in plasmon
propagation free of external sources, but also in typical scanning probe
microscopy configurations. In particular, it is analyzed how this spatial
dispersion affects the excitation strength, or coupling, between the field
sources and the surface plasmons.
