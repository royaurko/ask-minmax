The dielectric constant of a conductor-insulator mixture shows a pronounced
maximum above the critical volume concentration. Further experimental evidence
is presented as well as a theoretical consideration based on a phenomenological
equation. Explicit expressions are given for the position of the maximum in
terms of scaling parameters and the (complex) conductances of the conductor and
insulator. In order to fit some of the data, a volume fraction dependent
expression for the conductivity of the more highly conductive component is
introduced.
