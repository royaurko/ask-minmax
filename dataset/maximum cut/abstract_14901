A system for live high quality surface reconstruction using a single moving
depth camera on a commodity hardware is presented. High accuracy and real-time
frame rate is achieved by utilizing graphics hardware computing capabilities
via OpenCL and by using sparse data structure for volumetric surface
representation. Depth sensor pose is estimated by combining serial texture
registration algorithm with iterative closest points algorithm (ICP) aligning
obtained depth map to the estimated scene model. Aligned surface is then fused
into the scene. Kalman filter is used to improve fusion quality. Truncated
signed distance function (TSDF) stored as block-based sparse buffer is used to
represent surface. Use of sparse data structure greatly increases accuracy of
scanned surfaces and maximum scanning area. Traditional GPU implementation of
volumetric rendering and fusion algorithms were modified to exploit sparsity to
achieve desired performance. Incorporation of texture registration for sensor
pose estimation and Kalman filter for measurement integration improved accuracy
and robustness of scanning process.
