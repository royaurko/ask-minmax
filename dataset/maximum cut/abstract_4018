We develop a new approach to characterizing the morphology of rough surfaces
based on the analysis of the scaling properties of contour loops, i.e. loops of
constant height. Given a height profile of the surface we perform independent
measurements of the fractal dimension of contour loops, and the exponent that
characterizes their size distribution. Scaling formulas are derived and used to
relate these two geometrical exponents to the roughness exponent of a
self-affine surface, thus providing independent measurements of this important
quantity. Furthermore, we define the scale dependent curvature and demonstrate
that by measuring its third moment departures of the height fluctuations from
Gaussian behavior can be ascertained. These nonlinear measures are used to
characterize the morphology of computer generated Gaussian rough surfaces,
surfaces obtained in numerical simulations of a simple growth model, and
surfaces observed by scanning-tunneling-microscopes. For experimentally
realized surfaces the self-affine scaling is cut off by a correlation length,
and we generalize our theory of contour loops to take this into account.
