We present a planar design of a metamaterial exhibiting electromagnetically
induced transparency that is amenable to experimental verification in the
microwave frequency band. The design is based on the coupling of a split-ring
resonator with a cut-wire in the same plane. We investigate the sensitivity of
the parameters of the transmission window on the coupling strength and on the
circuit elements of the individual resonators, and we interpret the results in
terms of two linearly coupled Lorentzian resonators. Our metamaterial designs
combine low losses with the extremely small group velocity associated with the
resonant response in the transmission window, rendering them suitable for slow
light applications at room temperature.
