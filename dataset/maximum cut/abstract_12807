We present a Dalitz plot analysis of the decay D+ -> K- pi+ pi+ based on 281
pb-1 of e+e- collision data produced at the psi(3770) by CESR and observed with
the CLEO-c detector. We select 67086 candidate events with a small, ~1.1%,
background for this analysis. When using a simple isobar model our results are
consistent with the previous measurements done by E791. Since our sample is
considerably larger we can explore alternative models. We find better agreement
with data when we include an isospin-two pi+pi+ S-wave contribution. We apply a
quasi model-independent partial wave analysis and measure the amplitude and
phase of the K pi and pi+pi+ S waves in the range of invariant masses from the
threshold to the maximum in this decay.
