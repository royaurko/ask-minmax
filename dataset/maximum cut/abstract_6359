We present the BVR broad band polarimetric observations of 51 stars belonging
to the young open cluster IC 1805. Along with the photometric data from the
literature we have modeled and subtracted the foreground dust contribution from
the maximum polarization (P_{max}) and colour excess (E_{B-V}). The mean value
of the P_max for intracluster medium and the foreground are found to be 5.008
+/-0.005 % and 4.865 +/-0.022 % respectively. Moreover, the mean value of the
wavelength of maximum polarization (lambda_{max}) for intracluster medium is
0.541 +/- 0.003 micro m, which is quite similar as the general interstellar
medium (ISM). The resulting intracluster dust component is found to have
negligible polarization efficiency as compared to interstellar dust. Some of
the observed stars in IC 1805 have shown the indication of intrinsic
polarization in their measurements.
