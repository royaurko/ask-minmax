In this paper we discuss the basic properties of a discrete distribution
introduced by Harris in 1948 and obtain a characterization of it. The
divisibility properties of the distribution are also studied. We derive the
moment and maximum likelihood estimators for both the parameters and verify
them by simulated observations.
