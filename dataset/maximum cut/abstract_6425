Magnetocaloric effect and magnetoresistance have been studied in
Dy(Co1-xSix)2 [x=0, 0.075 and 0.15] compounds. Magnetocaloric effect has been
calculated in terms of adiabatic temperatue change (Delta Tad) as well as
isothermal magnetic entropy change (Delta SM) using the heat capacity data. The
maximum values of DeltaSM and DeltaTad for DyCo2 are found to be 11.4 JKg-1K-1
and 5.4 K, respectively. Both DSM and DTad decrease with Si concentration,
reaching a value of 5.4 JKg-1K-1 and 3 K, respectively for x=0.15. The maximum
magnetoresistance is found to about 32% in DyCo2, which decreases with increase
in Si. These variations are explained on the basis of itinerant electron
metamagnetism occurring in these compounds.
