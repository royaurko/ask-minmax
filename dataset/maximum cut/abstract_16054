We investigate the possibility that the Universe is reionized by the decay
products of heavy particles. In particular we study under which circumstances
this decay may produce a significant reionization at high redshift ($z \simeq
20$), as requested by the WMAP result.Extra sources of reionization at high
redshifts increase the recombination rate. As a result, the number density of
decaying particles required to produce a high level of ionization at $z \simeq
10-20$ is significantly higher ($\simeq 300$ times) than previously estimated.
Moreover, the ionization produced by decay particles implies a high optical
depth even if the maximum level of ionization ever produced is of the order of
$10^{-2}$. In order to match the cosmic microwave background polarization power
spectrum, other significant sources of reionization are needed at low redshift.
Decaying particles producing a ionization fraction $x \simeq 0.5$ at $z \simeq
20$ would imply an optical depth much too high to fit the cosmic microwave
background spectra at $l \ge 30$. For decay times $t_{dec} < 2 \times 10^{16}
{\rm s}$, recent cosmic microwave background and large scale structure data
limits the primordial abundance of the decaying particles to $\Omega_x \le 21
\times 10^{-9} (1+z)^3$ at 95 % C.L., and favors long decay times. The data do
not favor this reionization model versus the instantaneous reionization one. We
also find that the decay of these heavy particles significantly heats up the
medium, bringing the expected $y$ distortion to unobservable levels.
