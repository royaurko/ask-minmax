This paper introduces a five-parameter lifetime model with increasing,
decreasing, upside -down bathtub and bathtub shaped failure rate called as the
McDonald Gompertz (McG) distribution. This new distribution extend the
Gompertz, generalized Gompertz, generalized exponential, beta Gompertz and
Kumaraswamy Gompertz distributions, among several other models. We obtain
several properties of the McG distribution including moments, entropies,
quantile and generating functions. We provide the density function of the order
statistics and their moments. The parameter estimation is based on the usual
maximum likelihood approach. We also provide the observed information matrix
and discuss inferences issues. In the end, the flexibility and usefulness of
the new distribution is illustrated by means of application to two real data
sets.
