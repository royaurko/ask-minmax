Motivated by the idea that a subset of HVCs trace dark matter substructure in
the Local Group, we search for signs of star formation in the Smith Cloud, a
nearby ~2x10^6 Msun HVC currently falling into the Milky Way. Using GALEX NUV
and WISE/2MASS NIR photometry, we apply a series of color and apparent
magnitude cuts to isolate candidate O and B stars that are plausibly associated
with the Smith Cloud. We find an excess of stars along the line of sight to the
cloud, but not at a statistically significant level relative to a control
region. The number of stars found in projection on the cloud after removing an
estimate of the contamination by the Milky Way implies an average star
formation rate surface density of 10^(-4.8 +/- 0.3) Msun yr^(-1) kpc^(-2),
assuming the cloud has been forming stars at a constant rate since its first
passage through the Milky Way ~70 Myr ago. This value is consistent with the
star formation rate expected based on the average gas density of the cloud. We
also discuss how the newly discovered star forming galaxy Leo P has very
similar properties to the Smith Cloud, but its young stellar population would
not have been detected at a statistically significant level using our method.
Thus, we cannot yet rule out the idea that the Smith Cloud is really a dwarf
galaxy.
