Studies of the X-ray luminescence and scintillation properties of a SrMoO4
crystal as function of temperature down to T=10 K have been carried out. The
luminescence in SrMoO4 is quenched at room temperature, but below T<200 K the
crystal exhibits a broad emission band with a maximum at a wavelength of 520
nm. The emission is attributed to the radiative decay of self-trapped excitons
and defects acting as traps for the exactions at low temperatures. Such complex
character of radiative decay is reflected in the kinetics which contains
several components plus a contribution from delayed recombination at low
temperatures. The temperature dependence of scintillation light output of
SrMoO4 was studied. Comparing with a reference ZnWO4 crystal measured under the
same experimental conditions it was found that the light output of SrMoO4 is
15+-5%. It is suggested, therefore, that there is scope for optimisation of
strontium molybdate for application as scintillator in cryogenic rare event
