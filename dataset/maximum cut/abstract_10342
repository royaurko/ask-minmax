As described in this paper, we study market-wide price co-movements around
crashes by analyzing a dataset of high-frequency stock returns of the
constituent issues of Nikkei 225 Index listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for
the three years during 2007--2009. Results of day-to-day principal component
analysis of the time series sampled at the 1 min time interval during the
continuous auction of the daytime reveal the long range up to a couple of
months significant auto-correlation of the maximum eigenvalue of the
correlation matrix, which express the intensity of market-wide co-movement of
stock prices. It also strongly correlates with the open-to-close intraday
return and daily return of Nikkei 225 Index. We also study the market mode,
which is the first principal component corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue,
in the framework of Multi-fractal random walk model. The parameter of the model
estimated in a sliding time window, which describes the covariance of the
logarithm of the stochastic volatility, grows before almost all large intraday
price declines of less than -5%. This phenomenon signifies the upwelling of the
market-wide collective behavior before the crash, which might reflect a herding
of market participants.
