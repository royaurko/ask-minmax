We performed low temperature shot noise measurements in Superconductor (TiN)
- strongly disordered normal metal (heavily doped Si) weakly transparent
junctions. We show that the conductance has a maximum due to coherent multiple
reflections at low energy and that shot noise is then twice the Poisson noise
(S=4eI). The shot noise changes to the normal value (S=2eI) due to a large
quasiparticle contribution.
