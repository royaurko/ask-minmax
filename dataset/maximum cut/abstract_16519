The value of an isomeric ratio (IR) in N=81 isotones ($^{137}$Ba, $^{139}$Ce,
$^{141}$Nd and $^{143}$Sm) is studied by means of the ($\gamma, n)$ reaction.
This quantity measures a probability to populate the isomeric state in respect
to the ground state population. In ($\gamma, n)$ reactions, the giant dipole
resonance (GDR) is excited and after its decay by a neutron emission, the
nucleus has an excitation energy of a few MeV. The forthcoming $\gamma$ decay
by direct or cascade transitions deexcites the nucleus into an isomeric or
ground state. It has been observed experimentally that the IR for $^{137}$Ba
and $ ^{139}$Ce equals about 0.13 while in two heavier isotones it is even less
than half the size. To explain this effect, the structure of the excited states
in the energy region up to 6.5 MeV has been calculated within the Quasiparticle
Phonon Model. Many states are found connected to the ground and isomeric states
by $E1$, $E2$ and $M1$ transitions. The single-particle component of the wave
function is responsible for the large values of the transitions. The calculated
value of the isomeric ratio is in very good agreement with the experimental
data for all isotones. A slightly different value of maximum energy with which
the nuclei rest after neutron decay of the GDR is responsible for the reported
effect of the A-dependence of the IR.
