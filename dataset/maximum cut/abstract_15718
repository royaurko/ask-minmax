The global nonlinear time-dependent evolution of the inertial-acoustic mode
instability in accretion disks surrounding black holes has been investigated.
The viscous stress is assumed to be proportional to the gas pressure only,
i.e.\,, $\tau = - \alpha p_g$. It is found that an oscillatory instability
exists in the inner regions of disks ($r < 10 r_g$, where $r_g$ is the
Schwarzschild radius) for sufficiently large $\alpha$ ($\gapprox 0.2$), and for
mass accretion rates less than about 0.3 times the Eddington value. The
variations of the integrated bolometric luminosity from the disk, $\Delta L/L$,
are less than 3\%. A power spectrum analysis of these variations reveals a
power spectrum which can be fit to a power law function of the frequency $P
\propto f^{-\gamma}$, with index $\gamma \sim 1.4-2.3$ and a low frequency
feature at about 4 Hz in one case. In addition, a narrow peak centered at a
frequency corresponding to the maximum epicyclic frequency of the disk at $\sim
100-130$ Hz and its first harmonic is also seen. The low frequency modulations
are remarkably similar to those observed in black hole candidate systems. The
possible existence of a scattering corona in the inner region of the disk
and/or to other processes contributing to the power at high frequencies in the
inner region of the accretion disk may make the detection of the high frequency
component difficult.
