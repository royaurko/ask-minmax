It has been pointed out in recent papers that the example considered earlier
in the O(N) sigma-model to test whether fixed-point actions are 1-loop perfect
actually checked classical perfection only. To clarify the issue we constructed
the renormalized trajectory explicitly in 1-loop perturbation theory. We found
that the fixed-point action is not exactly 1-loop perfect. The cut-off effects
are, however, strongly reduced also on the 1-loop level relative to those of
the standard and tree level improved Symanzik actions. Some points on off- and
on-shell improvement, Symanzik's program and fixed-point actions are also
discussed.
