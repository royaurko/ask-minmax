We present improved measurements of the branching fraction and CP asymmetry
for the process B+ --> rho+ pi0. The data sample corresponding to 211/fb
comprises 232 million Y(4S)-->BBbar decays collected with the BABAR detector at
the PEP-II asymmetric B Factory at SLAC. The yield and CP asymmetry are
measured using an extended maximum likelihood fitting method. The branching
fraction and CP asymmetry are found to be BR(B+ --> rho+ pi0)= [10.2 +-
1.4(stat) +- 0.9(syst)] x 10^-6 and Acp (B+ --> rho+ pi0) = -0.01 +- 0.13(stat)
+- 0.02(syst).
