It is currently believed that the decay of the thermoremanent magnetization
in spin glasses is composed of two terms; The "stationary" term which does not
depend on the sample history and dominates the short time decay ($<1s$) and a
long time aging term which depends on the samples history. The sample history
includes both the thermal history and the time spent in a magnetic field
(waiting time) before that field is removed. We report finding a third
component of the decay at times much larger than the waiting time. This decay
is independent of the waiting time, but part of the same mechanism that
produces aging. We explain this decay in terms of the initial state
distribution that is developed during the cooling process. This explanation is
tested by performing Iso-thermoremanent magnetization decay measurements.
Follow up calculations using the Spin Glass phase space barrier model suggest
that the long time decay is logarithmic and that the maximum aging time is
approximately three thousand years, in this sample, at a measuring temperature
of .83 $T_{g}$.
