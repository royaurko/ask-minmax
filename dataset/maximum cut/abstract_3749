In this paper the holographic model for hybrid and coexisting s-wave and
p-wave Josephson junction is constructed by a triplet charged scalar field
coupled with a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge fields in (3+1)-dimensional AdS
spacetime. Depending on the value of chemical potential $\mu$, one can show
that there are four types of junctions (s+p-N-s+p, s+p-N-s, s+p-N-p and s-N-p).
We show that DC current of all the hybrid and coexisting s-wave and p-wave
junctions is proportional to the sine of the phase difference across the
junction. In addition, the maximum current and the total condensation decays
with the width of junction exponentially, respectively. For s+p-N-s and s-N-p
junction, the maximum current decreases with growing temperature. Moreover, we
find that the maximum current increases with growing temperature for s+p-N-s+p
and s+p-N-p junction, which is in the different manner as the behaviour of
s+p-N-s and s-N-p junction.
