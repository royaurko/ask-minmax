The three-dimensional half-shell t-matrix for a sharply cut-off Coulomb
potential is analytically derived together with its asymptotic form without
reference to partial wave expansion. The numerical solutions of the
three-dimensional Lippmann-Schwinger equation for increasing cut-off radii
provide half-shell t-matrices which are in quite a good agreement with the
asymptotic values.
