We perform fully relativistic calculations of binary neutron stars in
quasi-equilibrium circular orbits. We integrate Einstein's equations together
with the relativistic equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to solve the initial
value problem for equal-mass binaries of arbitrary separation. We construct
sequences of constant rest mass and identify the innermost stable circular
orbit and its angular velocity. We find that the quasi-equilibrium maximum
allowed mass of a neutron star in a close binary is slightly larger than in
isolation.
