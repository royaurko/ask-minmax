The triviality of the scalar sector of the standard one-doublet Higgs model
implies that this model is only an effective low-energy theory valid below some
cut-off scale $\Lambda$. The underlying high-energy theory must include flavor
dynamics at a scale of order $\Lambda$ or greater in order to give rise to the
different Yukawa couplings of the Higgs to ordinary fermions. This flavor
dynamics will generically produce flavor-changing neutral currents and
non-universal corrections to Z -> b b-bar. We show that the experimental
constraints on the neutral D-meson mass difference imply that $\Lambda$ must be
greater than of order 21 TeV. We also discuss bounds on $\Lambda$ from the
constraints on extra contributions to the K_L - K_S mass difference and to the
coupling of the Z boson to b-quarks. For theories defined about the
infrared-stable Gaussian fixed-point, we estimate that this lower bound on
$\Lambda$ yields an upper bound of approximately 460 GeV on the Higgs boson's
mass, independent of the regulator chosen to define the theory.
