Using the GW approximation, we study the electronic structure of the recently
synthesized hydrogenated graphene, named graphane. For both conformations, the
minimum band gap is found to be direct at the $\Gamma$ point, and it has a
value of 5.4 eV in the stable chair conformation, where H atoms attach C atoms
alternatively on opposite sides of the two dimensional carbon network. In the
meta-stable boat conformation the energy gap is 4.9 eV. Then, using a supercell
approach, the electronic structure of graphane was modified by introducing
either an hydroxyl group or an H vacancy. In this last case, an impurity state
appears at about 2 eV above the valence band maximum.
