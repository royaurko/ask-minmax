From the separability point of view the problem of two atoms interact with a
single cavity mode is investigated. The density matrix is calculated and used
to discuss the entanglement and to examine the dynamics of the local and
non-local information. Our examination concentrated on the variation in the
mean photon number and the ratio of the coupling parameters. Furthermore, we
have also assumed that the atomic system is initially in the ground states as
well as in the intermediate states. It has been shown that the local
information is transferred to non-local information when the impurity of one
qubit or both is maximum.
