Let $G$ be a simple graph with no even cycle, called an odd-cycle graph.
Cavers et al. [Cavers et al. Skew-adjacency matrices of graphs, Linear Algebra
Appl. 436(2012), 4512--1829] showed that the spectral radius of $G^\sigma$ is
the same for every orientation $\sigma$ of $G$, and equals the maximum matching
root of $G$. They proposed a conjecture that the graphs which attain the
maximum skew spectral radius among the odd-cycle graphs $G$ of order $n$ are
isomorphic to the odd-cycle graph with one vertex degree $n-1$ and size
$m=\lfloor 3(n-1)/2\rfloor$. This paper, by using the Kelmans transformation,
gives a proof of the conjecture. Moreover, sharp upper bounds of the maximum
matching roots of the odd-cycle graphs with given order $n$ and size $m$ are
given and extremal graphs are characterized.
