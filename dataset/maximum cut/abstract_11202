The COBE satellite has provided the only comprehensive multi-frequency
full-sky observations of the microwave sky available today. Assessment of the
observations requires a detailed likelihood analysis to extract the maximum
amount of information present in the noisy data. I present a specific method
for estimating the CMB anisotropy power spectrum independent of any assumptions
about the underlying cosmology, and then use standard image processing
techniques to generate the most revealing corresponding maps of the signal. The
consistency of the data at the available frequencies provides strong support to
the assertion that we are being provided with our first glimpse of the last
scattering surface.
