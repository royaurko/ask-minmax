Using a nonrelativistic potential model, we calculate the cross section for
the leading-order gluon dissociation of J/psi by including the full gluon wave
function. We find that the resulting cross section as a function of gluon
energy is reduced by about a factor of three at its maximum value compared to
that calculated in the dipole approximation that is usually adopted in
theoretical studies. The effect of the reduced cross section on the J/psi
dissociation width at finite temperature is also discussed.
