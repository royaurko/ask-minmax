We present a technique to measure chemical composition and particle
cross-section of ultra-high energy cosmic rays using radio data. We relate the
geometry of the radio footprint on the ground to the depth of the extensive air
shower maximum. We suggest to use the spectral information of the radio signal
to improve the shower maximum reconstruction by minimum number of antennas on
the ground.
