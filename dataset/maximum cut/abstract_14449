This paper proposes a grey interval relation TOPSIS method for the decision
making in which all of the attribute weights and attribute values are given by
the interval grey numbers. In this paper, all of the subjective and objective
weights are obtained by interval grey number and decision-making is based on
four methods such as the relative approach degree of grey TOPSIS, the relative
approach degree of grey incidence and the relative approach degree method using
the maximum entropy estimation using 2-dimensional Euclidean distance. A
multiple attribute decision-making example for evaluation of artistic talent of
Kayagum (stringed Korean harp) players is given to show practicability of the
proposed approach.
