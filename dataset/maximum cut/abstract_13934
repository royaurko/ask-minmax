Flux loops have been installed on selected segments of the magnetic flux
return yoke of the 4 T superconducting coil of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)
detector under construction at CERN. Voltages induced in the loops during
discharge of the solenoid will be sampled online during the entire discharge
and integrated offline to provide a measurement of the initial magnetic flux
density in steel at the maximum field to an accuracy of a few percent. Although
the discharge of the solenoid is rather slow (190 s time constant), the
influence of eddy currents induced in the yoke elements should be estimated.
The calculation of eddy currents is performed with Vector Fields' program
ELEKTRA. The results of the calculations are reported.
