A model for stationary, radiatively driven winds from X--ray bursting neutron
stars is presented. General relativistic hydrodynamical and radiative transfer
equations are integrated from the neutron star surface outwards, taking into
account for helium nuclear burning in the inner, dense, nearly hydrostatic
shells. Radiative processes include both bremsstrahlung emission--absorption
and Compton scattering; only the frequency--integrated transport is considered
here. It is shown that each solution is characterized by just one parameter:
the mass loss rate $\Mdot$, or, equivalently, the envelope mass $\Menv$. We
found that, owing to the effects of Comptonization, steady, supersonic winds
can exist only for $\Mdot$ larger than a limiting value $\Mdot_{min}
\approx\Mdot_{E}$. Several models, covering about two decades in mass loss
rate, have been computed for given neutron star parameters. We discuss how the
sequence of our solutions with decreasing $\Menv$ can be used to follow the
time evolution of a strong X--ray burst during the expansion/contraction phase
near to the luminosity maximum. The comparison between our numerical results
and the observational data of Haberl {\it et al.\/} (1987) for the bursts in
4U/MXB 1820-30 gives an estimate for both the spectral hardening factor and the
accretion rate in this source.
