We investigate the angular distribution of the lepton pair in the process $p
\bar{p} \rightarrow \gamma^{\ast} + X \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^- + X$, where the
virtual photon is produced at high transverse momentum. The angular
distribution of the leptons is very sensitive to possible nonperturbative
effects, such as a nontrivial vacuum structure of QCD, and offers a good chance
to test such effects. We present complete ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$ calculations
of the decay lepton distributions in the lepton pair rest frame. An order
${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ Monte Carlo study of the lepton angular distributions,
with acceptance cuts and energy resolution smearing applied to the leptons, is
also presented.
