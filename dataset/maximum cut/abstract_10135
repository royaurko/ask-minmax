The so-called thermodynamic anomalies of water form an integral part of the
peculiar behaviour of this both important and ubiquitous molecule. In this
paper our aim is to establish whether the recently proposed TIP4P/2005 model is
capable of reproducing a number of these anomalies. Using molecular dynamics
simulations we investigate both the maximum in density and the minimum in the
isothermal compressibility along a number of isobars. It is shown that the
model correctly describes the decrease in the temperature of the density
maximum with increasing pressure. At atmospheric pressure the model exhibits an
additional minimum in density at a temperature of about 200K, in good agreement
with recent experimental work on super-cooled confined water. The model also
presents a minimum in the isothermal compressibility close to 310K. We have
also investigated the atmospheric pressure isobar for three other water models;
the SPC/E and TIP4P models also present a minimum in the isothermal
compressibility, although at a considerably lower temperature than the
experimental one. For the temperature range considered no such minimum is found
for the TIP5P model.
