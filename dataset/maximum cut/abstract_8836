The property of isoscaling in nuclear fragmentation is studied using a simple
bond percolation model with ``isospin'' added as an extra degree of freedom. It
is shown analytically, first, that isoscaling is expected to exist in such a
simple model with the only assumption of fair sampling with homogeneous
probabilities. Second, numerical percolations of hundreds of thousands of grids
of different sizes and with different $N$ to $Z$ ratios confirm this prediction
with remarkable agreement. It is thus concluded that isoscaling emerges from
the simple assumption of fair sampling with homogeneous probabilities, a
requirement which, if put in the nomenclature of the minimum information
theory, translates simply into the existence of equiprobable configurations in
maximum entropy states.
