We study the effect of contamination by interlopers in kinematic samples of
galaxy clusters. We demonstrate that without the proper removal of interlopers
the inferred parameters of the mass distribution in the cluster are strongly
biased towards higher mass and lower concentration. The interlopers are removed
using two procedures previously shown to work most efficiently on simulated
data. One is based on using the virial mass estimator and calculating the
maximum velocity available to cluster members and the other relies on the ratio
of the virial and projected mass estimators. We illustrate the performance of
the methods in detail using the example of A576, a cluster with a strong
uniform background contamination, and compare the case of A576 to 15 other
clusters with different degree of contamination. We model the velocity
dispersion and kurtosis profiles obtained for the cleaned data samples of these
clusters solving the Jeans equations to estimate the mass, concentration and
anisotropy parameter. We present the mass-concentration relation for the total
sample of 22 clusters.
