We investigate correlated electronic transport in single-walled carbon
nanotubes with two intramolecular tunneling barriers. We suggest that below a
characteristic temperature the long range nature of the Coulomb interaction
becomes crucial to determine the temperature dependence of the maximum G_max of
the conductance peak. Correlated sequential tunneling dominates transport
yielding the power-law G_max ~ T^{\alpha_{end-end}-1}, typical for tunneling
between the ends of two Luttinger liquids. Our predictions are in agreement
with recent measurements.
