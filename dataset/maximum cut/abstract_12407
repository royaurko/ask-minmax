Large Mixing Angle (LMA) neutrino oscillation is the main solution for the
long-standing Solar Neutrino Problem (SNP). Whether there is any subdominant
effect accompanying the dominant LMA solution can not be ruled out at the
moment, but will be settled by the forthcoming data from highly skilled real
time experiments targeting essentially the low energy domain of solar
neutrinos. Assuming a subdominant effect converting one of the active neutrinos
into a sterile partner in the varying solar field with changing sunspot
activity, we performed field-profile-independent predictions for $^7 Be$
neutrino signal variation, which might be tested in the KamLAND's future solar
neutrino detection program. We found that after a substantial reduction of
background and running of KamLAND solar mode through the sunspot maximum period
(around 2010 - 2012), when the solar field at the resonance may vary from few
$kG$ to $300~kG$, the subdominant time variation effect might be clearly
visible (more than $5\sigma$) for $^7 Be$ neutrinos.
