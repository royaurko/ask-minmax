Expansion velocities (Vexp) of different ions and line widths at the base of
the lines are measured and analyzed for 24 PNe with [WC]-type nuclei (WRPNe), 9
PNe ionized by WELS (WLPNe) and 14 ordinary PNe. A comparative study of the
kinematical behavior of the sample clearly demonstrates that WRPNe have in
average 40-45% larger Vexp, and possibly more turbulence than WLPNe and
ordinary PNe. WLPNe have velocity fields very much alike the ones of ordinary
PNe, rather than the ones of WRPNe. All the samples (WRPNe, WLPNe and ordinary
PNe) show expansion velocities increasing with age indicators, for example
<Vexp> is larger for low-density nebulae and also it is larger for nebulae
around high-temperature stars. This age effect is much stronger for evolved
WRPNe, suggesting that the [WC] winds have been accelerating the nebulae for a
long time, while for non-WRPNe the acceleration seems to stop at some point
when the star reaches a temperature of about 90,000-100,000 K. Non-WR nebulae
reach a maximum Vexp < 30 km/s while evolved WRPNe reach maximum Vexp of about
40 km/s. For all kind of objects (WRPNe and non-WRPNe) it is found that in
average Vexp(N+) is slightly larger than Vexp(O++), indicating that the nebulae
present acceleration of the external shells.
