We have used the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland
Association (BIMA) array to search for redshifted millimetre absorption in a
sample of damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems (DLAs). This brings the number
of published systems searched from 18 to 30. In 17 cases we reach $3\sigma$
limits of $\tau\leq0.1$, which is a significant improvement over the previous
searches and more than sufficient to detect the 4 known redshifted millimetre
absorbers ($\tau\gapp1$). While the CO rotational (millimetre) column density
limits obtained are weaker than the electronic (optical) limits, they may
provide useful limits below the atmospheric cut-off for the Lyman and Werner
\MOLH-bands in the UV ($z_{\rm abs}\lapp1.8$). Using a model for the DLA
metallicity evolution combined with assumed HCO$^+$/\MOLH ~and CO/\MOLH
\~conversion ratios, we use the molecular column density limits to calculate
plausible \MOLH ~molecular fraction limits. Finally, we use these results to
discuss the feasibility of detecting rotational CO transitions in DLAs with the
next generation of large radio telescopes.
