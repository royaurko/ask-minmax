We analyze the connections between entanglement dynamics and classical
trajectories in a semiclassi-cal regime for two systems: A pair of coupled
oscillators and the Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that entanglement production
depends on classical invariant tori and such phenomenon is closely related to
the power spectra of classical trajectories. Classical power spectrum with a
larger number of frequency com-ponents corresponds to larger entanglement. We
introduce a frequency entropy to describe the classical frequency distribution,
and find that there is good correspondence between the classical frequency
entro-pies and the maximum von Neumann entropies.
