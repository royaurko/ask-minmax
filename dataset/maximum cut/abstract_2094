The well-known ``displace, cut and reflect'' method used to generate disks
from given solutions of Einstein field equations is applied to the
superposition of twoextreme Reissner-Nordstrom black holes to construct disks
made of charged dust and alsonon-axisymmetric planar distributions of charged
dust on the z=0 plane. They are symmetric with respect to twoor one coordinate
axes, depending whether the black holes have equal or unequal masses,
respectively.For these non-axisymmetric distributions of matter we also study
the effective potential for geodesic motion of neutral test particles.
