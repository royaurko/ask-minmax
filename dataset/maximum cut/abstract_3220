In this contribution, we study a single Cooper pair box interacts with a
single cavity mode. We show the roles played by the detuning parameters and
charged capacities on the degree of entanglement. For large values of the
detuning parameter the survival entanglement increases on the expanse of the
degree of entanglement. We generate a maximum entangled state and use it to
perform the original teleportation protocol. The fidelity of the teleportated
state is increased with decreasing the detuning parameter and the number of
photon inside the cavity.
