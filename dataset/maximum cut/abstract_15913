We present the results of a wide-field survey designed to measure the size,
inclination, and radial distributions of Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). The survey
found 86 KBOs in 73 square degrees observed to limiting red magnitude 23.7
using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the 12k x 8k CCD Mosaic camera.
For the first time, both ecliptic and off-ecliptic fields were examined to more
accurately constrain the inclination distribution of the KBOs. The survey data
were processed using an automatic moving object detection algorithm, allowing a
careful characterization of the biases involved. In this work, we quantify
fundamental parameters of the Classical KBOs (CKBOs), the most numerous objects
found in our sample, using the new data and a maximum likelihood simulation.
Deriving results from our best-fit model, we find that the size distribution
follows a differential power law with exponent q = 4.0 (+0.6)(-0.5) (1 sigma,
or 68.27% confidence). In addition, the CKBOs inhabit a very thick disk
consistent with a Gaussian distribution of inclinations with a Half-Width of
i(1/2) = 20 (+6)(-4) deg (1 sigma). We estimate that there are N = 3.8
(+2.0)(-1.5) x 10^4 (1 sigma) CKBOs larger than 100 km in diameter. We also
find compelling evidence for an outer edge to the CKBOs at heliocentric
distance R = 50 AU.
