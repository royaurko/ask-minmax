We address the investigation of the solvation properties of the minimal
orientational model for water, originally proposed by Bell and Lavis. The model
presents two liquid phases separated by a critical line. The difference between
the two phases is the presence of structure in the liquid of lower density,
described through orientational order of particles. We have considered the
effect of small inert solute on the solvent thermodynamic phases. Solute
stabilizes the structure of solvent, by the organization of solvent particles
around solute particles, at low temperatures. Thus, even at very high
densities, the solution presents clusters of structured water particles
surrounding solute inert particles, in a region in which pure solvent would be
free of structure. Solute intercalates with solvent, a feature which has been
suggested by experimental and atomistic simulation data. Examination of solute
solubility has yielded a minimum in that property, which may be associated with
the minimum found for noble gases. We have obtained a line of minimum
solubility (TmS) across the phase diagram, accompanying the line of maximum in
density (TMD). This coincidence is easily explained for non-interacting solute
and it is in agreement with earlier results in the literature. We give a simple
argument which suggests that interacting solute would dislocate TmS to higher
temperatures.
