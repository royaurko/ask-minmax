We compute the QCD corrections to the gluon fusion subprocess gg to gamma
gamma, which forms an important component of the background to the search for a
light Higgs boson at the LHC. We study the dependence of the improved pp to
gamma gamma X background calculation on the factorization and renormalization
scales, on various choices for photon isolation cuts, and on the rapidities of
the photons. We also investigate ways to enhance the statistical significance
of the Higgs signal in the di-photon channel.
