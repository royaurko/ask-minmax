X-ray spectral state transitions are a key signature of black hole X-ray
binaries and follow a well-defined pattern. We examined 12 XMM-Newton
observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 1313, which harbors two compact
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), X-1 and X-2, in order to determine if the
state transitions in ULXs follow the same pattern. For both sources, the
spectra were adequately fitted by an absorbed power-law with the addition of a
low temperature (kT=0.1~0.3 keV) disk blackbody component required in 6 of the
12 observations. As the X-ray luminosity of X-1 increases to a maximum at
3x10^40 ergs/s, the power-law photon index softens to 2.5-3.0. This behavior is
similar to the canonical spectral state transitions in Galactic black hole
binaries, but the source never enters the high/soft or thermal dominant state
and instead enters the steep power-law state at high luminosities. X-2 has the
opposite behavior and appears to be in the hard state, with a photon index of
Gamma=1.7-2.0 at high luminosity, but can soften to Gamma=2.5 at the lower
luminosities.
