In this work, we study the thermodynamic behavior of heavy-flavored meson
matter in the framework of $(\sigma,\omega)$-meson-exchange model in
relativistic mean field theory. We find a decreasing of the effective masses of
$D$ and $B$ mesons as the temperature increases. By using the effective mass
and maximum value of dissociation temperatures available from lattice QCD, the
masses of the bound states $D \bar{D}$ and $B \bar{B}$ are estimated in 2 MeV
for both molecules. For the $B$-meson matter, the pressure presents an exotic
behavior, being negative for temperatures above 6.6 times the deconfinement
transition temperature $T_c$. In addition, the ratio of pressure to energy
density is similar to the value predicted for systems that behave as dark
energy matter.
