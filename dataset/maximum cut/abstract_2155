The S and P wave $\pi \pi$ phase shifts are recalculated in terms of two
phenomenological parameters using the one loop CPTh and the elastic unitarity
condition. Using these phase shifts, the vector and scalar form factors are
calculated and shown to be in a good agreement with experimental data. It is
found that the simpler and more phenomenological approach, where the left hand
cut contributions to the partial wave amplitude are neglected, yields
approximately the same result.
