We propose a new mechanism for binding of two equally charged carriers in a
double-layer system subjected by a magnetic field of a special form. A field
configuration for which the magnetic fields in adjacent layers are equal in
magnitude and opposite in direction is considered. In such a field an
additional integral of motion - the momentum of the pair P arises. For the case
when in one layer the carrier is in the zero (n=0) Landau level while in the
other layer - in the first (n=1) Landau level the dependence of the energy of
the pair on its momentum E(P} is found. This dependence turns out to be
nonmonotonic one : a local maximum and a local minimum appears, indicating the
emergence of a metastable bound state of two carrier with the same sign of
electrical charge.
