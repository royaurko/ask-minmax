We present an analytical theory for impact ionization fronts in reversely
biased p^{+}-n-n^{+} structures. The front propagates into a depleted n base
with a velocity that exceeds the saturated drift velocity. The front passage
generates a dense electron-hole plasma and in this way switches the structure
from low to high conductivity. For a planar front we determine the
concentration of the generated plasma, the maximum electric field, the front
width and the voltage over the n base as functions of front velocity and doping
of the n base. Theory takes into account that drift velocities and impact
ionization coefficients differ between electrons and holes, and it makes
quantitative predictions for any semiconductor material possible.
