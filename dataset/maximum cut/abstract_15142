Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two dyes acriflavine
(Acf) and rhodamine B (RhB) were investigated in solution and Layer-by-Layer
(LbL) self assembled films in presence and absence of clay mineral laponite.
UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy studies suggest both the dyes
present mainly as monomer in solution and films. Energy transfer occurred from
Acf to RhB in solution and LbL films. The energy transfer efficiency increases
in presence of clay laponite and the maximum efficiency were 78.17% and 32.54%
in clay dispersion and in LbL films respectively. Presence of laponite
particles onto LbL film was confirmed by atomic force microscopy investigations
with a surface coverage of more than 75%. Energy transfer efficiency was pH
sensitive and the energy transfer efficiency varies from 4.5% to 44.45% in
mixed dye solution for a change in pH from 3.0 to 12.0. With proper calibration
it is possible to use the present system under investigation to sense pH over a
wide range of pH from 3.0 to 12.0.
