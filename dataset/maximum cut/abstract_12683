The floating potential of a probe, emitting a sufficiently high electron
current, yields a fairly accurate approximation of the plasma potential. This
is an advantage in comparison to the conventional Langmuir probe where, after
determination of the electron temperature Te, the plasma potential can only be
derived indirectly from the formula Vpl = Vfl + aTe, where a is a function of
the ratio of the electron to the ion saturation currents (a is around 2.4 in a
magnetised hydrogen plasma). In addition, an emissive probe also works if there
are electron drifts or beams in the plasma. Emissive probes are usually
realised by small directly heated loops of W-wire. Drawbacks of this design are
the limited lifetime, the low electron emissivity of W and the voltage drop
across the wire. We have developed a new type of emissive probe, which is
heated by an infrared high-power diode laser with a maximum output power of 50
W. The probe consists of a small cylinder of LaB6. The probe was inserted into
the edge region of the VINETA helicon discharge plasma. Basic features of
emissive probes were verified.
