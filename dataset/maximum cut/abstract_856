We present an algorithm for the integrand-level reduction of multi-loop
amplitudes of renormalizable field theories, based on computational algebraic
geometry. This algorithm uses (1) the Gr\"obner basis method to determine the
basis for integrand-level reduction, (2) the primary decomposition of an ideal
to classify all inequivalent solutions of unitarity cuts. The resulting basis
and cut solutions can be used to reconstruct the integrand from unitarity cuts,
via polynomial fitting techniques. The basis determination part of the
algorithm has been implemented in the Mathematica package, BasisDet. The
primary decomposition part can be readily carried out by algebraic geometry
softwares, with the output of the package BasisDet. The algorithm works in both
D=4 and $D=4-2\epsilon$ dimensions, and we present some two and three-loop
examples of applications of this algorithm.
