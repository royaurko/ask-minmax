We have investigated the low frequency (f) flicker (also called 1/f) noise of
single-layer graphene devices on h-BN (placed on SiO2/Si) along with those on
SiO2/Si. We observe that the devices fabricated on h-BN have on average one
order of magnitude lower noise amplitude compared with devices fabricated on
SiO2/Si. We associate this noise reduction to the lower densities of impurities
and trap sites in h-BN than in SiO2. Furthermore, the gate voltage dependent
noise amplitude shows a broad maximum at Dirac point for devices on h-BN, in
contrast to the M-shaped behavior showing a minimum at Dirac point for devices
on SiO2, consistent with the reduced charge inhomogeneity (puddles) for
graphene on h-BN. This study demonstrates that the use of h-BN as a substrate
or dielectric can be a simple and efficient noise reduction technique valuable
for electronic applications of graphene and other nanomaterials.
