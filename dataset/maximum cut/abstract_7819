In a variety of well motivated models, such as two Higgs Doublet Models
(2HDMs) and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), there are neutral
Higgs bosons that have significantly enhanced couplings to b-quarks and tau
leptons in comparison to those of the SM Higgs. These so called non-standard
Higgs bosons could be copiously produced at the LHC in association with b
quarks, and subsequently decay into b-quark pairs. However, this production
channel suffers from large irreducible QCD backgrounds. We propose a new search
strategy for non-standard neutral Higgs bosons at the 7 TeV LHC in the 3b's
final state topology. We perform a simulation of the signal and backgrounds,
using state of the art tools and methods for different sets of selection cuts,
and conclude that neutral Higgs bosons with couplings to b-quarks of about 0.3
or larger, and masses up to 400 GeV, could be seen with a luminosity of 30
fb^{-1}. In the case of the MSSM we also discuss the complementarity between
the 3b channel and the inclusive tau pair channel in exploring the
supersymmetric parameter space.
