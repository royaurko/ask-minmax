We propose a practical network code for the wireless two-way relay channel
where all nodes communicate in full duplex (FD) mode. The physical layer
network coding (PNC) operation is applied with the FD operating nodes, reducing
the transmission time to a single time slot, hence doubling the spectral
efficiency when compared to classical PNC systems. In our system model, binary
phase shift keying modulated signals are transmitted over Rayleigh fading
channels. We derive the theoretical error rates at relay and end nodes
according to the maximum likelihood detection rule, in case of non-ideal
self-interference cancellation. Theoretical results are also verified via
simulations.
