The number of equations needed to cut out a variety given by an ideal is
called the arithmetic rank (of the ideal). It was shown in [8] that the notion
of arithmetic rank is strongly related to the concept of regular sequences on
the Matlis duals of certain local cohomology modules and thus is related to the
set of associated primes of such Matlis duals. While in [8] the general
situation with no restrictions on arithmetic rank and cohomological dimension
was investigated, this work concentrates on the case ``cohomological dimension
of the given ideal is (at most) one'' and also on the interplay between
non-graded local and graded situations. The main results are new
characterizations for the case $\ara \leq 1$ (theorem 1 and theorem 2), the
fact that given a graded ring $R$ and a homogenous ideal $I$ of cohomological
dimension at most one the inclusion $$\{x\in I| x\hbox {non-homogenous}\}
\subseteq \bigcup_{\goth p\in \Ass_R(D(\LCMo ^1_I(R)))}\goth p$$ holds (theorem
4, $D$ is a Matlis dual functor) and a (somewhat technical) statement on
regular sequences on Matlis duals of certain local cohomology modules (theorem
5), which shows that regular sequences on such Matlis duals behave well in some
sense although these modules are not finite in general.
