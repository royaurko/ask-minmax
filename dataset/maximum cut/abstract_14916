The peculiar high-energy emission spectrum of the so-called extreme BL Lacs
(EHBL) challenges the standard emission models of blazars. Among the possible
solutions, the so-called hadronic cascade scenario assumes that the observed
high-energy radiation is produced in the intergalactic space through
photo-hadronic reactions by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) with energies
up to $10^{19-20}$ eV beamed by the blazar jet. Under the assumption --
implicit in this model -- that the intrinsic high-energy synchrotron-self
Compton emission of the blazar does not substantially contribute to the
observed $\gamma$-ray spectrum, we derive constraints to the basic physical
quantities of the jet and we compare them with the requirements of the hadronic
cascade scenario. We found that, for a plausible range of relativistic jet
Doppler factors ($\delta=10-50$), the maximum achievable energy of the
accelerated protons can exceed $2\times 10^{19}$ eV with jet powers of the
order of $\approx 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, parameters compatible with the
requests of the hadronic scenario even if EHBL are embedded in magnetic fields
of cosmic filaments. We also discuss the consequences of our results for the
possibility that local EHBL contribute to the observed UHECR.
