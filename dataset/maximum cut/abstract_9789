This is a survey on recent results on counting of curves over finite fields.
It reviews various results on the maximum number of points on a curve of genus
g over a finite field of cardinality q, but the main emphasis is on results on
the Euler characteristic of the cohomology of local systems on moduli spaces of
curves of low genus and its implications for modular forms.
