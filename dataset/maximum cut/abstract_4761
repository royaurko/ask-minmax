We study techniques for identifying highly boosted top jets, where the
subsequent top decay products are not isolated. For hadronic boosted tops, we
consider variables which probe the jet substructure in order to reduce the
background from QCD jets with large invariant mass. Substructure variables
related to two-body kinematics are least sensitive to the modeling of parton
shower, while those which involve multi-body kinematics may still have
discrimination power. For leptonic boosted tops, we consider variables which
characterize the separation between the lepton--although not isolated by
conventional criterion--and the hadronic activity in the top jet. Such
variables are useful in reducing the backgrounds both from heavy-flavor jets
and from accidental jet-lepton overlap. We give numerical estimates of the top
identification efficiency versus background rejection rate as a functions of
cuts on these variables, and find that these variables offer additional useful
information above invariant mass alone.
