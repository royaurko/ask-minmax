We report the observation of an anomalous {27}Al-NMR response of a single
grain Al_{72.4}Pd_{20.5}Mn_{7.1} icosahedral quasicrystal at low temperatures.
In an external magnetic field of
 6 T and upon decreasing temperature, we observe a sharp 100 % increase of the
resonance linewidth at 2.5 K. No further changes of the linewidth are observed
down to 0.05 K. The linewidth enhancement is accompanied by a small but
distinct increase of the spin-lattice relaxation rate T_{1}^{-1} and by a
maximum of the spin-spin relaxation time T_{2}(T). All these anomalies are
absent in external fields of 2.5 T and below. Our observations indicate unusual
variations in the stability of isolated magnetic moments in a quasiperiodic
metallic environment.
