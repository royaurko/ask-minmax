The origin of peculiar magnetic structures in cubic rare-earth (R)
hexaborides RB_6 is traced back to their characteristic band structure. The
three sphere-like Fermi surfaces induce interpocket polarization of the
conduction band as a part of a RKKY-type interaction. It is shown for the
free-electron-like model that the interpocket polarization gives rise to a
broad maximum in the intersite interaction I(q) around q=(1/4,1/4,1/2) in the
Brillouin zone. This maximum is consistent with the superstructure observed in
R=Ce, Gd and Dy. The wave-number dependence of I(q) is independently extracted
from analysis of the spin-wave spectrum measured for NdB_6. It is found that
I(q) obtained from fitting the data has a similarly to that derived by the
interpocket polarization model, except that the absolute maximum now occurs at
(0,0,1/2) in consistency with the A-type structure. The overall shape of I(q)
gives a hint toward understanding an incommensurate structure in PrB_6 as well.
