In this note, new examples of manifolds with Riemannian metrics of
nonnegative sectional curvature are constructed. These manifolds are orbit
spaces of free nonlinear orientation-preserving and orientation-reversing
involutions on products of spheres, their fundamental group is of order two,
and they realize homeomorphism classes that were not previously known to
contain nonnegatively curved smooth manifolds. We remark that our examples are
obtained as a cut-and-paste construction along spheres and real projective
spaces on sphere bundles.
