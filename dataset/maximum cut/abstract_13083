We describe a low-cost and simple setup for hyperthermia measurements on
colloidal solutions of magnetic nanoparticles (ferrofluids) with a
frequency-adjustable magnetic field in the range 5-500 kHz produced by an
electromagnet. By optimizing the general conception and each component (nature
of the wires, design of the electromagnet), a highly efficient setup is
obtained. For instance, in a useful gap of 1.1 cm, a magnetic field of 4.8 mT
is generated at 100 kHz and 500 kHz with an output power of 3.4 W and 75 W,
respectively. A maximum magnetic field of 30 mT is obtained at 100 kHz. The
temperature of the colloidal solution is measured using optical fiber sensors.
To remove contributions due to heating of the electromagnet, a differential
measurement is used. In this configuration the sensitivity is better than 1.5
mW at 100 kHz and 19.3 mT. This setup allows one to measure weak heating powers
on highly diluted colloidal solutions. The hyperthermia characteristics of a
solution of Fe nanoparticles are described, where both the magnetic field and
the frequency dependence of heating power have been measured.
