The technology of scintillating bolometers based on zinc molybdate
(ZnMoO$_4$) crystals is under development within the LUMINEU project to search
for 0$\nu$2$\beta$ decay of $^{100}$Mo with the goal to set the basis for large
scale experiments capable to explore the inverted hierarchy region of the
neutrino mass pattern. Advanced ZnMoO$_4$ crystal scintillators with mass of
$\sim$~0.3 kg were developed and Zn$^{100}$MoO$_4$ crystal from enriched
$^{100}$Mo was produced for the first time by using the low-thermal-gradient
Czochralski technique. One ZnMoO$_4$ scintillator and two samples (59 g and 63
g) cut from the enriched boule were tested aboveground at milli-Kelvin
temperature as scintillating bolometers showing a high detection performance.
The first results of the low background measurements with three ZnMoO$_4$ and
two enriched detectors installed in the EDELWEISS set-up at the Modane
Underground Laboratory (France) are presented.
