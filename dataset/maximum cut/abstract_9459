We consider irreducible reversible discrete time Markov chains on a finite
state space. Mixing times and hitting times are fundamental parameters of the
chain. We relate them by showing that the mixing time of the lazy chain is
equivalent to the maximum over initial states x and large sets A of the hitting
time of A starting from x. We also prove that the first time when averaging
over two consecutive time steps is close to stationarity is equivalent to the
mixing time of the lazy version of the chain.
