NGC 4486A is a low-luminosity elliptical galaxy harbouring an edge-on nuclear
disk of stars and dust. It is known to host a super-massive black hole. We
study its large-scale kinematics and stellar population along the major axis to
investigate the link between the nuclear and global properties. We use
long-slit medium-resolution optical spectra that we fit against stellar
population models. The SSP-equivalent age is about 12 Gyr old throughout the
body of the galaxy, and its metallicity decreases from [Fe/H] = 0.18 near the
centre to sub-solar values in the outskirts. The metallicity gradient is -0.24
dex per decade of radius within the effective isophote. The velocity dispersion
is 132+-3 km/s at 1.3 arcsec from the centre and decreases outwards. The
rotation velocity reaches a maximum V_max >~ 115+-5 km/s at a radius 1.3 <
r_max < 2 arcsec. NGC\,4486A appears to be a typical low-luminosity elliptical
galaxy. There is no signature in the stellar population of the possible ancient
accretion/merging event that produced the disk.
