We present a study of humidity effects on the maximum stability angle in
granular media. We show that a granular medium of small glass beads exhibits
aging properties : the first avalanche angle increases logarithmically with the
resting time of the pile. This aging behavior is found to depend on the
relative humidity of the surrounding atmosphere. A short interpretation of this
effect, based on a model of activated capillary condensation, is proposed.
