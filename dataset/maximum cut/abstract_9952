Detailed neutral hydrogen observations have been obtained of the large barred
spiral galaxy NGC 3992 and its three small companion galaxies, UGC 6923, UGC
6940, and UGC 6969. For the main galaxy, the HI distribution is regular with a
low level radial extension outside the stellar disc. However, at exactly the
region of the bar, there is a pronounced central HI hole in the gas
distribution. Likely gas has been transported inwards by the bar and because of
the emptyness of the hole no large accretion events can have happened in recent
galactic times. The gas kinematics is very regular and it is demonstrated that
the influence of the bar potential on the velocity field is negligible. A
precise and extended rotation curve has been derived showing some distinct
features which can be explained by the non-exponential radial light
distribution of NGC 3992. The decomposition of the rotation curve gives a
slight preference for a sub maximal disc, though a range of disc contributions,
up to a maximum disc situation fits nearly equally well. For such a maximum
disc contribution, which might be expected in order to generate and maintain
the bar, the required mass-to-light ratio is large but not exceptional.
