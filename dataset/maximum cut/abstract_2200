A high-energy, transverse momentum cut-off, solution of QCD is outlined.
Regge pole and ``single gluon'' properties of the pomeron are directly related
to the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking properties of the hadron
spectrum. This solution, which corresponds to a supercritical phase of Reggeon
Field Theory, may only be applicable to QCD with a very special quark content.
