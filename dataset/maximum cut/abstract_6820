The spectral characteristics of ZnO:Ga and ZnO:Ga,N ceramics prepared by
uniaxial hot pressing have been investigated. At room temperature, the edge
(exciton) band at 3.12 eV dominates in the luminescence spectra of ZnO:Ga,
while a wide luminescence band at 2.37 eV, which is likely to be due to zinc
vacancies, is observed in the spectra of ZnO:Ga,N. Upon heating, the edge band
maximum shifts to lower energies and the bandwidth increases. The extrapolated
position of the edge-band maximum at zero temperature, Em(0) = 3.367 +/- 0.005
eV, is in agreement with the data for thin zinc oxide films. The luminescence
excitation spectra in the range from 3 to 6.5 eV are reported and the mechanism
of energy transfer to excitons and luminescence centers is considered.
