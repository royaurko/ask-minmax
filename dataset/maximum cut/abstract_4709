We extend the AdS/CFT prescription of Alday and Maldacena to finite
temperature $T$, defining the amplitude for gluon scattering in ${\cal N}=4$
Super Yang-Mills at strong coupling from string theory. It is defined by a
lightlike ''Wilson loop'' living at the horizon of the T-dual to the black hole
in AdS space. Unlike the zero temperature case, this is different from the
Wilson loop contour defined at the boundary of the AdS black hole metric, thus
at finite $T$ there is no relation between gluon scattering amplitudes and the
Wilson loop. We calculate the amplitude at strong coupling for forward
scattering of a low energy gluon ($E<T$) off a high energy gluon ($E\gg T$) in
both cut-off and generalized dimensional regularization. The generalized
dimensional regularization is defined in string theory as an IR modified
dimensional reduction. For this calculation, the corresponding usual Wilson
loop is related to the jet quenching parameter of the finite temperature ${\cal
N}=4$ SYM plasma, while the gluon scattering amplitude is related to the
viscosity coefficient.
