The light stop pair if produced in hadron colliders and decaying through the
likely decay chain stop->chargino + b followed by chargino->neutralino + f f',
can mimic closely a top quark event when the mass of the stop is close to that
of the top quark. Because of the much lower production rate, the stop event can
be buried under the top quark event sample. In order to uncover the stop event,
specific selection cuts need to be applied. Through Monte Carlo simulation with
suitable kinematic cuts, we found that such stop event can be extracted from
the top quark sample and detected by the top quark counting experiments in the
upcoming upgraded Tevatron and LHC. However, because of the small statistics of
the Run 1 of the Tevatron, the stop signal remains hidden at Run 1.
