Pulse shape analysis is an important background reduction and signal
identification technique for next generation of neutrinoless double-beta decay
experiments examining 76Ge. We present a study of the systematic uncertainties
in one such parametric pulse-shape analysis technique for separating multi-site
backgrounds from single-site signal events. We examined systematic
uncertainties for events in full-energy gamma peaks (predominantly multi-site),
double escape peaks (predominantly single-site) and the Compton continuum near
double-beta decay endpoint (which will be the dominant background for most
neutrinoless double-beta decay searches). In short, we find total (statistical
plus systematic) fractional uncertainties in the pulse shape cut survival
probabilities of: 6.6%, 1.5% and 3.8% for double-escape, continuum and
gamma-ray events respectively.
