We reanalyze deep inelastic scattering data of BCDMS Collaboration by
including proper cuts of ranges with large systematic errors. We perform also
the fits of high statistic deep inelastic scattering data of BCDMS, SLAC, NM
and BFP Collaborations taking the data separately and in combined way and find
good agreement between these analyses. We extract the values of the QCD
coupling constant \alpha_s(M^2_Z) up to NLO level.
