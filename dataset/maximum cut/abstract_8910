Scattering of a short (much shorter then the spontaneous lifetime) laser
pulse has been considered in a dense resonant medium subject to local field
effects. The system was studied in the limit of Hartree-Fock approximation for
Bogolubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy of equations for reduced
density operators. A closed set of equations for atomic and field density
operators was derived to describe stimulated scattering of radiation.
Numerically as well as theoretically the capability of multicomponent spectrum
with maximums multiple to Rabi frequency has been demonstrated. Relative line
intensities in the spectrum were found in the limit of low density.
