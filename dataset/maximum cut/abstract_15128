We derive a theoretical model for the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)-like instability
for a thin foil accelerated by an intense laser, taking into account finite
wavelength effects in the laser wave field. The latter leads to the diffraction
of the electromagnetic wave off the periodic structures arising from the
instability of the foil, which significantly modifies the growth rate of the
RT-like instability when the perturbations on the foil have wavenumbers
comparable to or larger than the laser wavenumber. In particular, the growth
rate has a local maximum at a perturbation wavenumber approximately equal to
the laser wavenumber. The standard RT instability, arising from a pressure
difference between the two sides of a foil, is approximately recovered for
perturbation wavenumbers smaller than the laser wavenumber. Differences in the
results for circular and linear polarization of the laser light are pointed
out. The model has significance to radiation pressure acceleration of thin
foils and to laser-driven inertial confinement fusion schemes, where RT-like
instabilities are significant obstacles.
