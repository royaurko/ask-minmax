The variable flux of TeV gamma-rays detected from Mkn 421 and Mkn 501
requires the presence of high energy electrons, which could in principle
produce large numbers of electron/positron pairs, leading to an electromagnetic
cascade. We point out that this scenario can be avoided if electrons are
accelerated to high energy rectilinearly, rather than being injected
isotropically into a blob, as in most of the models of the GeV gamma-ray
emission. By balancing linear acceleration by an electric field against inverse
Compton losses in the radiation field of the accretion disk we calculate the
emitted spectra and find the conditions which must be fulfilled in order to
exclude the development of electromagnetic cascades during acceleration.
Assuming these to be fulfilled, we show that the maximum possible photon energy
is approximately $10M_8^{2/5}\,$TeV, where $M_8$ is the mass of the central
black hole in units of $10^8\,\msolar$. In addition we compute the optical
depth to absorption of TeV photons on a possible isotropic scattered component
and on the observed nonthermal radiation (in the case of Mkn 421) and find that
TeV photons can escape provided the nonthermal X-rays originate in a jet moving
with a Lorentz factor of around 8.
