It has recently been claimed that there is significant coherence between the
spectral peaks of the global temperature series over the last 160 years and
those of the speed of the solar center of mass at periods of 10-10.5, 20-21, 30
and 60-62 years. Here it is shown that these claims are based on a comparison
between spectral peaks in spectral estimates that assume that the global
temperature data contains time-invariant spectral lines. However,
time-frequency analysis using both windowed periodograms and the maximum
entropy method shows that this is not the case. An estimate of the magnitude
squared coherence shows instead that under certain conditions only coherence at
a period of 15-17 years can be found in the data. As this result builds on a
low number of independent averages and also is unwarranted from any physical
model it is doubtful whether it is significant.
