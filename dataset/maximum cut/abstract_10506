(Abridged) We discuss the nature of the galaxies found in the Pico dos Dias
Survey (PDS) for young stellar objects. The PDS galaxies were selected from the
IRAS Point Source catalog. They have flux density of moderate or high quality
at 12, 25 and 60 $\mu$m and spectral indices in the ranges $-3.00 \leq
\alpha(25,12) \leq +0.35$ and $-2.50 \leq \alpha(60,25) \leq +0.85$. These
criteria allowed the detection of 382 galaxies, which are a mixture of
starburst and Seyfert galaxies.
  The starburst galaxies show an excess of FIR luminosity and their IRAS colors
are significantly different from those of Seyfert galaxies -- 99% of the
starburst galaxies in our sample have a spectral index $\alpha(60,25) < -1.9$.
As opposed to Seyfert galaxies, very few PDS starbursts are detected in X-rays.
  In the infrared, the starburst galaxies form a continuous sequence with
normal galaxies. But they generally can be distinguished from normal galaxies
by their spectral index $\alpha(60,25) > -2.5$. This color cut--off also marks
a change in the dominant morphologies of the galaxies: the normal IRAS galaxies
are preferentially late--type spirals (Sb and later), while the starbursts are
more numerous among early--type spirals (earlier than Sbc).
  No difference is found between the starbursts detected in the FIR and those
detected on the basis of UV excess. The PDS starburst galaxies represent the
FIR luminous branch of the UV-bright starburst nucleus galaxies, with mean FIR
luminosity $\log({\rm L}_{\rm IR}/{\rm L}_\odot) = 10.3 \pm 0.5$ and redshifts
smaller than 0.1. They form a complete sample limited in flux in the FIR at
$2\times10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.
