We report preliminary results of a multi-frequency campaign on the TeV
candidate blazar W Comae (z=0.102). Flux limits by Whipple and HEGRA show that
the TeV flux must be considerably below an E^-2 extrapolation of the EGRET
flux. In the framework of proton-initiated cascade models, this implies a
moderate amount of gamma-ray attenuation due to pair production in collisions
with low-energy photons of the extragalactic infrared background. In a simple
SSC model, the gamma-ray spectrum cuts off intrinsically just below TeV without
requiring external absorption.
