BABYSCAN, a whole body counter (WBC) for small children was developed in
2013, and units have been installed at three hospitals in Fukushima Prefecture.
Between December, 2013 and March, 2015, 2707 children between the ages of 0 and
11 have been scanned, and none had detectable levels of radioactive cesium. The
minimum detectable activities (MDAs) for $^{137}$Cs were $\leq 3.5$ Bq
kg$^{-1}$ for ages 0-1, decreasing to $\leq 2$ Bq kg$^{-1}$ for ages 10-11.
Including the $^{134}$Cs contribution, these translate to a maximum committed
effective dose of $\sim 16 \mu$Sv y$^{-1}$ even for newborn babies, and
therefore the internal exposure risks can be considered negligibly small.
  Analysis of the questionnaire filled out by the parents of the scanned
children regarding their families' food and water consumption revealed that the
majority of children residing in the town of Miharu regularly consume local or
home-grown rice and vegetables, while in Minamisoma, a majority avoid tap water
and produce from Fukushima. The data show, however, no correlation between
consumption of locally produced food and water and the children's body burdens.
