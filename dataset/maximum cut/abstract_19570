We use GALEX ultraviolet (UV) and optical integrated photometry of the hosts
of seventeen luminous supernovae (LSNe, having peak M_V < -21) and compare them
to a sample of 26,000 galaxies from a cross-match between the SDSS DR4 spectral
catalog and GALEX interim release 1.1. We place the LSNe hosts on the galaxy
NUV-r versus M_r color magnitude diagram (CMD) with the larger sample to
illustrate how extreme they are. The LSN hosts appear to favor low-density
regions of the galaxy CMD falling on the blue edge of the blue cloud toward the
low luminosity end. From the UV-optical photometry, we estimate the star
formation history of the LSN hosts. The hosts have moderately low star
formation rates (SFRs) and low stellar masses (M_*) resulting in high specific
star formation rates (sSFR). Compared with the larger sample, the LSN hosts
occupy low-density regions of a diagram plotting sSFR versus M_* in the area
having higher sSFR and lower M_*. This preference for low M_*, high sSFR hosts
implies the LSNe are produced by an effect having to do with their local
environment. The correlation of mass with metallicity suggests that perhaps
wind-driven mass loss is the factor that prevents LSNe from arising in
higher-mass, higher-metallicity hosts. The massive progenitors of the LSNe
(>100 M_sun), by appearing in low-SFR hosts, are potential tests for theories
of the initial mass function that limit the maximum mass of a star based on the
SFR.
