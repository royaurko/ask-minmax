Doppler reflectometry is considered in slab plasma model in the frameworks of
analytical theory. The diagnostics locality is analyzed for both regimes:
linear and nonlinear in turbulence amplitude. The toroidal antenna focusing of
probing beam to the cut-off is proposed and discussed as a method to increase
diagnostics spatial resolution. It is shown that even in the case of nonlinear
regime of multiple scattering, the diagnostics can be used for an estimation
(with certain accuracy) of plasma poloidal rotation profile.
