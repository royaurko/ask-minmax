We present a new model for the coronal structure of rapidly rotating
solar-type stars. The presence of prominences trapped in co-rotation 2 to 5
stellar radii above the stellar surface has been taken as evidence that the
coronae of these stars must be very extended. The observed surface magnetic
fields, however, cannot contain X-ray emitting gas out to these distances. We
present an alternative model: that these prominences are trapped in long thin
loops embedded not in the X-ray corona, but in the wind. Above coronal helmet
streamers, oppositely-directed wind-bearing field lines reconnect to form
closed loops which then fill up with gas that was originally part of the wind.
We demonstrate that static equilibria exist for these loops at a range of
pressures and temperatures. The maximum loop height falls as the rotation rate
increases, but rises as the loop temperature decreases. For a solar-mass star
with rotation period 0.5 days, whose X-ray corona extends 1stellar radius above
the surface, loops at temperatures of 10, 000 K can extend out to 5 stellar
radii.
