Recently, a thermal Brownian motor was introduced [Van den Broeck, Kawai and
Meurs, Phys. Rev. Lett. (2004)], for which an exact microscopic analysis is
possible. The purpose of this paper is to review some further properties of
this construction, and to discuss in particular specific issues including the
relation with macroscopic response and the efficiency at maximum power.
