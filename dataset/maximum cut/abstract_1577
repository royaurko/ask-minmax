We present an implementation of the method of orthogonal polynomials which is
particularly suitable to study the partition functions of Penner random matrix
models, to obtain their explicit forms in the exactly solvable cases, and to
determine the coefficients of their perturbative expansions in the continuum
limit. The method relies on identities satisfied by the resolvent of the Jacobi
matrix in the three-term recursion relation of the associated families of
orthogonal polynomials. These identities lead to a convenient formulation of
the string equations. As an application, we show that in the continuum limit
the free energy of certain exactly solvable models like the linear and double
Penner models can be written as a sum of gaussian contributions plus linear
terms. To illustrate the one-cut case we discuss the linear, double and cubic
Penner models, and for the two-cut case we discuss theoretically and
numerically the existence of a double-branch structure of the free energy for
the gaussian Penner model.
