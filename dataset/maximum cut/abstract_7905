We present a phenomenological study of the associated production of a prompt
photon and a heavy quark jet (charm or bottom) in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.
This channel allows for estimating the amount of energy loss experienced by the
charm and bottom quarks propagating in the dense QCD medium produced in those
collisions. Calculations are carried out at next-to-leading order (NLO)
accuracy using the BDMPS-Z heavy-quark quenching weights. The quenching of the
single heavy-quark jet spectrum reflects fairly the hierarchy in the heavy
quark energy loss assumed in the perturbative calculation. On the contrary, the
single photon spectrum in heavy-ion collisions is only modified at low momenta,
for which less heavy-quark jets pass the kinematic cuts. On top of single
particle spectra, the two-particle final state provides a range of observables
(photon-jet pair momentum, jet asymmetry, among others) which are studied in
detail. The comparison of the photon-jet pair momentum, from p-p to Pb-Pb
collisions, is sensitive to the amount of energy lost by the heavy-quarks and
could therefore be used in order to better understand parton energy loss
processes in the heavy quark sector.
