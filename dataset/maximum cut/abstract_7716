Synchrotron X-ray emission components were recently detected in many young
supernova remnants (SNRs). There is even an emerging class - SN1006,
RXJ1713.72-3946, Vela Jr, and others - that is dominated by non-thermal
emission in X-rays, also probably of synchrotron origin. Such emission results
from electrons/positrons accelerated well above TeV energies in the spectral
cut-off regime. In the case of diffusive shock acceleration, which is the most
promising acceleration mechanism in SNRs, very strong magnetic fluctuations
with amplitudes well above the mean magnetic field must be present. Starting
from such a fluctuating field, we have simulated images of polarized X-ray
emission of SNR shells and show that these are highly clumpy with high
polarizations up to 50%. Another distinct characteristic of this emission is
the strong intermittency, resulting from the fluctuating field amplifications.
The details of this "twinkling" polarized X-ray emission of SNRs depend
strongly on the magnetic-field fluctuation spectra, providing a potentially
sensitive diagnostic tool. We demonstrate that the predicted characteristics
can be studied with instruments that are currently being considered. These can
give unique information on magnetic-field characteristics and high-energy
particle acceleration in SNRs.
