We assess the potential of detecting a charged Higgs boson of the MSSM at the
LHC via its decays into a chargino and a neutralino. We focus our attention on
the region of parameter space with $m_{H^{\pm}} > m_t$ and $3 \lsim tan(beta)
\lsim 10$, where identification of the $H^{\pm}$ via other decay modes has
proven to be ineffective. Searching for means to plug this hole, we simulate
the decays $H^{\pm} --> {\tilde\chi}_1^{\pm} {\tilde\chi}_1^0$ and $H^{\pm} -->
{\tilde\chi}_1^{\pm} {\tilde\chi}_2^0,
  {\tilde\chi}_1^{\pm} {\tilde\chi}_3^0$ --- the former can yield a single hard
lepton (from the chargino decay) while the latter can yield three leptons (from
the chargino and neutralino decays). Coupled with the dominant top quark +
charged Higgs boson production mode, the resulting signature is one or three
hard, isolated leptons, substantial missing transverse momentum and a
reconstructed (via a 3-jet invariant mass) top quark. The single lepton channel
is swamped by background processes; however, with suitable cuts, a trilepton
signal emerges. While such a signal suffers from a low number of surviving
events (after cuts) and is dependent on several MSSM input parameters (notably
$M_2$, $\mu$, and slepton masses), it does fill at least some of the void left
by previous investigations.
