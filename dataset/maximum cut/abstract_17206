Aims. We present a diagnostic tool to determine the abundance of the
crystalline silicate forsterite in AGB stars surrounded by a thick shell of
silicate dust. Using six infrared spectra of high mass-loss oxygen rich AGB
stars we obtain the forsterite abundance of their dust shells.
  Methods. We use a monte carlo radiative transfer code to calculate infrared
spectra of dust enshrouded AGB stars. We vary the dust composition, mass-loss
rate and outer radius. We focus on the strength of the 11.3 and the 33.6 \mu m
forsterite bands, that probe the most recent (11.3 \mu m) and older (33.6 \mu
m) mass-loss history of the star. Simple diagnostic diagrams are derived,
allowing direct comparison to observed band strengths.
  Results. Our analysis shows that the 11.3 \mu m forsterite band is a robust
indicator for the forsterite abundance of the current mass-loss period for AGB
stars with an optically thick dust shell. The 33.6 \mu m band of forsterite is
sensitive to changes in the density and the geometry of the emitting dust
shell, and so a less robust indicator. Applying our method to six high
mass-loss rate AGB stars shows that AGB stars can have forsterite abundances of
12% by mass and higher, which is more than the previously found maximum
abundance of 5%.
