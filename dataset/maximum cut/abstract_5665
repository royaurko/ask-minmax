We present the long-wavelength effective description of non-extremal spinning
black D3-branes in flat space. Our setup is motivated by recent explorations of
low energy dynamics on black brane world-volumes within the blackfold approach
and its connections to the fluid/gravity correspondence. The spinning D3-branes
with a rigid radial Dirichlet cut-off give rise to an effective field theory.
This theory describes a charged plasma which is driven by external forces,
given by one vector and two scalar operators. Furthermore, the flavour charge
of this plasma is anomalous, allowing us to examine features of anomaly-induced
transport in the blackfold context. We calculate the hydrodynamic transport
coefficients to first order and show that in the near-horizon limit, they
reproduce the conformal charged fluid dynamics of ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills
theory. More generally the system interpolates smoothly between the blackfold,
fluid/gravity, and Rindler fluid dynamics.
