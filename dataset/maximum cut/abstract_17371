We introduce the method of double pole QCD sum rule which is basically a fit
with two exponentials of the correlation function, where we can extract the
masses and decay constants of mesons as a function of the Borel mass. We apply
this method to study the mesons: $\rho(1S,2S)$, $\psi(1S,2S)$,
$\Upsilon(1S,2S)$ and $\psi_t(1S,2S)$. The experimental masses are obtained in
two distinct Borel windows with the formation of a curious local maximum to
$\psi(1S)$ and $\Upsilon(1S)$. The $\rho$ meson decay constant is closer to the
experimental semileptonic decay constant than di-electron decay constant, on
the other hand the values of $\psi(1S,2S)$ decay constants are in agreement
with the experimental di-electron decay constant, if we consider two distinct
Borel windows. In the cases of $\rho(1S,2S)$ and $\Upsilon(1S,2S)$ the decay
constants show discrepancies with the experimental di-electron decay values,
which can be explained as the effect of QED vacuum polarization. We also
present predictions for the toponiuns masses $\psi_t(1S,2S)$ of m(1S)=357 GeV
and m(2S)=374 GeV.
