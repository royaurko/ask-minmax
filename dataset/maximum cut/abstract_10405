A passive and multi-channel microwave sounder onboard Chang'E-2 orbiter has
successfully performed microwave observation of the lunar surface and
subsurface structure. Compared with Chang'E-1 orbiter, Chang'E-2 orbiter
obtained more accurate and comprehensive microwave brightness temperature data
which is helpful for further research. Since there is a close relationship
between microwave brightness temperature data and some related properties of
the lunar regolith, such as the thickness, temperature and dielectric constant,
so precise and high resolution brightness temperature is necessary for such
research. However, through the detection mechanism of the microwave sounder,
the brightness temperature data acquired from the microwave sounder is weighted
by the antenna radiation pattern, so the data is the convolution of the antenna
radiation pattern and the lunar brightness temperature. In order to obtain the
real lunar brightness temperature, a deconvolution method is needed. The aim of
this paper is to solve the problem in performing deconvolution of the lunar
brightness temperature. In this study, we introduce the maximum entropy
method(MEM) to process the brightness temperature data and achieve excellent
results. The paper mainly includes the following aspects: firstly, we introduce
the principle of the MEM, secondly, through a series of simulations, the MEM
has been verified an efficient deconvolution method, thirdly, the MEM is used
to process the Chang'E-2 microwave data and the results are significant.
