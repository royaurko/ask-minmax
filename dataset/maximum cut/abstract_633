We present cut and project formalism based on measures and continuous weight
functions of sufficiently fast decay. The emerging measures are strongly almost
periodic. The corresponding dynamical systems are compact groups and
homomorphic images of the underlying torus. In particular, they are strictly
ergodic with pure point spectrum and continuous eigenfunctions. Their
diffraction can be calculated explicitly. Our results cover and extend
corresponding earlier results on dense Dirac combs and continuous weight
functions with compact support. They also mark a clear difference in terms of
factor maps between the case of continuous and non-continuous weight functions.
