We discuss the nuclear magnetic relaxation rate and the superfluid density
with the use of the effective five-band model by Kuroki et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 101, 087004 (2008)] in Fe-based superconductors. We show that a
fully-gapped anisotropic \pm s-wave superconductivity consistently explains
experimental observations. In our phenomenological model, the gaps are assumed
to be anisotropic on the electron-like \beta Fermi surfaces around the M point,
where the maximum of the anisotropic gap is about four times larger than the
minimum.
