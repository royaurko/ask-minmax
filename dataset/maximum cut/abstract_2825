We consider changes of properties of subgraphs of an infinite graph if we
enlarge the subgraphs by adding Bernoulli percolation on the infinite graph to
them. We give a pair of an infinite graph, a subgraph of it, and, a property.
Then, we can define two "critical probabilities" of the pair, in the same
manner as the (ordinal) critical probability is defined. We focus on the
following cases that a property is being a transient subgraph, having finitely
many or no cut points, being a recurrent subset, and, being connected. We
compare the two critical probabilities with the critical probability. Our
results depend heavily on a choice of a pair of an infinite graph, a subgraph
of it, and, a property.
