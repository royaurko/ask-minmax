Let $H \in C^2(\mathbb{R}^{N \times n})$, $H\geq 0$. The PDE system \[
\label{1} A_\infty u \, :=\, \Big(H_P \otimes H_P + H [H_P]^\bot H_{PP}
\Big)(Du) : D^2 u\, = \, 0 \tag{1} \] arises as the ``Euler-Lagrange PDE" of
vectorial variational problems for the functional $E_{\infty}(u,\Omega) = \|
H(Du) \|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}$ defined on maps $u : \Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n
\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^N$. \eqref{1} first appeared in the contributor's recent
work \cite{K3}. The scalar case though has a long history initiated by Aronsson
in \cite{A1}. Herein we study the solutions of \eqref{1} with emphasis on the
case of $n=2\leq N$ with $H$ the Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{R}^{N \times n}$,
which we call the ``$\infty$-Laplacian". By establishing a rigidity theorem for
rank-one maps of independent interest, we analyse a phenomenon of separation of
the solutions to phases with qualitatively different behaviour. As a corollary,
we extend to $N \geq 2$ the Aronsson-Evans-Yu theorem regarding non-existence
of zeros of $|Du|$ and prove a Maximum Principle. We further characterise all
$H$ for which \eqref{1} is elliptic and also study the initial value problem
for the ODE system arising for $n=1$ but with $H(\cdot,u,u')$ depending on all
the arguments.
