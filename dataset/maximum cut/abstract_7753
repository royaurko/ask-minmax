We study the environments of 6 radio galaxies at 2.2 < z < 2.6 using
wide-field near-infrared images. We use colour cuts to identify galaxies in
this redshift range, and find that three of the radio galaxies are surrounded
by significant surface overdensities of such galaxies. The excess galaxies that
comprise these overdensities are strongly clustered, suggesting they are
physically associated. The colour distribution of the galaxies responsible for
the overdensity are consistent with those of galaxies that lie within a narrow
redshift range at z ~ 2.4. Thus the excess galaxies are consistent with being
companions of the radio galaxies. The overdensities have estimated masses in
excess of 10^14 solar masses, and are dense enough to collapse into virizalised
structures by the present day: these structures may evolve into groups or
clusters of galaxies. A flux-limited sample of protocluster galaxies with K <
20.6 mag is derived by statistically subtracting the fore- and background
galaxies. The colour distribution of the protocluster galaxies is bimodal,
consisting of a dominant blue sequence, comprising 77 +/- 10% of the galaxies,
and a poorly populated red sequence. The blue protocluster galaxies have
similar colours to local star-forming irregular galaxies (U -V ~ 0.6),
suggesting most protocluster galaxies are still forming stars at the observed
epoch. The blue colours and lack of a dominant protocluster red sequence
implies that these cluster galaxies form the bulk of their stars at z < 3.
