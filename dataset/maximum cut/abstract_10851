We estimate the power spectrum of mass density fluctuations from peculiar
velocities of galaxies by applying an improved maximum-likelihood technique to
the new all-sky SFI catalog. Parametric models are used for the power spectrum
and the errors, and the free parameters are determined by assuming Gaussian
velocity fields and errors and maximizing the probability of the data given the
model. It has been applied to generalized CDM models with and without COBE
normalization. The method has been carefully tested using artificial SFI
catalogs. The most likely distance errors are found to be similar to the
original error estimates in the SFI data. The general result that is not very
sensitive to the prior model used is a relatively high amplitude of the power
spectrum. For example, at k=0.1 h/Mpc we find P(k)\Omega^{1.2}=(4.4+/-1.7)X10^3
(Mpc/h)^3. An integral over the power spectrum yields
\sigma_8\Omega^{0.6}=0.82+/-0.12. Model-dependent constraints on the
cosmological parameters are obtained for families of CDM models. For example,
for COBE-normalized \Lambda CDM models (scalar fluctuations only), the
maximum-likelihood result can be approximated by \Omega n^{2} h_{60}^{1.3}
=0.58+/-0.11. The formal random errors quoted correspond to the 90% confidence
level. The total uncertainty, including systematic errors associated with
nonlinear effects, may be larger by a factor of ~2. These results are in
agreement with an application of a similar method to other data (Mark III).
