We present fully dynamic simulations of heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies
within the perturbative QCD-based partonic transport model BAMPS, focusing on
the simultaneous investigation of jet-quenching and elliptic flow. The model
consistently features elastic and inelastic 2 -> 3 processes, the latter being
based on the Gunion-Bertsch matrix element. We discuss first attempts to extend
the model to include light quark degrees of freedom and study the energy loss
of high energy gluons and quarks in a static partonic medium. The difference
between gluons and quarks in inelastic processes is found to be weaker than
expected from color factors, due to a self-quenching effect associated with a
cut-off modeling the LPM effect.
