We adopt CUDA-capable Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) for Coulomb, Landau and
maximally Abelian gauge fixing in 3+1 dimensional SU(3) lattice gauge field
theories. The local overrelaxation algorithm is perfectly suited for highly
parallel architectures. Simulated annealing preconditioning strongly increases
the probability to reach the global maximum of the gauge functional. We give
performance results for single and double precision. To obtain our maximum
performance of ~300 GFlops on NVIDIA's GTX 580 a very fine grained degree of
parallelism is required due to the register limits of NVIDIA's Fermi GPUs: we
use eight threads per lattice site, i.e., one thread per SU(3) matrix that is
involved in the computation of a site update.
