We discuss two general aspects of the theory of cardinal characteristics of
the continuum, especially of proofs of inequalities between such
characteristics. The first aspect is to express the essential content of these
proofs in a way that makes sense even in models where the inequalities hold
trivially (e.g., because the continuum hypothesis holds). For this purpose, we
use a Borel version of Vojtas's theory of generalized Galois-Tukey connections.
The second aspect is to analyze a sequential structure often found in proofs of
inequalities relating one characteristic to the minimum (or maximum) of two
others. Vojtas's max-min diagram, abstracted from such situations, can be
described in terms of a new, higher-type object in the category of generalized
Galois-Tukey connections. It turns out to occur also in other proofs of
inequalities where no minimum (or maximum) is mentioned.
