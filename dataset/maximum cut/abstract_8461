Aging behavior is an important effect in the friction properties of solid
surfaces. In this paper we investigate the temporal evolution of the static
properties of a granular medium by studying the aging over time of the maximum
stability angle of submillimetric glass beads. We report the effect of several
parameters on these aging properties, such as the wear on the beads, the stress
during the resting period, and the humidity content of the atmosphere. Aging
effects in an ethanol atmosphere are also studied. These experimental results
are discussed at the end of the paper.
