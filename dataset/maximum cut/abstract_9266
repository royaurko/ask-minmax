We give several characterizations of discrete Sugeno integrals over bounded
distributive lattices, as particular cases of lattice polynomial functions,
that is, functions which can be represented in the language of bounded lattices
using variables and constants. We also consider the subclass of term functions
as well as the classes of symmetric polynomial functions and weighted minimum
and maximum functions, and present their characterizations, accordingly.
Moreover, we discuss normal form representations of these functions.
