In this paper, we study the large time behavior of the heat kernel on
complete Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, which was
studied by P. Li with additional maximum volume growth assumption. Following Y.
Ding's original strategy, by blowing down the metric, using Cheeger and
Colding's theory about limit spaces of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, combining
with the Gaussian upper bound of heat kernel on limit spaces, we succeed in
reducing the limit behavior of the heat kernel on manifold to the values of
heat kernels on tangent cones at infinity of manifold with renormalized
measure. As one application, we get the consistent large time limit of heat
kernel in more general context, which generalizes the former result of P. Li.
Furthermore, by choosing different sequences to blow down the suitable metric,
we show the first example manifold whose heat kernel has inconsistent limit
behavior, which answers an open question posed by P. Li negatively.
