We study the isoscalar giant monopole resonance for drip-lines and super
heavy nuclei in the frame work of a relativistic mean field theory with scaling
approach. The well known extended Thomas-Fermi approximation in the non-linear
$\sigma$-$\omega$ model is used to estimate the giant monopole excitation
energy for some selected light spherical nuclei starting from the region of
proton to neutron drip-lines. The application is extended to super heavy region
for Z=114 and 120, which are predicted by several models as the next proton
magic number beyond Z=82. We compared the excitation energy obtained by four
successful force parameters NL1, NL3, NL3$^*$ and FSUGold. The monopole energy
decreases toward the proton and neutron drip-lines in an isotopic chain for
lighter mass nuclei contrary to a monotonous decrease for super heavy isotopes.
The maximum and minimum monopole excitation energies are obtained for nuclei
with minimum and maximum isospin, respectively in an isotopic chain.
