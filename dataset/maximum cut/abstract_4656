We examine the possibility of distinguishing a supersymmetric gluino from a
Kaluza-Klein gluon of universal extra dimensions (UED) at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). We focus on the case when all kinematically allowed tree-level
decays of this particle are 3-body decays into two jets and a massive daughter
(typically weak gaugino or Kaluza-Klein weak gauge boson). We show that the
shapes of the dijet invariant mass distributions differ significantly in the
two models, as long as the mass of the decaying particle mA is substantially
larger than the mass of the massive daughter mB. We present a simple analysis
estimating the number of events needed to distinguish between the two models
under idealized conditions. For example, for mA/mB=10, we find the required
number of events to be of order several thousand, which should be available at
the LHC within a few years. This conclusion is confirmed by a parton level
Monte Carlo study which includes the effects of experimental cuts and the
combinatoric background.
