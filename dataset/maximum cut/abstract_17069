Aeolian transport in coastal areas can be significantly affected by the
presence of an exposed water table. In some dune fields, such as in
Len\c{c}\'ois Maranhenses, northeastern Brazil, the water table oscillates in
response to seasonal changes of rainfall and rates of evapotranspiration,
rising above the ground during the wet season and sinking below in the dry
period. A quantitative understanding of dune mobility in an environment with
varying groundwater level is essential for coastal management as well as for
the study of long-term evolution of many dune fields. Here we apply a model for
aeolian dunes to study the genesis of coastal dune fields in presence of an
oscillating water table. We find that the morphology of the field depends on
the time cycle, $T_{\mathrm{w}}$, of the water table and the maximum height,
$H_{\mathrm{w}}$, of its oscillation. Our calculations show that long chains of
barchanoids alternating with interdune ponds such as found at Len\c{c}\'ois
Maranhenses arise when $T_{\mathrm{w}}$ is of the order of the dune turnover
time, whereas $H_{\mathrm{w}}$ dictates the growth rate of dune height with
distance downwind. We reproduce quantitatively the morphology and size of dunes
at Len\c{c}\'ois Maranhenses, as well as the total relative area between dunes.
