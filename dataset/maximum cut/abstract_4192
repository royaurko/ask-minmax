We investigate the sparticle production processes $e\gamma\goto \sele\sz1$
and $\gamma\gamma\goto \sfermion\overline{\sfermion}$ at high energy $e\gamma$
and $\gamma\gamma$ colliders in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric
standard model (MSSM). It will be shown that the $e\gamma$ colliders would be
more suitable in searching for the heavy selectrons than $ee$ colliders because
of the low mass threshold of the process $e\gamma\goto \sele\sz1$. We show that
the standard background processes $e\gamma\goto \nu W$ and $eZ$ can be
suppressed in terms of initial beam polarization as well as the kinematical
cuts on the energy and angle of the final electron. Moreover, it will be argued
that the experimental measurements of the cross sections for the processes
$e\gamma\goto \sele\sz1$ and $\gamma\gamma\goto \sfb\sf$ could enable us to
constrain the basic parameters in the MSSM. This is originated from the
simplicity of SUSY parameter dependence of these processes. We also give
comments on the stop production at $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders with the
longitudinally polarized electron beams.
