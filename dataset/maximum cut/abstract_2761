These proceedings describe the charged-particle pseudorapidity densities and
multiplicity distributions measured by the ALICE detector in pp collisions at
$\sqrt{s} = 0.9$ and 7 TeV in specific phase space regions. The pseudorapidity
range $|\eta| < 0.8$, together with $p_{\rm T}$ cuts at 0.15, 0.5 and 1 GeV/$c$
is considered. The classes of events considered are those having at least one
charged particle in the kinematical ranges just described. The results obtained
by ALICE are compared to Monte Carlo predictions.
