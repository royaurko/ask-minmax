The `maximum' disk hypothesis of galactic disks imbedded in dark matter halos
is examined. First, decompositions of the rotation curves of NGC 2613, 3198,
6503, and 7184 are analyzed. For these galaxies the radial velocity dispersions
of the stars have been measured. If the parameters of the decompositions are
chosen according to the `maximum' disk hypothesis, the Toomre Q stability
parameter is sytematically less than one, which is a strong argument against
the `maximum' disk hypothesis. Next, density wave theory arguments are used to
describe the morphology of the spiral arms of NGC 3223, 157, and 7083. It is
shown that the `maximum' disk hypothesis is not consistent with the observed
morphologies of the galaxies.
