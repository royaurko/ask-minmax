We investigate different versions of the minority game, a toy model for
agents buying and selling a commodity. The Hamming distance between the
strategies used by agents to take decisions is introduced as an analytical tool
to determine several properties of these models. The success rate of the agents
in an adaptive version of the game is compared with the rate from a stochastic
version. It is shown numerically and analytically that the adaptive process is
inefficient, increasing the success rate of the unused strategies while
decreasing the success rate of the strategies used by the agents. The agents do
not do as well as if they were forced to use only one strategy permanently. A
version of the game in which the agents strategies evolve is also analyzed
using the notion of distance. The agents evolve into a state in which they are
all using one strategy, which is again the state that yields the maximum
success rate.
