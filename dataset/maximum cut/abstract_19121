eLISA/NGO is a new gravitational wave detection proposal with arm length of
10^6 km and one interferometer down-scaled from LISA. Just like LISA and
ASTROD-GW, in order to attain the requisite sensitivity for eLISA/NGO, laser
frequency noise must be suppressed to below the secondary noises such as the
optical path noise, acceleration noise etc. In previous papers, we have
performed the numerical simulation of the time delay interferometry (TDI) for
LISA and ASTROD-GW with one arm dysfunctional by using the CGC 2.7 ephemeris.
The results are well below their respective limits which the laser frequency
noise is required to be suppressed. In this paper, we follow the same procedure
to simulate the time delay interferometry numerically. To do this, we work out
a set of 1000-day optimized mission orbits of the eLISA/NGO spacecraft starting
at January 1st, 2021 using the CGC 2.7 ephemeris framework. We then use the
numerical method to calculate the residual optical path differences in the
second-generation TDI solutions as in our previous papers. The maximum path
length difference, for all configurations calculated, is below 13 mm (43 ps).
It is well below the limit which the laser frequency noise is required to be
suppressed for eLISA/NGO. We compare and discuss the resulting differences due
to the different arm lengths for various mission proposals -- eLISA/NGO, an
NGO-LISA-type mission with a nominal arm length of 2 x 10^6 km, LISA and
ASTROD-GW.
