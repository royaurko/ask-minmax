Decaying active region 10942 is investigated from 4:00-16:00 UT on February
24, 2007 using a suite of EUV observing instruments. Results from Hinode/EIS,
STEREO and TRACE show that although the active region has decayed and no
sunspot is present, the physical mechanisms that produce distinguishable loop
structures, spectral line broadening, and plasma flows still occur. A coronal
loop that appears as a blue-shifted structure in Doppler maps is apparent in
intensity images of log(T) = 6.0-6.3 ions. The loop structure is found to be
anti-correlated with spectral line broadening generally attributed to
nonthermal velocities. This coronal loop structure is investigated physically
(temperature, density, geometry) and temporally. Lightcurves created from
imaging instruments show brightening and dimming of the loop structure on two
different time scales; short pulses of 10-20 min and long duration dimming of
2-4 hours until its disappearance. The coronal loop structure, formed from
relatively blue-shifted material that is anti-correlated with spectral line
broadening, shows a density of 10^10 to 10^9.3 cm-3 and is visible for longer
than characteristic cooling times. The maximum nonthermal spectral line
broadenings are found to be adjacent to the footpoint of the coronal loop
structure.
