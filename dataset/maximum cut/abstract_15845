We present the first unambiguous detection of helium emission lines in
spectra of Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic). The presence of He I lines, with full
width at half maximum ~ 2000 km/s, and the distinct absence of any other
intermediate-width emission (e.g., Halpha), implies that the ejecta of SN Ic
1999cq are interacting with dense circumstellar material composed of almost
pure helium. This strengthens the argument that the progenitors of SNe Ic are
core-collapse events in stars that have lost both their hydrogen and helium
envelopes, either through a dense wind or mass-transfer to a companion. In this
way, SN 1999cq is similar to supernovae such as SN 1987K and SN 1993J that
helped firmly establish a physical connection between Type Ib and Type II
supernovae. The light curve of SN 1999cq is very fast, with an extremely rapid
rise followed by a quick decline. SN 1999cq is also found to exhibit a high
level of emission at blue wavelengths (< 5500 A), likely resulting from either
an unusually large amount of iron and iron-group element emission or
uncharacteristically low reddening compared with other SNe Ic.
