We determine the curvature of the (pseudo)critical line of QCD with $n_f$=2+1
staggered fermions at nonzero temperature and quark density, by analytic
continuation from imaginary chemical potentials. Monte Carlo simulations are
performed adopting the HISQ/tree action discretization, as implemented in the
code by the MILC collaboration, suitably modified to include a nonzero
imaginary baryon chemical potential. We work on a line of constant physics, as
determined in Ref.\cite{Bazavov:2011nk}, adjusting the couplings so as to keep
the strange quark mass $m_s$ fixed at its physical value, with a light to
strange mass ratio $m_l/m_s=1/20$. In the present investigation we set the
chemical potential at the same value for the three quark species,
$\mu_l=\mu_s\equiv \mu$. We explore lattices of different spatial extensions,
$16^3\times 6$ and $24^3\times 6$, to check for finite size effects, and
present results on a $32^3 \times 8$ lattice, to check for finite cut-off
effects. We discuss our results for the curvature $\kappa$ of the critical line
at $\mu = 0$, which indicate $\kappa=0.018(4)$, and compare them with previous
lattice determinations by alternative methods and with experimental
determinations of the freeze-out curve.
