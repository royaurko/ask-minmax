A graph G is Ramsey for H if every two-colouring of the edges of G contains a
monochromatic copy of H. Two graphs H and H' are Ramsey-equivalent if every
graph G is Ramsey for H if and only if it is Ramsey for H'. In this paper, we
study the problem of determining which graphs are Ramsey-equivalent to the
complete graph K_k. A famous theorem of Nesetril and Rodl implies that any
graph H which is Ramsey-equivalent to K_k must contain K_k. We prove that the
only connected graph which is Ramsey-equivalent to K_k is itself. This gives a
negative answer to the question of Szabo, Zumstein, and Zurcher on whether K_k
is Ramsey-equivalent to K_k.K_2, the graph on k+1 vertices consisting of K_k
with a pendent edge.
  In fact, we prove a stronger result. A graph G is Ramsey minimal for a graph
H if it is Ramsey for H but no proper subgraph of G is Ramsey for H. Let s(H)
be the smallest minimum degree over all Ramsey minimal graphs for H. The study
of s(H) was introduced by Burr, Erdos, and Lovasz, where they show that
s(K_k)=(k-1)^2. We prove that s(K_k.K_2)=k-1, and hence K_k and K_k.K_2 are not
Ramsey-equivalent.
  We also address the question of which non-connected graphs are
Ramsey-equivalent to K_k. Let f(k,t) be the maximum f such that the graph
H=K_k+fK_t, consisting of K_k and f disjoint copies of K_t, is
Ramsey-equivalent to K_k. Szabo, Zumstein, and Zurcher gave a lower bound on
f(k,t). We prove an upper bound on f(k,t) which is roughly within a factor 2 of
the lower bound.
