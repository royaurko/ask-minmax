In this paper we extend the HKLL holographic smearing function method to
reconstruct (quasi)local AdS bulk scalar observables in the background of a
large AdS black hole formed by null shell collapse (a "pure state" black hole),
from the dual CFT which is undergoing a sudden quench. In particular, we probe
the near horizon and sub-horizon bulk locality. First we construct local bulk
operators from the CFT in the leading semiclassical limit,
$N\rightarrow\infty$. Then we look at effects due to the finiteness of $N$,
where we propose a suitable coarse-graining prescription involving early and
late time cut-offs to define semiclassical bulk observables which are
approximately local; their departure from locality being non-perturbatively
small in $N$. Our results have important implications on the black hole
information problem.
