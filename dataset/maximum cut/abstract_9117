The derivation of the maximum entropy distribution of particles in boxes
yields two kinds of distributions: a "bell-like" distribution and a long-tail
distribution. The first one is obtained when the ratio between particles and
boxes is low, and the second one - when the ratio is high. The obtained long
tail distribution yields correctly the empirical Zipf law, Pareto's 20:80 rule
and Benford's law. Therefore, it is concluded that the long tail and the
"bell-like" distributions are outcomes of the tendency of statistical systems
to maximize entropy.
