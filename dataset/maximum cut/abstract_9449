The application of the Markov chain to modeling agricultural succession is
well known. In most cases, the main problem is the inference of the model, i.e.
the estimation of the transition matrix. In this work we present methods to
estimate the transition matrix from historical observations. In addition to the
estimator of maximum likelihood (MLE), we also consider the Bayes estimator
associated with the Jeffreys prior. This Bayes estimator will be approximated
by a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We also propose a method based on
the sojourn time to test the adequation of Markov chain model to the dataset.
