The one-- and two-- particle densities of up to four interacting electrons
with spin, confined within a quasi one--dimensional ``quantum dot'' are
calculated by numerical diagonalization. The transition from a dense
homogeneous charge distribution to a dilute localized Wigner--type electron
arrangement is investigated. The influence of the long range part of the
Coulomb interaction is studied. When the interaction is exponentially cut off
the ``crystallized'' Wigner molecule is destroyed in favor of an inhomogeneous
charge distribution similar to a charge density wave .
