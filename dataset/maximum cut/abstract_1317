The non-radiative scattering amplitudes for electron-positron annihilation
into quark and lepton pairs in the TeV energy range are calculated in the
double-logarithmic approximation. The expressions for the amplitudes are
obtained using infrared evolution equations with different cut-offs for virtual
photons and for W and Z bosons, and compared with previous results obtained
with an universal cut-off.
