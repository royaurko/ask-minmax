A sample of nine bright Seyfert 1 and NELG type galaxies, observed with
BeppoSAX, is analyzed to assess on a truly broad band basis (0.1-200 keV) the
issue of the spectral contributions of Compton reflection and iron line
fluorescence from circumnuclear gas. The empirical description adopted for the
direct continuum is the commonly used power law with an exponential cut-off.
The most direct test of the theoretical predictions, namely that the equivalent
width of the line, Walpha, and the strength R of the reflection relative to the
direct continuum are closely related to each other, gives a substantially
positive result, that is their mean ratio is very close to expectation, and
only a modest spread in the iron abundance seems implied. The existence of a
steep correlation between R and the slope Gamma of the power law is not
confirmed. A weak evidence is found that the existence of a very shallow trend
to increase on average with Gamma cannot be altogether excluded in both R and
Walpha, but needs to be tested with a larger sample. The energy Ef in the
exponential cut-off spans a range from about 80 to more than 300 keV. A
possible correlation is found, with Ef increasing on average with Gamma: if
ignored, for instance by keeping Ef at a fixed value in a sample study, it
could be cause of artificial steepening in a correlation between R and Gamma.
