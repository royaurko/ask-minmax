Biodiversity is essential to the viability of ecological systems. Species
diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic, non-hierarchical interactions
among competing populations. Such non-transitive relations lead to an evolution
with central features represented by the `rock-paper-scissors' game, where rock
crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with
spatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in
the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of
biodiversity. However, population mobility is a central feature of real
ecosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a
critical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a
certain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this
critical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling
spiral waves forms in the course of temporal evolution. We establish that this
phenomenon is robust, it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition
or spatial environment. These findings have important implications for
maintenance and evolution of ecological systems and are relevant for the
formation and propagation of patterns in excitable media, such as chemical
kinetics or epidemic outbreaks.
