Earlier work by Diaconis and Saloff-Coste gives a spectral criterion for a
maximum separation cutoff to occur for birth and death chains. Ding, Lubetzky
and Peres gave a related criterion for a maximum total variation cutoff to
occur in the same setting. Here, we provide complementary results which allow
us to compute the cutoff times and windows in a variety of examples.
