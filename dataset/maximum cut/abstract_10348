Magneto-resistive and magneto-caloric properties of polycrystalline
Pr2/3Sr1/3MnO3 have been studied as a function of sintering temperature (Ts)
between 1260-1450{\deg}C. Reitveld refinement of their X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns confirms their single phase crystalline structure with orthorhombic
Pbnm space group. The point of maximum value of temperature coefficient of
resistance (TCRmax) and Curie temperature (Tc) decreased slightly with Ts.
Magneto-resistance (MR) and magnetic entropy ({\Delta}SM) increased markedly
with sintering temperature. This could be attributed to the observed sharpness
of both the magnetic and resistive transitions due to better grain
connectivity. Optimum results are obtained for the sample with Ts =
1400{\deg}C. MR at Tc of the same is found to be as large as 32% at 1T and 58%
at 5T magnetic fields. The maximum entropy change ({\Delta}SMmax) near its Tc
is 2.3Jkg-1K-1 and 7.8 Jkg-1K-1 upon 1T and 5T fields change respectively.
These characteristics [MR (32% 1T, 58% 5T) and reasonable change in magnetic
entropy (7.8Jkg-1K-1, 5T)] generate possibility that the optimized compound can
be used as a potential magnetic refrigerant close to room temperature.
