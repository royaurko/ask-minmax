A breakdown of the Local Lorentz Invariance and hence the special theory of
relativity in the Kaon system can, in principle, induce oscillations between
the $K^0$ and $\bar{K}^0$ states. We construct a general formulation in which
simultaneous pairwise diagonalization of mass, momentum and weak eigenstates is
not assumed and the maximum attainable speeds of the momentum eigenstates are
different. This mechanism permits Local Lorentz Invariance violation in a
manner that may or may not violate CPT. In the $CPT-$conserving case, we show
that violation of special relativity could be clearly tested experimentally via
the energy dependence of the $K_L-K_S$ mass difference and we discuss
constraints imposed by present experiments. In the CPT-violating case the
$K^0$--$\bar{K}^0$ system also allows the possiblity of testing different
Lorentz properties of matter and antimatter.
