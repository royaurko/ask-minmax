We find good dynamical compactifications for arbitrary polynomial mappings of
C^2 and use them to show that the degree growth sequence satisfies a linear
integral recursion formula. For maps of low topological degree we prove that
the Green function is well behaved. For maps of maximum topological degree, we
give normal forms.
