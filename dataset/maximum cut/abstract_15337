The effect of substituting Rh in CeRh1-xPdxIn5 with Pd up to x = 0.25 has
been studied on single crystals. The crystals have been grown by means of the
In self-flux method and characterized by x-ray diffraction and microprobe. The
tetragonal HoCoGa5-type of structure and the c/a ratio of the parent compound
remains intact by the Pd substitution; the unit cell volume increases by 0.6 %
with x = 0.25 of Pd. The low-temperature behavior of resistivity was studied
also under hydrostatic pressure up to 2.25 GPa. The Pd substitution for Rh
affects the magnetic behavior and the maximum value of the superconducting
transition temperature measured at pressures above 2 GPa only negligibly. On
the other hand, the results provide evidence that superconductivity in
CeRh0.75Pd0.25In5 is induced at significantly lower pressures, i.e. the Pd
substitution for Rh shifts the CeRh1-xPdxIn5 system closer to coexistence of
magnetism and superconductivity at ambient pressure.
