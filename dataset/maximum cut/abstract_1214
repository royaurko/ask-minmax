The amount of dark matter in the four galactic dwarf spheroidals with large
mass-to-light ratios is investigated. Sextans has a cut-off radius which is
equal to the expected tidal radius, assuming a high mass-to-light ratio. This
satellite very likely is dark matter dominated. Carina, Ursa Minor and Draco,
on the other hand, cannot contain a dominating dark matter component if the
observed 'extra-tidal' stars are located exterior to the tidal radii of these
systems. The evidence for tidal stripping in the absence of dark matter is also
supported by the fact that the observed cut-off radii of all three satellites
are equal to their tidal radii, assuming a low, globular cluster like
mass-to-light ratio. The large velocity dispersions of these galaxies, on the
other hand, seem to provide strong evidence for a massive dark matter
component. In this case, the 'extra-tidal' stars lie deeply embedded in the
dark matter potential wells of the satellites. These stars then would represent
a gravitationally bound, extended stellar component with unknown origin.
