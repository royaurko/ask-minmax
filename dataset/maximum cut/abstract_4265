We extend our recent analysis of the dilepton and photon emission rates to
the case of finite temperature and baryon density, within the context of a
density expansion. To leading order, the effects of the baryon density are
assessed using data (photon emission) or constraints from broken chiral
symmetry (dilepton emission). Next to leading order effects are worked out, and
their contribution qualitatively assessed. The opening of the $\pi N$ cut
causes the photon rate to saturate the empirical photon yield of WA80, but may
not be enough to fully account for the excess low mass dileptons seen at CERES.
