We study CP-violating phenomena in the production, mixing and decay of a
coupled system of CP-violating neutral Higgs bosons at \gamma \gamma colliders,
assuming a Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) Higgs sector in which
CP violation is radiatively induced by phases in the soft
supersymmetry-breaking gaugino masses and third-generation trilinear squark
couplings. We discuss CP asymmetries in the production and decays of \mu^+
\mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, {\bar b} b and {\bar t} t pairs. We find large
asymmetries when two (or all three) neutral Higgs bosons are nearly degenerate
with mass differences comparable to their decay widths, as happens naturally in
the CP-violating MSSM for values of \tan\beta >~ 5(30) and large (small)
charged Higgs-boson masses.
