We report on numerical simulations of one dimensional maximally
supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, by using the lattice action with two
exact supercharges. Based on the gauge/gravity duality, the gauge theory
corresponds to N D0-branes system in type IIA superstring theory at finite
temperature. We aim to verify the gauge/gravity duality numerically by
comparing our results of the gauge side with analytic solutions of the gravity
side. First of all, by examining the supersymmetric Ward-Takahashi relation, we
show that supersymmetry breaking effects from the cut-off vanish in the
continuum limit and our lattice theory has the desired continuum limit. Then,
we find that, at low temperature, the black hole internal energy obtained from
our data is close to the analytic solution of the gravity side. It suggests the
validity of the duality.
