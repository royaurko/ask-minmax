The initial-state radiative events in electron-positron annihilation into
hadrons at DAFNE have been considered. The coresponding cross-section with the
full first order radiative correction has been calculated. The analytical
calculations take into account the realistic angular acceptance and energy cut
of DAFNE photon detector.
