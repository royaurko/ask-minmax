LaAlO3-Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 (LAO-BST) thin films, with different LAO contents, were
deposited on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si and (100) LaAlO3 substrate, via a pulsed laser
deposition (PLD). Phase composition and microstructure of the LAO-BST thin
films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). The LAO-BST thin films were solid solution of LAO nd BST,
with lattice constant decreasing with increasing LAO content. The composition
of (LAO)x(BST)1-x, estimated from the lattice constant of the thin films
derived from the targets of 1/6, 2/6 and 3/6 LAO, was 0.143, 0.278, 0.476,
respectively. The grain size of the thin films decreased as a result of the
incorporation of LAO into BST. Dielectric properties of the LAO-BST thin films
on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si were measured at low frequency (100 kHz), while those on
LaAlO3 substrate were characterized at high frequency (~7.9 GHz). The
dielectric constants of the film derived from pure BST target and those from
the targets with 1/6, 2/6 and 3/6 area ratio of LAO, on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si
substrate, were 772, 514, 395 and 282, with a dielectric loss of 0.096, 0.023,
0.024 and 0.025, and a dielectric tunability of 65%, 53%, 43% and 14%,
respectively. The dielectric constant of the LAO-BST films on LaAlO3 substrate
were 2436, 2148, 2018, 1805, with a maximum dielectric tunability of 11%, 13%,
10% and 8% at a maximum applied voltage of 2.4 kV (~9.2 kV/cm).
