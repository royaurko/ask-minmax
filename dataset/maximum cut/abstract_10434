Excitation functions were measured by stacked-foil activation technique for
the $^{150}$Nd(p, xpyn) reaction using 97.65$%$ enriched $^{150}$Nd target.
Measurement up to $\sim$50$%$ above barrier and down to 18$%$ below the barrier
was performed using proton beam energy (E$_p$) of 7 - 15 MeV from VECC
Cyclotron. The yield of suitable $\gamma$ rays emitted following the decay of
relevant evaporation residues was determined using a 50$%$ High Purity
Germanium (HPGe) detector.(p,n) cross section was found to follow the expected
trend with a maximum value of 63.7(4.9)mb at E$_p$ $\sim$ 8.6 MeV. (p,2n) cross
section gradually increased with E$_p$ and had maximum contribution to the
total reaction cross section after E$_p$ $\sim$ 9.0 MeV. (p, p$^{\prime}$n)
reaction channel also showed a reasonable yield with a threshold of E$_p$
$\sim$ 12.0 MeV. The experimental data were corroborated with statistical model
calculations using different codes, viz., CASCADE, ALICE/91 and EMPIRE3.1. All
the calculations using a suitable set of global parameters could reproduce the
excitation function fairly well in the present energy range.
