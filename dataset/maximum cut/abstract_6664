By doping Rh to the Fe sites in SrFe2As2, superconductivity is induced when
the antiferromagnetic (AF) order is suppressed. The maximum superconducting
transition temperature was found at about 22 K with the doping level of x =
0.25. It is found that the resistivity anomaly associating with the AF order
reveals a sharp drop for the parent phase and the samples with low doping (x =
0.05), while it evolves into an uprising at a higher doping level (x = 0.1). A
general phase diagram is depicted which exhibits the similarity with that of Co
doping. Regarding the close maximum superconducting transition temperatures in
doping Co, Rh and Ir, we argue that the superconductivity is intimately related
to the suppression of the AF order, rather than the electron-phonon coupling.
