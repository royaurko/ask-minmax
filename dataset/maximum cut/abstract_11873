The Harris-Aharony criterion for a statistical model predicts, that if a
specific heat exponent $\alpha \ge 0$, then this model does not exhibit
self-averaging. In two-dimensional percolation model the index $\alpha=-{1/2}$.
It means that, in accordance with the Harris-Aharony criterion, the model can
exhibit self-averaging properties. We study numerically the relative variances
$R_{M}$ and $R_{\chi}$ for the probability $M$ of a site belongin to the
"infinite" (maximum) cluster and the mean finite cluster size $\chi$. It was
shown, that two-dimensional site-bound percolation on the square lattice, where
the bonds play the role of impurity and the sites play the role of the
statistical ensemble, over which the averaging is performed, exhibits
self-averaging properties.
