In this work, an analytical model to calculate the channel potential and
current-voltage characteristics in a Symmetric tunneling
Field-Effect-Transistor (SymFET) is presented. The current in a SymFET flows by
tunneling from an n-type graphene layer to a p-type graphene layer. A large
current peak occurs when the Dirac points are aligned at a particular drain-to-
source bias VDS . Our model shows that the current of the SymFET is very weakly
dependent on temperature. The resonant current peak is controlled by chemical
doping and applied gate bias. The on/off ratio increases with graphene
coherence length and doping. The symmetric resonant peak is a good candidate
for high-speed analog applications, and can enable digital logic similar to the
BiSFET. Our analytical model also offers the benefit of permitting simple
analysis of features such as the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the
resonant peak and higher order harmonics of the nonlinear current. The SymFET
takes advantage of the perfect symmetry of the bandstructure of 2D graphene, a
feature that is not present in conventional semiconductors.
