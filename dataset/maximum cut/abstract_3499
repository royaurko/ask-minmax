Observing a load process above high thresholds, modeling it as a pulse
process with random occurrence times and magnitudes, and extrapolating
life-time maximum or design loads from the data is a common task in structural
reliability analyses. In this paper, we consider a stationary live load
sequence that arrive according to a dependent point process and allow for a
weakened mixing-type dependence in the load pulse magnitudes that
asymptotically decreases to zero with increasing separation in the sequence.
Inclusion of dependence in the model eliminates the unnecessary conservatism
introduced by the i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) assumption
often made in determining maximum live load distribution. The scale of
fluctuation of the loading process is used to identify clusters of exceedances
above high thresholds which in turn is used to estimate the extremal index of
the process. A Bayesian updating of the empirical distribution function,
derived from the distribution of order statistics in a dependent stationary
series, is performed. The pulse arrival instants are modeled as a Cox process
goverened by a stationary lognormal intensity. An illustrative example utilizes
in-service peak strain data from ambient traffic collected on a high volume
highway bridge, and analyzes the asymptotic behavior of the maximum load.
