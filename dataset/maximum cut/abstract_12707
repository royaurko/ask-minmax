We propose a new type of waveguide optical amplifier. The device consists of
collinearly propagating pump and amplified Stokes beams with periodic imaging
of the Stokes beam due to the Talbot effect. The application of this device as
an Image preamplifier for Mid Wave Infrared (MWIR) remote sensing is discussed
and its performance is described. Silicon is the preferred material for this
application in MWIR due to its excellent transmission properties, high thermal
conductivity, high damage threshold and the mature fabrication technology. In
these devices, the Raman amplification process also includes four-wave-mixing
between various spatial modes of pump and Stokes signals. This phenomenon is
unique to nonlinear interactions in multimode waveguides and places a limit on
the maximum achievable gain, beyond which the image begins to distort. Another
source of image distortion is the preferential amplification of Stokes modes
that have the highest overlap with the pump. These effects introduce a tradeoff
between the gain and image quality. We show that a possible solution to this
trade-off is to restrict the pump into a single higher order waveguide mode.
