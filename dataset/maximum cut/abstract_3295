For latent class models where the class weights depend on individual
covariates, we derive a simple expression for computing the score vector and a
convenient hybrid between the observed and the expected information matrices
which is always positive defnite. These ingredients, combined with a
maximization algorithm based on line search, provides an efficient tool for
maximum likelihood estimation. In particular, the proposed algorithm is such
that the log-likelihood never decreases from one step to the next and the
choice of starting values is not crucial for reaching a local maximum. We show
how the same algorithm may be used for numerical investigation of the effect of
model mispecifications. An application to education transmission is used as an
illustration.
