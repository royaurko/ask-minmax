We discuss the problem of unitarity for Yang-Mills theory in the Landau gauge
with a mass term a la Stueckelberg. We assume that the theory
(non-renormalizable) makes sense in some subtraction scheme (in particular the
Slavnov-Taylor identities should be respected!) and we devote the paper to the
study of the space of the unphysical modes. We find that the theory is unitary
only under the hypothesis that the 1-PI two-point function of the vector mesons
has no poles (at p^2=0). This normalization condition might be rather crucial
in the very definition of the theory. With all these provisos the theory is
unitary. The proof of unitarity is given both in a form that allows a direct
transcription in terms of Feynman amplitudes (cutting rules) and in the
operatorial form. The same arguments and conclusions apply verbatim to the case
of non-abelian gauge theories where the mass of the vector meson is generated
via Higgs mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, there is no mention in the
literature on the necessary condition implied by physical unitarity.
