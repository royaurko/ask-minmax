Let \cal A be a family of subsets of an n-set such that \cal A does not
contain distinct sets A and B with |A\B| = 2|B\A|. How large can \cal A be? Our
aim in this note is to determine the maximum size of such an \cal A. This
answers a question of Kalai. We also give some related results and conjectures.
