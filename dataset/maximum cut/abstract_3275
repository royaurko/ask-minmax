We investigate the nonlocality of Schmidt-correlated (SC) states, and present
analytical expressions of the maximum violation value of Bell inequalities. It
is shown that the violation of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality is
necessary and sufficient for the nonlocality of two-qubit SC states, whereas
the violation of the Svetlichny inequality is only a sufficient condition for
the genuine nonlocality of three-qubit SC states. Furthermore, the relations
among the maximum violation values, concurrence and relative entropy
entanglement are discussed.
