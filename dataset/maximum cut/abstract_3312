We are interested in the problem of robust parametric estimation of a density
from i.i.d observations. By using a practice-oriented procedure based on robust
tests, we build an estimator for which we establish non-asymptotic risk bounds
with respect to the Hellinger distance under mild assumptions on the parametric
model. We prove that the estimator is robust even for models for which the
maximum likelihood method is bound to fail. We also evaluate the performance of
the estimator by carrying out numerical simulations for which we observe that
the estimator is very close to the maximum likelihood one when the model is
regular enough and contains the true underlying density.
