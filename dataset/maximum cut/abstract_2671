We discuss exclusive central production of Higgs boson, quark-antiquark and
digluon dijets. Several differential distributions are shown and disussed.
Irreducible leading-order $b \bar b $ background to Higgs production is
calculated in several kinematical variables. The signal-to-background ratio is
shown and several improvements are suggested by imposing cuts on $b$ ($\bar b$)
transverse momenta and rapidities. \
