AFM-based technique of nanolithography is proposed. The method enables rapid
point by point indentation with a sharp tip. When used in tandem with
single-crystal diamond tips, this technique allows the creation of high aspect
ratio grooves in hard materials, such as silicon or metals. Examples of
fabricated groove arrays on Si surface with 30-100 nm pitches and 5-32 nm
depths are presented. Cutting of a 63nm thick metal magnetic film demonstrated.
The resulting structure is studied by use of magnetic force microscopy.
