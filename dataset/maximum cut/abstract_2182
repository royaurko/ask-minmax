We investigated the effect of the light fermion masses on cross sections for
e^+e^- into 4 fermions in the Fermion Loop scheme defined in hep-ph/9612260,
and approximations to it. The effects are found to be very small, except of
course in the collinear region of single W-boson production where the electron
mass acts as the cut-off.
