We present results on the renormalization functions of the quark field and
fermion bilinears with up to one covariant derivative. For the fermion part of
the action we employ the twisted mass formulation with $N_f{=}2$ and $N_f{=}4$
degenerate dynamical quarks, while in the gluon sector we use the Iwasaki
improved action. The simulations for $N_f{=}4$ have been performed for pion
masses in the range of 390MeV - 760MeV and at three values of the lattice
spacing, $a$, corresponding to $\beta{=}1.90,\,1.95,\,2.10$. The $N_f{=}2$
action includes a clover term with $c_{\rm sw}{=}1.57551$ at $\beta{=}2.10$,
and three ensembles at different values of $m_\pi$.
  The evaluation of the renormalization functions is carried out in the RI$'$
scheme using a momentum source. The non-perturbartive evaluation is
complemented with a perturbative computation, which is carried out at one-loop
level and to all orders in the lattice spacing, $a$. For each renormalization
function computed non-perturbatively we subtract the corresponding lattice
artifacts to all orders in $a$, so that a large part of the cut-off effects is
eliminated.
  The renormalization functions are converted to the ${\overline{\rm MS}}$
scheme at a reference energy scale of $\mu{=}2$ GeV after taking the chiral
limit.
