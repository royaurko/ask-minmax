The spin and charge structure factors are calculated for the Hubbard model on
the square lattice near half-filling using a spin-rotation invariant six-slave
boson representation. The charge structure factor shows a broad maximum at the
zone corner and is found to decrease monotonically with increasing interaction
strength and electron density and increasing temperature. The spin structure
factor develops with increasing interaction two incommensurate peaks at the
zone boundary and along the zone diagonal. Comparison with results of Quantum
Monte Carlo and variational calculations is carried out and the agreement is
found to be good. The limitations of an RPA-type approach are pointed out.
