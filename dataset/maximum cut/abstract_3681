For each odd prime p, and for each non-split link admitting non-trivial
p-colorings, we prove that the maximum number of Fox colors is p. We also prove
that we can assemble a non-trivial p-coloring with any number of colors, from
the minimum to the maximum number of colors. Furthermore, for any rational
link, we prove that there exists a non-trivial coloring of any Schubert Normal
Form of it, modulo its determinant, which uses all colors available. If this
determinant is an odd prime, then any non-trivial coloring of this Schubert
Normal Form, modulo the determinant, uses all available colors. We prove also
that the number of crossings in the Schubert Normal Form equals twice the
determinant of the link minus 2. Facts about torus links and their coloring
abilities are also proved.
