A numerical simulation of evolution of an identical interacting streamers
array in semiconductors has been performed using the diffusion-drift
approximation and taking into account the impact and tunnel ionization. It has
been assumed that the external electric field Eo is static and uniform, the
background electrons and holes are absent, the initial avalanches start
simultaneously from the nodes of the plane hexagonal lattice, which is
perpendicular to the external field, however the avalanches and streamers are
axially symmetric within a cylinder of radius R. It has been shown that under
certain conditions, the interaction between the streamers leads finally either
to the formation of two types of stationary ionization waves with corrugated
front or to a stationary plane ionization wave. A diagram of different steady
states of this type waves in the plane of parameter [Eo,R] has been presented
and a qualitative explanation of the plane partition into four different
regions has been given. Characteristics of corrugated waves have been studied
in detail and discussed in the region of R and Eo large values, in which the
maximum field strength at the front is large enough for the tunnel ionization
implementation. It has been shown that corrugated waves ionize semiconductor
more efficiently than flat ones, especially in relatively weak external fields.
