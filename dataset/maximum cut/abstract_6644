Let X\subset PP^n be a projective scheme over a field, and let phi:X --> Y be
a finite morphism. Our main result is a formula in terms of global data for the
maximum of the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the fibers of \phi, considered
as subschemes of \PP^n.
  From an algebraic point of view, our formula is related to the theorem of
Cutkosky-Herzog-Trung and Kodiyalam showing that for any homogeneous ideal I in
a standard graded algebra S, the regularity of I^t can be written as
dt+\epsilon for some non-negative integers d, \epsilon, and all large t. In the
special case where I contains a power of S_+ and is generated by forms of a
single degree, our formula gives an interpretation of \epsilon: it is one less
than the maximum regularity of a fiber of the morphism associated to I.
  These formulas have strong consequences for ideals generated by generic
forms.
