We present time-series data on Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs) 17P/Holmes,
47P/Ashbrook-Jackson and 137P/Shoemaker-Levy 2. In addition we also present
results from `snap-shot' observations of comets 43P/Wolf-Harrington,
44P/Reinmuth 2, 103P/Hartley 2 and 104P/Kowal 2 taken during the same run. The
comets were at heliocentric distances of between 3 and 7 AU at this time. We
present measurements of size and activity levels for the snap-shot targets. The
time-series data allow us to constrain rotation periods and shapes, and thus
bulk densities. We also measure colour indices (V-R) and (R-I) and reliable
radii for these comets. We compare all of our findings to date with similar
results for other comets and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). We find that the
rotational properties of nuclei and KBOs are very similar, that there is
evidence for a cut-off in bulk densities at ~ 0.6 g cm^{-3} in both
populations, and the colours of the two populations show similar correlations.
For JFCs there is no observational evidence for the optical colours being
dependant on either position in the orbit or on orbital parameters.
