A type of tunable plasmonic lens with nanoslits is proposed for subwavelength
imaging in the far field at different wavelengths. The nanoslits array in the
plasmonic lens, which have constant depths but varying widths, could generate
desired optical phase retardations based on the particular propagation property
of the Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) in the metal-dielectric-metal (MDM)
slit waveguides. We theoretically and numerically demonstrate the tunability of
a single plasmonic lens for subwavelength imaging (full width at half maximum,
0.37 ~0.47) by adjusting the surrounding dielectric fluid, thereby realizing
the compact in-plane tunable plasmonic lens. This work provides a novel
approach for developing integrative tunable plasmonic lens for a variety of
lab-on-chip applications.
