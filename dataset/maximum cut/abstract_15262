Contractive interference functions introduced by Feyzmahdavian et al. is the
newest approach in the analysis and design of distributed power control laws.
This approach can be extended to several cases of distributed power control.
One of the distributed power control scenarios wherein the contractive
interference functions have not been employed is the power control in MIMO
systems. In this paper, this scenario will be analyzed. In addition, the
optimal linear precoder is employed in each user to achieve maximum
point-to-point information rate. In our approach, we use the same amount of
signaling as the previous methods did. However, we show that the uniqueness of
Nash equilibria is more probable in our approach, suggesting that our proposed
method improves the convergence performance of distributed power control in
MIMO systems. We also show that the proposed power control algorithm can be
implemented asynchronously, which gives a noticeable flexibility to our
algorithm given the practical communication limitations.
