We discuss the possible existence of a spin singlet, charge $\pm2$ resonance
($\psi$-mode) in cuprate superconductors, associated to the SU(2) symmetry
relating the $d$-wave superconducting singlet pairing channel to $d$-wave
charge channel. We show that the $\psi$ boson forms a bonding state below the
$2\Delta$ threshold of the particle-hole continuum where $\Delta$ is the
maximum $d$-wave gap. Within a generalized random phase approximation and
ladder approximation study, we find that this mode has energies similar to the
resonance observed by Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) below the
superconducting (SC) coherent peak at $2\Delta$ in various SC cuprates
compounds. We show that it is a very good candidate for the resonance observed
in Raman scattering below the $2\Delta$ peak in the $A_{1g}$ symmetry. The
SU(2) $\psi$-boson sitting in the $S=0$ channel, it may be observable via
Raman, X -ray or Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy probes.
