A suppression of superconductivity in the late rare earth RFeAsO1-xFx
materials is reported. The maximum critical temperature (Tc) decreases from 51
K for R = Tb to 36 K for HoFeAsO0.9F0.1, which has been synthesised under 10
GPa pressure. This suppression is driven by a decrease in the Fe-As-Fe angle
below an optimimum value of 110.6 degrees, as the angle decreases linearly with
unit cell volume (V) across the RFeAsO1-xFx series. A crossover in electronic
structure around this optimum geometry is evidenced by a change in sign of the
compositional dTc/dV, from negative values for previously reported large R
materials to positive for HoFeAsO0.9F0.1.
