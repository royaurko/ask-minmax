This paper is devoted to the study of the sign of the Green's function
related to a general linear $n^{\rm th}$-order operator, depending on a real
parameter, $T_n[M]$, coupled with the $(k,n-k)$ boundary value conditions.
  If operator $T_n[\bar M]$ is disconjugate for a given $\bar M$, we describe
the interval of values on the real parameter $M$ for which the Green's function
has constant sign.
  One of the extremes of the interval is given by the first eigenvalue of
operator $T_n[\bar M]$ satisfying $(k,n-k)$ conditions.
  The other extreme is related to the minimum (maximum) of the first
eigenvalues of $(k-1,n-k+1)$ and $(k+1,n-k-1)$ problems.
  Moreover if $n-k$ is even (odd) the Green's function cannot be non-positive
(non-negative).
  To illustrate the applicability of the obtained results, we calculate the
parameter intervals of constant sign Green's functions for particular
operators. Our method avoids the necessity of calculating the expression of the
Green's function.
  We finalize the paper by presenting a particular equation in which it is
shown that the disconjugation hypothesis on operator $T_n[\bar M]$ for a given
$\bar M$ cannot be eliminated.
