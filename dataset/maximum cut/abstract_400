This paper proposes a cake-cutting protocol using cryptography when the cake
is a heterogeneous good that is represented by an interval on a real line.
Although the Dubins-Spanier moving-knife protocol with one knife achieves
simple fairness, all players must execute the protocol synchronously. Thus, the
protocol cannot be executed on asynchronous networks such as the Internet. We
show that the moving-knife protocol can be executed asynchronously by a
discrete protocol using a secure auction protocol. The number of cuts is n-1
where n is the number of players, which is the minimum.
