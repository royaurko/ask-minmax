We have observed depolarization effects when high intensity cold neutron
beams are incident on alkali-metal-spin-exchange polarized He-3 cells used as
neutron spin filters. This was first observed as a reduction of the maximum
attainable He-3 polarization and was attributed to a decrease of alkali-metal
polarization, which led us to directly measure alkali-metal polarization and
spin relaxation over a range of neutron fluxes at LANSCE and ILL. The data
reveal a new alkali-metal spin-relaxation mechanism that approximately scales
as the square root of the neutron capture-flux density incident on the cell.
This is consistent with an effect proportional to the recombination-limited ion
concentration, but is much larger than expected from earlier work.
