Plasma based surface modification of niobium is a promising alternative to
wet etching of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. The development
of the technology based on Cl2/Ar plasma etching has to address several crucial
parameters which influence the etching rate and surface roughness, and
eventually, determine cavity performance. This includes dependence of the
process on the frequency of the RF generator, gas pressure, power level, the
driven (inner) electrode configuration, and the chlorine concentration in the
gas mixture during plasma processing. To demonstrate surface layer removal in
the asymmetric non-planar geometry, we are using a simple cylindrical cavity
with 8 ports symmetrically distributed over the cylinder. The ports are used
for diagnosing the plasma parameters and as holders for the samples to be
etched. The etching rate is highly correlated with the shape of the inner
electrode, radio-frequency (RF) circuit elements, chlorine concentration in the
Cl2/Ar gas mixtures, residence time of reactive species and temperature of the
cavity. Using cylindrical electrodes with variable radius, large-surface
ring-shaped samples and d.c. bias implementation in the external circuit we
have demonstrated substantial average etching rates and outlined the
possibility to optimize plasma properties with respect to maximum surface
processing effect.
