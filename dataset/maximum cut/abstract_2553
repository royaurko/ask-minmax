A well-known result of liquid state theory is that the structure of dense
fluids is mainly determined by repulsive forces. The WCA potential, which cuts
intermolecular potentials at their minima, is therefore often used as a
reference. However, this reference gives quite wrong results for the viscous
dynamics of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones liquid [Berthier and Tarjus,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 170601 (2009)]. We show that repulsive inverse-power law
potentials provide a useful reference for this liquid by reproducing its
structure, dynamics, and isochoric heat capacity.
