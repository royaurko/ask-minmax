We present here the computer model of the distribution of the luminosity,
produced by old isolated neutron stars (OINSs) accreting from the interstellar
medium (ISM). We show, that for different mean velocities of OINSs the
distribution of the luminosity has a torus-like structure, with the maximum at
$\approx 5 kpc$.
