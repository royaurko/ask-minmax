We propose a new scheme to express the uncertainty principle in form of
inequality of the bipartite correlation functions for a given multipartite
state, which provides an experimentally feasible and model-independent way to
verify various uncertainty and measurement disturbance relations. By virtue of
this scheme the implementation of experimental measurement on the measurement
disturbance relation to a variety of physical systems becomes practical. The
inequality in turn also imposes a constraint on the strength of correlation,
i.e. it determines the maximum value of the correlation function for two-body
system and a monogamy relation of the bipartite correlation functions for
multipartite system.
