This paper investigates the performance of wireless systems that employ
finite-blocklength channel codes for transmission and operate under queueing
constraints in the form of limitations on buffer overflow probabilities. A
block fading model, in which fading stays constant in each coherence block and
change independently between blocks, is considered. It is assumed that channel
coding is performed over multiple coherence blocks. An approximate lower bound
on the transmission rate is obtained from Feintein's Lemma. This lower bound is
considered as the service rate and is incorporated into the effective capacity
formulation, which characterizes the maximum constant arrival rate that can be
supported under statistical queuing constraints. Performances of variable-rate
and fixed-rate transmissions are studied. The optimum error probability for
variable rate transmission and the optimum coding rate for fixed rate
transmission are shown to be unique. Moreover, the tradeoff between the
throughput and the number of blocks over which channel coding is performed is
identified.
