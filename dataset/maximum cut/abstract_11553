A new analysis of CCD-based BVRI broad-band photometry for the globular
cluster NGC2419 is presented, based on 340 CCD images either donated by
colleagues or retrieved from public archives. The calibrated results have been
made available through my Web site. I compare the results of my analysis with
those of an independent analysis of a subset of these data by Saha et al.
(2005, PASP, 117, 37), who have found a color-dependent discrepancy of up to
0.05 mag between their I-band photometry and mine for stars in this cluster. I
conclude that a major part of the discrepancy appears to be associated with
small (a few hundredths of a second) shutter-timing errors in the MiniMos
camera on the WIYN 3.5-m telescope. Smaller contributions to the anomaly likely
come from (a) a color-scale error with a maximum amplitude of ~ +/-0.02 mag in
my secondary standard list as of September 2004; and (b) statistical effects
arising from the previous study's use of a relatively small number of
standard-star observations to determine a comparatively large number of fitting
parameters in the photometric transformations.
