The Type Ic supernovae are probably "nearly-nude" core collapse events. They
are thus of special interest in terms of their evolutionary origin, but also as
the source of potential clues to the explosion process that may not be obtained
from other supernovae. Study of Type Ic shows that they are distinct from Type
Ia, even those of the dimmer, redder variety. Type Ic also suggest that the
historical classification scheme based on spectra cannot encompass the physical
features of these and closely related events. The Type Ic probably all have a
very small outer layer of helium, but not enough to make them merely a version
of Type Ib. They probably require another evolutionary channel. Similar spectra
near maximum light belie a variety of late-time light curve behavior. Some
events classified as Type Ic, eg SN 1962L, 1983V, 1990B, and 1990U, follow a
relatively slow evolution after maximum light, decaying about 3.0 magnitudes in
V during the first 150 days after maximum. These events seem to belong to a
general category that includes SN 1993J and the Type Ib SN 19983N. Their light
curves decline more rapidly than the expected late-time Co-56 decay with full
trapping, but less rapidly than Type Ia. The late time light curve of these
events seems to be independent of the velocity of the ejecta and hence implies
the trapping of gamma-rays in a manner that is independent of the mass that
participates in the homologous expansion. Other Type Ic, SNe 1983I, 1987M, and
1994I, show steeper decline than even Type Ia.
