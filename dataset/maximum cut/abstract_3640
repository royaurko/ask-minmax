We simulate the central reactions of nearly symmetric, and asymmetric
systems, for the energies at which the maximum production of IMFs occurs
(E$_{c.m.}^{peak}$).This study is carried out by using hard EOS along with
cugnon cross section and employing MSTB method for clusterization. We study the
various properties of fragments. The stability of fragments is checked through
persistence coefficient, gain term and binding energy. The information about
the thermalization and stopping in heavy-ion collisions is obtained via
relative momentum, anisotropy ratio, and rapidity distribution. We find that
for a complete stopping of incoming nuclei very heavy systems are required. The
mass dependence of various quantities (such as average and maximum central
density, collision dynamics as well as the time zone for hot and dense nuclear
matter) is also presented. In all cases (i.e., average and maximum central
density, collision dynamics as well as the time zone for hot and dense nuclear
matter) a power law dependence is obtained.
