The multiple production processes of secondary hadrons in proton-antiproton
scattering are divided into three types. The first type is a shower of
secondary hadrons produced from gluon string decay, the second type is a shower
of secondary hadrons produced from two quark strings decay and the third is a
shower produced from three quark strings decay. At the same time there are only
two types for proton-proton scattering - shower from gluon string and shower
from two quark strings. These showers do not correspond to pomeron showers
originating from cuts of one, two, three, ... pomerons. Multiplicity
distribution in gluon string is Gaussian, in two and three quark strings it is
negative binomial. Gluon string weight in the multiplicity distribution is
determined by the constant contribution to total cross sections, the quark
strings weights - by the growing with energy contributions. The expected value
of proton-proton scattering total cross section and the multiplicity
distribution at energy 14 TeV are given
