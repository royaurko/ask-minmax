We present results on the QCD equation of state, obtained with two different
improved dynamical staggered fermion actions and almost physical quark masses.
Lattice cut-off effect are discussed in detail as results for three different
lattice spacings are available now, i.e. results have been obtained on lattices
with temporal extent of $N_\tau=4,6$ and 8. Furthermore we discuss the Taylor
expansion approach to non-zero baryon chemical potential and present the
isentropic equation of state on lines of constant entropy per baryon number.
