Precision continuous-wave NMR measurements have been carried out over the
entire magnetization curve of EuO and are presented in tabular form. Two very
closely spaced resonances are observed and are attributed to domain and
domain-wall signals. Both of the signals are useful for analysis in the
spin-wave region. Only the domain signal is measurable above ~50K. The latter
is used for fitting Tc and the critical exponent beta. The critical-region fits
agree with previous measurements, within experimental error. The
low-temperature data exhibit a clear-cut T^2 behavior, at variance with the
expectations of conventional spin-wave theory. This result is discussed in
relation to two semi-empirical spin-wave schemes, one formulated by N.
Bykovetz, and one by U. Koebler. The NMR signal at 4.2K gives no indication of
a quadrupole splitting, in contradiction to the interpretation of several
previous spin-echo NMR spectra observed in EuO. This issue remains unresolved.
