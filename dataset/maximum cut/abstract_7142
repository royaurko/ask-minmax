The pattern of the radio emission of air showers is finely sampled with the
Low-Frequency ARray (LOFAR). A set of 382 measured air showers is used to test
a fast, analytic parameterization of the distribution of pulse powers. Using
this parameterization we are able to reconstruct the shower axis and give
estimators for the energy of the air shower as well as the distance to the
shower maximum.
