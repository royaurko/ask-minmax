We derive the ac dielectric loss in glasses due to resonant processes created
by two-level systems and a swept electric field bias. It is shown that at
sufficiently large ac fields and bias sweep rates the nonequilibrium loss
tangent created by the two fields approaches a universal maximum determined by
the bare linear dielectric permittivity. In addition this nonequilibrium loss
tangent is derived for a range of bias sweep rates and ac amplitudes and show
that the loss tangent creates a predicted loss function that can be understood
in a Landau-Zener theory and which can be used to extract the TLS density,
dipole moment, and relaxation rate.
