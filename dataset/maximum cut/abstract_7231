A structure based on a dimer of silicon nanoparticles, presenting directional
scattering in the visible range, was studied as a new design of an all-optical
switch. The combination of spherical nanoparticles satisfying, at the same
incident wavelength, the zero-backward and the minimum-forward scattering
conditions, can produce either a maximum or a minimum of the scattered field in
the area between the nanoparticles. The modulation of the incident wavelength
can be used as switching parameter, due to the sensitivity of these conditions
to it. An optimization of the dimer setup, both in the distance between the
nanoparticles and the incident wavelength, was numerically performed to obtain
a maximum contrast. Also, near-field and far-field distributions of the
electric field have been considered.
