We establish the existence of a fundamental limit to the efficiency of
spin-exchange optical pumping of 3He nuclei by collisions with spin-polarized
alkali-metal atoms. Using accurate ab initio calculations of molecular
interactions and scattering properties, we show that the maximum 3He spin
polarization that can be achieved in spin-exchange collisions with potassium
(39K) and silver (107Ag) atoms is limited by the anisotropic hyperfine
interaction. We find that spin exchange in Ag-He collisions occurs much faster
than in K-He collisions, suggesting the possibility of using Ag in
spin-exchange optical pumping experiments to increase the production rate of
hyperpolarized 3He. Our analysis indicates that measurements of trap loss rates
of 2S atoms in the presence of cold 3He gas may be used to probe anisotropic
spin-exchange interactions in atom-He collisions.
