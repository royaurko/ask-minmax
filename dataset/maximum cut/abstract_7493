The ratios ${\cal R}_{\gamma ,\ell}=B(Z\to\ell^+\ell^-)\cdot\sigma(Z\gamma)
/\allowbreak B(W\to\ell\nu)\cdot\sigma(W^\pm\gamma)$, ${\cal R}_{\gamma , \nu}=
B(Z\to\bar\nu\nu)\cdot\sigma(Z\gamma)/\allowbreak B(W\to\ell\nu)\cdot\sigma(W^
\pm\gamma)$, ${\cal R}_{W\gamma}=\sigma(W^\pm\gamma)/\allowbreak\sigma(W^\pm)$,
and ${\cal R}_{Z\gamma}=\sigma(Z\gamma)/\allowbreak\sigma(Z)$ are studied as
tools to probe the electroweak boson self-interactions. As a function of the
minimum photon transverse momentum, ${\cal R}_{\gamma ,\ell}$ and ${\cal R}_{
\gamma ,\nu}$ are found to directly reflect the radiation zero present in $W^
\pm\gamma$ production in the Standard Model. All four ratios are sensitive to
anomalous $WW\gamma$ and/or $ZZ\gamma/Z\gamma\gamma$ couplings. The sensitivity
of the cross section ratios to the cuts imposed on the final state particles,
as well as the systematic uncertainties resulting from different
parametrizations of parton distribution functions, the choice of the
factorization scale $Q^2$, and from higher order QCD corrections are explored.
Taking into account these uncertainties, sensitivity limits for anomalous three
gauge boson couplings, based on a measurement of the cross section ratios with
an integrated luminosity of 25~pb$^{-1}$ at the Tevatron, are estimated.
