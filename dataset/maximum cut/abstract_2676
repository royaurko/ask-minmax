We study the reach of the Large Hadron Collider with 1/fb of data at sqrt{s}
= 7 TeV for several classes of supersymmetric models with compressed mass
spectra, using jets and missing transverse energy cuts like those employed by
ATLAS for Summer 2011 data. In the limit of extreme compression, the best
limits come from signal regions that do not require more than 2 or 3 jets and
that remove backgrounds by requiring more missing energy rather than higher
effective mass.
