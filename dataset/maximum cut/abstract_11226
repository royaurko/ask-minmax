We examine the status of the threat posed to stellar-mass black hole
candidates by the possible existence of Q-stars (compact objects with an exotic
equation of state which might have masses well above the normally-accepted
maximum for standard neutron stars). We point out that Q-stars could be
extremely compact (with radii less than 1.5 times the corresponding
Schwarzschild radius) making it quite difficult to determine observationally
that a given object is a black hole rather than a Q-star, unless there is
direct evidence for the absence of a solid surface. On the other hand, in order
for a Q-star to have a mass as high as that inferred for the widely-favoured
black hole candidate V404 Cygni, it would be necessary for the Q-matter
equation of state to apply already at densities an order of magnitude below
that of nuclear matter and this might well be considered implausible on
physical grounds. We also describe how rotation affects the situation and
discuss the prospects for determining observationally that black hole
candidates are not Q-stars.
