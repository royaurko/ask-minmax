We study the impact of the multi-lepton searches at the LHC on supersymmetric
models with compressed mass spectra. For such models the acceptances of the
usual search strategies are significantly reduced due to requirement of large
effective mass and missing E_T. On the other hand, lepton searches do have much
lower thresholds for missing E_T and p_T of the final state objects. Therefore,
if a model with a compressed mass spectrum allows for multi-lepton final
states, one could derive constraints using multi-lepton searches. For a class
of simplified models we study the exclusion limits using ATLAS multi-lepton
search analyses for the final states containing 2-4 electrons or muons with a
total integrated luminosity of 1-2/fb at \sqrt{s}=7 TeV. We also modify those
analyses by imposing additional cuts, so that their sensitivity to compressed
supersymmetric models increase. Using the original and modified analyses, we
show that the exclusion limits can be competitive with jet plus missing E_T
searches, providing exclusion limits up to gluino masses of 1 TeV. We also
analyse the efficiencies for several classes of events coming from different
intermediate state particles. This allows us to assess exclusion limits in
similar class of models with different cross sections and branching ratios
without requiring a Monte Carlo simulation.
