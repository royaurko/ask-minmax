Lately the relativistic self induced transparency (RSIT) has drawn
considerable research interest around the world. In this paper we have studied
the effect of target thickness on RSIT mechanism and found out that for
subwavelength target the corresponding threshold target density increases. The
effect of target density for given laser and target thickness is also being
studied and an optimum density for maximum accelerating field is observed.
Furthermore, the accelerating field created by RSIT in subwavelength target is
used to accelerate the externally injected proton bunch to ~ 100 MeV. The word
`via' in the title signifies the fact that we are interested in acceleration of
ions which are injected externally in an electrostatic field created by the
main target. It is being also observed that as per as energy spectrum is
concerned; external injection is advantageous than relying on target ions
alone.
