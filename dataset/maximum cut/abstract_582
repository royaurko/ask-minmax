The $f_0(1500)$ is identified in three glueball favoured production
mechanisms: $p\bar{p}$ annihilation, $\psi \to \gamma f_0$ and Central
Production. The production rate for glueballs in $\psi \to \gamma G$ has been
quantified and the $f_0(1500)$ is found to be consistent with a glueball -
$q\bar{q}$ mixture. We illustrate a remarkable property of central production
where kinematic cuts appear to make a systematic separation between glueballs
and $q\bar{q}$ of the same $J^{PC}$. When the cut favouring glueballs is
applied, the $f_0(1500)$ and other enigmatic states appear prominently while
confirmed $q\bar{q}$ states are empirically suppressed.
