The paper considers nonparametric specification tests of quantile curves for
a general class of nonstationary processes. Using Bahadur representation and
Gaussian approximation results for nonstationary time series, simultaneous
confidence bands and integrated squared difference tests are proposed to test
various parametric forms of the quantile curves with asymptotically correct
type I error rates. A wild bootstrap procedure is implemented to alleviate the
problem of slow convergence of the asymptotic results. In particular, our
results can be used to test the trends of extremes of climate variables, an
important problem in understanding climate change. Our methodology is applied
to the analysis of the maximum speed of tropical cyclone winds. It was found
that an inhomogeneous upward trend for cyclone wind speeds is pronounced at
high quantile values. However, there is no trend in the mean lifetime-maximum
wind speed. This example shows the effectiveness of the quantile regression
technique.
