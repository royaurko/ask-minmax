We report optical photometric observations of four superoutbursts of the
short-period dwarf nova TV Crv. This object experiences two types of
superoutbursts; one with a precursor and the other without. The superhump
period and period excess of TV Crv are accurately determined to be 0.065028 +/-
0.000008 d and 0.0342 +/- 0.0021, respectively. This large excess implies a
relatively large mass ratio of the binary components (M_2/M_1), though it has a
short orbital period. The two types of superoutbursts can be explained by the
thermal-tidal instability model for systems having large mass ratios. Our
observations reveal that superhump period derivatives are variable in distinct
superoutbursts. The variation is apparently related to the presence or absence
of a precursor. We propose that the superhump period derivative depends on the
maximum disk radius during outbursts. We investigate the relationship of the
type of superoutbursts and the superhump period derivative for known sources.
In the case of superoutbursts without a precursor, superhump period derivatives
tend to be larger than those in precursor-main type superoutbursts, which is
consistent with our scenario.
