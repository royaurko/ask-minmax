We construct an N=1 theory with gauge group U(nN) and degree n+1 tree level
superpotential whose matrix model spectral curve develops an A_{n+1}
Argyres-Douglas singularity. We evaluate the coupling constants of the
low-energy U(1)^n theory and show that the large N expansion is singular at the
Argyres-Douglas points. Nevertheless, it is possible to define appropriate
double scaling limits which are conjectured to yield four dimensional
non-critical string theories as proposed by Ferrari. In the Argyres-Douglas
limit the n-cut spectral curve degenerates into a solution with n/2 cuts for
even n and (n+1)/2 cuts for odd n.
