We study the effect of rotation on global properties of neutron star with a
hyperon core in an effective chiral model with varying nucleon effective mass
within a mean field approach. The resulting gross properties of the rotating
compact star sequences are then compared and analyzed with other theoretical
predictions and observations from neutron stars. The maximum mass of the
compact star predicted by the model lies in the range $(1.4-2.4) ~M_{\odot}$ at
Kepler frequency $\Omega_K$, which is consistant with recent observation of
high mass stars thereby reflecting the sensitivity of the underlying nucleon
effective mass in the dense matter EoS. We also discuss the implications of the
experimental constraints from the flow data from heavy-ion collisions on the
global properties of the rotating neutron stars.
