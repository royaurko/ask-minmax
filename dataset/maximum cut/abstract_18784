We investigate the environment of the nearby (d ~ 40Mpc) broad-lined Type Ic
supernova SN 2009bb. This event was observed to produce a relativistic outflow
likely powered by a central accreting compact object. While such a phenomenon
was previously observed only in long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), no LGRB
was detected in association with SN 2009bb. Using an optical spectrum of the SN
2009bb explosion site, we determine a variety of ISM properties for the host
environment, including metallicity, young stellar population age, and star
formation rate. We compare the SN explosion site properties to observations of
LGRB and broad-lined SN Ic host environments on optical emission line ratio
diagnostic diagrams. Based on these analyses, we find that the SN 2009bb
explosion site has a very high metallicity of ~2x solar, in agreement with
other broad-lined SN Ic host environments and at odds with the low-redshift
LGRB host environments and recently proposed maximum metallicity limits for
relativistic explosions. We consider the implications of these findings and the
impact that SN 2009bb's unusual explosive properties and environment have on
our understanding of the key physical ingredient that enables some SNe to
produce a relativistic outflow.
