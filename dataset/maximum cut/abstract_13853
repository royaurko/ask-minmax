The Be star 102719279 is an interesting target observed with CoRoT during two
runs, giving us the possibility to study the stability of the detected
frequencies and to search for any correlation with outburts, as it was recently
found in the Be star HD 49330 (Huat et al. 2009). The light curve of the star
102719279 shows fadings, multiperiodicity, stable and transient frequencies,
etc. The short-term variations of the light curve are probably produced by
non-radial pulsations together with some material that is ejected from the
star, which produces the transient frequency. It is should be noted that the
two main frequencies are synchronized and have the maximum amplitude just
before the outburst.
