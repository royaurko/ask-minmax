The recurrent nova CI Aquilae entered the final decline phase a bit before
May of 2001, showing the slowest evolution among the recurrent novae. Based on
the optically thick wind mass-loss theory of the thermonuclear runaway model,
we have estimated the turn-off time of the CI Aql 2000 outburst in March of
2001, after a supersoft X-ray source (SSS) phase lasts 150 days from December
of 2000 until May of 2001. Fitting our theoretical light curves with both the
1917 and 2000 outbursts, we also obtained the WD mass to be M_{WD}= 1.2 \pm
0.05 M_\sun, helium enrichment of ejecta, He/H ~ 0.5 by number, the mass of the
hydrogen-rich envelope on the WD of \Delta M ~ 6 x 10^{-6} M_\sun at the
optical maximum, which is indicating an average mass accretion rate of \dot
M_{acc} ~ 0.8 x 10^{-7} M_\sun yr^{-1} during the quiescent phase between the
1917 and 2000 outbursts.
