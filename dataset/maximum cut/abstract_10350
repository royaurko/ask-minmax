We extend the quark mean-field (QMF) model to strangeness freedom to study
the properties of hyperons ($\Lambda,\Sigma,\Xi$) in infinite baryon matter and
neutron star properties. The baryon-scalar meson couplings in the QMF model are
determined self-consistently from the quark level, where the quark confinement
is taken into account in terms of a scalar-vector harmonic oscillator
potential. The strength of such confinement potential for $u,d$ quarks is
constrained by the properties of finite nuclei, while the one for $s$ quark is
limited by the properties of nuclei with a $\Lambda$ hyperon. These two
strengths are not same, which represents the SU(3) symmetry breaking
effectively in the QMF model. Also, we use an enhanced $\Sigma$ coupling with
the vector meson, and both $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$ hyperon potentials can be
properly described in the model. The effects of the SU(3) symmetry breaking on
the neutron star structures are then studied. We find that the SU(3) breaking
shifts earlier the hyperon onset density and makes hyperons more abundant in
the star, in comparisons with the results of the SU(3) symmetry case. However,
it does not affect much the star's maximum mass. The maximum masses are found
to be $1.62 M_{\odot}$ with hyperons and $1.88 M_{\odot}$ without hyperons. The
present neutron star model is shown to have limitations on explaining the
recently measured heavy pulsar.
