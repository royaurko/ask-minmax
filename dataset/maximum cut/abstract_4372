We study the generation of the baryon asymmetry in a variant of the standard
model, where the Higgs field is stabilized by a dimension-six interaction.
Analyzing the one-loop potential, we find a strong first order electroweak
phase transition for Higgs masses up to at least 170 GeV. Dimension-six
operators induce also new sources of CP violation. We compute the baryon
asymmetry in the WKB approximation. Novel source terms in the transport
equations enhance the generated baryon asymmetry. For a wide range of
parameters the model predicts a baryon asymmetry close to the observed value.
