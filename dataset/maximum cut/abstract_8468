We performed in-plane magnetodrag measurements on dilute double layer
two-dimensional hole systems, at in-plane magnetic fields that suppress the
apparent metallic behavior, and to fields well above those required to fully
spin polarize the system. When compared to the single layer magnetoresistance,
the magnetodrag exhibits exactly the same qualitative behavior. In addition, we
have found that the enhancement to the drag from the in-plane field exhibits a
strong maximum when both layer densities are matched.
