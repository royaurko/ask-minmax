We investigate diffusion-limited reactions between a diffusing particle and a
target site on a semiflexible polymer, a key factor determining the kinetics of
DNA-protein binding and polymerization of cytoskeletal filaments. Our theory
focuses on two competing effects: polymer shape fluctuations, which speed up
association, and the hydrodynamic coupling between the diffusing particle and
the chain, which slows down association. Polymer bending fluctuations are
described using a mean field dynamical theory, while the hydrodynamic coupling
between polymer and particle is incorporated through a simple heuristic
approximation. Both of these we validate through comparison with Brownian
dynamics simulations. Neither of the effects has been fully considered before
in the biophysical context, and we show they are necessary to form accurate
estimates of reaction processes. The association rate depends on the stiffness
of the polymer and the particle size, exhibiting a maximum for intermediate
persistence length and a minimum for intermediate particle radius. In the
parameter range relevant to DNA-protein binding, the rate increase is up to
100% compared to the Smoluchowski result for simple center-of-mass motion. The
quantitative predictions made by the theory can be tested experimentally.
