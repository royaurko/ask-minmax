Quasi-analytic wave-front sets of distributions which correspond to the
Gevrey sequence $p!^s, s\in[1/2,1)$ are defined and investigated. The
localization by a cut-off function, for distributions and ultra-distributions
which correspond to $p!^s, s>1,$ or the localization by a sequence of cut-off
functions in the analytic case ($s=1$) and then the use of Fourier transform is
replaced, in the case $s\in[1/2,1),$ by a new approach based on a restriction
of a distribution, then extension of this restriction and the use of a sequence
of short time Fourier transforms with the Gaussian window functions. Then, the
basic properties are established.
