We study identical mass black hole binaries with spins perpendicular to the
binary's orbital plane. These binaries have individual spins ranging from
$s/m^2=-0.90$ to 0.90, ($s_1 = s_2$ in all cases) which is near the limit
possible with standard Bowen-York puncture initial data. The extreme cases
correspond to the largest initial spin simulations to date. Our results expand
the parameter space covered by Rezzolla {\it et al.} and, when combining both
data sets, we obtain estimations for the minimum and maximum values for the
intrinsic angular momenta of the remnant of binary black hole mergers of
$J/M^2=0.341 \pm 0.004$ and $0.951 \pm 0.004$ respectively. Note, however, that
these values are reached through extrapolation to the singular cases $|s_1| =
|s_2| = 1$ and thus remain as {\it estimates} until full-fledged numerical
simulations provide confirmation.
