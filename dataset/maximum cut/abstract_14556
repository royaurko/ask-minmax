We consider multivariate skew-t distributions for modeling composition data
of high energy cosmic rays. The model has been validated with simulated data
for different primary nuclei and hadronic models focusing on the depth of
maximum Xmax and number of muons N{\mu} observables. Further, we consider
mixtures of multivariate skew-t distributions for cosmic ray mass composition
determination and event-by-event classification. With respect to other
approaches in the field, it is based on analytical calculations and allows to
incorporate different sets of constraints provided by the present hadronic
models. We present some applications to simulated data sets generated with
different nuclear abundances assumptions. As it does not fully rely on the
hadronic model predictions, the method is particularly suited to the current
experimental scenario in which evidences of discrepancies of the measured data
with respect to the models have been reported for some shower observables, such
as the number of muons at ground level.
