We suggest a new scenario to explain the outburst light curves of black hole
soft X-ray transients together with the secondary maximum and the bump seen on
their decay phases. Our explanations are based on the disk instability models
considering the effect of X-ray irradiation. The scenario is consistent with
the observed X-ray delays by a few days with respect to the optical rise for
both the main outburst and the later maxima. We test our scenario by
numerically solving the disk diffusion equation. The obtained model curve fits
well to the observed X-ray outburst photon flux curve of the black hole soft
X-ray transient GS/GRS 1124-68, a typical representative of the four BH SXTs
with very similar light curves.
