The effect of doping with hydrogen on the electrical properties of vanadium
oxide is studied. For vanadium oxide films, subject to cold hydrogen plasma
treatment, the temperature dependence of resistance with a maximum at T ~ 100 K
is observed. Also, the dependence of the a.c. resistance on frequency is
studied. A strategy for fabrication new superconducting materials is discussed.
