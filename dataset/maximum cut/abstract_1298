The transverse momentum distribution of the diffractive final state provides
an interesting test of models of diffractive deep-inelastic scattering at HERA.
We present a comparison of several colour-singlet exchange models with thrust
transverse momentum data from a recent H1 analysis. We also study the effect of
constraints imposed on the kinematically-accessible phase space by data
selection cuts and find that, as a result of the pseudo-rapidity cut which is
used by H1 to select diffractive events, there is no dijet contribution at low
transverse momenta. We are able to fit the large transverse momentum part of
the data with a two-gluon dijet model. The results of this analysis are
compared with a previous study of large pseudo-rapidity gap structure function
data, and we discuss ways in which one might reconcile the results of the two
analyses. We conclude that a significant small-$\beta$ 3-jet contribution is
probably required to explain the data, and show that the combination of a
two-gluon dijet model and an exponentially-decaying thrust transverse momentum
distribution provides a good fit over the entire kinematic range of the thrust
data.
