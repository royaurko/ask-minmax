We have prepared the new amorphous superconductor $\rm Mo_xC_yGa_zO_{\delta}$
with a maximum critical temperature $T_c$ of 3.8\,K by the direct-write
nano-patterning technique of focused (gallium) ion beam induced deposition
(FIBID) using $\rm Mo(CO)_6$ as precursor gas. From a detailed analysis of the
temperature-dependent resistivity and the upper critical field we found clear
evidence for proximity of the samples to a disorder-induced metal-insulator
transition. We observed a strong dependence of $T_c$ on the deposition
parameters and identified clear correlations between $T_c$, the localization
tendency visible in the resistance data and the sample composition. By an
in-situ feedback-controlled optimization process in the FIB-induced growth we
were able to identify the beam parameters which lead to samples with the
largest $T_c$-value and sharpest transition into the superconducting state.
