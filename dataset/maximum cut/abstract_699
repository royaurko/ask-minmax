We study the asymptotic expansion in $n$ for the partition function of
$\beta$ matrix models with real analytic potentials in the multi-cut regime up
to the $O(n^{-1})$ terms. As a result, we find the limit of the generating
functional of linear eigenvalue statistics and the expressions for the
expectation and the variance of linear eigenvalue statistics, which in the
general case contain the quasi periodic in $n$ terms.
