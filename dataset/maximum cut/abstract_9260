The absolute frequencies of the hyperfine components of the R(26) 62-0
transition in molecular iodine at 501.7 nm are measured for the first time with
an optical clockwork based on a femtosecond laser frequency comb generator. The
set-up is composed of an Ar+ laser locked to a hyperfine component of the R(26)
62-0 transition detected in a continuously pumped low-pressure cell (0.33 Pa).
The detected resonances show a linewidth of 45 kHz (half-width at
half-maximum). The uncertainty of the frequency measurement is estimated to be
250 Hz.
