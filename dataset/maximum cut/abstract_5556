Real time operation of the power grid and synchronism of its different
elements require accurate estimation of its state variables. Errors in state
estimation will lead to sub-optimal Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solutions and
subsequent increase in the price of electricity in the market or, potentially
overload and create line outages. This paper studies hidden data attacks on
power systems by an adversary trying to manipulate state estimators. The
adversary gains control of a few meters, and is able to introduce spurious
measurements in them. The paper presents a polynomial time algorithm using
min-cut calculations to determine the minimum number of measurements an
adversary needs to manipulate in order to perform a hidden attack. Greedy
techniques are presented to aid the system operator in identifying critical
measurements for protection to prevent such hidden data attacks. Secure PMU
placement against data attacks is also discussed and an algorithm for placing
PMUs for this purpose is developed. The performances of the proposed algorithms
are shown through simulations on IEEE test cases.
