We consider the rare decay $\eta\to\pi^0\pi^0\gamma\gamma$ and calculate the
non-resonant contribution to the amplitude to one loop in Chiral Perturbation
Theory. We display our result as both a diphoton energy spectrum and a partial
decay rate as a function of the photon energy cut. It turns out that the
one-loop correction can be numerically very important and could be detected, at
sufficiently large center-of-mass photon energies, from a measurement of the
partial decay width.
