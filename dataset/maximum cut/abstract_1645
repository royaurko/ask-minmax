The maximum complexity momentum distribution for an isolated monodimensional
ideal gas out of equilibrium is derived analytically. In a first approximation,
it consists of a double non-overlapping Gaussian distribution. In good
agreement with this result, the numerical simulations of a particular isolated
monodimensional gas, which is abruptly pushed far from equilibrium, shows the
maximum complexity distribution in the decay of the system toward equilibrium.
