We studied the in-plane magnetic anisotropy of rf (radio frequency) sputtered
[(FeTaN)/(TaN)](n) multilayers synthesized on Si substrates. In the multilayers
where n=5, the FeTaN thickness is fixed at 30 nm and the thickness of TaN,
t(TaN), is varied from 0 to 6.0 nm, we observed a clear trend that, with
increasing t(TaN), the values of coercivity, grain size, and amplitude of
maximum magnetoresistance (MR) of the samples all decrease first and then
increase after reaching a minimum when t(TaN) is around 2.0-4.0 nm. This trend
is also associated with an evolution of in-plane magnetic anisotropy, where the
multilayers change from uniaxial anisotropy to biaxial at t(TaN) around 4.0 nm
and above. We attribute the phenomena to the interlayer coupling effect of
FeTaN films as a function of the coupling layer (TaN) thickness, rather than to
the thickness dependence observed in single-layered FeTaN films, where the
direction of easy axis switches 90degrees when the film is thicker than 300 nm.
The in-plane anisotropy of the [(FeTaN)/(TaN)](n) multilayers also shows signs
of oscillation when the number of coupling layers varies. The MR effects
observed are mainly due to anisotropy MR (AMR), while the grain size and
exchange coupling may also contribute to the change of maximum MR ratios in the
multilayers with changing t(TaN).
