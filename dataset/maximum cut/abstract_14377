Standard maximum likelihood estimation cannot be applied to discrete
energy-based models in the general case because the computation of exact model
probabilities is intractable. Recent research has seen the proposal of several
new estimators designed specifically to overcome this intractability, but
virtually nothing is known about their theoretical properties. In this paper,
we present a generalized estimator that unifies many of the classical and
recently proposed estimators. We use results from the standard asymptotic
theory for M-estimators to derive a generic expression for the asymptotic
covariance matrix of our generalized estimator. We apply these results to study
the relative statistical efficiency of classical pseudolikelihood and the
recently-proposed ratio matching estimator.
