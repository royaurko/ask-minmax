We present two unconventional methods of extracting information from hadronic
2-point functions produced by Monte Carlo simulations. The first is an
extension of earlier work by Leinweber which combines a QCD Sum Rule approach
with lattice data. The second uses the Maximum Entropy Method to invert the
2-point data to obtain estimates of the spectral function. The first approach
is applied to QCD data, and the second method is applied to the
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model in (2+1)D. Both methods promise to augment the
current approach where physical quantities are extracted by fitting to pure
exponentials.
