We explore the implications of a 126 GeV Higgs boson indicated by the recent
LHC results for two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM). Identifying the 126 GeV Higgs
boson as either the lighter or heavier of CP even neutral Higgs bosons in 2HDM,
we examine how the masses of Higgs fields and mixing parameters can be
constrained by the theoretical conditions and experimental constraints. The
theoretical conditions taken into account are the vacuum stability,
perturbativity and unitarity required to be satisfied up to a cut-off scale. We
also show how bounds on the masses of Higgs bosons and mixing parameters depend
on the cut-off scale. In addition, we investigate whether the allowed regions
of parameter space can accommodate particularly the enhanced di-photon signals,
ZZ* and WW* decay modes of the Higgs boson, and examine the prediction of the
signal strength of Z{\gamma} decay mode for the allowed regions of the
parameter space.
