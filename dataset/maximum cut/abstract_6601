Using molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the thermodynamic of
particles interacting with a continuous and a discrete versions of a
core-softened (CS) intermolecular potential composed by a repulsive shoulder.
Dynamic and structural properties are also analyzed by the simulations. We show
that in the continuous version of the CS potential the density at constant
pressure has a maximum for a certain temperature. Similarly the diffusion
constant, $D$, at a constant temperature has a maximum at a density
$\rho_{\mathrm{max}}$ and a minimum at a density
$\rho_{\mathrm{min}}<\rho_{\mathrm{max}}$, and structural properties are also
anomalous. For the discrete CS potential none of these anomalies are observed.
The absence of anomalies in the discrete case and its presence in the
continuous CS potential are discussed in the framework of the excess entropy.
