We discuss Fermi observations of gamma-ray loud binaries. We show that within
hadronic model of activity of LSI +61 303, detection of cut-off in the GeV
spectrum constrains maximal energy of the primary protons. In this way, the GeV
gamma-ray data impose constraint on the expected neutrino signal (spectrum and
lightcurve) from the source. We also briefly discuss perspectives of GeV band
detection of PSR B1259-63 during the 2010 periastron passage.
