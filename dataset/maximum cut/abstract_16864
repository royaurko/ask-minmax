The gravitational waves and energy radiations from a spinning compact object
with stellar mass in a circular orbit in the equatorial plane of a supermassive
Kerr black hole are investigated in this paper. The effect how the spin acts on
energy and angular moment fluxes is discussed in detail. The calculation
results indicate that the spin of small body should be considered in
waveform-template production for the upcoming gravitational wave detections. It
is clear that when the direction of spin axes is the same as the orbitally
angular momentum ("positive" spin), spin can decrease the energy fluxes which
radiate to infinity. For antidirection spin ("negative"), the energy fluxes to
infinity can be enlarged. And the relations between fluxes (both infinity and
horizon) and spin look like quadratic functions. From frequency shift due to
spin, we estimate the wave-phase accumulation during the inspiraling process of
the particle. We find that the time of particle inspiral into the black hole is
longer for positive spin and shorter for negative compared with the nonspinning
particle. Especially, for extreme spin value, the energy radiation near the
horizon of the extreme Kerr black hole is much more than that for the
nonspinning one. And consequently, the maximum binging energy of the extreme
spinning particle is much larger than that of the nonspinning particle.
