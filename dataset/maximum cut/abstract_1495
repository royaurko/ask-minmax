In this paper we present an analysis at NLO of the contribution from
squark-squark production to the experimental signature 2j + 2l + missing E_T
(+X) with opposite-sign same flavor leptons, taking into account decays and
experimental cuts. We consider the case in which one squark decays directly
into the lightest neutralino chi^0_1 and the other one into the second lightest
neutralino and subsequently into l^+l^-chi^0_1 via an intermediate slepton. On
one hand we study effects of the NLO corrections on invariant mass
distributions which can be used for future parameter determination. On the
other hand we analyze the impact on predictions for cut-and-count searches
using this experimental signature.
