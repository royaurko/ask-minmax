This letter describes how to perform searches over the complete
kinematically-allowed parameter space for new pair-produced color octet
particles that each subsequently decay into two jets plus missing energy at the
Tevatron. This letter shows that current searches can miss otherwise
discoverable spectra of particles due to CMSSM-motivated cuts. Optimizing the
HT and MET cuts expands the sensitivity of these searches.
