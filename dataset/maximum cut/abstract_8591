We discuss the sensitivity of the CASSINI experiments to gravitational waves
emitted by the in-spiral of compact binaries. We show that the maximum distance
reachable by the instrument is $\sim 100$ Mpc. In particular, CASSINI can
detect massive black hole binaries with chirp mass $\simgt 10^6 \Ms$ in the
Virgo Cluster with signal-to-noise ratio between 5 and 30 and possible compact
objects of mass $\simgt 30 \Ms$ orbiting the massive black hole that our
Galactic Centre is likely to harbour.
