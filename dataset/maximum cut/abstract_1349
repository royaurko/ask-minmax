Recently we have introduced a novel characterisation of the distribution of
twin primes that consists of three essential elements. These are: that the
twins are most naturally viewed as a subsequence of the primes themselves, that
the likelihood of a particular prime in sequence being the first element of a
twin is akin to a fixed-probability random event, and that this probability
varies with $\pi_{1}$, the count of primes up to this number, in a simple way.
Our initial studies made use of two unproven assumptions: that it was
consistent to model this fundamentally discrete system with a continuous
probability density, and that the fact that an upper-bound cut-off for prime
separations exists could be consistently ignored in the continuous analysis.
The success of the model served as a posteriori justification for these
assumptions. Here we perform the analysis using a discrete formalism -- not
passing to integrals -- and explicitly include a self-consistently defined
cut-off. In addition, we reformulate the model so as to minimise the input data
needed.
