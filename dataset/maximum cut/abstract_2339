In a brief review, we discuss interrelations between arbitrary solutions of
the loop equations that describe Hermitean one-matrix model and particular
(multi-cut) solutions that describe concrete matrix integrals. These latter
ones enjoy a series of specific properties and, in particular, are described in
terms of Seiberg-Witten-Whitham theory. The simplest example of ordinary
integral is considered in detail.
