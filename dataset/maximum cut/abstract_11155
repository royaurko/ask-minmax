The large scale structure of the universe is reconstructed by means of the
Wiener filter and constrained realizations of Gaussian fields. The density
field constructed from optically selected galaxies (Hudson \cite{Hudson}) has
been sampled out to a distance of $80\hmpc$. This data set is used for the
reconstruction of the underlying primordial perturbation field. A preliminary
reconstruction analysis from the IRAS $1.9Jy$ density field is presented here
for the sake of comparison. The perturbation field within a cube of $160\hmpc$
on the side, centered on the Local Group, and with Gaussian smoothing of length
$10\hmpc$ is reconstructed, assuming the standard CDM model. In particular, the
density field at the Zone of Avoidance is studied. A preliminary maximum
likelihood analysis performed on Hudson's data shows that it is consistent with
a tilted CDM with $n\sim -0.5\pm 0.3$ and $\sigma_8\sim 1.4\pm 0.15$
