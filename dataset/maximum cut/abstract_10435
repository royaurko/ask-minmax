We have developed a model to calculate the emission intensities of various
vibrational transitions of N$_2$ triplet band and Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH)
band emissions in the dayglow of Pluto for solar minimum, moderate, and maximum
conditions. The calculated overhead intensities of Vegard-Kaplan ($
A^3\Sigma_u^+ - X^1\Sigma^+_g $), First Positive ($ B^3\Pi_g - A^3\Sigma^+_u
$), Second Positive ($ C^3\Pi_u - B^3\Pi_g $), Wu-Benesch ($W^3\Delta_u -
B^3\Pi_g$), Reverse First Positive, and LBH ($a^1\Pi_g$-- $X^1\Sigma^+_g$)
bands of N$_2$ are 17 (74), 14.8 (64), 2.4 (10.8), 2.9 (12.7), 2.9 (12.5), and
2.3 (10) R, respectively, for solar minimum (maximum) condition. We have
predicted the overhead and limb intensities of VK (150-190 nm) and LBH (120-190
nm) bands of N$_2$ on Pluto for the New Horizons (NH) flyby condition that can
be observed by Alice: the ultraviolet imaging spectrograph also know as
P-Alice. The predicted limb intensities of VK and LBH bands peak at radial
distance of $ \sim$2000 km with the value of about 5 (13) and 9.5 (22) R for
solar zenith angle 60$ ^\circ $ (0$ ^\circ $), respectively. We have also
calculated overhead and limp intensities of few prominent transition of CO
Fourth Positive bands for NH flyby condition.
