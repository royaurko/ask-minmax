We take an $L_1$-dense class of functions $\Cal F$ on a measurable space
$(X,\Cal X)$ and a sequence of i.i.d. $X$-valued random variables
$\xi_1,\dots,\xi_n$, and give a good estimate on the tail behaviour of
$\sup\limits_{f\in\Cal F}\sum\limits_{j=1}^nf(\xi_j)$ if the conditions
$\sup\limits_{x\in X}|f(x)|\le1$, $Ef(\xi_1)=0$ and $Ef(\xi_1)^2<\sigma^2$ with
some $0\le\sigma\le1$ hold for all $f\in\Cal F$. Roughly speaking this estimate
states that under some natural conditions the above considered supremum is not
much larger than the worst element taking part in it. The proof heavily depends
on the main result of paper~[3]. Here we have to deal with such a problem where
the classical methods worked out to investigate the behaviour of Gaussian or
almost Gaussian random variables do not work.}
