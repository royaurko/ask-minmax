Nguyen and Onak constructed the first constant-time algorithm for the
approximation of the size of the maximum matching in bounded degree graphs. The
Borel oracle machinery is a tool that can be used to convert some statements in
Borel graph theory to theorems in the field of constant-time algorithms. In
this paper we illustrate the power of this tool to prove the existence of the
above mentioned constant-time approximation algorithm.
