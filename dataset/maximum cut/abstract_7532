We analyze multiparticle production in a thermal framework for 7 central
nucleus nucleus collisions, $e^+$+ $e^-$ annihilation into hadrons on the Z
resonance and 4 hadronic reactions (p+p and p+$\bar{p}$ with partial centrality
selec tion), with center of mass energies ranging from $\sqrt{s}$= 2.6 GeV (per
nucleon pair) to 1.8 TeV. Thermodynamic parameters at chemical freeze-out
(temperature and baryon and strangeness fugacities) are obtained from
appropriate fits, generally improving in quality for reactions subjected to
centrality cuts. All systems with nonvanishing fugacities are extrapolated
along trajectories of equal energy density, density and entropy density to zero
fugacities. The so obtained temperatures extrapolated to zero fugacities as a
function of initial energy density $\epsilon_{in}$ universally show a strong
rise followed by a saturating limit of $T_{lim}$ = 155 $\pm$ 6 $\pm$ 20 MeV. We
interpret this behaviour as mapping out the boundary between quark gluon plasma
and hadronic phases. The ratio of strange antiquarks to light ones as a
function of the initial energy density $\epsilon_{in}$ shows the same behaviour
as the temperature, saturating at a value of 0.365 $\pm$ 0.033 $\pm$ 0.07. No
distinctive feature of 'strangeness enhancement' is seen for heavy ion
collisions relative to hadronic and leptonic reactions, when compared at the
same initial energy density.
