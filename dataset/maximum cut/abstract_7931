The past few years have witnessed a remarkable crossover of string
theoretical ideas from the abstract world of geometrical forms to the concrete
experimental realm of condensed matter physics. The basis for this ---
variously known as holography, the AdS/CFT correspondence or gauge-gravity
duality --comes from notions right at the cutting edge of string theory.
Nevertheless, the insights afforded can often be expressed in ways very
familiar to condensed matter physicists, such as relationships between response
functions and new sum rules.
  The aim of this short, introductory review is to survey the ideas
underpinning this crossover, in a way that -- as far as possible -- strips them
of sophisticated mathematical formalism, whilst at the same time retaining
their fundamental essence. I will sketch the areas in which progress has been
made to date and highlight where the challenges and open questions lie.
Finally, I will attempt to give a perspective upon these ideas. What
contribution can we realistically expect from this approach and how might it be
accommodated into the canon of condensed matter theory? Inevitably, any attempt
to do this in such a rapidly evolving field will be superseded by events.
Nevertheless, I hope that this will provide a useful way to think about
gauge-gravity duality and the uncharted directions in which it might take us.
