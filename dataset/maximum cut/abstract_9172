It is known that the thermal conductivity of a dilute gas can be derived by
using kinetic theory. We present here a new derivation by starting with two
known entropy production principles: the steepest entropy ascent (SEA)
principle and the maximum entropy production (MEP) principle. A remarkable
feature of the new derivation is that it does not require the specification of
the existence of the temperature gradient. The known result is reproduced in a
similar form.
