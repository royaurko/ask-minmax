We present a detail study of the electrical resistivity, thermoelectric
power, magnetic susceptibility \c{hi} and the heat capacity CP in
antiferromagnetic layered compounds CuCrS2 and CuCrSe2 at 2K-300K. CuCrS2
showed sharp cusp in \c{hi} and a lambda-like peak in CP at TN = 40K as
expected for a 3D- magnetic order, while more metallic CuCrSe2 showed a rounded
maximum in \c{hi} and the absence of sharp peak in CP around 55K, the CP at low
temperature has T2-dependence in it which suggests the absence of the long
range order and 2D spin-liquid like excitation in its magnetic phase. We
explain the absence of the magnetic order in the selenide compound as resulting
from the effective competition of the magnetic interactions from the distant
neighbors; the indirect exchange among the intra-layer Cr-atoms increases in
more metallic selenide compound which competes with the direct
antiferromagnetic interactions between the Cr-atoms of different layers which
destroys the long range magnetic order.
