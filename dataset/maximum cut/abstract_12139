Recent experiments on Pr$_{0.89}$LaCe$_{0.11}$CuO$_4$ observe an anisotropic
spin-correlation gap and a nonmonotonic superconducting (SC) gap, which we
analyze within the framework of a
$t-t^{\prime}-t^{\prime\prime}-t^{\prime\prime\prime}-t^{iv}-U$ model with a
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction including a third harmonic contribution. By
introducing a realistic broadening of the quasiparticle spectrum to reflect
small-angle scattering, our computations explain the experimental observations,
especially the presence of a maximum in the leading edge gap in the vicinity of
the hot-spots. Our analysis suggests that the material behaves like a {\it
two-band} superconductor with the d-wave third harmonic acting as the {\it
interband pairing gap}, and that the anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) and SC orders
co-exist in a uniform phase.
