The shape of the photoluminescence line registered from a side edge of InP
wafer is studied as function of the distance from the excitation spot. The
observed red shift in the luminescence maximum is well described by radiation
filtering and is consistent with the absorption spectra. Our method provides an
independent and accurate determination of the Urbach tails in moderately doped
semiconductors.
