We have investigated the nature of the magnetic white dwarf LP 790-29 = LHS
2293 by polarimetric monitoring, searching for short-term variability. No
periodicity was found and we can exclude rotation periods between 4 sec and 1.5
hour with a high confidence. Maximum amplitudes of sinusoidal variations are
Delta R < 0.009 mag and Delta V_R < 0.7% for a mean value of the R-band
circular polarization of V_R = +9.1+/-0.3%. Combined with earlier results by
other contributors, our observation suggests that LP 790-29 is, in fact, an
extremely slowly rotating single white dwarf and not an unrecognized fast
rotator and/or disguised cataclysmic variable.
