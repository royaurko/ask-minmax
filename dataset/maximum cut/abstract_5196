The Fermi space telescope has detected over 100 pulsars. These discoveries
have ushered in a new era of pulsar astrophysics at gamma-ray energies.
Gamma-ray pulsars, regardless of whether they are young, old, radio-quiet etc,
all exhibit a seemingly unifying characteristic: a spectral energy distribution
which takes the form of a power law with an exponential cut-off occurring
between ~1 and ~10 GeV. The single known exception to this is the Crab pulsar,
which was recently discovered to emit pulsed gamma rays at energies exceeding a
few hundred GeV. Here we present an update on observations of the Crab pulsar
above 100 GeV with VERITAS. We show some new results from a joint
gamma-ray/radio observational campaign to search for a correlation between
giant radio pulses and pulsed VHE emission from the Crab pulsar. We also
present some preliminary results on Lorentz invariance violation tests
performed using Fermi and VERITAS observations of the Crab pulsar.
