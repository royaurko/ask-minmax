We study how to extract information on the neutron star equation of state
from the gravitational wave signal emitted during the coalescence of a binary
system composed of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. We use
post-Newtonian templates which include the tidal deformability parameter and,
when tidal disruption occurs before merger, a frequency cut-off. Assuming that
this signal is detected by Advanced LIGO/Virgo or ET, we evaluate the
uncertainties on these parameters using different data analysis strategies
based on the Fisher matrix approach, and on recently obtained analytical fits
of the relevant quantities. We find that the tidal deformability is more
effective than the stellar compactness to discriminate among different possible
equations of state.
