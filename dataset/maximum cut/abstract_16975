The X-ray emission from the wind-wind collision in short-period massive
O+O-star binaries is investigated. The emission is calculated from
three-dimensional hydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the driving
of the winds, orbital motion of the stars, and radiative cooling of the shocked
plasma. Changes in the amount of stellar occultation and circumstellar
attenuation introduce phase-dependent X-ray variability in systems with
circular orbits, while strong variations in the intrinsic emission also occur
in systems with eccentric orbits. The X-ray emission in eccentric systems can
display strong hysteresis, with the emission softer after periastron than at
corresponding orbital phases prior to periastron, reflecting the physical state
of the shocked plasma at these times. Furthermore, the rise of the luminosity
to maximum does not necessarily follow a 1/D law. Our models further
demonstrate that the effective circumstellar column can be highly energy
dependent.
  We simulate Chandra and Suzaku observations, and fit these using standard
XSPEC models. We find that the recovered temperatures from two or
three-temperature mekal fits are comparable to those from fits to the emission
from real systems with similar stellar and orbital parameters/nature. We also
find that when the global abundance is thawed in the spectral fits, sub-solar
values are exclusively returned, despite the calculations using solar values as
input (abridged).
