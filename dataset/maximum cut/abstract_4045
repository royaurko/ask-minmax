The interaction between the vortex lines in a type-II superconductor is
mediated by currents. In the absence of transverse screening this interaction
is long-ranged, stiffening up the vortex lattice as expressed by the dispersive
elastic moduli. The effect of disorder is strongly reduced, resulting in a
mean-squared displacement correlator <u^2(R,L)> = <[u(R,L)-u(0,0)]^2>
characterized by a mere logarithmic growth with distance. Finite screening cuts
the interaction on the scale of the London penetration depth \lambda and limits
the above behavior to distances R<\lambda. Using a functional renormalization
group (RG) approach, we derive the flow equation for the disorder correlation
function and calculate the disorder-averaged mean-squared relative displacement
<u^2(R)> \propto ln^{2\sigma} (R/a_0). The logarithmic growth (2\sigma=1) in
the perturbative regime at small distances [A.I. Larkin and Yu.N. Ovchinnikov,
J. Low Temp. Phys. 34, 409 (1979)] crosses over to a sub-logarithmic growth
with 2\sigma=0.348 at large distances.
