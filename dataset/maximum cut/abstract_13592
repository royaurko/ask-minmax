Let G be a graph with n vertices, and let k be an integer dividing n. G is
said to be strongly k-colorable if for every partition of V(G) into disjoint
sets V_1 \cup ... \cup V_r, all of size exactly k, there exists a proper vertex
k-coloring of G with each color appearing exactly once in each V_i. In the case
when k does not divide n, G is defined to be strongly k-colorable if the graph
obtained by adding k \lceil n/k \rceil - n isolated vertices is strongly
k-colorable. The strong chromatic number of G is the minimum k for which G is
strongly k-colorable. In this paper, we study the behavior of this parameter
for the random graph G(n, p). In the dense case when p >> n^{-1/3}, we prove
that the strong chromatic number is a.s. concentrated on one value \Delta+1,
where \Delta is the maximum degree of the graph. We also obtain several weaker
results for sparse random graphs.
