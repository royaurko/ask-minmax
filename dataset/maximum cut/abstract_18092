The tribology of a bubble rubbing on a solid surface is studied via
interferometry. A unique experimental setup is designed for monitoring the
thickness profiles of a wetting film, intercalated between the bubble and
hydrophilic glass moving with speed up to 412 um/s. The determination of the 3D
film thickness profiles allows us to calculate 3D maps over the wetted surface
of the local capillary, disjoining and lift pressures, viscous stress and
friction force. In this way the average friction force and the corresponding
friction coefficient are obtained. A theoretical model for the dependence of
the friction coefficient on the film thickness is developed. The relevant slip
coefficient, being a measure for the slip between liquid and solid, is
determined as a function of the speed of the solid surface. It is found out
that below 170 um/s a friction regime exists which formally resembles dry
friction, while at larger speed the friction force between the bubble and solid
passes through a maximum. Furthermore, the friction coefficient has a large
value at low speed of the solid and reduces substantially with the speed
increase.
