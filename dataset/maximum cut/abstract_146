Point-contact (PC) Andreev-reflection (AR) measurements of the
superconducting gap in iron-oxipnictide ReFeAsO_{1-x}F_x (Re=La, Sm) films have
been carried out. The value of the gap is distributed in the range 2\Delta
\simeq 5-10 meV (for Re=Sm) with a maximum in the distribution around 6 meV.
Temperature dependence of the gap \Delta(T) can be fitted well by BCS curve
giving reduced gap ratio 2\Delta /kT_c^*\simeq 3.5 (here T_c^* is the critical
temperature from the BCS fit). At the same time, an expected second larger gap
feature was difficult to resolve distinctly on the AR spectra making
determination reliability of the second gap detection questionable. Possible
reasons for this and the origin of other features like clear-cut asymmetry in
the AR spectra and current regime in PCs are discussed.
