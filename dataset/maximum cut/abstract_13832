We theoretically investigate the impact of multiple plasmon resonances on the
charging of Xe clusters embedded in He nanodroplets under intense pump-probe
laser excitation. Our molecular dynamics simulations on Xe309He10000$ and
comparison to results for free Xe309$ give clear evidence for selective
resonance heating in the He shell and the Xe cluster, but no corresponding
double hump feature in the final Xe charge spectra is found. Though the
presence of the He shell substantially increases the maximum charge states, the
pump-probe dynamics of the Xe spectra from embedded system is similar to that
of the free species. In strong contrast to that, the predicted electron spectra
do show well-separated and pronounced features from highly efficient plasmon
assisted electron acceleration for both resonances in the embedded clusters. A
detailed analysis of the underlying ionization and recombination dynamics is
presented and explains the apparent disaccord between the resonance features in
the ion and electron spectra.
