We study large sample properties of Bayesian analysis of the proportional
hazard model with neutral to the right process priors on the baseline hazard
function. We show that the posterior distribution of the baseline cumulative
hazard function and regression coefficients centered at the maximum likelihood
estimator is jointly asymptotically equivalent to the sampling distribution of
the maximum likelihood estimator.
