This article is aimed at the investigation of some properties of the Weibull
cumulative exposure model on multiple-step step-stress accelerated life test
data. Although the model includes a probabilistic idea of Miner's rule in order
to express the effect of cumulative damage in fatigue, our result shows that
the application of only this is not sufficient to express degradation of
specimens and the shape parameter must be larger than 1. For a random variable
obeying the model, its average and standard deviation are investigated on a
various sets of parameter values. In addition, a way of checking the validity
of the model is illustrated through an example of the maximum likelihood
estimation on an actual data set, which is about time to breakdown of
cross-linked polyethylene-insulated cables.
