Results of observations of low energy nuclear and electron recoil events in
liquid xenon scintillator detectors are given. The relative scintillation
efficiency for nuclear recoils is 0.22 +/- 0.01 in the recoil energy range 40
keV - 70 keV. Under the assumption of a single dominant decay component to the
scintillation pulse-shape the log-normal mean parameter T0 of the maximum
likelihood estimator of the decay time constant for 6 keV < Eee < 30 keV
nuclear recoil events is equal to 21.0 ns +/- 0.5 ns. It is observed that for
electron recoils T0 rises slowly with energy, having a value ~ 30 ns at Eee ~
15 keV. Electron and nuclear recoil pulse-shapes are found to be well fitted by
single exponential functions although some evidence is found for a double
exponential form for the nuclear recoil pulse-shape.
