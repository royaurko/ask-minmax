The generalization of the Zubarev nonequilibrium statistical operator method
for the case of Renyi statistics is proposed when the relevant statistical
operator (or distribution function) is obtained based on the principle of
maximum for the Renyi entropy. The nonequilibrium statistical operator and
corresponding generalized transport equations for the reduced-description
parameters are obtained. A consistent description of kinetic and hydrodynamic
processes in the system of interacting particles is considered as an example.
