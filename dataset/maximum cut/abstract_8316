The surface flux (and the corresponding observed flux) of a geometrically
thick ``funnel'' shaped disk is computed taking into account the radiation
impinging on the surface from other parts of the disk. It is found that the
ratio of the maximum apparent luminosity to the real luminosity of the disk is
only a factor $\approx 5$ even when the opening angle of the disk is small
($\approx 15^o$). Thus, geometrically beamed emission from ``funnel'' shaped
sub-Eddington disks around stellar mass black holes, cannot explain the
Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources detected in nearby galaxies.
