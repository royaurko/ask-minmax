Uncovering human mobility patterns is of fundamental importance to the
understanding of epidemic spreading, urban transportation and other
socioeconomic dynamics embodying spatiality and human travel. According to the
direct travel diaries of volunteers, we show the absence of scaling properties
in the displacement distribution at the individual level,while the aggregated
displacement distribution follows a power law with an exponential cutoff. Given
the constraint on total travelling cost, this aggregated scaling law can be
analytically predicted by the mixture nature of human travel under the
principle of maximum entropy. A direct corollary of such theory is that the
displacement distribution of a single mode of transportation should follow an
exponential law, which also gets supportive evidences in known data. We thus
conclude that the travelling cost shapes the displacement distribution at the
aggregated level.
