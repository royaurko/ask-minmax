We combined two-dimensional kinematic and morphology information on the
Halpha emission, obtained using near-infrared integral field spectroscopy, with
broad-band photometry to investigate the dynamical structure and the physical
properties of a sample of ten late-type galaxies at 1.0 < z < 1.5. The sample
displays a range of kinematical types which include one merger, one face-on
galaxy, and eight objects showing evidence of rotation. Among these eight
objects, half are rotation-dominated galaxies, while the rest are
dispersion-dominated. We found also that two galaxies out of the
rotation-dominated galaxies are pure rotationally supported disks. They achieve
a maximum velocity of ~180-290 km/s within ~0.5-1 kpc, similar to local spirals
with thin disks. The galaxies of our sample have relatively young stellar
populations (< 1.5 Gyr) and possess a range of stellar mass of 0.6-5 X10^10
Msun. In addition, most of them have not yet converted the majority of their
gas into stars (six galaxies have their gas fraction >50 per cent). Therefore,
those of them which already have a stable disk will probably have their final
stellar mass similar to the present-day spirals, to which these rotating
systems can be seen as precursors. We conclude our study by investigating the
stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation at 1.2 < z < 1.5.
