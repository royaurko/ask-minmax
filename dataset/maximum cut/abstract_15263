We consider dynamic versions of the mutual information of lifetime
distributions, with focus on past lifetimes, residual lifetimes and mixed
lifetimes evaluated at different instants. This allows to study multicomponent
systems, by measuring the dependence in conditional lifetimes of two components
having possibly different ages. We provide some bounds, and investigate the
mutual information of residual lifetimes within the time-transformed
exponential model (under both the assumptions of unbounded and truncated
lifetimes). Moreover, with reference to the order statistics of a random
sample, we evaluate explicitly the mutual information between the minimum and
the maximum, conditional on inspection at different times, and show that it is
distribution-free. Finally, we develop a copula-based approach aiming to
express the dynamic mutual information for past and residual bivariate
lifetimes in an alternative way.
