Information (I) is defined as the amount of the data after data compression.
The first law of information theory: the total amount of data L (the sum of
entropy S and information I) of an isolated system remains unchanged. The
second law of information theory: Information I of an isolated system decreases
to a minimum at equilibrium. The third law of information theory: For a solid
structure of perfect symmetry (e.g., a perfect crystal), the information I is
zero and the (information theory) entropy (called by me as static entropy for
solid state) S is at the maximum. Gibbs Paradox has been resolved.
Spontaneously mixed substances at gaseous state can be spontaneously separated
at condensed phases (solid or liquid states), driving only by information loss
or by the increase in (information theory) entropy. None of the typical pure
mixing or separation processes are driving by free energy minimization and the
free energy (or total amount of chemical potential) has no change during the
processes of ideal mixture formation or ideal mixture separation. The
thermodynamic entropy change for the formation of ideal mixtures of gases,
liquids or solids is always zero.
