Let $\xi(n, x)$ be the local time at $x$ for a recurrent one-dimensional
random walk in random environment after $n$ steps, and consider the maximum
$\xi^*(n) = \max_x \xi(n,x)$. It is known that $\limsup \xi^*(n)/n$ is a
positive constant a.s. We prove that $\liminf_n (\log\log\log n)\xi^*(n)/n$ is
a positive constant a.s.; this answers a question of P. R\'ev\'esz (1990). The
proof is based on an analysis of the {\em valleys /} in the environment,
defined as the potential wells of record depth. In particular, we show that
almost surely, at any time $n$ large enough, the random walker has spent almost
all of its lifetime in the two deepest valleys of the environment it has
encountered. We also prove a uniform exponential tail bound for the ratio of
the expected total occupation time of a valley and the expected local time at
its bottom.
