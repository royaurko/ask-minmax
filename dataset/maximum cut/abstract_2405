Progress in the Effective Field Theory of two and three nucleon systems is
sketched, concentrating mainly on the low energy version in which pions are
integrated out as explicit degrees of freedom. Examples given are: the
extraction of nucleon polarisabilities from deuteron Compton scattering at very
low energies; the energy dependence of the nucleon polarisabilities; three body
forces and the triton; and $\mathrm{nd}$ partial waves at momenta below the
pion cut.
