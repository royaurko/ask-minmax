The Schottky barrier height (SBH) is mapped with nanoscale resolution at pure
Au/Si(001) and mixed Au/Ag/Si(001) interfaces utilizing ballistic electron
emission microscopy (BEEM) by acquiring and fitting spectra every 11.7 nm over
a 1 micron by 1 micron area. The energetic distribution of the SBH for the
mixed interfaces contain several local maximums indicative of a mixture of
metal species at the interface. To estimate the composition at the interface,
the distributions are fit to multiple Gaussians that account for the species,
"pinch-off" effects, and defects. This electrostatic composition is compared to
Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and x-ray photo-emission
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to relate it to the physical composition at the
interface.
