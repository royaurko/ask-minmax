We present results of a Monte Carlo study of temperature-programmed
desorption in a model system with attractive lateral interactions. It is shown
that even for weak interactions there are large shifts of the peak maximum
temperatures with initial coverage. The system has a transition temperature
below which the desorption has a negative order. An analytical expression for
this temperature is derived. The relation between the model and real systems is
discussed.
