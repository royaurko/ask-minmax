We demonstrate the injection and detection of electrically and thermally
generated spin currents probed in Co$_2$MnSi/Cu lateral spin valves. Devices
with different electrode separations are patterned to measure the non-local
signal as a function of the electrode spacing and we determine a relatively
high effective spin polarization $\alpha$ of Co$_2$MnSi to be 0.63 and the spin
diffusion length of Cu to be 500 nm at room temperature. The electrically
generated non-local signal is measured as a function of temperature and a
maximum signal is observed for a temperature of 80 K. The thermally generated
non-local signal is measured as a function of current density and temperature
in a second harmonic measurement detection scheme. We find different
temperature dependences for the electrically and thermally generated non-local
signals, which allows us to conclude that the temperature dependence of the
signals is not just dominated by the transport in the Cu wire, but that there
is a crucial contribution from the different generation mechanisms, which has
been largely disregarded to date.
