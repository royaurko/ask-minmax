The maximum entropy of a quantized surface is demonstrated to be proportional
to the surface area in the classical limit. The general structure of the
horizon spectrum and the value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter are found. The
discrete spectrum of thermal radiation of a black hole fits naturally the Wien
profile. The natural widths of the lines are very small as compared to the
distances between them. The total intensity of the thermal radiation is
calculated.
