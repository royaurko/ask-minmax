We have studied some transport properties of cold atoms in an accelerated
optical lattice in the presence of decohering effects due to spontaneous
emission. One new feature added is the effect of an external AC drive. As a
result we obtain a tunable diffusion coefficient and it's nonlinear enhancement
with increasing drive amplitude. We report an interesting maximum diffusion
condition.
