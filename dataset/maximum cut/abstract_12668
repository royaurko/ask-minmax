We use several variants of the detrended fluctuation analysis to study the
appearance of long-term persistence in temperature records, obtained at 95
stations all over the globe. Our results basically confirm earlier studies. We
find that the persistence, characterized by the correlation C(s) of temperature
variations separated by s days, decays for large s as a power law, C(s) ~
s^(-gamma). For continental stations, including stations along the coastlines,
we find that gamma is always close to 0.7. For stations on islands, we find
that gamma ranges between 0.3 and 0.7, with a maximum at gamma = 0.4. This is
consistent with earlier studies of the persistence in sea surface temperature
records where gamma is close to 0.4. In all cases, the exponent gamma does not
depend on the distance of the stations to the continental coastlines. By
varying the degree of detrending in the fluctuation analysis we obtain also
information about trends in the temperature records.
