We extend previous work on alkali halides by calculations for the heavy-atom
species RbF, RbCl, LiBr, NaBr, KBr, RbBr, LiI, NaI, KI, and RbI. Relativistic
effects are included by means of energy-consistent pseudopotentials,
correlations are treated at the coupled-cluster level. A striking deficiency of
the Hartree-Fock approach are lattice constants deviating by up to 7.5 % from
experimental values which is reduced to a maximum error of 2.4 % by taking into
account electron correlation. Besides, we provide ab-initio data for in-crystal
polarizabilities and van der Waals coefficients.
