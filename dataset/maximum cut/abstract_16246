We have recently shown that both the Prugniel-Simien model and Sersic's
function (hereafter referred to as the Einasto model when applied to internal
density profiles) describe simulated dark matter halos better than an NFW-like
model with equal number of parameters. Here we provide analytical expressions
for the logarithmic slopes of these models, and compare them with data from
real galaxies. Depending on the Einasto parameters of the dark matter halo, one
can expect an extrapolated, inner (0.01--1 kpc), logarithmic profile slope
ranging from -0.2 to -1.5, with a typical value at 0.1 kpc around -0.7.
Application of this (better fitting) model therefore alleviates some of the
past disagreement with observations on this issue. We additionally provide
useful expressions for the concentration and assorted scale radii: r_s, r_{-2},
r_e, R_e, r_virial, and r_max -- the radius where the circular velocity profile
has its maximum value. We also present the circular velocity profiles and the
radial behavior of rho(r)/sigma(r)^3 for both the Einasto and Prugniel-Simien
models. We find this representation of the phase-space density profile to be
well approximated by a power-law with slope slightly shallower than -2 near
r=r_{-2}.
