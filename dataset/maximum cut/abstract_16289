We investigate theoretically the possibility of a wetting transition induced
by geometric roughness of a solid substrate for the case where the flat
substrate does not show a wetting layer. Our approach makes use of a novel
closed-form expression which relates the interaction between two sinusoidally
modulated interfaces to the interaction between two flat interfaces. Within the
harmonic approximation, we find that roughness-induced wetting is indeed
possible if the substrate roughness, quantified by the substrate surface area,
exceeds a certain threshold. In addition, the molecular interactions between
the substrate and the wetting substance have to satisfy several conditions.
These results are expressed in terms of a lower bound on the wetting potential
for a flat substrate in order for roughness-induced wetting to occur. This
lower bound has the following properties: A minimum is present at zero or very
small separation between the two interfaces, as characteristic for the
non-wetting situation in the flat case. Most importantly, the wetting potential
needs to have a pronounced maximum at a separation comparable to the amplitude
of the substrate roughness. These findings are in agreement with the
experimental observation of roughness-induced surface premelting at a glass-ice
interface as well as the calculation of the dispersion interaction for the
corresponding glass-water-ice system.
