We consider a self-similar phase space with specific fractal dimension $d$
being distributed with spectrum function $f(d)$. Related thermostatistics is
shown to be governed by the Tsallis formalism of the non-extensive statistics,
where the non-additivity parameter is equal to ${\bar\tau}(q)\equiv
1/\tau(q)>1$, and the multifractal function $\tau(q)= qd_q-f(d_q)$ is the
specific heat determined with multifractal parameter $q\in [1,\infty)$. In this
way, the equipartition law is shown to take place. Optimization of the
multifractal spectrum function $f(d)$ derives the relation between the
statistical weight and the system complexity. It is shown the statistical
weight exponent $\tau(q)$ can be modeled by hyperbolic tangent deformed in
accordance with both Tsallis and Kaniadakis exponentials to describe arbitrary
multifractal phase space explicitly. The spectrum function $f(d)$ is proved to
increase monotonically from minimum value $f=-1$ at $d=0$ to maximum one $f=1$
at $d=1$. At the same time, the number of monofractals increases with growth of
the phase space volume at small dimensions $d$ and falls down in the limit
$d\to 1$.
