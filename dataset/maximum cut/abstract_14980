A recently introduced parameter, the ratio of an aggregate solid mass to a
solid mass of an intraaggregate matrix (K ratio) is connected with the mean
thickness of a deformable, but non-shrinking surface layer of aggregates and is
a fundamental property of aggregated soils that essentially influences their
shrinkage. The objective of this work is to suggest and validate an approach to
estimating the K ratio at any soil clay content through characteristics of soil
texture and structure. We derive an equation that reflects the interrelation
between the K ratio and soil texture and structure. The K ratio can be
estimated as the solution of the equation and is determined by the mean size of
soil solids and the maximum size of soil aggregates in the oven-dried state,
independently of a measured shrinkage curve. To validate the approach we use
available data for eight soils.
