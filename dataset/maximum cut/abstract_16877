(abridged) We present the results of the long-term hard X-ray monitoring of
the high mass X-ray binary 2S 0114+65 with INTEGRAL/IBIS from 2003 to 2008. 2S
0114+65 is a variable hard X-ray source, when 2S 0114+65 was bright, we found a
pulse period evolution of $\sim 2.67$ hour to 2.63 hour from 2003 -- 2008, with
a spin-up rate of the neutron star $\sim 1.09\times 10^{-6}$ s s$^{-1}$.
Compared with the previous reported spin-up rate, the spin-up rate of the
neutron star in 2S 0114+65 is accelerating. The spectral properties of 2S
0114+65 in the band of 18 -- 100 keV which changed with the orbital phases. The
variation of the power-law photon index over orbital phase anticorrelates with
hard X-ray flux, and the variation of $E_{\rm cut}$ has a positive correlation
with the hard X-ray flux, implying that the harder spectrum at the maximum of
the light curve. The variations of spectral properties over orbital phase
suggested 2S 0114+65 as a highly obscured binary system. In some observational
revolutions, hard X-ray tails above 70 keV are detected. We study the
characteristics of the hard X-ray tails combining JEM-X and IBIS data in the
energy range of 3 -- 100 keV. The 3 -- 100 keV spectra of 2S 0114+65 are
generally fitted by an absorbed power-law model with high energy cutoff. We
discover that the hard X-ray tails are only detected when column density is
very low. Thus, high column density leads to disappearance of the hard X-ray
tails in this wind-fed neutron star accretion binary.
