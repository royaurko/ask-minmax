We present optical spectra of the peculiar Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 1999ac.
The data extend from -15 to +42 days with respect to B-band maximum and reveal
an event that is unusual in several respects. Prior to B-band maximum, the
spectra resemble those of SN 1999aa, a slowly declining event, but possess
stronger SiII and CaII signatures (more characteristic of a spectroscopically
normal SN). Spectra after B-band maximum appear more normal. The expansion
velocities inferred from the Iron lines appear to be lower than average;
whereas, the expansion velocity inferred from Calcium H and K are higher than
average. The expansion velocities inferred from SiII are among the slowest ever
observed, though SN 1999ac is not particularly dim. The analysis of the
parameters v_10, R(SiII), dv(SiII)/dt, and d_m15 further underlines the unique
characteristics of SN 1999ac. We find convincing evidence of CII 6580 in the
day -15 spectrum with ejection velocity v > 16,000 km/s, but this signature
disappears by day -9. This rapid evolution at early times highlights the
importance of extremely early-time spectroscopy.
