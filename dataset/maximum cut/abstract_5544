The internal structure of deuterons weakly influences a motion of their
center of mass (translational motion). The scenario can be different when the
translational wave function has a formal singularity along the line (thread)
connecting the deuteron and another Coulomb center. The singularity is cut off
by fluctuations of nuclear internal degrees of freedom and the wave function
becomes smooth with the narrow peak. The peak is associated with the certain
potential well which is localized on the thread and dominates the Coulomb
barrier. As a result, the deuteron is able to move along the thread with no
classical reflection. Two deuterons can get in contact despite their energy is
low. This is not an underbarrier motion but one along the region which became
classically allowed due to the thread well. In experiments nuclear threads can
be formed by the incident particle flux if to adjust its angular distribution
at large distances.
