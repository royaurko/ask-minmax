We study the effect of turbulent drift of a large-scale magnetic field that
results from the interaction of helical convective motions and differential
rotation in the solar convection zone. The principal direction of the drift
corresponds to the direction of the large-scale vorticity vector. Thus, the
effect produces a latitudinal transport of the large-scale magnetic field in
the convective zone wherever the angular velocity has a strong radial gradient.
The direction of the drift depends on the sign of helicity and it is defined by
the Parker-Yoshimura rule. The analytic calculations are done within the
framework of mean-field magnetohydrodynamics using the minimal
\tau-approximation. We estimate the magnitude of the drift velocity and find
that it can be several m/s near the base of the solar convection zone. The
implications of this effect for the solar dynamo are illustrated on the basis
of an axisymmetric mean-field dynamo model with a subsurface shear layer. We
find that the helicity--vorticity pumping effect can have an influence on the
features of the sunspot time--latitude diagram, producing a fast drift of the
sunspot activity maximum at the rise phase of the cycle and a slow drift at the
decay phase of the cycle.
