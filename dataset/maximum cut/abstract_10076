We have studied the 1.5 $\mu$m photoluminescence (PL) from Er ions after
annealing two different sample sets in the temperature range 500 &deg;C to 1100
&deg;C. The different sample sets were made by magnetron sputtering from
composite targets of Si+SiO2+Er and Ge+SiO2+Er respectively for the different
sample sets. The annealing induces Si - and Ge-nanoclusters respectively in the
different film sets. The PL peak reaches its maximum intensity after annealing
at 700 &deg;C for samples with Ge nanoclusters and after annealing at 800
&deg;C for samples with Si. No luminescence from nanoclusters was detected in
neither sample sets. This is interpreted as an energy transfer from the
nanocluster to Er atoms. Transmission electron microscopy shows that after
annealing to the respective temperature yielding the maximum PL intensity both
the Ge and Si clusters are non-crystalline. Here we mainly compare the spectral
shape of Er luminescence emitted in these different nanostructured matrixes.
The PL spectral shapes are clearly different and witness a different local
environment for the Er ions.
