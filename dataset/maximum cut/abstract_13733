We investigate the properties of an $N$-site tight-binding lattice with
periodic boundary condition (PBC) in the presence of a pair of gain and loss
impurities $\pm i\gamma$, and two tunneling amplitudes $t_0,t_b$ that are
constant along the two paths that connect them. We show that the parity and
time-reversal ($\mP\mT$)-symmetric phase of the lattice with PBC is robust,
insensitive to the distance between the impurities, and that the critical
impurity strength for PT-symmetry breaking is given by $\gamma_{PT}=|t_0-t_b|$.
We study the time-evolution of a typical wave packet, initially localized on a
single site, across the PT-symmetric phase boundary. We find that it acquires
chirality with increasing $\gamma$, and the chirality reaches a universal
maximum value at the threshold, $\gamma=\gamma_{PT}$, irrespective of the
initial location of the wave packet or the lattice parameters. Our results
imply that PT-symmetry breaking on a lattice with PBC has consequences that
have no counterpart in open chains.
