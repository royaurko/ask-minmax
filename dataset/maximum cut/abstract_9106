In this article I review two data analysis methods for determining the mass
(and eventually the spin-independent cross section on nucleons) of Weakly
Interacting Massive Particles with positive signals from direct Dark Matter
detection experiments: a maximum likelihood analysis with only one experiment
and a model-independent method requiring at least two experiments.
Uncertainties and caveats of these methods will also be discussed.
