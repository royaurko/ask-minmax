We report the formation of bound states in the continuum for Dirac-like
fermions in structures composed by a trilayer graphene flake connected to
nanoribbon leads. The existence of this kind of localized states can be proved
by combining local density of states and electronic conductance calculations.
By applying a gate voltage, the bound states couple to the continuum, yielding
a maximum in the electronic transmission. This feature can be exploited to
identify bound states in the continuum in graphene-based structures.
