We report on the calculation of the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to
the production of ttbar pairs in association with two hard jets at the Fermilab
TeVatron and CERN Large Hadron Collider. Results for the integrated and
differential cross sections are given. The corrections with respect to leading
order are negative and moderate. A study of the scale dependence of our NLO
predictions indicates that the residual theoretical uncertainty, due to higher
order corrections, is 21% for the TeVatron and 15% for the LHC. In case of the
TeVatron, the forward-backward asymmetry of the top quark is calculated for the
first time at next-to-leading order. With the inclusive selection of cuts, this
asymmetry amounts to A_FB = -10.3% at leading order and A_FB = -4.6% at
next-to-leading order. All results presented in this paper have been obtained
with the help of the HELAC-NLO package.
