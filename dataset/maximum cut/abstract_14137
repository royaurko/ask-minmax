The local when earthquake prediction is based on the connection between
geomagnetic quakes and the next incoming minimum or maximum of tidal
gravitational potential. The probability time window for the predicted
earthquake is for the tidal minimum approximately +/-1 day and for the maximum-
+/-2 days. The preliminary statistic estimation on the basis of distribution of
the time difference between occurred and predicted earthquakes for the period
2002- 2003 for Sofia region is given. The possibility for creating a local
when, where earthquake research and prediction NETWORK is based on the accurate
monitoring of the electromagnetic field with special space and time scales
under, on and over the Earth surface. The periodically upgraded information
from seismic hazard maps and other standard geodetic information as well as
other precursory information is essential.
