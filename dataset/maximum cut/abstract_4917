Gamma-ray binaries are orbital modulated gamma-ray sources in the Galaxy
detected both at GeV and TeV energies. The high-energy radiation may come from
the interaction of energetic electrons injected by a young pulsar and photons
from the massive companion star. We present a model for the production of
high-energy radiation where emission, absorption and pair cascading are
considered. New observations of LS I +61 303 by the Fermi Space Telescope
revealed an exponential cut-off in the spectrum at a few GeV, inconsistent with
gamma-gamma absorption. Electrons radiating at GeV and TeV have probably two
different origins. We investigate whether the emission from the unshocked
pulsar wind explains the GeV component in LS I +61 303.
