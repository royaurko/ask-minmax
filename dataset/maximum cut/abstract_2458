We have generated more than 100 watts of radial polarized beam from a Yb
fiber laser using a photonics crystal segmented half-wave-plate. We
demonstrated the high power handling capability of such a photonics crystal
segmented half-wave-plate and show that it is a promising external radial
polarization converter for high power Yb fiber laser used in laser cutting
industry.
