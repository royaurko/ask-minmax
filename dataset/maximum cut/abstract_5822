In spite of the apparent lack of Si II and S II features in its spectra, SN
2002cx was classified as a peculiar Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) on the basis of
its overall photometric and spectroscopic behavior. Spectra obtained near
maximum light contained Fe III features, as in SN 1991T-like events, but the
blueshifts of the Fe III absorptions were exceptionally low. The luminosity
also was low. We use the supernova synthetic--spectrum code SYNOW to study line
identifications in SN 2002cx. We find that the maximum-light spectra appear to
contain weak features of Si II, S II, Si III, and Ca II, which strengthens the
connection with SN 1991T-like events. We show that later spectra, obtained 12,
25, and 56 days after maximum, consist of P-Cygni resonance-scattering features
due to permitted Fe II and Co II lines. SN 2002cx had been thought to have made
the transition from a permitted-line to a forbidden-line spectrum between 25
and 56 days. Owing to the low expansion velocities the postmaximum spectral
features are narrower and easier to identify than they are in other SNe Ia. SN
2002cx will lead to improved line identifications in other SNe Ia and clarify
when the transition from a permitted-line to a forbidden-line spectrum occurs.
In the context of current SN Ia explosion models, we suggest that the
properties of SN 2002cx may be consistent with 3D deflagration models, which
are not favored for normal SNe Ia.
