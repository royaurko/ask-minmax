Neutron powder diffraction and single crystal x-ray resonant magnetic
scattering measurements suggest that Dy plays an active role in enhancing the
ferroelectric polarization in multiferroic DyMnO3 above TNDy = 6.5 K. We
observe the evolution of an incommensurate ordering of Dy moments with the same
periodicity as the Mn spiral ordering. It closely tracks the evolution of the
ferroelectric polarization which reaches a maximum value of 0.2 muC/m^2. Below
TNDy, where Dy spins order commensurately, the polarization decreases to values
similar for those of TbMnO3.
