The Landau-gauge gluon propagator is computed for the SU(3) gauge theory on
lattices up to a size of $32^3 \times 200$. We use the standard Wilson action
at $\beta = 6.0$ and compare our results with previous computations using large
asymmetric and symmetric lattices. In particular, we focus on the impact of the
lattice geometry and momentum cuts to achieve compatibility between data from
symmetric and asymmetric lattices for a large range of momenta.
