In this paper, convergence results on the solutions of a time and space
discrete model approximation of the Boltzmann equation for a gas of Maxwellian
particles in a bounded domain, obtained by Babovsky and Illner [1989], are
extended to approximate the solutions of the Boltzmann equation in the whole
physical space. This is done for a class of particle interactions including
Maxwell and soft cut-off potentials in the sense of Grad.
  The main result shows that the solutions of the discrete model converge in
$\mathbb{L}^1$ to the solutions of the Boltzmann equation, when the
discretization parameters go simultaneously to zero. The convergence is uniform
with respect to the discretization parameters.
  In addition, a sufficient condition for the implementation of the main result
is provided.
