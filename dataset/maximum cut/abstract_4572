Ultrarelativistic heavy ion beams carry large electromagnetic and strong
absorptive fields, allowing exploration of a variety of physics. Two-photon,
photon-Pomeron, and double Pomeron interactions can probe a huge variety of
couplings and final states. RHIC will be the first heavy ion accelerator
energetic enough to produce hadronic final states via coherent couplings.
Virtual photons from the nuclear EM fields can interact in two-photon
interactions, which can be exploited to study many particle spectroscopy and
QCD topics. Because the photon flux scales as $Z^2$, Two-photon luminosities
are large up to an energy of about \gamma\hbar c/R~ 3 GeV/c. Photon-Pomeron
interactions are sensitive to how different vector mesons, including the
$J/\psi$, interact with nuclear matter. $PP$ collisions rates are sensitive to
the range of the Pomeron. Signals can be separated from backgrounds by using
cuts on final state isolation (rapidity gaps) and $p_\perp$. We present Monte
Carlo studies of different backgrounds, showing that representative signals can
be extracted with good rates and signal to noise ratios.
