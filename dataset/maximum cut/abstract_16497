In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the Gaussian quasi maximum
likelihood estimator of a stationary GARCH process with heavy-tailed
innovations. This means that the innovations are regularly varying with index
$\alpha\in(2,4)$. Then, in particular, the marginal distribution of the GARCH
process has infinite fourth moment and standard asymptotic theory with normal
limits and $\sqrt{n}$-rates breaks down. This was recently observed by Hall and
Yao [Econometrica 71 (2003) 285--317]. It is the aim of this paper to indicate
that the limit theory for the parameter estimators in the heavy-tailed case
nevertheless very much parallels the normal asymptotic theory. In the
light-tailed case, the limit theory is based on the CLT for stationary ergodic
finite variance martingale difference sequences. In the heavy-tailed case such
a general result does not exist, but an analogous result with infinite variance
stable limits can be shown to hold under certain mixing conditions which are
satisfied for GARCH processes. It is the aim of the paper to give a general
structural result for infinite variance limits which can also be applied in
situations more general than GARCH.
