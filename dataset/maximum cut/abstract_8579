It is developed a very complex system (hardware/software) to detect
luminosity variations connected with the discovery of new planets outside the
Solar System. Traditional imaging approaches are very demanding in terms of
computing time; then, the implementation of an automatic vision and decision
software architecture is presented. It allows to perform an on-line
discrimination of interesting events by using two levels of triggers. A
fundamental challenge was to work with very large CCD camera (even 16k*16k
pixels) in line with very large telescopes. Then, the architecture can use a
distributed parallel network system based on a maximum of 256 standard
workstations.
