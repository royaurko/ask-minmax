Photometric observations of the supersoft X-ray source 1E 0035.4-7230
obtained during two years reveal that the very blue optical counterpart (V
(maximum)=20.2, B-V=-0.15, U-B=-1.06) undergoes nearly sinusoidal variations
with a period of 0.1719256 days and an amplitude of Delta V~0.3 mag. ROSAT
observations show the X-rays vary with approximately the same period. However,
either the X-ray minimum precedes the optical minimum by about a quarter cycle
or there is a small period difference between the two wavelength regions. We
consider that this X-ray source is a close binary, with the optical light
coming primarily from an accretion disk surrounding the compact star. Optical
spectra show weak, variable He II (4686 Angstrom) emission which probably
originates in this disk. Possible interpretations of the light curve are
discussed, including X-ray heating of the secondary star. The very broad
minimum in the X-ray light curve suggests the X-rays may be scattered in a
large accretion disk corona (ADC) which is partially occulted, probably by an
azimuthally irregular bulge on the disk rim. If this system lies at the
distance of the Small Magellanic Cloud, it radiates near the Eddington
luminosity.
