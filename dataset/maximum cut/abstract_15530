We consider relations between the size, treewidth, and local crossing number
(maximum crossings per edge) of graphs embedded on topological surfaces. We
show that an $n$-vertex graph embedded on a surface of genus $g$ with at most
$k$ crossings per edge has treewidth $O(\sqrt{gkn})$ and layered treewidth
$O(gk)$, and that these bounds are tight up to a constant factor. As a special
case, the $k$-planar graphs with $n$ vertices have treewidth $O(\sqrt{kn})$ and
layered treewidth $O(k)$, which are tight bounds that improve a previously
known $O(k^{3/4}n^{1/2})$ treewidth bound. Additionally, we show that for
$g<m$, every $m$-edge graph can be embedded on a surface of genus $g$ with
$O((m/g)\log^2 g)$ crossings per edge, which is tight to within a
polylogarithmic factor.
