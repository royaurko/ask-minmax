The influence of higher-order terms in the K\"{a}hler potential of the
supergravity D-term inflation model on the density perturbation is studied. We
show that these terms can make the inflaton potential flatter, which lowers the
energy scale of inflation under the COBE/WMAP normalization. As a result, the
mass per unit length of cosmic strings, which are produced at the end of
inflation, can be reduced to a harmless but detectable level without
introducing a tiny Yukawa coupling. Our scenario can naturally be implemented
in models with a low cut-off as in Type I or Type IIB orientifold models.
