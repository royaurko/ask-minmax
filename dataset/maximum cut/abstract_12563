To seek for a possible origin of fractal pattern in nature, we perform a
molecular dynamics simulation for a fragmentation of an infinite fcc lattice.
The fragmentation is induced by the initial condition of the model that the
lattice particles have the Hubble-type radial expansion velocities. As time
proceeds, the average density decreases and density fluctuation develops. By
using the box counting method, it is found that the frequency-size plot of the
density follows instantaneously a universal power-law for each Hubble constant
up to the size of a cross-over. This cross-over size corresponds to the maximum
size of fluctuation and is found to obey a dynamical scaling law as a function
of time. This instantaneous generation of a nascent fractal is purely of
dynamical origin and it shows us a new formation mechanism of a fractal
patterns different from the traditional criticality concept.
