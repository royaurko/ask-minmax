The gravitaional force produced by a point particle, like the sun, in the
background of the static Einstein universe is studied. Both the approximate
solution in the weak field limit and exact solution are obtained. The main
properties of the solution are {\it i}) near the point particle, the metric
approaches the Schwarzschild one and the radius of its singularity becomes
larger than that of the Schwarzschild singularity, {\it ii}) far from the point
particle, the metric approaches the static Einstein closed universe. The
maximum length of the equator of the universe becomes smaller than that of the
static Einstein universe due to the existence of the point particle. These
properties show the strong correlation betweem the particle and the universe.
