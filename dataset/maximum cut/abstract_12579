New results from the energy scan programme of NA49, in particular kaon
production at 30 AGeV and phi production at 40 and 80 AGeV are presented. The
K+/pi+ ratio shows a pronounced maximum at 30 AGeV; the kaon slope parameters
are constant at SPS energies. Both findings support the scenario of a phase
transition at about 30 AGeV beam energy. The phi/pi ratio increases smoothly
with beam energy, showing an energy dependence similar to K-/pi-. The measured
particle yields can be reproduced by a hadron gas model, with chemical
freeze-out parameters on a smooth curve in the T-muB plane. The transverse
spectra can be understood as resulting from a rapidly expanding, locally
equilibrated source. No evidence for an earlier kinetic decoupling of heavy
hyperons is found.
