We address four unique signatures in pulsar gamma-ray radiation as predicted
by polar-cap models. These signatures are expected to be present nearby the
spectral high-energy cutoff at around several GeV. Their magnitude and,
therefore, their observability depends strongly on the orientational factors,
the rotation, as well as on the details of the polar cap structure. These
strong predictions are likely to be verified by the NASA's future gamma-ray
mission GLAST.
