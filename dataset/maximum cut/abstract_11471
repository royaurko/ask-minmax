We observed the entire course of the 1998 outburst of V592 Her, which was
originally reported as a nova in 1968. We have been able to construct a full
light curve of the outburst, which is characterized by a rapid initial decline
(0.98 mag/d), which smoothly developed into a plateau phase with a slower
linear decline. We detected superhumps characteristic to SU UMa-type dwarf
novae ~7 d after the optical maximum. The overall behavior of the light curve
and the development of superhumps were characteristic to a WZ Sge-type dwarf
nova. Combined with the past literature, we have been able to uniquely
determine the superhump period to be 0.05648(2) d. From this period, together
with a modern interpretation of the absolute magnitude of the outburst light
curve, we conclude that the overall picture of V592 Her is not inconsistent
with a lower main-sequence secondary star in contrast to a previous claim that
V592 Her contains a brown dwarf.
