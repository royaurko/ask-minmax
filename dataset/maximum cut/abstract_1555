The inclusion of higher-dimensional gauge invariant operators induces new
Lorentz structures in Higgs couplings with electroweak gauge boson pairs. This
in principle affects the kinematics of Higgs production and decay, thereby
modifying the efficiencies of the experimental cuts compared to what
simulations based on the standard model interactions yield. Taking some sample
cases, we perform a rigorous analysis of how the efficiencies differ for
various strengths of the additional operator vis-a-vis the standard model
interactions, scanning over the values of both of them. While the response to
cuts can be markedly different in some regions, we find that the sensitivity to
new operator structures is relatively limited, so long as we remain confined to
the 2-sigma regions around the best fit signal strengths measured at the Large
Hadron Collider. We also show modifications to certain kinematical
distributions including the new operators in the diphoton final state.
