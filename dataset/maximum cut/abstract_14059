We study the transverse-size effect of a quasi-one-dimensional rectangular
waveguide on the single-photon scattering on a two-level system. We calculate
the transmission and reflection coefficients for single incident photons using
the scattering formalism based on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. When the
transverse size of the waveguide is larger than a critical size, we find that
the transverse mode will be involved in the single-photon scattering. Including
the coupling to a higher traverse mode, we find that the photon in the lowest
channel will be lost into the other channel, corresponding to the other
transverse modes, when the input energy is larger than the maximum bound-state
energy. Three kinds of resonance phenomena are predicted: single-photon
resonance, photonic Feshbach resonance, and cutoff (minimum) frequency
resonance. At these resonances, the input photon is completely reflected.
