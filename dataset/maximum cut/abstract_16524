Saturn is a dual-purpose accelerator. It can be operated as a large-area
flash x-ray source for simulation testing or as a Z-pinch driver especially for
K-line x-ray production. In the first mode, the accelerator is fitted with
three concentric-ring 2-MV electron diodes, while in the Z-pinch mode the
current of all the modules is combined via a post-hole convolute arrangement
and driven through a cylindrical array of very fine wires. We present here a
point design for a new Saturn class driver based on a number of linear
inductive voltage adders connected in parallel. A technology recently
implemented at the Institute of High Current Electronics in Tomsk (Russia) is
being utilized[1].
  In the present design we eliminate Marx generators and pulse-forming
networks. Each inductive voltage adder cavity is directly fed by a number of
fast 100-kV small-size capacitors arranged in a circular array around each
accelerating gap. The number of capacitors connected in parallel to each cavity
defines the total maximum current. By selecting low inductance switches,
voltage pulses as short as 30-50-ns FWHM can be directly achieved.
