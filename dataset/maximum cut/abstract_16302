Resonant photoemission (RPES) at the Ce 3d -> 4f threshold has been performed
for alpha-like compound CeNi_2 with extremely high energy resolution (full
width at half maximum < 0.2 eV) to obtain bulk-sensitive 4f spectral weight.
The on-resonance spectrum shows a sharp resolution-limited peak near the Fermi
energy which can be assigned to the tail of the Kondo resonance. However, the
spin-orbit side band around 0.3 eV binding energy corresponding to the f_{7/2}
peak is washed out, in contrast to the RPES spectrum at the Ce 3d -> 4f RPES
threshold. This is interpreted as due to the different surface sensitivity, and
the bulk-sensitive Ce 3d -> 4f RPES spectra are found to be consistent with
other electron spectroscopy and low energy properties for alpha-like
Ce-transition metal compounds, thus resolves controversy on the interpretation
of Ce compound photoemission. The 4f spectral weight over the whole valence
band can also be fitted fairly well with the Gunnarsson-Schoenhammer
calculation of the single impurity Anderson model, although the detailed
features show some dependence on the hybridization band shape and (possibly) Ce
5d emissions.
