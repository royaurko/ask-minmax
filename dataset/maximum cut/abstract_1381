We present results on bulk thermodynamic quantities as well as net baryon
number, strangeness and electric charge fluctuations in QCD at non-zero density
and temperature obtained from lattice calculations with almost physical quark
masses for two values of the lattice cut-off $aT=1/4$ and 1/6 . We show that
with our improved p4fa3-action the cut-off effects are under control when using
lattices with a temporal extent of 6 or larger and that the contribution to the
equation of state, which is due to a finite chemical potential is small for
$\mu_q/T<1$. Moreover, at vanishing chemical potential, i.e. under conditions
almost realized at RHIC and the LHC, quartic fluctuations of net baryon number
and strangeness are large in a narrow temperature interval characterizing the
transition region from the low to high temperature phase. At non-zero baryon
number density, strangeness fluctuations are enhanced and correlated to
fluctuations of the net baryon number. If strangeness is furthermore forced to
vanish, as it may be the case in systems created in heavy ion collisions,
strangeness fluctuations are significantly smaller than baryon number
fluctuations.
