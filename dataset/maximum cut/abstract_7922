Existing models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) find it
very difficult to get a Higgs of mass lighter than $m_t$. Consequently, in
light of the LHC discovery of the ~125 GeV Higgs, such models face a
significant obstacle. Moreover, with three generations those models have a
superheavy cut-off around $10^{17}$ GeV, requiring a significant fine-tuning.
To overcome these twin difficulties, we propose a hybrid framework for EWSB, in
which the Higgs mechanism is combined with a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio mechanism. The
model introduces a strongly coupled doublet of heavy quarks with a mass around
500 GeV, which forms a condensate at a compositeness scale $\Lambda$ about a
few TeV, and an additional unconstrained scalar doublet which behaves as a
"fundamental" doublet at $\Lambda$. This "fundamental"-like doublet has a
vanishing quartic term at $\Lambda$ and is, therefore, not the SM doublet, but
should rather be viewed as a pseudo-Goldstone boson of the underlying strong
dynamics. This setup is matched at the compositeness scale $\Lambda$ to a
tightly constrained hybrid two Higgs doublet model, where both the composite
and unconstrained scalars participate in EWSB. This allows us to get a good
candidate for the recently observed 125 GeV scalar which has properties very
similar to the Standard Model Higgs. The heavier (mostly composite) CP-even
scalar has a mass around 500 GeV, while the pseudoscalar and the charged Higgs
particles have masses in the range 200 -300 GeV.
