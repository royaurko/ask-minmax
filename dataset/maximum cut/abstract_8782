We deal with the integral functional of the calculus of variations assuming
that the gradient of the integrand is Lipschitzian. We then prove that if this
gradient does not vanish at zero, then the functional has a unique minimum and
a unique maximum on each sphere, centered at zero, with radius small enough.
