Observations of the WC9+OB system WR 65 in the infrared show variations of
its dust emission consistent with a period near 4.8~yr, suggesting formation in
a colliding-wind binary (CWB) having an elliptical orbit. If we adopt the IR
maximum as zero phase, the times of X-ray maximum count and minimum extinction
to the hard component measured by Oskinova & Hamann fall at phases 0.4--0.5,
when the separation of the WC9 and OB stars is greatest. We consider WR 65 in
the context of other WC8-9+OB stars showing dust emission.
