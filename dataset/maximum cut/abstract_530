In this paper we consider Hopf's Lemma and the Strong Maximum Principle for
supersolutions to a class of non elliptic equations. In particular we prove a
sufficient condition for the validity of Hopf's Lemma and of the Strong Maximum
Principle and we give a condition which is at once necessary for the validity
of Hopf's Lemma and sufficient for the validity of the Strong Maximum
Principle.
