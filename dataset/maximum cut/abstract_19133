We have been monitoring yearly variation in the Sun's polar magnetic fields
with the Solar Optical Telescope aboard {\it Hinode} to record their evolution
and expected reversal near the solar maximum. All magnetic patches in the
magnetic flux maps are automatically identified to obtain the number density
and magnetic flux density as a function of th total magnetic flux per patch.
The detected magnetic flux per patch ranges over four orders of magnitude
($10^{15}$ -- $10^{20}$ Mx). The higher end of the magnetic flux in the polar
regions is about one order of magnitude larger than that of the quiet Sun, and
nearly that of pores. Almost all large patches ($ \geq 10^{18}$ Mx) have the
same polarity, while smaller patches have a fair balance of both polarities.
The polarity of the polar region as a whole is consequently determined only by
the large magnetic concentrations. A clear decrease in the net flux of the
polar region is detected in the slow rising phase of the current solar cycle.
The decrease is more rapid in the north polar region than in the south. The
decrease in the net flux is caused by a decrease in the number and size of the
large flux concentrations as well as the appearance of patches with opposite
polarity at lower latitudes. In contrast, we do not see temporal change in the
magnetic flux associated with the smaller patches ($ < 10^{18}$ Mx) and that of
the horizontal magnetic fields during the years 2008--2012.
