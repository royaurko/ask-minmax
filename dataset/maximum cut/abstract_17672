Prior to 1947, the activity of the Sun was assessed by the relative numbers
of sunspots (W). The 10.7 cm radio emission (frequency of 2.8 GHz) for
observations of the variability of radiation of chromosphere and the lower
corona (F10.7) became used from 1947. For the F10,7 are available more detailed
observational archive data, so this activity index more often than the other
indices is used in the prediction and monitoring of the solar activity. We have
made the analysis of time series of F10.7 with the use of different mother
wavelets: Daubechies 10, Symlet 8, Meyer, Gauss 8 and Morlet. Wavelet spectrum
allows us not only to identify cycles, but analyze their change in time. Each
wavelet has its own characteristic features, so sometimes with the help of
different wavelets it can be better identify and highlight the different
properties of the analyzed signal. We intended to choose the mother wavelet,
which is more fully gives information about the analyzed index F10.7. We have
received, that all these wavelets show similar values to the maximums of the
cyclic activity. However, we can see the difference when using different
wavelets. There are also a number of periods, which, perhaps, are the harmonics
of main period. The mean value of 11-year cycle is about 10.2 years. All the
above examples show that the best results we get when using wavelets Morley,
Gauss (real-valued) and multiparameter family of wavelets Morley and Gauss
(complex-valued).
