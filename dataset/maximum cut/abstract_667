We report an observation of the extraordinary high reflection of acoustic
waves in water by thin epoxy plates partitioned by subwavelength cuts, whereas
such plates without structure are acoustically-transparent as the acoustic
properties of epoxy are close to water. It is demonstrated that this exotic
phenomenon results from the resonant excitation of the local modes within the
individual pieces derived by the cuts. The experiment agrees well with the
theory.
