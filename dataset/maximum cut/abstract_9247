A survey of results for Mahler measure of algebraic numbers, and one-variable
polynomials with integer coefficients is presented. Related results on the
maximum modulus of the conjugates (`house') of an algebraic integer are also
discussed. Some generalisations are given too, though not to Mahler measure of
polynomials in more than one variable.
