We demonstrate how information in the form of observable data and moment
constraints are introduced into the method of Maximum relative Entropy (ME). A
general example of updating with data and moments is shown. A specific
econometric example is solved in detail which can then be used as a template
for real world problems. A numerical example is compared to a large deviation
solution which illustrates some of the advantages of the ME method.
