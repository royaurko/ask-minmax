With an eye towards human-centered automation, we contribute to the
development of a systematic means to infer features of human decision-making
from behavioral data. Motivated by the common use of softmax selection in
models of human decision-making, we study the maximum likelihood parameter
estimation problem for softmax decision-making models with linear objective
functions. We present conditions under which the likelihood function is convex.
These allow us to provide sufficient conditions for convergence of the
resulting maximum likelihood estimator and to construct its asymptotic
distribution. In the case of models with nonlinear objective functions, we show
how the estimator can be applied by linearizing about a nominal parameter
value. We apply the estimator to fit the stochastic UCL (Upper Credible Limit)
model of human decision-making to human subject data. We show statistically
significant differences in behavior across related, but distinct, tasks.
