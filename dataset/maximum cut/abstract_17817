Using the 2MASS near-infrared photometry and high signal-to-noise HI 21-cm
data from the Arecibo, Green Bank, Nancay, and Parkes telescopes, we calculate
the redshift-independent distances and peculiar velocities of 2,018 bright
inclined spiral galaxies over the whole sky. This project is part of the 2MASS
Tully-Fisher survey (2MTF), aiming to map the galaxy peculiar velocity field
within 100 h^{-1}Mpc, with an all-sky coverage apart from Galactic latitudes
|b|< 5 deg. A \chi^2 minimization method was adopted to analyze the
Tully-Fisher peculiar velocity field in J, H and K bands, using a Gaussian
filter. We combine information from the three wavebands, to provide bulk flow
measurements of 310.9 +/- 33.9 km/s, 280.8 +/- 25.0 km/s, and 292.3 +/- 27.8
km/s at depths of 20 h^{-1}Mpc, 30 h^{-1}Mpc and 40 h^{-1}Mpc, respectively.
Each of these bulk flow vectors points in a direction similar to those found by
previous measurements. At each of the three depths, the bulk flow magnitude is
consistent with predictions made by the $\Lambda$CDM model at the 1$\sigma$
level. The maximum likelihood and minimum variance method were also used to
analyze the 2MTF samples, giving similar results.
