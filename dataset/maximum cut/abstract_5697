In this paper we consider the generalized uncertainty principle in the
tunneling formalism via Hamilton-Jacobi method to determine the
quantum-corrected Hawking temperature and entropy for 2+1-dimensional
noncommutative acoustic black holes. In our results we obtain an area entropy,
a correction logarithmic in leading order, a correction term in subleading
order proportional to the radiation temperature associated with the
noncommutative acoustic black holes and an extra term that depends on a
conserved charge. Thus, as in the gravitational case, there is no need to
introduce the ultraviolet cut-off and divergences are eliminated.
