It is suggested that in gold nanoparticles (GNPs) of about 5 nm sizes used in
the radiofrequency (RF) hyperthermia, an absorption of the RF photon by the
Fermi electron occurs with involvement of the longitudinal acoustic vibrational
mode (LAVM), the dominating one in the distribution of vibrational density of
states (VDOS). This physical mechanism helps to explain two observed phenomena:
the size dependence of the heating rate (HR) in GNPs and reduced heat
production in aggregated GNPs. The argumentation proceeds within the
one-electron approximation, taking into account the discretenesses of energies
and momenta of both electrons and LAVMs. The heating of GNPs is thought to
consist of two consecutive processes: first, the Fermi electron absorbs
simultaneously the RF photon and the LAVM available in the GNP; hereafter the
excited electron gets relaxed within the GNP's boundary, exciting a LAVM with
the energy higher than that of the previously absorbed LAVM. GNPs containing
the Ta and/or Fe impurities are proposed for the RF hyperthermia as promising
heaters with enhanced HRs, and GNPs with rare-earth impurity atoms are also
brought into consideration. It is shown why the maximum HR values should be
expected in GNPs with about 5-7 nm size.
