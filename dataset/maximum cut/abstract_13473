Within the context of a large project aimed at studying early F-, A- and late
B-type stars we present the abundance analysis of the photospheres of 21
members of the open cluster NGC 5460, an intermediate age cluster (logt ~ 8.2)
previously unstudied with spectroscopy. Our study is based on medium and high
resolution spectra obtained with the FLAMES instrument of the ESO/VLT. We show
that cluster members have a nearly solar metallicity, and that there is
evidence that the abundances of magnesium and iron are correlated with the
effective temperature, exhibiting a maximum around Teff=10500 K. No
correlations are found between abundances and projected equatorial velocity,
except for marginal evidence of barium being more abundant in slower than in
faster rotating stars. We discovered two He-weak stars, and a binary system
where the hotter component is a HgMn star. We provide new estimates for the
cluster distance (720 +/- 50 pc), age (logt = 8.2 +/- 0.1), and mean radial
velocity (-17.9 +/- 5.2 km/s).
