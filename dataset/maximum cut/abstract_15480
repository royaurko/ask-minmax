Linear water wave theory suggests that wave patterns caused by a steadily
moving disturbance are contained within a wedge whose half-angle depends on the
depth-based Froude number $F_H$. For the problem of flow past an axisymmetric
pressure distribution in a finite-depth channel, we report on the apparent
angle of the wake, which is the angle of maximum peaks. For moderately deep
channels, the dependence of the apparent wake angle on the Froude number is
very different to the wedge angle, and varies smoothly as $F_H$ passes through
the critical value $F_H=1$. For shallow water, the two angles tend to follow
each other more closely, which leads to very large apparent wake angles for
certain regimes.
