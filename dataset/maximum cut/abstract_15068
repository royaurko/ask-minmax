We argue that the divergence in time for the asymptotic observer occurs
because of specifying the position of the Horizon beyond the Planck scale. In
fact, a similar divergence in time will also occur for an in-going observer in
Gravity's Rainbow, if we again specify the position of the Horizon beyond the
Planck scale. On the other hand, if we accept the occurrence of a minimum
measurable length scale associated with a universal invariant maximum energy
scale in Gravity's Rainbow, then the time taken by both the in-going and
asymptotic observers will be finite.
