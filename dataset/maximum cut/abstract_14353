Magnetic and mechanical designs of a Nb3Sn quadrupole magnet with 120-mm
aperture suitable for interaction regions of hadron colliders are presented.
The magnet is based on a two-layer shell-type coil and a cold iron yoke.
Special spacers made of a low-Z material are implemented in the coil mid-planes
to reduce the level of radiation heat deposition and radiation dose in the
coil. The quadrupole mechanical structure is based on aluminum collars
supported by an iron yoke and a stainless steel skin. Magnet parameters
including maximum field gradient and field harmonics, Nb3Sn coil pre-stress and
protection at the operating temperatures of 4.5 and 1.9 K are reported. The
level and distribution of radiation heat deposition in the coil and other
magnet components are discussed.
