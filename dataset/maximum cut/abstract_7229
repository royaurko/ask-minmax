We study numerically the high energy head-on collision of nonspinning equal
mass black holes to estimate the maximum gravitational radiation emitted by
these systems. Our simulations include improvements in the full numerical
evolutions and computation of waveforms at infinity. We make use of new initial
data with notably reduced spurious radiation content, allowing for initial
speeds nearing the speed of light, i.e. $v\sim0.99c$. We thus estimate the
maximum radiated energy from head-on collisions to be
$E_{\text{max}}/M_{ADM}=0.13\pm0.01$. This value differs from the second order
perturbative $(0.164)$ and zero-frequency-limit $(0.17)$ analytic computations,
but is close to those obtained by thermodynamic arguments $(0.134)$ and to
previous numerical estimates $(0.14\pm0.03)$.
