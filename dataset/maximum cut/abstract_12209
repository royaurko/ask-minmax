We show that the "waterfalls", as reported in recent ARPES studies on HTSC,
can neither be described as a part of a self-consistent quasiparticle spectrum
nor represent a new physical phenomena, namely the "new energy scale". They
stem from the critical suppression of the photoemission intensity along the
Brillouin zone (BZ) diagonals. Our arguments, however, do not question the
existence of the high-energy scale itself (~ 0.25 eV), which is a simple
consequence of the renormalization maximum and has been explained earlier in
terms of coupling to a continuum of bosonic excitations. Moreover, when the
matrix-elements are taken into account, it becomes clear that the photoemission
spectrum consists of two components: one represents the spectrum of
one-particle excitations and the other, having a grid-like structure along the
bonding directions in the BZ, is of yet unknown origin.
