The membrane components of cellular organelles have been shown to segregate
into domains as the result of biochemical maturation. We propose that the
dynamical competition between maturation and lateral segregation of membrane
components regulates domain formation. We study a two- component fluid membrane
in which enzymatic reaction irreversibly converts one component into another,
and phase separation triggers the formation of transient membrane domains. The
maximum domains size is shown to depend on the maturation rate as a power-law
similar to the one observed for domain growth with time in the absence of
maturation, despite this time dependence not being verified in the case of
irreversible maturation. This control of domain size by enzymatic activity
could play a critical role in intra-organelle dynamics.
