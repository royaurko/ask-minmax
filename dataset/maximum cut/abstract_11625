We develop a non-linear relativistic model of the Shapley Concentration (SC)
and its environs, including the Great Attractor (GA) and the Local Group (LG).
We take the Shapley concentration as a major attractive centre, and we use the
Lemaitre-Tolman model. We constrain our model with present day observations,
plus the requirement that it have a physically reasonable evolution from small
perturbations at last scattering. We investigate possible mass and velocity
distributions, and we find that the peculiar velocity maximum near the SC is
\~800 km/s inwards, the density between GA and SC must be about ~0.9 times
background, the mass of the GA is probably 4 - 6 x 10^15 M_sun, the SC's
contribution to the LG motion is negligible, and the value of the cosmological
constant is not significant on this scale.
