We perform the two-loop matching calculation for heavy-to-light currents from
QCD onto soft-collinear effective theory for the complete set of Dirac
structures. The newly obtained matching coefficients enter several
phenomenological applications, of which we discuss heavy-to-light form factor
ratios and exclusive radiative decays, as well as the semi-inclusive decay
anti-B ---> X(s) l+ l-. For this decay, we observe a significant shift of the
forward-backward asymmetry zero and find q_0^2 = (3.34 +0.22 -0.25) GeV^2 for
an invariant mass cut m_X^cut=2.0 GeV.
