To get the total cross section of one interaction from its amplitude ${\cal
M}$, one needs to integrate $|{\cal M}|^2$ over phase spaces of all out-going
particles. Starting from this paper, we will propose a new method to perform
such integrations, which is inspired by the reduced phase space integration of
one-loop unitarity cut developed in the last few years. The new method reduces
one constrained three-dimension momentum space integration to an
one-dimensional integration, plus one possible Feynman parameter integration.
There is no need to specify a reference framework in our calculation, since
every step is manifestly Lorentz invariant by the new method. The current paper
is the first paper of a series for the new method. Here we have exclusively
focused on massless particles in 4D. There is no need to carve out a
complicated integration region in the phase space for this particular simple
case because the integration region is always simply $[0,1]$.
