To elucidate the permeation of cosmic ultraviolet (UV) background radiation
into a pregalactic cloud and subsequent ionization, the frequency-dependent
radiative transfer equation is solved, coupled with the ionization process. A
spherical top-hat cloud which is composed of pure hydrogen is assumed. As a
result, it is shown that the self-shielding, although it is often disregarded
in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, could start to emerge shortly after
the maximum expansion stages of density fluctuations. The present analysis
reveals that the Stro"mgren approximation leads to overestimation of the
photoionization effects. Also, the self-shielded neutral core is no longer
sharply separated from surrounding ionized regions; a low but noticeable degree
of ionization is caused by high energy photons even in the self-shielded core.
The present results may be substantial on considering the biasing by
photoionization against low-mass galaxy formation.
