We examine the effects that a confining boundary together with hydrodynamical
expansion play on two-pion distributions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
We show that the effects arise from the introduction of further correlations
due both to collective motion and the system's finite size. As is well known,
the former leads to a reduction in the apparent source radius with increasing
average pair momentum K. However, for small K, the presence of the boundary
leads to a decrease of the apparent source radius with decreasing K. These two
competing effects produce a maximum for the effective source radius as a
function of K.
