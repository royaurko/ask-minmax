The thermodynamic parameters of the superconducting state in calcium under
the pressure at 161 GPa have been calculated within the framework of the
Eliashberg approach. It has been shown that the value of the Coulomb
pseudopotential is high (0.24) and the critical temperature (25 K) should be
determined from the modified Allen-Dynes formula. In addition, it has been
found that the basic dimensionless ratios of the thermodynamic parameters
significantly diverge from the BCS predictions, and take the following values:
(i) The zero temperature energy gap to the critical temperature(R1) is equal to
4.01. (ii) The ratio R2 equals 2.17. (iii) The quantity R3=0.158. Finally, it
has been proven that the electron effective mass is large and takes the maximum
of 2.32*me at TC.
