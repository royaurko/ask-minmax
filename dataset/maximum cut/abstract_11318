I perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis of galaxies of different spectral
types using the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS). Using a maximum-likelihood
technique to fit for the relationship between the density fields of early- and
late-type galaxies, I find a relative linear bias of $b=0.76\pm 0.02$. This
technique can probe the nonlinearity and stochasticity of the relationship as
well. However, the degree to which nonlinear and stochastic fits improve upon
the linear fit turns out to depend on the redshift range in question. In
particular, there seems to be a systematic difference between the high- and
low-redshift halves of the data (respectively, further than and closer than
$cz\approx 36,000$ km/s); all of the signal of stochasticity and nonlinearity
comes from the low-redshift portion. Analysis of mock catalogs shows that the
peculiar geometry and variable flux limits of the LCRS do not cause this
effect. I speculate that the central surface brightness selection criteria of
the LCRS may be responsible.
