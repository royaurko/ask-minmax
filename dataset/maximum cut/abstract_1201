We consider the asymptotic consistency of maximum likelihood parameter
estimation for dynamical systems observed with noise. Under suitable conditions
on the dynamical systems and the observations, we show that maximum likelihood
parameter estimation is consistent. Our proof involves ideas from both
information theory and dynamical systems. Furthermore, we show how some
well-studied properties of dynamical systems imply the general statistical
properties related to maximum likelihood estimation. Finally, we exhibit
classical families of dynamical systems for which maximum likelihood estimation
is consistent. Examples include shifts of finite type with Gibbs measures and
Axiom A attractors with SRB measures.
