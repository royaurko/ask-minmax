With the help of the experimental installation aimed at the investigation of
high energy cosmic rays (Tien-Shan high mountain laboratory) the signal of
Solar and star optical radiation is registered. The signal is well provided
statistically and possesses the strictly expressed maximum in the region of EAS
sizes Ne 1.19 106 particles (primary energy Eo 1.33 1015 eV). This signal is
the peak from gamma EAS, generated by gamma quanta from decay of pi zero
mesons, photo produced by the Primary Cosmic Radiation (PCR) nuclei on the
photons of stars and of PCR sources. The assumption is made, that exactly this
process provides the main contribution in the formation of so called knee on
the primary spectrum.
  Due to the universality and distinct maximum of this signal, its usage for
independent and reliable calibration of the EAS installations, for the mutual
calibration of these installations and, possibly, for the merger of
experimental data obtained by means of these installations to increase the
statistics, is proposed. It is especially vital to day, when the further
essential increase of the energy range under investigation is necessary.
