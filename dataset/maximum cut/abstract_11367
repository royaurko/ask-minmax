Rapidly spinning magnetic white dwarfs in symbiotic stars may pass through
the propeller stage. It is believed that a magnetic propeller acts in two such
stars CH Cyg and
  MWC 560. We review a diversity of manifestations of the propeller there. In
these systems in a quiescent state the accretion onto a white dwarf from the
strong enough wind of a companion star is suppressed by the magnetic field, and
the hot component luminosity is low. Since the gas stored in the envelope
eventually settles to the corotation radius the star-propeller reveals itself
by long-time outbursts, short-time brightness dips, strong amplitude
flickering, ejection of a powerful wind and jets. The envelope appears to be
stratified and inhomogeneous because of the shock pumping of the propeller. At
this stage, at which catastrophic transitions to the accretion stage and back
are possible, the release of energy and angular momentum of the white dwarf is
maximum. Using this property, we estimate the magnetic field strength of the
white dwarfs in CH Cyg and MWC 560 to be of order $10^8$ G.
  The most spectacular property of these stars - jets - is inherently connected
with the propeller. This suggests hydromagnetic models of jet acceleration.
