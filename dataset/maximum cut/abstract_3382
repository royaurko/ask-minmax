We obtain the analogue of the classical result by Erd\"os and Kac on the
limiting distribution of the maximum of partial sums for exchangeable random
variables with zero mean and variance one. We show that, if the conditions of
the central limit theorem of Blum et al. hold, the limit coincides with the
classical one. Under more general assumptions, the probability of the random
variables having conditional negative drift appears in the limiting
distribution.
