Young, rapidly rotating neutron stars could accelerate ions from their
surface to energies of $\sim 1$ PeV. If protons reach such energies, they will
produce pions (with low probability) through resonant scattering with x-rays
from the stellar surface. The pions subsequently decay to produce muon
neutrinos. Here we calculate the energy spectrum of muon neutrinos, and
estimate the event rates at Earth. The spectrum consists of a sharp rise at
$\sim 50$ TeV, corresponding to the onset of the resonance, above which the
flux drops with neutrino energy as $\epsilon_\nu^{-2}$ up to an upper-energy
cut-off that is determined by either kinematics or by the maximum energy to
which protons are accelerated. We estimate event rates as high as 10-100
km^${-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ from some candidates, a flux that would be easily detected
by IceCube. Lack of detection would allow constraints on the energetics of the
poorly-understood pulsar magnetosphere.
