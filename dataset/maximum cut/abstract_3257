We consider a one dimensional ballistic random walk evolving in an i.i.d.
parametric random environment. We provide a maximum likelihood estimation
procedure of the environment parameters based on a single observation of the
path till the time it reaches a distant site, and prove that this estimator is
consistent as the distant site tends to infinity. We also explore the numerical
performances of our estimation procedure.
