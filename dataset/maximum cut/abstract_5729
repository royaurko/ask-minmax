Dominators provide a general mechanism for identifying reconverging paths in
graphs. This is useful for a number of applications in Computer-Aided Design
(CAD) including signal probability computation in biased random simulation,
switching activity estimation in power and noise analysis, and cut points
identification in equivalence checking. However, traditional single-vertex
dominators are too rare in circuit graphs. In order to handle reconverging
paths more efficiently, we consider the case of double-vertex dominators which
occur more frequently. First, we derive a number of specific properties of
double-vertex dominators. Then, we describe a data structure for representing
all double-vertex dominators of a given vertex in linear space. Finally, we
present an algorithm for finding all double-vertex dominators of a given vertex
in linear time. Our results provide an efficient systematic way of partitioning
large graphs along the reconverging points of the signal flow.
