Superoxide reductase (SOR) catalyzes the reduction of O2*- to H2O2. Its
active site consists of a non-heme Fe2+ center in an unusual square-pyramidal
[His4 Cys] coordination. Like many SORs, the electronic absorption band
corresponding to the oxidized active site of the SOR from Desulfoarculus
baarsii exhibits a pH-dependent alkaline transition changing from ca. 644 to
560 nm as the pH increases and with an apparent pKa of 9.0. Variants in which
the conserved amino acids glutamate 47 and lysine 48 were replaced by the
neutral residues alanine (E47A) and isoleucine (K48I), respectively, exhibited
the same alkaline transition but at lower apparent pKa values of 6.7 and 7.6,
respectively. Previous work [Nivi{\`e}re, V.; Asso, M.; Weill, C. O.; Lombard,
M.; Guigliarelli, B.; Favaudon, V.; Hou{\'e}e-Levin, C. Biochemistry 2004, 43,
808-818] has shown that this alkaline transition is associated with the
protonation/deprotonation of an unidentified base, B-, which is neither E47 nor
K48. In this work, we show by resonance Raman spectroscopy that at basic pH a
high-spin Fe3+-OH species is formed at the active site. The presence of the HO-
ligand was directly associated with an absorption band maximum at 560 nm,
whereas upon protonation, the band shifts to 644 nm. With respect to our
previous work, B- can be identified with this high-spin Fe3+-OH species, which
upon protonation results in a water molecule at the active site. Implications
for the SOR catalytic cycle are proposed.
