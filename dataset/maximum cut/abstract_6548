The method of lowest-order constrained variational, which predicts reasonably
the nuclear matter semi-empirical data is used to calculate the equation of
state of beta-stable matter at finite temperature. The Reid soft-core with and
without the N-$\Delta$ interactions which fits the N-N scattering data as well
as the $UV_{14}$ potential plus the three-nucleon interaction are considered in
the nuclear many-body Hamiltonian. The electron and muon are treated
relativistically in the total Hamiltonian at given temperature, to make the
fluid electrically neutral and stable against beta decay. The calculation is
performed for a wide range of baryon density and temperature which are of
interest in the astrophysics. The free energy, entropy, proton abundance, etc.
of nuclear beta-stable matter are calculated.
 It is shown that by increasing the temperature, the maximum proton abundance
is pushed to the lower density while the maximum itself increases as we
increase the temperature. The proton fraction is not enough to see any
gas-liquid phase transition. Finally we get an overall agreement with other
many-body techniques, which are available only at zero temperature.
