It was recently proved that any graph satisfying $\omega > \frac
23(\Delta+1)$ contains a stable set hitting every maximum clique. In this note
we prove that the same is true for graphs satisfying $\omega \geq \frac
23(\Delta+1)$ unless the graph is the strong product of $K_{\omega/2}$ and an
odd hole. We also provide a counterexample to a recent conjecture on the
existence of a stable set hitting every sufficiently large maximal clique.
