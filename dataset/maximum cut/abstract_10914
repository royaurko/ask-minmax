The performance of Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) in gaseous He, Ne, He+H2
and Ne+H2 was studied at temperatures in the range of 3-293 K. This paper
reports on previously published measurements and additional studies on the
effects of the purity of the gases in which the GEM performance is evaluated.
In He, at temperatures between 77 and 293 K, triple-GEM structures operate at
rather high gains, exceeding 1000. There is an indication that this high gain
is achieved through the Penning effect as a result of impurities in the gas. At
lower temperatures the gain-voltage characteristics are significantly modified
probably due to the freeze-out of these impurities. Double-GEM and single-GEM
structures can operate down to 3 K at gains reaching only several tens at a gas
density of about 0.5 g/l; at higher densities the maximum gain drops further.
In Ne, the maximum gain also drops at cryogenic temperatures. The gain drop in
Ne at low temperatures can be re-established in Penning mixtures of Ne+H2: very
high gains, exceeding 104, have been obtained in these mixtures at 30-77 K, at
a density of 9.2 g/l which corresponds to saturated Ne vapor density at 27 K.
The addition of small amounts of H2 in He also re-establishes large GEM gains
above 30 K but no gain was observed in He+H2 at 4 K and a density of 1.7 g/l
(corresponding to roughly one-tenth of the saturated vapor density). These
studies are, in part, being pursued in the development of two-phase He and Ne
detectors for solar neutrino detection.
