Particular diagnostic tools may isolate the signature left on the oscillation
frequencies by the presence of a small convective core. Their frequency
derivative is expected to provide information about convective core's
properties and stellar age. The main goal of this work is to study the
potential of the diagnostic tools with regards to the inference of stellar age
and stellar core's properties. For that, we computed diagnostic tools and their
frequency derivatives from the oscillation frequencies of main-sequence models
with masses between 1.0 and $1.6\,{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ and with different physics.
We considered the dependence of the diagnostic tools on stellar age and on the
size of the relative discontinuity in the squared sound speed at the edge of
the convectively unstable region. We find that the absolute value of the
frequency derivatives of the diagnostic tools increases as the star evolves on
the main sequence. The fraction of stellar main-sequence evolution for models
with masses $>1.2\,{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ may be estimated from the frequency
derivatives of two of the diagnostic tools. For lower mass models, constraints
on the convective core's overshoot can potentially be derived based on the
analysis of the same derivatives. For at least 35 per cent of our sample of
stellar models the frequency derivative of the diagnostic tools takes its
maximum absolute value on the frequency range where observed oscillations may
be expected.
