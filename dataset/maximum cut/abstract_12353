We calculate the one-loop non-factorizable QCD corrections to the production
and decay of pairs of top quarks at various collider experiments. These
non-factorizable corrections interconnect the different production and decay
stages of the off-shell top-pair production processes. This in particular
affects the invariant-mass distributions of the off-shell top quarks, resulting
in a shift of the maximum of the distorted Breit-Wigner distributions. Although
the non-factorizable corrections can be large, the actual shift in the mass as
determined from the peak position of the corrected Breit-Wigner line-shape is
below $100\MeV$.
