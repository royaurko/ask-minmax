Model calculations are performed of extensive air shower (EAS) component
energies using a variety of hadronic interaction parameters. A conversion
factor from electromagnetic component energy to the energy of ultra-high energy
cosmic rays (UHECRs) and its model and primary mass dependence is studied. It
is shown that model dependence of the factor minimizes under the necessary
condition of the same maximum position and muon content of simulated showers.
