Our main object of study is a 3-valent graph with a vector function on its
edges. The function assignes to an edge a pair of 2-adic integer numbers and
satisfies additional condition: the sum of its values on three edges,
terminating in the same vertex, is equal to 0. For each vertex of the graph
three vectors corresponding to these edges generate a lattice over the ring of
2-adic integers. In this paper we study the restrictions, imposed on these
lattices by the combinatorics of the graph.
  As an application we obtain the following fact: a rational balanced polygon
cannot be cut into an odd number of triangles of equal areas. First result of
this type was obtained by Paul Monsky in 1970. He proved that a square cannot
be cut into an odd number of triangles of equal areas. In 2000 Sherman Stein
conjectured that the same holds for any balanced polygon. We prove this
conjecture in the case, when coordinates of all vertices of the cut are
rational numbers.
