Convection in red giant stars excites resonant acoustic waves whose
frequencies depend on the sound speed inside the star, which in turn depends on
the properties of the stellar interior. Therefore, asteroseismology is the most
robust available method for probing the internal structure of red giant stars.
Solar-like oscillations in the red giant HR7349 are investigated. Our study is
based on a time series of 380760 photometric measurements spread over 5 months
obtained with the CoRoT satellite. Mode parameters were estimated using maximum
likelihood estimation of the power spectrum. The power spectrum of the
high-precision time series clearly exhibits several identifiable peaks between
19 and 40 uHz showing regularity with a mean large and small spacing of Dnu =
3.47+-0.12 uHz and dnu_02 = 0.65+-0.10 uHz. Nineteen individual modes are
identified with amplitudes in the range from 35 to 115 ppm. The mode damping
time is estimated to be 14.7+4.7-2.9 days.
