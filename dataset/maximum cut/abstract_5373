In this paper, we propose a novel technique to reconstruct 3D surface of an
underwater object using stereo images. Reconstructing the 3D surface of an
underwater object is really a challenging task due to degraded quality of
underwater images. There are various reason of quality degradation of
underwater images i.e., non-uniform illumination of light on the surface of
objects, scattering and absorption effects. Floating particles present in
underwater produces Gaussian noise on the captured underwater images which
degrades the quality of images. The degraded underwater images are preprocessed
by applying homomorphic, wavelet denoising and anisotropic filtering
sequentially. The uncalibrated rectification technique is applied to
preprocessed images to rectify the left and right images. The rectified left
and right image lies on a common plane. To find the correspondence points in a
left and right images, we have applied dense stereo matching technique i.e.,
graph cut method. Finally, we estimate the depth of images using triangulation
technique. The experimental result shows that the proposed method reconstruct
3D surface of underwater objects accurately using captured underwater stereo
images.
