Using a high resolution spectrum of the secondary star in the black hole
binary A0620-00, we have derived the stellar parameters and veiling caused by
the accretion disk in a consistent way. We have used a chi^2 minimization
procedure to explore a grid of 800 000 LTE synthetic spectra computed for a
plausible range of both stellar and veiling parameters. Adopting the best model
parameters found, we have determined atmospheric abundances of Fe, Ca, Ti, Ni
and Al. The Fe abundance of the star is [Fe/H]=0.14 +- 0.20. Except for Ca, we
found the other elements moderately over-abundant as compared with stars in the
solar neighborhood of similar iron content. Taking into account the small
orbital separation, the mass transfer rate and the mass of the convection zone
of the secondary star, a comparison with element yields in supernova explosion
models suggests a possible explosive event with a mass cut comparable to the
current mass of the compact object. We have also analyzed the Li abundance,
which is unusually high for a star of this spectral type and relatively low
mass.
