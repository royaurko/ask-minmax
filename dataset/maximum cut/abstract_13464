Restricted solid on solid surface growth models can be mapped onto binary
lattice gases. We show that efficient simulation algorithms can be realized on
GPUs either by CUDA or by OpenCL programming. We consider a
deposition/evaporation model following Kardar-Parisi-Zhang growth in 1+1
dimensions related to the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process and show that for
sizes, that fit into the shared memory of GPUs one can achieve the maximum
parallelization speedup ~ x100 for a Quadro FX 5800 graphics card with respect
to a single CPU of 2.67 GHz). This permits us to study the effect of quenched
columnar disorder, requiring extremely long simulation times. We compare the
CUDA realization with an OpenCL implementation designed for processor clusters
via MPI. A two-lane traffic model with randomized turning points is also
realized and the dynamical behavior has been investigated.
