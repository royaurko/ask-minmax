Athanassoula (2014) has claimed that measurements of the ratio of corotation
radius to bar length in galaxies do not place a constraint on the disk to halo
mass ratio. Her conclusion was based on a series of simulations published by
Athanassoula et al. (2013). Here we show that these results are, in fact,
consistent with previous work on the slow down of bars due to dynamical
friction because gas inflow rearranges the disk mass before the bar settles. It
therefore remains true that a bar rotating sufficiently fast that corotation is
not far beyond the bar end requires a near maximum disk.
