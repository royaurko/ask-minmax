We compare the current LIGO/Virgo upper limits on double compact object
volumetric merger rates with our theoretical predictions. Our optimistic models
are a factor of 3 below the existing upper limits for massive BH-BH systems
with total mass 50-70 Msun, suggesting that a small increase in observational
sensitivity may bring the first detections. The LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave
observatories are currently being upgraded to advanced design sensitivity. If a
sizeable population of BH-BH binaries is detected, the maximum total binary
mass of this population will discriminate between two general families of
common envelope models. If no binaries are detected, the new upper limits will
provide astrophysically useful information about the environment and physical
processes (e.g., metallicity of host galaxies or BH natal kicks) crucial to the
formation of binaries containing black holes. For NS-NS systems, our predicted
rates are 3 orders of magnitude below the current upper limits; even if
advanced instruments reach their design sensitivities (factors of 10 times in
distance, and 1,000 times in volumetric rate) the detection of NS-NS systems is
not assured. However, we note that although our predicted NS-NS merger rates
are consistent with estimates derived from Galactic NS-NS binaries and short
GRBs, they are on the low side of these empirical estimates.
