The recent determination of the mass of the pulsar PSR J1614-2230 with $1.97
\pm 0.04 M_\odot$ by \cite{Demorest}, renewed the discussions about the
possibility of exotic matter being present at the core of neutron stars. Since
the description of matter at densities beyond nuclear saturation is model
dependent, several works have explored different aspects of the fact that the
maximum neutron star mass implied by any equation of state (EoS) must exceed
the mass of PSR J1614-2230. In this article we present an extensive study of
hybrid star masses using several parametrizations of a relativistic mean-field
hadronic EoS together with a typical three-flavor NJL model with scalar, vector
and 't Hooft interactions as realized.
