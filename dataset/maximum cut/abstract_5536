We prove the analogue for continuous space-time of the quenched LDP derived
in Birkner, Greven and den Hollander (2010) for discrete space-time. In
particular, we consider a random environment given by Brownian increments, cut
into pieces according to an independent continuous-time renewal process. We
look at the empirical process obtained by recording both the length of and the
increments in the successive pieces. For the case where the renewal time
distribution has a Lebesgue density with a polynomial tail, we derive the
quenched LDP for the empirical process, i.e., the LDP conditional on a typical
environment. The rate function is a sum of two specific relative entropies, one
for the pieces and one for the concatenation of the pieces. We also obtain a
quenched LDP when the tail decays faster than algebraic. The proof uses
coarse-graining and truncation arguments, involving various approximations of
specific relative entropies that are not quite standard.
  In a companion paper we show how the quenched LDP and the techniques
developed in the present paper can be applied to obtain a variational
characterisation of the free energy and the phase transition line for the
Brownian copolymer near a selective interface.
