5$\mu$m thick NdFeB films have been sputtered onto 100 mm Si substrates using
high rate sputtering (18 $\mu$m/h). Films were deposited at &#8804; 500 C and
then annealed at 750 C for 10 minutes. While films deposited at temperatures up
to 450 C have equiaxed grains, the size of which decreases with increasing
deposition temperature, the films deposited at 500 C have columnar grains. The
out-of-plane remanent magnetization increases with deposition temperature,
reaching a maximum value of 1.4 T, while the coercivity remains constant at
about 1.6 T. The maximum energy product achieved (400 kJ/m3) is comparable to
that of high-quality NdFeB sintered magnets.
