The dielectric response in relaxor ferroelectrics is analyzed in the
framework a model for the polarization dynamics in the presence of polar
clusters. We associate the origin of polar clusters with the atoms displaced
from their centro-symmerical positions even above $T_c$. Their collective
hopping in multi-well potentials induced by disorder is analogous with the
situation in glasses. The theory explicitly takes into account the distribution
of cluster reorientation frequencies and the effect of cluster-cluster
interactions in highly polarizable crystals, which we describe in terms of the
local field distribution function. The dielectric constant is obtained from an
integral master equation for the polarization dynamics in the presence of a
time dependent electric field. The theory is applied for the analysis of the
shape of the frequency dependent permittivity in the typical relaxor
ferrolectrics $PST$ as a function of temperature. The comparison of the theory
with experiment shows that in contrast to earlier assumptions, the observed
Vogel-Fulcher dependence of the permittivity maximum is a consequence of the
Vogel-Fulcher temperature dependence of the cluster reorientation frequency.
