The spectral study of the HESS J1745-290 high energy gamma-ray cut-off from
the galactic center is compatible with a signal of Dark Matter (DM)
annihilation or decay. If this is the case, a neutrino flux from that source is
also expected. We analyze the neutrino flux predicted by DM particles able to
originate the HESS J1745-290 gamma-rays observations. We focus on the
electroweak and hadronic channels, which are favoured by present measurements.
In particular, we study DM annihilating into W+W- and u-ubar with DM masses of
48.8 and 27.9 TeV respectively. We estimate the resolution angle and exposition
time necessary to test the DM hypothesis as the origin of the commented gamma
signal.
