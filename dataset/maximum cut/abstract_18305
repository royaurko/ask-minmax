We present results of our Chandra observation with the ACIS-I instrument
centered on the position of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the compact nonthermal
radio source associated with the massive black hole (MBH) at the dynamical
center of the Milky Way Galaxy. We have obtained the first
high-spatial-resolution (~1 arcsec), hard X-ray (0.5-7 keV) image of the
central 40 pc (17 arcmin) of the Galaxy and have discovered an X-ray source,
CXOGC J174540.0-290027, coincident with the radio position of Sgr A* to within
0.35 arcsec, corresponding to a maximum projected distance of 16 light-days for
an assumed distance to the center of the Galaxy of 8.0 kpc. We received 222
+/-17 (1 sigma) net counts from the source in 40.3 ks. Due to the low number of
counts, the spectrum is well fit either by an absorbed power-law model with
photon index Gamma = 2.7 (1.8-4.0) and column density NH = (9.8 [6.8-14.2]) x
10^22 cm^-2 (90% confidence interval) or by an absorbed optically thin thermal
plasma model with kT = 1.9 (1.4-2.8) keV and NH = (11.5 [8.4-15.9]) x 10^22
cm^-2. Using the power-law model, the measured (absorbed) flux in the 2-10 keV
band is (1.3 [1.1-1.7]) x 10^-13 ergs cm^-2 s^-1, and the absorption-corrected
luminosity is (2.4 [1.8-5.4]) x 10^33 ergs s^-1. We also briefly discuss the
complex structure of the X-ray emission from the Sgr A radio complex and along
the Galactic plane and present morphological evidence that Sgr A* and Sgr A
West lie within the hot plasma in the central cavity of Sgr A East.
