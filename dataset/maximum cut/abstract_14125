We report the results from a 19-h integration with the SPIRE Fourier
Transform Spectrometer aboard the Herschel Space Observatory which has revealed
the presence of a molecular outflow from the Cosmic Eyelash (SMM J2135-0102)
via the detection of blueshifted OH absorption. Detections of several
fine-structure emission lines indicate low-excitation HII regions contribute
strongly to the [CII] luminosity in this z = 2.3 ULIRG. The OH feature suggests
a maximum wind velocity of 700 km/s, which is lower than the expected escape
velocity of the host dark matter halo, ~1000 km/s. A large fraction of the
available molecular gas could thus be converted into stars via a burst
protracted by the resulting gas fountain, until an AGN-driven outflow can eject
the remaining gas.
