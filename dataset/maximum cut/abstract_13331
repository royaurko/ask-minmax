The gravitational recoil or "kick" of a black hole formed from the merger of
two orbiting black holes, and caused by the anisotropic emission of
gravitational radiation, is an astrophysically important phenomenon. We combine
(i) an earlier calculation, using post-Newtonian theory, of the kick velocity
accumulated up to the merger of two non-spinning black holes, (ii) a
"close-limit approximation" calculation of the radiation emitted during the
ringdown phase, and based on a solution of the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli
equations using initial data accurate to second post-Newtonian order. We prove
that ringdown radiation produces a significant "anti-kick". Adding the
contributions due to inspiral, merger and ringdown phases, our results for the
net kick velocity agree with those from numerical relativity to 10-15 percent
over a wide range of mass ratios, with a maximum velocity of 180 km/s at a mass
ratio of 0.38.
