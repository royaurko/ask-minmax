We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to analyse the structure and microscopic
dynamics of a viscous Lennard-Jones liquid coupled to a quenched reference
configuration of the same liquid. The coupling between the two replicas is
introduced via a field epsilon conjugate to the overlap Q between the two
particle configurations. This allows us to study the evolution of various
static and dynamic correlation functions across the (epsilon, T) equilibrium
phase diagram. As the temperature is decreased, we identify increasingly marked
precursors of a first-order phase transition between a low-Q and a high-Q phase
induced by the field epsilon. We show in particular that both static and
dynamic susceptibilities have a maximum at a temperature-dependent value of the
coupling field, which defines a `Widom line'. We also show that, in the
high-overlap regime, diffusion and structural relaxation are strongly decoupled
because single particle motion mostly occurs via discrete hopping on the sites
defined by the reference configuration. These results, obtained using
conventional numerical tools, provide encouraging signs that an equilibrium
phase transition exists in coupled viscous liquids, but also demonstrate that
important numerical challenges must be overcome to obtain more conclusive
numerical evidence.
