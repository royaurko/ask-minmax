We investigate the lattice index theorem and the localization of the
zero-modes for thick classical center vortices. For non-orientable spherical
vortices, the index of the overlap Dirac operator differs from the topological
charge although the traces of the plaquettes deviate only by a maximum of 1.5%
from trivial plaquettes. This may be related to the fact that even in Landau
gauge some links of these configuration are close to the non-trivial center
elements.
