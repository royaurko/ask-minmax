We discuss various examples and ramifications of the conjecture that there
exists a maximum force (or tension) in general relativistic systems. We
contrast this situation with that in Newtonian gravity, where no maximum force
exists, and relate it to the existence of natural units defined by constants of
Nature and the fact that the Planck units of force and power do not depend on
Planck's constant. We discuss how these results change in higher dimensions
where the Planck units of force are no longer non-quantum. We discuss the
changes that might occur to the conjecture if a positive cosmological constant
exists and derive a maximum force bound using the Kottler-Schwarzschild-de
Sitter black hole.
