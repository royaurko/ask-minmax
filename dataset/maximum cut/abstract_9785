A new class of critical points, termed as perpetual points, where
acceleration becomes zero but the velocity remains non-zero, are observed in
dynamical systems. The velocity at these points is either maximum or minimum or
of inflection behavior.These points also show the bifurcation behavior as
parameters of the system vary. These perpetual points are useful for locating
the hidden oscillating attractors as well as co-existing attractors. Results
show that these points are important for better understanding of transient
dynamics in the phase space. The existence of these points confirms whether a
system is dissipative or not. Various examples are presented, and results are
discussed analytically as well as numerically.
