A new class of regular quaternionic functions, defined by power series in a
natural fashion, has been introduced in recent years. Several results of the
theory recall the classical complex analysis, whereas other results reflect the
peculiarity of the quaternionic structure. A more recent paper identified a
larger class of domains, on which the study of regular functions is most
natural and not limited to the study of quaternionic power series. In the
present paper we extend some basic results concerning the algebraic and
topological properties of the zero set to regular functions defined on these
domains. We then use these results to prove the Maximum and Minimum Modulus
Principles and a version of the Open Mapping Theorem in this new setting.
