Tissue growth can be modeled in two dimension by only using circular granular
cells, which can grow and produce child. Linear spring-dashpot model is used to
bind the cells with a cut-off interaction range of 1.1 times sum of radii of
interacted cells. Simulation steps must be divided into explicit and implicit
ones due to cell growing stage and cell position rearrangement. This division
is aimed to avoid simulation problem. Only in the explicit steps time changes
is performed. Large cells overlap is chosen as termination condition of tissue
growth. Only some cells configuration can growth to infinite time without
encountering the large cells overlap. These configurations, and the other also,
are presented in this work. Simulation time $t$ increases as cell number $N$
increases due to raise of interaction number between two cells. Linear and
network configurations tend to aligned with different asymtotic function, that
relates $N$ and $t$, for large $N$.
