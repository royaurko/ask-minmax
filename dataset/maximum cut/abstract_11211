We have discovered scattered broad Balmer emission lines in the spectrum of
Cygnus A, using the Keck II telescope. Broad H-alpha appears in polarized flux
from components on either side of the nucleus, and to a lesser extent in the
nucleus. The full-width at half-maximum of broad H-alpha is 26,000 km/s,
comparable to the widest emission lines seen in broad-line radio galaxies.
Scattered AGN light provides a significant contribution to the total flux at
3800 Angstroms (rest) of the western component, where the polarization rises to
16%. The spatially integrated flux of Cygnus A at 5500 Angstroms can be
decomposed into an elliptical galaxy fraction (Fg=0.70), a highly polarized
blue component (FC1=0.15), a less polarized red component (FC=0.09), and a
contribution from the nebular continuum (0.06). Imaging polarimetry shows a
double fan of polarization vectors with circular symmetry which corresponds to
the ionization cone seen in HST images. Our results are consistent with
scattering of light from a hidden quasar of modest luminosity by an extended,
dusty narrow-line region.
