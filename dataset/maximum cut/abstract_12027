A consistent generalization of statistical mechanics is obtained by applying
the maximum entropy principle to a trace-form entropy and by requiring that
physically motivated mathematical properties are preserved. The emerging
differential-functional equation yields a two-parameter class of generalized
logarithms, from which entropies and power-law distributions follow: these
distributions could be relevant in many anomalous systems. Within the specified
range of parameters, these entropies possess positivity, continuity, symmetry,
expansibility, decisivity, maximality, concavity, and are Lesche stable. The
Boltzmann-Shannon entropy and some one parameter generalized entropies already
known belong to this class. These entropies and their distribution functions
are compared, and the corresponding deformed algebras are discussed.
