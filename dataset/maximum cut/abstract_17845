This work is to study the degrees of freedom (DoF) for the $K$-user MIMO Y
channel. Previously, two transmission frameworks have been proposed for the DoF
analysis when $N \geq 2M$, where $M$ and $N$ denote the number of antennas at
each source node and the relay node respectively. The first method is named as
signal group based alignment proposed by Hua et al. in [1]. The second is named
as signal pattern approach introduced by Wang et al. in [2]. But both of them
only studied certain antenna configurations. The maximum achievable DoF in the
general case still remains unknown. In this work, we first derive a new upper
bound of the DoF using the genie-aided approach. Then, we propose a more
general transmission framework, generalized signal alignment (GSA), and show
that the previous two methods are both special cases of GSA. With GSA, we prove
that the new DoF upper bound is achievable when $\frac{N}{M} \in
\left(0,2+\frac{4}{K(K-1)}\right] \cup \left[K-2, +\infty\right)$. The DoF
analysis in this paper provides a major step forward towards the fundamental
capacity limit of the $K$-user MIMO Y channel. It also offers a new approach of
integrating interference alignment with physical layer network coding.
