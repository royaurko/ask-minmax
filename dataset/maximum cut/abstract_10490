We investigate the claim that the ratio {\beta} of radiation pressure force
to gravitational force on a dust grain in our solar system can substantially
exceed unity for some grain sizes, provided that grain porosity is high enough.
For model grains consisting of random aggregates of silicate spherules, we find
that the maximum value of {\beta} is almost independent of grain porosity, but
for small (<0.3 {\mu}m) grains, {\beta} actually decreases with increasing
porosity. These results affect the interpretation of the grain trajectories
estimated from the Stardust mission, which were modeled assuming {\beta} values
exceeding one. We find that radiation pressure effects are not large enough for
particles Orion and Hylabrook captured by Stardust to be of interstellar origin
given their reported impact velocities. We also investigate the effect of
metallic iron inclusions in the dust grains, and find that metallic iron will
increase {\beta}, but at least half the grain (by mass) must be iron in order
to raise the maximum value of {\beta} as a function of grain size above one. We
also investigate the effects of solar radiation on transverse velocities and
grain spin, and show that radiation pressure introduces both transverse
velocities and equatorial spin velocities of several hundred meters per second
for incoming interstellar grains at 2 AU. Such spin rates may result in
centrifugal disruption of aggregates.
