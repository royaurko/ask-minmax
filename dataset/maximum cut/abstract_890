Using a Coulomb gas approach, we compute the generating function of the
covariances of power traces for one-cut $\beta$-ensembles of random matrices in
the limit of large matrix size. This formula depends only on the support of the
spectral density, and is therefore universal for a large class of models. This
allows us to derive a closed-form expression for the limiting covariances of an
arbitrary one-cut $\beta$-ensemble. As particular cases of the main result we
consider the classical $\beta$-Gaussian, $\beta$-Wishart and $\beta$-Jacobi
ensembles, for which we derive previously available results as well as new ones
within a unified simple framework. We also discuss the connections between the
problem of trace fluctuations for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble and the
enumeration of planar maps.
