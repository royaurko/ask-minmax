We calculate excitation functions for various dynamical quantities as well as
experimental observables from SIS to RHIC energies within the HSD transport
approach which is based on string, quark, diquark ($q, \bar{q}, qq,
\bar{q}\bar{q}$) and hadronic degrees of freedom without including any explicit
phase transition to a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). It is argued that the failure
of this more 'conventional' approach in comparison to experimental data should
indicate the presence of a different phase which might be either attributed to
space-time regions of vanishing scalar quark condensate ($<q\bar{q}>$ = 0) or
to the presence of a QGP phase with strongly interacting partons. We study the
$K/\pi$ ratio, the low mass dilepton enhancement in the invariant mass regime
from 0.2 -- 1.2 GeV as well as charmonium suppression for central Au + Au
collisions as a function of the bombarding energy and present predictions for
these observables as well as hadron rapiditiy distributions at RHIC energies.
Whereas all observables studied within HSD show smooth increasing/decreasing
excitation functions, the experimental $K^+/\pi^+$ ratio indicates a maximum at
11 A$\cdot$GeV (or above) which is interpreted as a signature for a chirally
restored phase in the course of the reaction.
