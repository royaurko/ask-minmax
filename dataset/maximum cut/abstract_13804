A simple model for the dynamics of the Magellanic Stream (MS), in the
framework of modified gravity models is investigated. We assume that the galaxy
is made up of baryonic matter out of context of dark matter scenario. The model
we used here is named Modified Gravity (MOG) proposed by Moffat (2005). In
order to examine the compatibility of the overall properties of the MS under
the MOG theory, the observational radial velocity profile of the MS is compared
with the numerical results using the $\chi^2$ fit method. In order to obtain
the best model parameters, a maximum likelihood analysis is performed. We also
compare the results of this model with the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halo model
and the other alternative gravity model that proposed by Bekenstein (2004), so
called TeVeS. We show that by selecting the appropriate values for the free
parameters, the MOG theory seems to be plausible to explain the dynamics of the
MS as well as the CDM and the TeVeS models.
