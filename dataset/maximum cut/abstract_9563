This paper provides a probabilistic and statistical comparison of the
log-GARCH and EGARCH models, which both rely on multiplicative volatility
dynamics without positivity constraints. We compare the main probabilistic
properties (strict stationarity, existence of moments, tails) of the EGARCH
model, which are already known, with those of an asymmetric version of the
log-GARCH. The quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of the log-GARCH parameters
is shown to be strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. Similar
estimation results are only available for particular EGARCH models, and under
much stronger assumptions. The comparison is pursued via simulation experiments
and estimation on real data.
