Motivated by the Exact Parity Model and other theories, the hypothesis that
each of the known neutrinos oscillates maximally with a sterile partner has
been put forward as an explanation of the atmospheric and solar neutrino
anomalies. We provide detailed predictions for muon and electron flux ratios
induced in the Kamiokande and SuperKamiokande detectors by sub-GeV atmospheric
neutrinos. Several different, carefully chosen cuts on momentum and zenith
angle are proposed, emphasizing the role of up-down flux asymmetries.
