Chaotic synchronization performs poorly in noisy environments, with the main
drawback being that the coherent receiver cannot be implemented in realistic
communication channels. In this paper, we focus our study on a promising
communication system based on chaotic symbolic dynamics. Such modulation shows
a high synchronization quality, without the need for a complex chaotic
synchronization mechanism. Our study mainly concerns an improvement of the
bandwidth efficiency of the chaotic modulator. A new chaotic map is proposed to
achieve this goal, and a receiver based on the maximum likelihood algorithm is
designed to estimate the transmitted symbols. The performance of the proposed
system is analyzed and discussed.
