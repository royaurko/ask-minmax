We examine the robustness of single-molecule tunneling diodes to
thermal-environmental effects. The diode comprises three fragments: two
different conjugated chemical groups at the boundaries, and a saturated moiety
in between, breaking conjugation. In this setup, molecular electronic levels
localized on the conjugated groups independently shift with applied bias. While
in the forward polarity a resonance condition is met, enhancing conductance, in
the reversed direction molecular electronic states shift away from each other,
resulting in small tunneling currents. In the absence of interactions with a
thermal environment (consisting e.g. internal vibrations, solvent),
rectification ratios reach three orders of magnitude. We introduce decoherence
and inelastic-dissipative effects phenomenologically, by using the "voltage
probe" approach. We find that when $\gamma_d \lesssim v$, with $\gamma_d$ the
interaction energy of electrons with the environment and $v$ the tunneling
energy across the saturated link, the diode is still highly effective, though
rectification ratios are cut down by a factor of 2-4 compared to the coherent
limit. To further enhance rectification ratios in molecular diodes we suggest a
refined design involving four orbitals, with a pair of closely spaced states at
each conjugated moiety.
