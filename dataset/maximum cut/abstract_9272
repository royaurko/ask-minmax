The Tully-Fisher relation of spiral galaxies shows notable dependence on
morphological types, with earlier type spirals having systematically lower
luminosity at fixed maximum rotation velocity $V_{max}$. This decrement of
luminosity is more significant in shorter wavelengths. By modeling the rotation
curve and stellar population of different morphological type spiral galaxies in
combination, we find the $V_{max}$ of spiral galaxies is weakly dependent on
the morphological type, whereas the difference of the stellar population
originating from the bulge disk composition effect mainly account for the
morphological type dependence of the Tully-Fisher relation.
