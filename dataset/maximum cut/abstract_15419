We consider the typical cell of a stationary Poisson hyperplane tessellation
in d-dimensional Euclidean space. It is well known that the expected vertex
number of the typical cell is independent of the directional distribution of
the hyperplane process. We give sharp bounds for the variance of this vertex
number, showing, in particular, that the maximum of the variance is attained if
and only if the distribution of the process is rotation invariant with respect
to a suitable scalar product.
  The employed representation of the second moment of the vertex number is a
special case of formulas providing the covariance matrix for the random vector
whose components are the total k-face contents of the typical cell. In the
isotropic case, such formulas were first obtained by R.E. Miles. We give a more
elementary proof and extend the formulas to general directional distributions.
