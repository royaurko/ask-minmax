This article studies bootstrap inference for high dimensional weakly
dependent time series in a general framework of approximately linear
statistics. The following high dimensional applications are covered: (1)
uniform confidence band for mean vector; (2) specification testing on the
second order property of time series such as white noise testing and bandedness
testing of covariance matrix; (3) specification testing on the spectral
property of time series. In theory, we first derive a Gaussian approximation
result for the maximum of a sum of weakly dependent vectors, where the
dimension of the vectors is allowed to be exponentially larger than the sample
size. In particular, we illustrate an interesting interplay between dependence
and dimensionality, and also discuss one type of "dimension free" dependence
structure. We further propose a blockwise multiplier (wild) bootstrap that
works for time series with unknown autocovariance structure. These
distributional approximation errors, which are finite sample valid, decrease
polynomially in sample size. A non-overlapping block bootstrap is also studied
as a more flexible alternative. The above results are established under the
general physical/functional dependence framework proposed in Wu (2005). Our
work can be viewed as a substantive extension of Chernozhukov et al. (2013) to
time series based on a variant of Stein's method developed therein.
