The explosive percolation problem on the complete graph is investigated via
extensive numerical simulations. We obtain the cluster-size distribution at the
moment when the cluster size heterogeneity becomes maximum. The distribution is
found to be well described by the power-law form with the decay exponent $\tau
= 2.06(2)$, followed by a hump. We then use the finite-size scaling method to
make all the distributions at various system sizes up to $N=2^{37}$ collapse
perfectly onto a scaling curve characterized solely by the single exponent
$\tau$. We also observe that the instant of that collapse converges to a
well-defined percolation threshold from below as $N\rightarrow\infty$. Based on
these observations, we show that the explosive percolation transition in the
model should be continuous, contrary to the widely-spread belief of its
discontinuity.
