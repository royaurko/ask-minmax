We match the vacuum, stationary, cylindrically symmetric solution of
Einstein's field equations with $\Lambda$, in a form recently given by Santos,
as an exterior to an infinite cylinder of dust cut out of a G\"{o}del universe.
There are three cases, depending on the radius of the cylinder. Closed timelike
curves are present in the exteriors of some of the solutions. There is a
considerable similarity between the spacetimes investigated here and those of
van Stockum referring to an infinite cylinder of rotating dust matched to
vacuum, with $\Lambda=0$.
