Understanding the lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere is critical for
predictions regarding future climate changes. A simple mass conservation
analysis presented here generates tight estimations for the atmosphere's
retention time constant. The analysis uses a leaky integrator model that
combines the observed deficit (only less than 40% of CO2 produced from
combustion of fossil fuels is actually retained in the atmosphere, while more
than 60% is continuously shed) with the exponential growth of fossil fuel
burning. It reveals a maximum characteristic time of less than 23 year for the
transfer of atmospheric CO2 to a segregation sink. This time constant is
further constrained by the rapid disappearance of 14C after the ban of
atmospheric atomic bomb tests, which provides a lower limit of 18 years for
this transfer. The study also generates evaluations of other CO2 fluxes,
exchange time constants and volumes exchanged. Analysis of large harmonic
oscillations of atmospheric CO2 concentration, often neglected in the
literature, indicate a strong. fast, time varying flux in and out of the
atmosphere, with an exchange time constant of little more than one month. The
correlation of oscillation amplitude with landmass distribution indicates that
this oscillation may have a predominantly terrestrial origin. It is predicted
that if the increase of anthropogenic CO2 production is halted, the CO2
concentration will stabilize within a quarter century.
