We have analyzed the statistical probabilities of limit-order book (LOB)
shape through building the book using the ultra-high-frequency data from 23
liquid stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2003. We find that the
averaged LOB shape has a maximum away from the same best price for both buy and
sell LOBs. The LOB shape function has nice exponential form in the right tail.
The buy LOB is found to be abnormally thicker for the price levels close to the
same best although there are much more sell orders on the book. We also find
that the LOB shape functions for both buy and sell sides have periodic peaks
with a period of five. The 1-min averaged volumes at fixed tick level follow
lognormal distributions, except for the left tails which display power-law
behaviors, and exhibit long memory. Academic implications of our empirical
results are also discussed briefly.
