In this talk I review recent progress made in extracting V_{ub} from the cut
electron energy and hadronic mass spectra of inclusive B meson decays utilizing
the data from radiative decays. It is shown that an extraction is possible
without modeling the B meson structure function. I discuss the issues involving
the assumptions of local duality in various extractions. I also comment on the
recent CLEO extraction of V_{ub}.
