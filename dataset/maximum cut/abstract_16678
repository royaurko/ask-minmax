Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI) provides researchers insight
into pathological and physiological alterations of living tissue, with the help
of which researchers hope to predict (local) therapeutic efficacy early and
determine optimal treatment schedule. However, the analysis of qMRI has been
limited to ad-hoc heuristic methods. Our research provides a powerful
statistical framework for image analysis and sheds light on future localized
adaptive treatment regimes tailored to the individual's response. We assume in
an imperfect world we only observe a blurred and noisy version of the
underlying pathological/physiological changes via qMRI, due to measurement
errors or unpredictable influences. We use a hidden Markov random field to
model the spatial dependence in the data and develop a maximum likelihood
approach via the Expectation--Maximization algorithm with stochastic variation.
An important improvement over previous work is the assessment of variability in
parameter estimation, which is the valid basis for statistical inference. More
importantly, we focus on the expected changes rather than image segmentation.
Our research has shown that the approach is powerful in both simulation studies
and on a real dataset, while quite robust in the presence of some model
assumption violations.
