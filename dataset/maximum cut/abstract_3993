Hans Bethe contributed in many ways to our understanding of the supernovae
that happen in massive stars, but, to this day, a first principles model of how
the explosion is energized is lacking. Nevertheless, a quantitative theory of
nucleosynthesis is possible. We present a survey of the nucleosynthesis that
occurs in 32 stars of solar metallicity in the mass range 12 to 120 solar
masses. The most recent set of solar abundances, opacities, mass loss rates,
and current estimates of nuclear reaction rates are employed. Restrictions on
the mass cut and explosion energy of the supernovae based upon nucleosynthesis,
measured neutron star masses, and light curves are discussed and applied. The
nucleosynthetic results, when integrated over a Salpeter initial mass function
(IMF), agree quite well with what is seen in the sun. We discuss in some detail
the production of the long lived radioactivities, 26Al and 60Fe, and why recent
model-based estimates of the ratio 60Fe/26Al are overly large compared with
what satellites have observed. A major source of the discrepancy is the
uncertain nuclear cross sections for the creation and destruction of these
unstable isotopes.
