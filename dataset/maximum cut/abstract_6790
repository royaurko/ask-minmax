Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group of order $p^n$. YA. G. Berkovich (Journal of
Algebra {\bf 144}, 269-272 (1991)) proved that $G$ is elementary abelian
$p$-group if and only if the order of its Schur multiplier, $M(G)$, is at the
maximum case. In this paper, first we find the upper bound
$p^{\chi_{c+1}{(n)}}$ for the order the $c$-nilpotent multiplier of $G$,
$M^{(c)}(G)$, where $\chi_{c+1}{(i)}$ is the number of basic commutators of
weight $c+1$ on $i$ letters. Second, we obtain the structure of $G$, in abelian
case, where $|M^{(c)}(G)|=p^{\chi_{c+1}{(n-t)}}$, for all $0\leq t\leq n-1$.
Finally, by putting a condition on the kernel of the left natural map of the
generalized Stallings-Stammbach five term exact sequence, we show that an
arbitrary finite $p$-group with the $c$-nilpotent multiplier of maximum order
is an elementary abelian $p$-group.
