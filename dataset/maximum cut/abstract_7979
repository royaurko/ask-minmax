A dielectric rod feed with a special radiation pattern of a tabletop form
used for the compact range reflector is developed and analyzed. Application of
this feed increases the size of the compact range quiet zone generated by the
reflector. The feed consists of the dielectric rod made of polystyren, the rod
is inserted into the circular waveguide with a corrugated flange. The waveguide
is excited by the H11-mode. The rod is covered by the textolite biconical
bushing and has a fluoroplastic insert in the vicinity of the bushing.
Mathematical modeling was used to obtain the parameters of the feed for the
optimal tabletop form of the radiation pattern. The problem of the
electromagnetic radiation was solved for metal-dielectric bodies of rotation by
method of integral equations with further solving of the problem of the
synthesis for feed parameters. The dielectric rod feed was fabricated for the
X-frequency range. Feed amplitude and phase patterns were measured in the
frequency range 8.2-12.5 GHz. Presented results of mathematical modeling and
measurements for X-range radiation patterns correlate well. It is shown that
this feed increases by 20-25% the quiet zone of the compact range with
reflector in the form of nonsymmetrical cutting of the paraboloid of revolution
5.0 x 4.5 m in size in the frequency range 8.5-10.0 GHz as compared to a
conical horn feed.
