The stability of a ternary system composed of decane/water/Aerosol-OT and
salt is revisited. Phase diagrams and emulsions similar in composition to those
previously studied by Hofman and Stein [Hofman, 1991] were made. Ac- cording to
our results, and contrary to the common experience, these systems exhibit a
maximum of stability very close to the balance zone.
