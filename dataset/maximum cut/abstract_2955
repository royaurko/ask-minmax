This work aims at analysing the moment effects at the tool tip point and at
the central axis, in the framework of a turning process. A testing device in
turning, including a six-component dynamometer, is used to measure the complete
torsor of the cutting actions in the case of self-excited vibrations. Many
results are obtained regarding the mechanical actions torsor. A confrontation
of the moment components at the tool tip and at the central axis is carried
out. It clearly appears that analysing moments at the central axis avoids the
disturbances induced by the transport of the moment of the mechanical actions
resultant at the tool tip point. For instance, the order relation between the
components of the forces is single. Furthermore, the order relation between the
moments components expressed at the tool tip point is also single and the same
one. But at the central axis, two different order relations regarding moments
are conceivable. A modification in the rolling moment localization in the (y,
z) tool plan is associated to these two order relations. Thus, the moments
components at the central axis are particularly sensitive at the disturbances
of machining, here the self-excited vibrations.
