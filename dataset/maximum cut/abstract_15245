In search for the cheapest but still reliable numerical simulation, a
systematic study on the effect of the computational domain ("box") size on
direct numerical simulations of Taylor-Couette flow was performed. Four boxes,
with varying azimuthal and axial extents were used. The radius ratio between
the inner cylinder and the outer cylinder was fixed to $\eta=r_i/r_o=0.909$,
and the outer was kept stationary, while the inner rotated at a Reynolds number
$Re_i=10^5$. Profiles of mean and fluctuation velocities are compared, as well
as autocorrelations and velocity spectra. The smallest box is found to
accurately reproduce the torque and mean azimuthal velocity profiles of larger
boxes, while having smaller values of the fluctuations than the larger boxes.
The axial extent of the box directly reflects on the Taylor-rolls and plays a
crucial role on the correlations and spectra. The azimuthal extent is also
found to play a significant role, as larger boxes allow for azimuthal wave-like
patterns in the Taylor rolls to develop, which affects the statistics in the
bulk region. For all boxes studied, the spectra does not reach a box
independent maximum.
