Gamma-ray bursts are the most luminous events in the Universe. Going beyond
the short-long classification scheme we work in the context of three burst
populations with the third group of intermediate duration and softest spectrum.
We are looking for physical properties which discriminate the intermediate
duration bursts from the other two classes. We use maximum likelihood fits to
establish group memberships in the duration-hardness plane. To confirm these
results we also use k-means and hierarchical clustering. We use Monte-Carlo
simulations to test the significance of the existence of the intermediate group
and we find it with 99.8% probability. The intermediate duration population has
a significantly lower peak-flux (with 99.94% significance). Also, long bursts
with measured redshift have higher peak-fluxes (with 98.6% significance) than
long bursts without measured redshifts. As the third group is the softest, we
argue that we have {related} them with X-ray flashes among the gamma-ray
bursts. We give a new, probabilistic definition for this class of events.
