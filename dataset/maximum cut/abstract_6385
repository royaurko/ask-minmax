Dielectric nonlinear response of
(PbMg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$O$_3$)$_{0.9}$(PbTiO$_3$)$_{0.1}$ (0.9PMN-0.1PT) relaxor
ceramics was investigated under different ac drive voltages. It was observed
that: (i) the dielectric permittivity is independent on ac field amplitude at
high temperatures; (ii) with increasing ac drive, the permittivity maximum
increases, and the temperature of the maximum shifts to lower temperature;
(iii) the nonlinear effect is weakened when the measurement frequency
increases. The influences of increasing ac drive were found to be similar to
that of decreasing frequency. It is believed that the dielectric nonlinearities
of relaxors at low drives can be explained by the phase transition theory of
ergodic space shrinking in succession. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed
on the flips of micro polarizations at low ac drives to verify the theory.
