We present the results from an optical study of the stellar & star formation
properties of NGC 925 using the WIYN 3.5m telescope. Images in B,V,R, & H-alpha
reveal a galaxy that is fraught with asymmetries. From isophote fits we
discover that the bar center is not coincident with the center of the outer
isophotes nor with the dynamical center (from Pisano et al. 1998). Cuts across
the spiral arms reveal that the northern arms are distinctly different from the
southern arm. The southern arm not only appears more coherent, but the peaks in
stellar and H-alpha emission are found to be coincident with those of the HI
distribution, while no such consistency is present in the northern disk. We
also examine the gas surface density criterion for massive star formation in
NGC 925, and find that its behavior is more consistent with that for irregular
galaxies, than with late-type spirals. In particular, star formation persists
beyond the radius at which the gas surface density falls below the predicted
critical value for star formation for late-type spirals. Such properties are
characteristic of Magellanic spirals, but are present at a less dramatic level
in NGC 925, a late-type spiral.
