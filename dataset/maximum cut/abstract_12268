A kinetic theory of relativistic gases in a two-dimensional space is
developed in order to obtain the equilibrium distribution function and the
expressions for the fields of energy per particle, pressure, entropy per
particle and heat capacities in equilibrium. Furthermore, by using the method
of Chapman and Enskog for a kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation the
non-equilibrium energy-momentum tensor and the entropy production rate are
determined for a universe described by a two-dimensional Robertson-Walker
metric. The solutions of the gravitational field equations that consider the
non-equilibrium energy-momentum tensor - associated with the coefficient of
bulk viscosity - show that opposed to the four-dimensional case, the cosmic
scale factor attains a maximum value at a finite time decreasing to a "big
crunch" and that there exists a solution of the gravitational field equations
corresponding to a "false vacuum". The evolution of the fields of pressure,
energy density and entropy production rate with the time is also discussed.
