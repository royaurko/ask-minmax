We show that important anomalous features of the normal-state thermoelectric
power S of high-Tc materials can be understood as being caused by doping
dependent short-range antiferromagnetic correlations. The theory is based on
the fluctuation-exchange approximation applied to Hubbard model in the
framework of the Kubo formalism. Firstly, the characteristic maximum of S as
function of temperature can be explained by the anomalous momentum dependence
of the single-particle scattering rate. Secondly, we discuss the role of the
actual Fermi surface shape for the occurrence of a sign change of S as a
function of temperature and doping.
