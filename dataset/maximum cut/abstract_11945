Raman scattering in the heavily overdoped (Y,Ca)Ba_2Cu_3O_{7-d} (T_c = 65 K)
and Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+d} (T_c = 55 K) crystals has been investigated. For the
both crystals, the electronic pair-breaking peaks in the A_{1g} and B_{1g}
polarizations were largely shifted to the low energies close to a half of
2Delta_0, Delta_0 being the maximum gap. It strongly suggests s-wave mixing
into the d-wave superconducting order parameter and the consequent
manifestation of the Coulomb screening effect in the B_{1g}-channel. Gradual
mixing of s-wave component with overdoping is not due to the change of crystal
structure symmetry but a generic feature in all high-T_c superconducting
cuprates.
