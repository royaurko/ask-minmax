In these notes we describe how to formulate the Lagrangian insertion
technique in a way that mimics generalized unitarity. We introduce a notion of
cuts in real space and show that the cuts of the correlators in the
super-correlators/super-amplitudes duality correspond to generalized unitarity
cuts of the equivalent amplitudes. The cuts consist of correlation functions of
operators in the chiral part of the stress-tensor multiplet as well as other
half-BPS operators. We will also discuss the application of the method to other
correlators as well as non-planar contributions.
