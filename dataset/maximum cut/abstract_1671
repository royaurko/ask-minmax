Conditional Equi-concentration of Types on I-projections is presented. It
provides an extension of Conditional Weak Law of Large Numbers to the case of
several I-projections. Also a multiple I-projections extension of Gibbs
Conditioning Principle is developed. mu-projection variants of the
probabilistic laws are stated. Implications of the results for Relative Entropy
Maximization, Maximum Probability, Maximum Entropy in the Mean and Maximum
Renyi-Tsallis Entropy methods are discussed.
