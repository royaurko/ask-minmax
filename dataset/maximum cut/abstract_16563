As we know, the states of triqubit systems have two important classes:
GHZ-class and W-class.
  In this paper, the states of W-class are considered for teleportation and
superdense coding, and are generalized to multi-particle systems. First we
describe two transformations of the shared resources for teleportation and
superdense coding, which allow many new protocols from some known ones for
that. As an application of these transformations, we obtain a sufficient and
necessary condition for a state of W-class being suitable for perfect
teleportation and superdense coding. As another application, we find that state
  $|W>_{123}={1/2}(|100>_{123}+|010>_{123}+\sqrt{2}|001>_{123})$ can be used to
transmit three classical bits by sending two qubits, which was considered to be
impossible by P. Agrawal and A. Pati [Phys. Rev. A to be published]. We
generalize the states of W-class to multi-qubit systems and multi-particle
systems with higher dimension. We propose two protocols for teleportation and
superdense coding by using W-states of multi-qubit systems that generalize the
protocols by using $|W>_{123}$ proposed by P. Agrawal and A. Pati. We obtain an
optimal way to partition some W-states of multi-qubit systems into two
subsystems, such that the entanglement between them achieves maximum value.
