Room temperature Mn K-edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
studies were carried out on La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_{3+\delta}$ (x = 0.1 to 0.9)
compounds. It is found from the detailed EXAFS analysis that the local
structure around Mn sites is different from the global structure inferred from
x-ray diffraction, especially for x <= 0.4, indicating presence of local
distortions in MnO$_6$ octahedra. For the rhombohedral compounds, x = 0.1 to
0.3 the distortion is maximum for x = 0.1 and two bond lengths are seen- short
one in basal plane and long one in apical plane. For compounds with x = 0.4 to
0.8 two short bonds in basal plane and four long bonds- two in the basal plane
and remaining two in the apical plane are seen. For the compounds up to x = 0.3
compositions long bond length decreases and short bond length increases with
increase in x whereas for the compounds 0.4 <= x <= 0.8 both types of bond
lengths decrease. Such behaviour of bond lengths is an indication of the
changed nature of distortion from Jahn-Teller type to breathing type at x = 0.4
composition.
