A Cramer moderate deviation theorem for Hotelling's $T^2$-statistic is proved
under a finite $(3+\delta)$th moment. The result is applied to large scale
tests on the equality of mean vectors and is shown that the number of tests can
be as large as $e^{o(n^{1/3})}$ before the chi-squared distribution calibration
becomes inaccurate. As an application of the moderate deviation results, a
global test on the equality of m mean vectors based on the maximum of
Hotelling's $T^2$-statistics is developed and its asymptotic null distribution
is shown to be an extreme value type I distribution. A novel intermediate
approximation to the null distribution is proposed to improve the slow
convergence rate of the extreme distribution approximation. Numerical studies
show that the new test procedure works well even for a small sample size and
performs favorably in analyzing a breast cancer dataset.
