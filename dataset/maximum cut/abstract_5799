Given a set $X$ of natural numbers, we may formalize "The formula $\phi$ is
provable in $\omega$-logic over the theory $T$ using an oracle for $X$" by a
formula $[\infty|X]_T\phi$ in the language of second-order arithmetic. We will
prove that the consistency and reflection principles arising from this notion
of provability may lead to axiomatizations of $\Pi^1_1$-$CA_0$.
  To be precise, we prove that whenever $U$ is an extension of $RCA^\ast_0$ (or
even the weaker $ECA_0$) that is no stronger than $\Pi^1_1$-$CA_0$, and $T$ is
an extension of Robinson's $Q$ with exponential and no stronger than
$\Pi^1_\infty$-$TI_0$, then the theories
  1) $\Pi^1_1$-$CA_0$
  2) $U+ \forall X \neg[\infty|X]_T \bot$
  3) $U+ \Big \{ \forall X \forall n \big ( [\infty|X]_T\phi(\bar n,\bar X)\to
\phi(n,X)\big ) : \phi\in {\Pi}^1_3\Big \}$ are all equivalent. Similar results
are given for the case where $T$ is cut-free.
