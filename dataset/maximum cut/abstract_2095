Using the well-known ``displace, cut and reflect'' method used to generate
disks from given solutions of Einstein field equations, we construct static
charged disks made of perfect fluid based on the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m
solution in isotropic coordinates. We also derive a simple stability condition
for charged and non charged perfect fluid disks. As expected, we find that the
presence of charge increases the regions of instability of the disks.
