In this paper we provide a complete approach to the real numbers via decimal
representations. Construction of the real numbers by Dedekind cuts, Cauchy
sequences of rational numbers, and the algebraic characterization of the real
number system by the concept of complete ordered field are also well explained
in the new setting.
