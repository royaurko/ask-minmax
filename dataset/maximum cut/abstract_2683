ATLAS and CMS report indications of a Higgs boson at M_h 125 GeV. In
addition, CMS data show a tenuous bump in the ZZ channel, at about 320 GeV. We
make the bold assumption that it might be the indication of a secondary line
corresponding to the heaviest scalar Higgs boson of Minimal Supersymmetry, H,
and discuss the viability of this hypothesis. We discuss also the case of a
heavier H, the relevance of the b bbar decay channel is underlined.
