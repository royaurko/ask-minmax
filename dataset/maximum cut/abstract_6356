Particle acceleration at non-relativistic shocks can be very efficient,
leading to the appearance of non-linear effects due to the dynamical reaction
of the accelerated particles on the shock structure and to the non-linear
amplification of the magnetic field in the shock vicinity. The value of the
maximum momentum $p_{max}$ in these circumstances cannot be estimated using the
classical results obtained within the framework of test particle approaches. We
provide here the first attempt at estimating $p_{max}$ in the cosmic ray
modified regime, taking into account the non-linear effects mentioned above.
