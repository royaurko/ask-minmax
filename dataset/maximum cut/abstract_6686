We report a novel pressure-induced spin-density-wave transition in the
superconductor Mo3Sb7 figured our by measurements of the electrical resistivity
and magnetization under hydrostatic pressure. The critical temperature of
superconducting Mo3Sb7 is found to increase with increasing pressure, from 2.15
K at 0.2 kbar up to 2.37 K at 22 kbar. Above 4.5 kbar, superconductivity exists
in parallel with a pressure-induced spin-density wave state, revealed by a
sharp jump in the electrical resistivity and a maximum in the magnetization at
the phase transition temperature T_SDW. The application of pressure shifts
T_SDW to lower temperatures, from 6.6 K at 4.5 kbar down to 6.15 K at 22 kbar.
A strong magnetic field dependence of T_SDW and a maximum seen in the
magnetization indicate an antiferromagnetic character of T_SDW. The pressure
dependence of T_c and T_SDW suggests a competition of the SDW and the
superconducting states in this system.
