In this paper, we introduce a new distribution generated by Lindley random
variable which off?ers a more flexible model for modelling lifetime data.
Various statistical properties like distribution function, survival function,
moments, entropy, and limiting distribution of extreme order statistics are
established. Inference for a random sample from the proposed distribution is
investigated and maximum likelihood estimation method is used for estimating
parameters of this distribution. The applicability of the proposed distribution
is shown through real data sets.
