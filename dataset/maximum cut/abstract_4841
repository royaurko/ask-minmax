We investigate the gravitational one-loop divergences of the standard model
in large extra dimensions, with gravitons propagating in the
(4+delta)-dimensional bulk and gauge fields as well as scalar and fermionic
multiplets confined to a three-brane. To determine the divergences we establish
a cut-off regularization which allows us to extract gauge-invariant
counterterms. In contrast to the claim of a recent paper [arXiv:0807.0132], we
show that the fermionic and scalar higher derivative counterterms do not
coincide with the higher derivative terms in the Lee-Wick standard model. We
argue that even if the exact Lee-Wick higher derivative terms were found, as in
the case of the pure gauge sector, this would not allow to conclude the
existence of the massive ghost fields corresponding to these higher derivative
terms in the Lee-Wick standard model.
