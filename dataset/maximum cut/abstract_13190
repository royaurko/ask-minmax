We present synthetic spectra around maximum for the type II supernova SN
2003Z, which was first detected on January 29.7 2003. Comparison with observed
spectra aim at the determination of physical parameters for SN 2003Z. Synthetic
spectra are calculated with our stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX. It solves the
special relativistic equation of radiative transfer, including large
NLTE-calculations and line blanketing by design, in 1-dimensional spherical
symmetry. The observed spectra were obtained at the 3.5 meter telescope at
Calar Alto. The TWIN instrument was used so that a spectral range from about
3600 to 7500 Angstroem was covered. The spectra were taken on Feb. 4, 5, 9, and
11, 2003. The physical parameters of the models give the luminosities, a range
of possible velocity profiles for the SN, an estimate of the colour excess, and
the observed metalicity.
