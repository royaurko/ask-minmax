The thermal behavior of free and alumina-supported iron-carbon nanoparticles
is investigated via molecular dynamics simulations, in which the effect of the
substrate is treated with a simple Morse potential fitted to ab initio data. We
observe that the presence of the substrate raises the melting temperature of
medium and large $Fe_{1-x}C_x$ nanoparticles ($x$ = 0-0.16, $N$ = 80-1000, non-
magic numbers) by 40-60 K; it also plays an important role in defining the
ground state of smaller Fe nanoparticles ($N$ = 50-80). The main focus of our
study is the investigation of Fe-C phase diagrams as a function of the
nanoparticle size. We find that as the cluster size decreases in the
1.1-1.6-nm-diameter range the eutectic point shifts significantly not only
toward lower temperatures, as expected from the Gibbs-Thomson law, but also
toward lower concentrations of C. The strong dependence of the maximum C
solubility on the Fe-C cluster size may have important implications for the
catalytic growth of carbon nanotubes by chemical vapor deposition.
