The critical-velocity behavior of oscillatory superfluid Helium-4 flow
through a 2-micrometer by 2-micrometer aperture in a 0.1-micrometer-thick foil
has been studied from 0.36 K to 2.10 K at frequencies from less than 50 Hz up
to above 1880 Hz. The pressure remained less than 0.5 bar. In early runs during
which the frequency remained below 400 Hz, the critical velocity was a
nearly-linearly decreasing function of increasing temperature throughout the
region of temperature studied. In runs at the lowest frequencies, isolated 2 Pi
phase slips could be observed at the onset of dissipation. In runs with
frequencies higher than 400 Hz, downward curvature was observed in the decrease
of critical velocity with increasing temperature. In addition, above 500 Hz an
alteration in supercritical behavior was seen at the lower temperatures,
involving the appearance of large energy-loss events. These irregular events
typically lasted a few tens of half-cycles of oscillation and could involve
hundreds of times more energy loss than would have occurred in a single
complete 2 Pi phase slip at maximum flow. The temperatures at which this
altered behavior was observed rose with frequency, from ~ 0.6 K and below, at
500 Hz, to ~ 1.0 K and below, at 1880 Hz.
