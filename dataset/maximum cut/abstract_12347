Supersymmetry is perhaps most effectively probed at the Tevatron through
production and decay of weak gauginos. Most of the analyses of weak gaugino
observables require electrons or muons in the final state. However, it is
possible that the gauginos will decay primarily to tau leptons, thus
complicating the search for supersymmetry. The motivating reasons for high tau
multiplicity final states are discussed in three approaches to supersymmetry
model building: minimal supergravity, gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking,
and more minimal supersymmetry. The concept of ``e/mu/tau candidate'' is
introduced, and an observable with three e/mu/tau candidates is defined in
analog to the trilepton observable. The maximum mass reach for supersymmetry is
then estimated when gaugino decays to tau leptons have full branching fraction.
