Tungsten ditelluride has attracted intense research interest due to the
recent discovery of its large unsaturated magnetoresistance up to 60 Tesla.
Motivated by the presence of a small, sensitive Fermi surface of 5d electronic
orbitals, we boost the electronic properties by applying a high pressure, and
introduce superconductivity successfully. Superconductivity sharply appears at
a pressure of 2.5 GPa, rapidly reaching a maximum critical temperature (Tc) of
7 K at around 16.8 GPa, followed by a monotonic decrease in Tc with increasing
pressure, thereby exhibiting the typical dome-shaped superconducting phase.
From theoretical calculations, we interpret the low-pressure region of the
superconducting dome to an enrichment of the density of states at the Fermi
level and attribute the high-pressure decrease in Tc to possible structural
instability. Thus, Tungsten ditelluride may provide a new platform for our
understanding of superconductivity phenomena in transition metal
dichalcogenides.
