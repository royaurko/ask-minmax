For a given graph H and n ? 1; let f(n;H) denote the maximum number m for
which it is possible to colour the edges of the complete graph Kn with m
colours in such a way that each subgraph H in Kn has at least two edges of the
same colour. Equivalently, any edge-colouring of Kn with at least rb(n;H) =
f(n;H)+1 colours contains a rainbow copy of H: The numbers f(n;H) and rb(Kn;H)
are called anti-ramsey numbers and rainbow numbers, respectively. In this paper
we will classify the rainbow number for a given graph H with respect to its
cyclomatic number. Let H be a graph of order p >= 4 and cyclomatic number v(H)
>= 2: Then rb(Kn;H) cannot be bounded from above by a function which is linear
in n: If H has cyclomatic number v(H) = 1; then rb(Kn;H) is linear in n: We
will compute all rainbow numbers for the bull B; which is the unique graph with
5 vertices and degree sequence (1; 1; 2; 3; 3): Furthermore, we will compute
some rainbow numbers for the diamond D = K_4 - e; for K_2;3; and for the house
H (complement of P_5).
