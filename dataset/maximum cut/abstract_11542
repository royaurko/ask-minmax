We have calculated proper motions and re-evaluated the membership
probabilities of 810 stars in the area of two NGC objects, NGC 1817 and NGC
1807. We have obtained absolute proper motions from 25 plates in the reference
system of the Tycho-2 Catalogue. The plates have a maximum epoch difference of
81 years; and they were taken with the double astrograph at Zo-Se station of
Shanghai Observatory, which has an aperture of 40 cm and a plate scale of 30
arcsec/mm. The average proper motion precision is 1.55 mas/yr. These proper
motions are used to determine the membership probabilities of stars in the
region, based on there being only one very extended physical cluster: NGC 1817.
With that aim, we have applied and compared parametric and non-parametric
approaches to cluster/field segregation. We have obtained a list of 169
probable member stars.
