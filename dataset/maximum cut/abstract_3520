The spin-up of a neutron star crucially depends on the maximum orbital
frequency around it, as do a host of other high energy accretion phenomena in
low mass X-ray binaries, including quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the
X-ray flux. We compare the maximum orbital frequencies for MIT-bag quark stars
and for neutron stars modeled with the FPS equation of state. The results are
based on relativistic calculations of constant baryon sequences of uniformly
rotating strange star models, and are presented as a function of the stellar
rotational frequency. The marginally stable orbit is present outside quark
stars for a wide range of parameters, but outside the neutron stars it is
present only for the highest values of mass. This allows a discrimination
between quark stars and neutron stars in the resonance theory of kHz QPOs.
