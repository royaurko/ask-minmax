Albert Einstein's real "biggest blunder" was not the 1917 introduction into
his gravitational field equations of a cosmological constant term \Lambda,
rather was his failure in 1916 to distinguish between the entirely different
concepts of active gravitational mass and passive gravitational mass. Had he
made the distinction, and followed David Hilbert's lead in deriving field
equations from a variational principle, he might have discovered a true (not a
cut and paste) Einstein-Rosen bridge and a cosmological model that would have
allowed him to predict, long before such phenomena were imagined by others,
inflation, a big bounce (not a big bang), an accelerating expansion of the
universe, dark matter, and the existence of cosmic voids, walls, filaments, and
nodes.
