In the present paper we show a dichotomy theorem for the complexity of
polynomial evaluation. We associate to each graph H a polynomial that encodes
all graphs of a fixed size homomorphic to H. We show that this family is
computable by arithmetic circuits in constant depth if H has a loop or no edge
and that it is hard otherwise (i.e., complete for VNP, the arithmetic class
related to #P). We also demonstrate the hardness over the rational field of cut
eliminator, a polynomial defined by B\"urgisser which is known to be neither VP
nor VNP-complete in the field of two elements, if VP is not equal to VNP (VP is
the class of polynomials computable by arithmetic circuit of polynomial size).
