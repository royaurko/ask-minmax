We present limits on the WIMP-nucleon cross section for inelastic dark matter
derived from the 2008 run of ZEPLIN-III. Cuts, notably on scintillation pulse
shape and scintillation-to-ionisation ratio, give a net exposure of 63 kg.days
in the range 20-80keV nuclear recoil energy, in which 6 events are observed.
Upper limits on signal rate are derived from the maximum empty patch in the
data. Under standard halo assumptions a small region of parameter space
consistent, at 99% CL, with causing the 1.17 ton.year DAMA modulation signal is
allowed at 90% CL: it is in the mass range 45-60 GeV with a minimum CL of 88%,
again derived from the maximum patch. This is the tightest constraint on that
explanation of the DAMA result yet presented using a xenon target.
