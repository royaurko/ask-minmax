A complete characterization of the possible joint distributions of the
maximum and terminal value of uniformly integrable martingale has been known
for some time, and the aim of this paper is to establish a similar
characterization for continuous martingales of the joint law of the minimum,
final value, and maximum, along with the direction of the final excursion. We
solve this problem completely for the discrete analogue, that of a simple
symmetric random walk stopped at some almost-surely finite stopping time. This
characterization leads to robust hedging strategies for derivatives whose value
depends on the maximum, minimum and final values of the underlying asset.
