We consider cut-elimination in the sequent calculus for classical first-order
logic. It is well known that this system, in its most general form, is neither
confluent nor strongly normalizing. In this work we take a coarser (and
mathematically more realistic) look at cut-free proofs. We analyze which
witnesses they choose for which quantifiers, or in other words: we only
consider the Herbrand-disjunction of a cut-free proof. Our main theorem is a
confluence result for a natural class of proofs: all (possibly infinitely many)
normal forms of the non-erasing reduction lead to the same
Herbrand-disjunction.
