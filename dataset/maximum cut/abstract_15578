We consider the problem of estimating self-exciting point process models from
limited binary observations, where the history of the process serves as the
covariate. We analyze the performance of two classes of estimators:
$\ell_1$-regularized maximum likelihood and greedy estimation for a discrete
version of the Hawkes process and characterize the sampling tradeoffs required
for stable recovery in the non-asymptotic regime. Our results extend those of
compressed sensing for linear and generalized linear models with i.i.d.
covariates to point processes with highly inter-dependent covariates. We
further provide simulation studies as well as application to real spiking data
from mouse's lateral geniculate nucleus which chime in accordance with our
theoretical predictions.
