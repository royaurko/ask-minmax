We show that the photoassociation (PA) rate of ultracold diatomic molecules
in the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance could be used to probe variations of
the electron-to-proton mass ratio $\beta = m_e/m_p$, a quantity related to
other fundamental constants via the $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$ scale. The PA rate
exhibits two features near a Feshbach resonance, a minimum and a maximum, which
are very sensitive to the details of the interactions and the exact mass of the
system. The effect and detection threshold are illustrated in the formation
rates of ultracold Li$_2$ and LiNa molecules by performing coupled-channel
calculations in an external magnetic field. We find that the PA rate is
particularly sensitive near narrow Feshbach resonances in heavy molecules,
where it might be possible to detect relative variability of $\beta$ on the
order of $10^{-15}-10^{-16}$. We also use a two-channel model to derive a
proportionality relation between the variation of the PA rate and $\beta$
applicable to diatomic molecules.
