We present an overview of precise pulsar timing using data from the Large
Area Telescope (LAT) on Fermi. We describe the analysis techniques including a
maximum likelihood method for determining pulse times of arrival from unbinned
photon data. In addition to determining the spindown behavior of the pulsars
and detecting glitches and timing noise, such timing analyses allow the precise
determination of the pulsar position, thus enabling detailed multiwavelength
follow up.
