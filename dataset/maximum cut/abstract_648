Wu has shown that if a link or a knot $L$ in $S^3$ in thin position has thin
spheres, then the thin sphere of lowest width is an essential surface in the
link complement. In this paper we show that if we further assume that $L
\subset S^3$ is prime, then the thin sphere of lowest width also does not have
any vertical cut-disks. We also prove the result for a specific kind of tangles
in $S^2 \times [-1,1]$.
