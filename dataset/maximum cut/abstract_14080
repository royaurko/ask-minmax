We explore various estimators for the parameters of a pair-copula
construction (PCC), among those the stepwise semiparametric (SSP) estimator,
designed for this dependence structure. We present its asymptotic properties,
as well as the estimation algorithm for the two most common types of PCCs.
Compared to the considered alternatives, that is, maximum likelihood, inference
functions for margins and semiparametric estimation, SSP is in general
asymptotically less efficient. As we show in a few examples, this loss of
efficiency may however be rather low. Furthermore, SSP is semiparametrically
efficient for the Gaussian copula. More importantly, it is computationally
tractable even in high dimensions, as opposed to its competitors. In any case,
SSP may provide start values, required by the other estimators. It is also well
suited for selecting the pair-copulae of a PCC for a given data set.
