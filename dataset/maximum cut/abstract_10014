Charge transport in electrorheological fluids is studied experimentally under
strongly nonequlibrium conditions. By injecting an electrical current into a
suspension of conducting nanoparticles we are able to initiate a process of
self-organization which leads, in certain cases, to formation of a stable
pattern which consists of continuous conducting chains of particles. The
evolution of the dissipative state in such system is a complex process. It
starts as an avalanche process characterized by nucleation, growth, and thermal
destruction of such dissipative elements as continuous conducting chains of
particles as well as electroconvective vortices. A power-law distribution of
avalanche sizes and durations, observed at this stage of the evolution,
indicates that the system is in a self-organized critical state. A sharp
transition into an avalanche-free state with a stable pattern of conducting
chains is observed when the power dissipated in the fluid reaches its maximum.
We propose a simple evolution model which obeys the maximum power condition and
also shows a power-law distribution of the avalanche sizes.
