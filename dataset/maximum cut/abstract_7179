We consider a class of linear codes associated to projective algebraic
varieties defined by the vanishing of minors of a fixed size of a generic
matrix. It is seen that the resulting code has only a small number of distinct
weights. The case of varieties defined by the vanishing of 2 x 2 minors is
considered in some detail. Here we obtain the complete weight distribution.
Moreover, several generalized Hamming weights are determined explicitly and it
is shown that the first few of them coincide with the distinct nonzero weights.
One of the tools used is to determine the maximum possible number of matrices
of rank 1 in a linear space of matrices of a given dimension over a finite
field. In particular, we determine the structure and the maximum possible
dimension of linear spaces of matrices in which every nonzero matrix has rank
1.
