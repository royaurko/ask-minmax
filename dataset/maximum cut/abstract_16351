We present a computational study of the dynamic behavior of a
Ziff-Gulari-Barshad model of CO oxidation with CO desorption on a catalytic
surface. Our results provide further evidence that below a critical desorption
rate the model exhibits a non-equilibrium, first-order phase transition between
low and high CO coverage phases. Our kinetic Monte Carlo simulations indicate
that the transition process between these phases follows a decay mechanism very
similar to the one described by the classic Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami
theory of phase transformation by nucleation and growth. We measure the
lifetimes of the metastable phases on each side of the transition line and find
that they are strongly dependent on the direction of the transformation, i.e.,
from low to high coverage or vice versa. Inspired by this asymmetry, we
introduce a square-wave periodic external forcing, whose two parameters can be
tuned to enhance the catalytic activity. At CO desorption rates below the
critical value, we find that this far-from-equilibrium system undergoes a
dynamic phase transition between a CO_2 productive phase and a nonproductive
one. In the space of the parameters of the periodic external forcing, this
nonequilibrium phase transition defines a line of critical points. The maximum
enhancement rate for the CO_2 production rate occurs near this critical line.
