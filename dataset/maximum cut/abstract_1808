Given a class of graphs G closed under taking minors, we study the maximum
degree \Delta_n of random graphs from G with n vertices. We prove several lower
and upper bounds that hold with high probability. Among other results, we find
classes of graphs providing orders of magnitude for \Delta_n not observed
before, such us \log n/ \log \log \log n and \log n/ \log \log \log \log n.
