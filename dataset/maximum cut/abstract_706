We consider the reconstruction of the CMB lensing potential and its power
spectrum of the full sphere in presence of sky-cuts due to point sources and
Galactic contaminations. Those two effects are treated separately. Small
regions contaminated by point sources are filled in using Gaussian constrained
realizations. The Galactic plane is simply masked using an apodized mask before
lensing reconstruction. This algorithm recovers the power spectrum of the
lensing potential with no significant bias.
