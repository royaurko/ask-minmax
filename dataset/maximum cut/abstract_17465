The two-stream instability is a common instability, responsible for many
observed phenomena in nature, especially the interaction of jets of various
origin with the background plasma (e.g. extragalactic jet interacting with the
cosmic background). The dispersion relation not considering magnetic field is
described by the well-known Buneman relation. In 2011, Bohata, Bren, and
Kulhanek derived the relation for the two-stream instability without the cold
limit, with the general orientation of magnetic field, and arbitrary stream
directions. The maximum value of the imaginary part of the individual
dispersion branches is of interest from the physical point of view. It
represents the instability growth rate which is responsible for the turbulence
mode onset and subsequent reconnection on the ion radius scale accompanied by a
strong plasma thermalization. The paper presented here is focused on the
non-relativistic instability growth rate and its dependence on various input
parameters, such as magnitude and direction of magnetic field, sound velocity,
plasma frequency of the jet and direction of the wave vector during the jet -
background interaction. The results are presented in well-arranged plots and
can be used for determination of the plasma parameter values close to which the
strong energy transfer and thermalization between the jet and the background
plasma occur.
