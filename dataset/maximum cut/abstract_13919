We investigate the dynamics of a single hole coupled to the spiral
fluctuations related to the magnetic ground states of the antiferromagnetic
J_1-J_2-J_3 Heisenberg model on a square lattice. Using exact diagonalization
on finite size clusters and the self consistent Born approximation in the
thermodynamic limit we find, as a general feature, a strong reduction of the
quasiparticle weight along the spiral phases of the magnetic phase diagram. For
an important region of the Brillouin Zone the hole spectral functions are
completely incoherent, whereas at low energies the spectral weight is
redistributed on several irregular peaks. We find a characteristic value of the
spiral pitch, Q=(0.7,0.7)\pi, for which the available phase space for hole
scattering is maximum. We argue that this behavior is due to the non trivial
interference of the magnon assisted and the free hopping mechanism for hole
motion, characteristic of a hole coupled to semiclassical spiral fluctuations.
