A new density dependent effective baryon-baryon interaction has been recently
derived from the quark-meson-coupling (QMC) model, offering impressive results
in application to finite nuclei and dense baryon matter. This self-consistent,
relativistic quark-level approach is used to construct the Equation of State
(EoS) and to calculate key properties of high density matter and cold, slowly
rotating neutron stars. The results include predictions for the maximum mass of
neutron star models, together with the corresponding radius and central
density, as well the properties of neutron stars with mass of order 1.4
$M_\odot$. The cooling mechanism allowed by the QMC EoS is explored and the
parameters relevant to slow rotation, namely the moment of inertia and the
period of rotation investigated. The results of the calculation, which are
found to be in good agreement with available observational data, are compared
with the predictions of more traditional EoS. The QMC EoS provides cold neutron
star models with maximum mass 1.9--2.1 M$_\odot$, with central density less
than 6 times nuclear saturation density ($n_{0}= 0.16 {\rm fm}^{-3}$) and
offers a consistent description of the stellar mass up to this density limit.
In contrast with other models, QMC predicts no hyperon contribution at
densities lower than $3n_0$, for matter in $\beta$-equilibrium. At higher
densities, $\Xi^{-,0}$ and $\Lambda$ hyperons are present.
