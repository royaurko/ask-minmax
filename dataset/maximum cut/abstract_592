While the hard phase of the strong interaction is well described by
perturbative QCD, the soft hadronization phase is less understood. Benefiting
from the high statistics from e+e- experiments at the Z0 resonance, it is
possible to impose strong two-jet cuts on the data without loosing the
statistical significance. In these events perturbative activity is suppressed
and hadronization effects can be more prominent. We show that after proper
event cuts a set of observables are sensitive to differences in the
hadronization models. These observables can thus be important tools for a more
detailed study of the hadronization mechanism.
