In this paper, we construct thin-shell wormholes in (2+1)-dimensions from
noncommutative BTZ black hole by applying the cut-and-paste procedure
implemented by Visser. We calculate the surface stresses localized at the
wormhole throat by using the Darmois-Israel formalism, and we ?nd that the
wormholes are supported by matter violating the energy conditions. In order to
explore the dynamical analysis of the wormhole throat, we consider that the
matter at the shell is supported by dark energy equation of state P = w\rho
with w < 0. The stability analysis is carried out of these wormholes to
linearized spherically symmetric perturbations around static solutions.
Preserving the symmetry we also consider the linearized radial perturbation
around static solution to investigate the stability of wormholes which explored
by the parameter \beta (speed of sound).
