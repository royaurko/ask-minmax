LS I +61 303 is one of the most studied X-ray binary systems because of its
two peculiarities: On the one hand being the probable counterpart of the
variable gamma ray source 2CG 135+01 (Gregory and Taylor 1978; Tavani et al.
1998) and on the other hand being a periodic radio source (Taylor and Gregory
1982). The recent discovery of a radio emitting jet extending ca. 200 AU at
both sides of a central core (Massi et al. 2004) in all evidence has shown the
occurrence of accretion/ejection processes in this system. However, the radio
outbursts do not occur at periastron passage, where the accretion is at its
maximum, but several days later. In addition, when the gamma-ray emission of
2CG 135+01 is examined along the orbital phase of LS I +61 303 one sees that
this emission seems to peak at periastron passage (Massi 2004). Here in detail
we analyse the trend of the gamma-ray data versus orbital phase and discuss the
delay between peaks at gamma-rays and in the radio band within the framework of
a two-peak accretion/ejection model proposed by Taylor et al. (1992) and
further developed by Marti' and Paredes (1995).
