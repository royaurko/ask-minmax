Tuza's Conjecture states that if a graph $G$ does not contain more than $k$
edge-disjoint triangles, then some set of at most $2k$ edges meets all
triangles of $G$. We prove Tuza's Conjecture for all graphs $G$ having no
subgraph with average degree at least $7$. As a key tool in the proof, we
introduce a notion of reducible sets for Tuza's Conjecture; these are
substructures which cannot occur in a minimal counterexample to Tuza's
Conjecture. We also introduce weak K\"onig--Egerv\'ary graphs, a generalization
of the well-studied K\"onig--Egerv\'ary graphs.
