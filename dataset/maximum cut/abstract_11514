We analyze a time series of high angular resolution magnetograms of quiet Sun
Inter-Network (IN) magnetic fields. These magnetograms have a spatial
resolution better than 0.5 arcsec, a noise of some 20 G, and they have been
obtained at the disk center during the minimum of the solar cycle. The IN
regions show a typical unsigned flux density of the order of 15 G. Signals
occur, preferentially, in the intergranular lanes, and the strongest signals
trace a network with a scale similar to the mesogranulation. All these features
are consistent with the IN magnetograms by Dominguez Cernena et al., obtained
during the maximum of the solar cycle. Consequently, the unsigned magnetic flux
of the structures that give rise to the IN polarization signals does not seem
to undergo large variations during the solar cycle.
