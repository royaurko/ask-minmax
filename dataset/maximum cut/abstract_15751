Analysing the weak lensing distortions of the images of faint background
galaxies provides a means to constrain the average mass distribution of cluster
galaxies and potentially to test the extent of their dark matter haloes as a
function of the density of their environment. The observable image distortions
are a consequence of the interplay between the effects of a global cluster mass
distribution and the perturbations due to individual cluster galaxies. Starting
from a reconstruction of the cluster mass distribution with conventional
techniques, we apply a maximum likelihood method to infer the average
properties of an ensemble of cluster galaxies. From simulations this approach
is found to be reliable as long as the galaxies including their dark matter
haloes only contribute a small fraction to the total mass of the system. If
their haloes are extended, the galaxies contain a substantial mass fraction. In
this case our method is still applicable in the outer regions of clusters,
where the surface mass density is low, but yields biased estimates of the
parameters describing the mass profiles of the cluster galaxies in the central
part of the cluster. In that case it will be necessary to resort to more
sophisticated strategies by modelling cluster galaxies and an underlying global
mass distribution simultaneously. We conclude that galaxy-galaxy lensing in
clusters provides a unique means to probe the presence and extent of dark
haloes of cluster galaxies.
