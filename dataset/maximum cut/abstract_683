The $\rho$ meson self-energy in nuclear matter from baryonic loops is
analysed in the real time formulation of field theory at finite temperature and
density. The discontinuities across the branch cuts of the self-energy function
are evaluated for an exhaustive set of resonances in the loops considering the
fully relativistic thermal baryon propagator including anti-baryons. Numerical
calculations show a significant broadening of the $\rho$ spectral function
coming from the Landau cut. Adding the contribution from mesonic loops, the
full spectral function of the $\rho$ in a thermal gas of mesons, baryons and
antibaryons in equilibrium is evaluated at various values of temperature and
baryonic chemical potential.
