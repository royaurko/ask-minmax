We present a search for excess mid-IR emission due to circumbinary material
in the orbital plane of cataclysmic variables (CVs). Our motivation stems from
the fact that the strong braking exerted by a circumbinary (CB) disc on the
binary system could explain several puzzles in our current understanding of CV
evolution. Since theoretical estimates predict that the emission from a CB disc
can dominate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the system at
wavelengths > 5 microns, we obtained simultaneous visible to mid-IR SEDs for
eight systems. We report detections of SS Cyg at 11.7 microns and AE Aqr at
17.6 microns, both in excess of the contribution from the secondary star. In AE
Aqr, the IR likely originates from synchrotron-emitting clouds propelled by the
white dwarf. In SS Cyg, we argue that the observed mid-IR variability is
difficult to reconcile with simple models of CB discs and we consider free-free
emission from a wind. In the other systems, our mid-IR upper limits place
strong constraints on the maximum temperature of a putative CB disc. The
results show that if any sizeable CB disc are present in these systems, they
must be self-shadowed or perhaps dust-free, with the peak thermal emission
shifted to far-IR wavelengths.
