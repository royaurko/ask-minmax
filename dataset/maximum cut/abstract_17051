The dynamic response of a near infrared Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal based
Mueller matrix ellipsometer (NIR FLC-MME) is presented. A time dependent
simulation model, using the measured time response of the individual FLCs, is
used to describe the measured temporal response. Furthermore, the impulse
response of the detector and the pre-amplifier is characterized and included in
the simulation model. The measured time-dependent intensity response of the MME
is reproduced in simulations, and it is concluded that the switching time of
the FLCs is the limiting factor for the Mueller matrix measurement time of the
FLC-based MME. Based on measurements and simulations our FLC based NIR-MME
system is estimated to operate at the maximum speed of approximately 16 ms per
Mueller matrix measurement. The FLC-MME may be operated several times faster,
since the switching time of the crystals depends on the individual crystal
being switched, and to what state it is switched. As a demonstration, the
measured temporal response of the Mueller matrix and the retardance of a thick
liquid crystal variable retarder upon changing state is demonstrated.
