We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ia
supernova SN 2009nr in UGC 8255 (z=0.0122). Following the discovery
announcement at what turned out to be ten days after peak, we detected it at V
~15.7 mag in data collected by the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) North
telescope 2 weeks prior to the peak, and then followed it up with telescopes
ranging in aperture from 10-cm to 6.5-m. Using early photometric data available
only from ASAS, we find that the SN is similar to the over-luminous Type Ia SN
1991T, with a peak at Mv=-19.6 mag, and a slow decline rate of Dm_15(B)=0.95
mag. The early post-maximum spectra closely resemble those of SN 1991T, while
the late time spectra are more similar to those of normal Type Ia SNe.
Interestingly, SN 2009nr has a projected distance of 13.0 kpc (~4.3 disk scale
lengths) from the nucleus of the small star-forming host galaxy UGC 8255. This
indicates that the progenitor of SN 2009nr is not associated with a young
stellar population, calling into question the conventional association of
luminous SNe Ia with the "prompt" component directly correlated with current
star formation. The pre-discovery observation of SN 2009nr using ASAS
demonstrates the science utility of high cadence all sky surveys conducted
using small telescopes for the discovery of nearby (d=<50 Mpc) supernovae.
