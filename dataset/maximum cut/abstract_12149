Charge density waves (CDWs) are periodic modulations of the conduction
electron density in solids. They are collective states that arise from
intrinsic instabilities often present in low dimensional electronic systems.
The layered dichalcogenides are the most well-studied examples, with TiSe_2 one
of the first CDW-bearing materials known. The competition between CDW and
superconducting collective electronic states at low temperatures has long been
held and explored, and yet no chemical system has been previously reported
where finely controlled chemical tuning allows this competition to be studied
in detail. Here we report how, upon controlled intercalation of TiSe_2 with Cu
to yield Cu_xTiSe_2, the CDW transition is continuously suppressed, and a new
superconducting state emerges near x = 0.04, with a maximum T_c of 4.15 K found
at x = 0.08. Cu_xTiSe_2 thus provides the first opportunity to study the CDW to
Superconductivity transition in detail through an easily-controllable chemical
parameter, and will provide new insights into the behavior of correlated
electron systems.
