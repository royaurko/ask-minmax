The final data of the Gallex and GNO radiochemical experiments have been
searched for possible time modulations of the solar neutrino capture rate using
the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and the maximum likelihood methods. Both analyses,
performed using the raw data, do not support the presence of a time variability
with characteristic periods resembling those of rotation of the solar magnetic
fields, as previously suggested in the literature by some contributors. In this
context, the potential sensitivity of the Lomb-Scargle method to radiochemical
71Ga data has also been explored with simulated data. This allowed to set an
exclusion plot in the frequency/amplitude plane from the Gallex-GNO dataset.
