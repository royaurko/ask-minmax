In this paper we take the first step towards a complete
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) calculation of the inclusive decay
rate for $B \to X_s\gamma$. We consider the virtual corrections of order
$\alphas^2 n_f$ to the matrix elements of the operators ${O}_1$, ${O}_2$ and
${O}_8$ and evaluate the real and virtual contributions to ${O}_7$. These
corrections are expected to be numerically important. We observe a strong
cancelation between the contributions from the current-current operators and
$O_7$ and obtain, after applying naive non-abelianization, a reduction of the
branching ratio of 3.9% (for $\mu=3.0$ GeV) and an increase of 3.4% (for
$\mu=9.6$ GeV).
