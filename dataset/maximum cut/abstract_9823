The Cyclic Coloring Conjecture of Ore and Plummer from 1969 asserts that the
vertices of every plane graph with maximum face size D can be colored using at
most 3D/2 colors in such a way that no face is incident with two vertices of
the same color. The Cyclic Coloring Conjecture has been proven only for two
values of D: the case D=3 is equivalent to the Four Color Theorem and the case
D=4 is equivalent to Borodin's Six Color Theorem, which says that every graph
that can be drawn in the plane with each edge crossed by at most one other edge
is 6-colorable. We prove the case D=6 of the conjecture.
