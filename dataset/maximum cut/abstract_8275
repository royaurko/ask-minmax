It is shown that in a number of scalar potentials with an unstable local
maximum at the origin chaotic inflation is followed by new inflation if model
parameters are appropriately chosen. In this model density fluctuation can have
a large-amplitude peak on the comoving Hubble scale at the onset of the
slow-roll new inflation and can result in formation of appreciable amount of
primordial black holes on astrophysically interesting mass scales.
