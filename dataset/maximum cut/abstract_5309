We present results on the electroweak form factors and on the lower moments
of parton distributions of the nucleon, within lattice QCD using two dynamical
flavors of degenerate twisted mass fermions. Results are obtained on lattices
with three different values of the lattice spacings, namely a=0.089 fm, a=0.070
fm and a=0.056 fm, allowing the investigation of cut-off effects. The volume
dependence is examined by comparing results on two lattices of spatial length
L=2.1 fm and L=2.8 fm. The simulations span pion masses in the range of 260-470
MeV. Our results are renormalized non-perturbatively and the values are given
in the MS-scheme at a scale mu=2 GeV.
