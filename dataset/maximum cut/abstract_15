After studying some properties of the generalized exponential and logarithmic
function, in particular investigating the domain where the first maintains
itself real and positive, and outlining how the known dualities $q
\leftrightarrow \frac{1}{q}$ and $q \leftrightarrow 2-q$ play an important
role, we shall examine the set of q-deforming parameters that allow generalized
canonical maximum entropy probability distributions (MEPDs) to maintain itself
positive and real without cut-off prescriptions. We determine the set of
q-deforming parameters for which a generalized statistics with discrete but
unbound energy states is possible.
