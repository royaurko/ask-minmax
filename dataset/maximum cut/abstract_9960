Spiral galaxies that are deficient in neutral Hydrogen are observed on the
outskirts of the Virgo cluster. If their orbits have crossed the inner parts of
the cluster, their interstellar gas may have been lost through ram pressure
stripping by the hot X-ray emitting gas of the cluster. We estimate the maximum
radius out to which galaxies can bounce out of a virialized system using
analytical arguments and cosmological N-body simulations. In particular, we
derive an expression for the turnaround radius in a flat cosmology with a
cosmological constant that is simpler than previously derived expressions. We
find that the maximum radius reached by infalling galaxies as they bounce out
of their cluster is roughly between 1 and 2.5 virial radii. Comparing to the
virial radius of the Virgo cluster, which we estimate from X-ray observations,
these HI-deficient galaxies appear to lie significantly further away from the
cluster center. Therefore, if their distances to the cluster core are correct,
the HI-deficient spiral galaxies found outside of the Virgo cluster cannot have
lost their gas by ram pressure from the hot intracluster gas.
