It is possible to derive the maximum entropy principle from thermodynamic
stability requirements. Using as a starting point the equilibrium probability
distribution, currently used in non-extensive thermostatistics, it turns out
that the relevant entropy function is Renyi's alpha-entropy, and not Tsallis'
entropy.
