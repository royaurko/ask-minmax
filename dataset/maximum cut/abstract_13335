The vacuum fluctuation (VF) effects on the properties of the hyperonic
neutron star matter are investigated in the framework of the relativistic mean
field (RMF) theory. The VF corrections result in the density dependence of
in-medium baryon and meson masses. We compare our results obtained by adopting
three kinds of meson-hyperon couplings. The introduction of both hyperons and
VF corrections soften the equation of state (EoS) for the hyperonic neutron
star matter and hence reduce hyperonic neutron star masses. The presence of the
$\delta$ field enlarges the masses and radii of hyperonic neutron stars. Taking
into account the uncertainty of meson-hyperon couplings, the obtained maximum
masses of hyperonic neutron stars are in the range of
$1.33M_{\odot}\sim1.55M_{\odot}$.
