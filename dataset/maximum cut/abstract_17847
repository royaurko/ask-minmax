A new approach to inference in state space models is proposed, based on
approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). ABC avoids evaluation of the likelihood
function by matching observed summary statistics with statistics computed from
data simulated from the true process; exact inference being feasible only if
the statistics are sufficient. With finite sample sufficiency unattainable in
the state space setting, we seek asymptotic sufficiency via the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE) of the parameters of an auxiliary model. We prove
that this auxiliary model-based approach achieves Bayesian consistency, and
that - in a precise limiting sense - the proximity to (asymptotic) sufficiency
yielded by the MLE is replicated by the score. In multiple parameter settings a
separate treatment of scalar parameters, based on integrated likelihood
techniques, is advocated as a way of avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Some
attention is given to a structure in which the state variable is driven by a
continuous time process, with exact inference typically infeasible in this case
as a result of intractable transitions. The ABC method is demonstrated using
the unscented Kalman filter as a fast and simple way of producing an
approximation in this setting, with a stochastic volatility model for financial
returns used for illustration.
