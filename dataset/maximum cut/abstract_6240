We present analytical solutions for the integral distribution of arbitrary
bursting or steady source counts as a function of peak photon count rate within
Friedmann cosmological models. We discuss both the standard candle and
truncated power-law luminosity function cases with a power-law density
evolution. While the analysis is quite general, the specific example discussed
here is that of a cosmological gamma-ray burst distribution. These solutions
show quantitatively the degree of dependence of the counts on the density and
luminosity function parameters, as well as the the weak dependence on the
closure parameter and the maximum redshift. An approximate comparison with the
publicly available Compton Gamma Ray Observatory data gives an estimate of the
maximum source luminosity and an upper limit to the minimum luminosity. We
discuss possible ways of further constraining the various parameters.
