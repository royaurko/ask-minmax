We present broad band R and narrow band H_alpha emission line images of a
sample of optically selected starburst galaxies from the Markarian lists. The
emission line morphology is studied and global properties like luminosities,
equivalent widths and star formation rates are derived. The radial distribution
of H_alpha flux and the EW are determined using concentric aperture photometry
on the emission line and the continuum images. H_alpha flux is generally found
to peak in the nuclear region and fall off outwards. The EW is found to peak
off-center in most of the cases implying that though the intensity of emission
is maximum at the nucleus, the star formation activity relative to the
underlying continuum often peaks away from the center in Markarian starburst
galaxies.
