Lyman x-ray spectra following charge exchange between C$^{6+}$ and H$_2$ are
presented for collision velocities between 400 and 2300 km/s (1--30 keV/amu).
Spectra were measured by a microcalorimeter x-ray detector capable of fully
resolving the C VI Lyman series emission lines though Lyman-$\delta$. The
ratios of the measured emission lines are sensitive to the angular momentum
$l$-states populated during charge exchange and are used to gauge the
effectiveness of different $l$-distribution models in predicting Lyman emission
due to charge exchange. At low velocities, we observe that both single electron
capture and double capture autoionization contribute to Lyman emission and that
a statistical $l$-distribution best describes the measured line ratios. At
higher velocities single electron capture dominates with the $l$-distribution
peaked at the maximum $l$.
