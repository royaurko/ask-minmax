We report on the discovery and validation of Kepler-452b, a transiting planet
identified by a search through the 4 years of data collected by NASA's Kepler
Mission. This possibly rocky 1.63$^{+0.23}_{-0.20}$ R$_\oplus$ planet orbits
its G2 host star every 384.843$^{+0.007}_{0.012}$ days, the longest orbital
period for a small (R$_p$ < 2 R$_\oplus$) transiting exoplanet to date. The
likelihood that this planet has a rocky composition lies between 49% and 62%.
The star has an effective temperature of 5757$\pm$85 K and a log g of
4.32$\pm$0.09. At a mean orbital separation of 1.046$^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$ AU,
this small planet is well within the optimistic habitable zone of its star
(recent Venus/early Mars), experiencing only 10% more flux than Earth receives
from the Sun today, and slightly outside the conservative habitable zone
(runaway greenhouse/maximum greenhouse). The star is slightly larger and older
than the Sun, with a present radius of 1.11$^{+0.15}_{-0.09}$ R$_\odot$ and an
estimated age of 6 Gyr. Thus, Kepler-452b has likely always been in the
habitable zone and should remain there for another 3 Gyr.
