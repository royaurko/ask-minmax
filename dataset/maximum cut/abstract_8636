We resolve a discrepancy between the SU(2) spacial string tension at finite
temperature, and the value obtained by monopoles in the maximum Abelian gauge.
Previous work had incorrectly omitted a term due to Dirac sheets. When this
term is included, the monopole and full SU(2) determinations of the spacial
string tension agree to within the statistical errors of the monopole
calculation.
