We present a new methodology for studying non-Hamiltonian nonlinear systems
based on an information theoretic extension of a renormalization group
technique using a modified maximum entropy principle. We obtain a rigorous
dimensionally reduced description for such systems. The neglected degrees of
freedom by this reduction are replaced by a systematically deefined stochastic
process under a constraint on the second moment. This then forms the basis of a
computationally efficient method. Numerical computations for the generalized
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation sup- port our method and reveal that the
long-time underlying stochastic process of the fast (unresolved) modes obeys a
universal distribution which does not depend on the initial conditions and
which we rigorously derive by the maximum entropy principle.
