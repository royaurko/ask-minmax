Collective behaviours taking place in financial markets reveal strongly
correlated states especially during a crisis period. A natural hypothesis is
that trend reversals are also driven by mutual influences between the different
stock exchanges. Using a maximum entropy approach, we find coordinated
behaviour during trend reversals dominated by the pairwise component. In
particular, these events are predicted with high significant accuracy by the
ensemble's instantaneous state.
