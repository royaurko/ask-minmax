In this note we outline the Monte Carlo project {\tt KrkMC}. The goal of this
project is to construct a QCD Parton Shower accurate to NLO level in both
coefficient function and splitting function (shower) parts. We discuss in
detail one of its aspects --- the evolution kernels. The kernels had to be
recalculated in a new regularisation scheme, called NPV. In this scheme all the
singularities in the plus component of the integration momenta are regularised
by means of principal value prescription. This is in contrast to the standard
approach, in which only the spurious axial singularities are regularised by
principal value. As a result, the triple poles in the dimensional
regularisation parameter $\epsilon$ are replaced by a combination of
$\epsilon$-poles and logarithms of geometrical cut-off $\delta$. The resulting
exclusive parton densities are more suitable for stochastic applications in
four dimensions. Simultaneously, at the inclusive level, the standard and new
prescriptions give the same results provided appropriate real and virtual
contributions are added.
