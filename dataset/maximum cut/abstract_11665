In this paper, we will discuss the prospects of deducing the proton-air cross
section from fluorescence telescope measurements of extensive air showers. As
it is not possible to observe the point of first interaction $X_{\rm 1}$
directly, other observables closely linked to $X_{\rm 1}$ must be inferred from
the longitudinal profiles. This introduces a dependence on the models used to
describe the shower development. The most straightforward candidate for a good
correlation to $X_{\rm 1}$ is the depth of shower maximum $X_{\rm max}$. We
will discuss the sensitivity of an $X_{\rm max}$-based analysis on $\sigma_{\rm
p-air}$ and quantify the systematic uncertainties arising from the model
dependence, parameters of the reconstruction method itself and a possible
non-proton contamination of the selected shower sample.
