We present analyses on nucleon structure functions at the small Bjorken-$x$
in the framework of holographic QCD. In this study, we improve the description
of the target nucleon in the current setup of the holographic model by
introducing a soft-wall AdS/QCD model, in which the AdS geometry is smoothly
cut off at IR. Combining the improved Pomeron-nucleon coupling and the wave
function of the 5D U(1) vector field with the BPST Pomeron exchange kernel,
then we obtain the structure functions. Here we focus on the nonperturbative
kinematical region, where $10^{-6} \leq x \leq 10^{-2}$ and $0.1 \leq Q^2 \leq
10$ [GeV$^2$], and show that our calculations for $F_2^p$ and $F_L^p$ are
consistent with experimental data of the deep inelastic scattering at HERA.
Furthermore, we find that the resulting longitudinal-to-transverse ratio of the
structure functions, $F_L^p/F_T^p$, depends on both of $x$ and $Q^2$.
