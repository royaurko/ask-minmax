This work deals with the study of an optimal control of a system of nonlinear
differential equations using the Bagarello's operator approach, recently
introduced in a paper (Int. Jour. of Theoretical Physics, 43, issue 12 (2004),
p. 2371 - 2394). The control problem is reduced by using the Pontryagin's
maximum principle, to a system of ordinary differential equations with unknown
state and adjoint variables. Its solution is then described in terms of a
series expansion of commutators involving an unbounded self-adjoint, densely
defined, system Hamiltonian operator H and initial position operators. Relevant
simple applications are discussed.
