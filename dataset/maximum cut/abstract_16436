The list of putative sources of gravitational waves possibly detected by the
ongoing worldwide network of large scale interferometers has been continuously
growing in the last years. For some of them, the detection is made difficult by
the lack of a complete information about the expected signal. We concentrate on
the case where the expected GW is a quasi-periodic frequency modulated signal
i.e., a chirp. In this article, we address the question of detecting an a
priori unknown GW chirp. We introduce a general chirp model and claim that it
includes all physically realistic GW chirps. We produce a finite grid of
template waveforms which samples the resulting set of possible chirps. If we
follow the classical approach (used for the detection of inspiralling binary
chirps, for instance), we would build a bank of quadrature matched filters
comparing the data to each of the templates of this grid. The detection would
then be achieved by thresholding the output, the maximum giving the individual
which best fits the data. In the present case, this exhaustive search is not
tractable because of the very large number of templates in the grid. We show
that the exhaustive search can be reformulated (using approximations) as a
pattern search in the time-frequency plane. This motivates an approximate but
feasible alternative solution which is clearly linked to the optimal one.
