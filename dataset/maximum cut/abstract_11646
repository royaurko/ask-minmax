To investigate the efficiency of centrifugal acceleration of particles as a
possible mechanism for the generation of ultra-high $\gamma$-ray nonthermal
emission from TeV blazars, we study the centrifugal acceleration of electrons
by rotating magnetic field lines, for an extended range of inclination angles
and determine the maximum Lorentz factors $\gamma_{max}$ attainable by the
electrons via this process. {Two principal limiting mechanisms for the particle
acceleration, inverse Compton scattering and breakdown of the bead-on-the-wire
approximation, are examined. Particles may be centrifugally accelerated up to
$\gamma_{max} \simeq 10^8$ and the main limiting mechanism for the
$\gamma_{max}$ is the inverse Compton scattering. The energy of centrifugally
accelerated particles can be amply sufficient for the generation (via inverse
Compton scattering) of the ultra-high energy (up to $20TeV$) gamma emission in
TeV blazars.
