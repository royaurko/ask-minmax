Consider families of $k$-subsets (or blocks) on a ground set of size $v$.
Recall that if all $t$-subsets occur with the same frequency $\lambda$, one
obtains a $t$-design with index $\lambda$. On the other hand, if all
$t$-subsets occur with different frequencies, such a family has been called (by
Sarvate and others) a $t$-adesign. An elementary observation shows that such
families always exist for $v > k \ge t$. Here, we study the smallest possible
maximum frequency $\mu=\mu(t,k,v)$.
  The exact value of $\mu$ is noted for $t=1$ and an upper bound (best possible
up to a constant multiple) is obtained for $t=2$ using PBD closure. Weaker, yet
still reasonable asymptotic bounds on $\mu$ for higher $t$ follow from a
probabilistic argument. Some connections are made with the famous Sidon problem
of additive number theory.
