We report the achievement of the first atomically resolved scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) imaging in a water-cooled magnet (WM), where the extremely
harsh vibrations and noises have been the major challenge. This homebuilt
WM-STM features an ultra-rigid and compact scan head in which the coarse
approach is driven by our new design of the TunaDrive piezoelectric motor. A
three-level spring hanging system is exploited for vibration isolation.
Room-temperature raw-data images of graphite with quality atomic resolution
were obtained in very high magnetic fields up to 27 T in a 32 mm bore WM whose
absolute maximum field is 27.5 T at the power rating of 10 MW. This record of
27 T has exceeded the maximum field strength of the conventional
superconducting magnets. Besides, our WM-STM has also paved the way to the STM
imaging in the 45 T, 32 mm bore hybrid magnet, which is the world's flagship
magnet and can produces the highest steady magnetic field at present.
