The NJL model is formulated on the light cone. Using the 1/N expansion to
solve the fermionic constraint, an effective 4-fermi lagrangian is derived.
Pionic properties are investigated using this lagrangian, and the formal
equivalence to the equal-time formulation is demonstrated. Two regularization
schemes in terms of light-cone variables are discussed: An extension of the
'invariant mass cut-off scheme', and a transverse momentum cut-off scheme. It
is shown that the first one is equivalent to the covariant 3-momentum cut-off
(dispersion cut-off) scheme in the equal-time formulation. As an application
the structure function of the pion is studied in both regularization schemes.
