The processes of six-quark production with one $b\bar b$ pair are studied by
means of a complete tree-level electroweak calculation. The top-quark signal is
examined: the importance of electroweak backgrounds, of the order of 10% above
the $t\bar t$ threshold and of about 30% of the purely electroweak signal at
threshold, is further stressed by studying the dependence of the cross-section
at threshold on the Higgs mass in the range between 100 GeV and 185 GeV, and
finding variations of the order of 10%. In the study of some event-shape
variables, a strong effect of initial-state radiation is found, in particular
for the thrust distribution, which is studied for several centre-of-mass
energies at the TeV scale. The effectiveness of cuts on the thrust for
isolating QCD backgrounds, as pointed out by some contributors, is confirmed also in
the presence of electroweak backgrounds and initial-state radiation.
