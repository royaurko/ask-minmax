The left-right twin Higgs model contains a new vector-like heavy top quark,
which mixes with the SM-like top quark. In this work, we studied the single
vector-like top partner production via process $e^{-}\gamma \rightarrow
\nu_{e}\bar{T}b$ at the International Linear Collider. We calculated the
production cross section at tree level and displayed the relevant differential
distributions. The result shows that there will be 125 events produced each
year with $\sqrt{s}$=2TeV and the integrated luminosity $\mathcal L_{int}\simeq
500fb^{-1}$, and the b-quark tagging and the relevant missing energy $\met$ cut
will be helpful to detect this new effect.
