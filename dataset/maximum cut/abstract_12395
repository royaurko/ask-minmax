In this paper we investigate the determination of the coupling structure of a
Higgs boson at the LHC using angular correlations in the decay chain H -> ZZ ->
4l. We consider the most general couplings of a scalar to spin 1 particles and
compare the angular correlations of the decay products using a maximum
likelihood method. We use the full information from the LO matrix element
including all posible correlations between the decay angles. In our analysis we
include all possible mixings between the different coupling structures. We
conclude that the coupling structure can in general be determined using this
approach. But it has to be noted, that for Higgs boson masses below the
ZZ-threshold the analysis is statistically limited. For higher Higgs boson
masses reasonably strong limits on non standard couplings can be achieved at
the LHC using the full integrated luminosity of 300 fb^-1.
