We report on the detection of infrared light from the super-Earth 55 Cnc e,
based on four occultations obtained with Warm Spitzer at 4.5 microns. Our data
analysis consists of a two-part process. In a first step, we perform individual
analyses of each dataset and compare several baseline models to optimally
account for the systematics affecting each lightcurve. We apply independent
photometric correction techniques, including polynomial detrending and
pixel-mapping, that yield consistent results at the 1-sigma level. In a second
step, we perform a global MCMC analysis including all four datasets, that
yields an occultation depth of 131+-28ppm, translating to a brightness
temperature of 2360+-300 K in the IRAC-4.5 micron channel. This occultation
depth suggests a low Bond albedo coupled to an inefficient heat transport from
the planetary dayside to the nightside, or else possibly that the 4.5-micron
observations probe atmospheric layers that are hotter than the maximum
equilibrium temperature (i.e., a thermal inversion layer or a deep hot layer).
The measured occultation phase and duration are consistent with a circular
orbit and improves the 3-sigma upper limit on 55 Cnc e's orbital eccentricity
from 0.25 to 0.06.
