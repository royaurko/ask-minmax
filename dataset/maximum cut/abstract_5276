In this paper we develop a supersymmetric version of unitarity cut method for
form factors of operators from the chiral truncation of the the $\mathcal{N}=4$
stress-tensor current supermultiplet $T^{AB}$. The relation between the
superform factor with supermomentum equals to zero and the logarithmic
derivative of the superamplitude with respect to the coupling constant is
discussed and verified at tree- and one-loop level for any MHV $n$-point ($n
\geq 4$) superform factor involving operators from chiral truncation of the
stress-tensor energy supermultiplet. The explicit $\mathcal{N}=4$ covariant
expressions for n-point tree- and one-loop MHV form factors are obtained. As
well, the ansatz for the two-loop three-point MHV superform factor is suggested
in the planar limit, based on the reduction procedure for the scalar integrals
suggested in our previous work. The different soft and collinear limits in the
MHV sector at tree- and one-loop level are discussed.
