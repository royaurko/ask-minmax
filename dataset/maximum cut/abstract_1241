Quench-condensed granular Al films, with normal-state sheet resistance close
to 10 k$\Omega/\Box$, display strong hysteresis and ultraslow, non-exponential
relaxation in the resistance when temperature is varied below 300 mK. The
hysteresis is nonlinear and can be suppressed by a dc bias voltage. The
relaxation time does not obey the Arrhenius form, indicating the existence of a
broad distribution of low energy barriers. Furthermore, large resistance
fluctuations, having a 1/f-type power spectrum with a low-frequency cut-off,
are observed at low temperatures. With decreasing temperature, the amplitude of
the fluctuation increases and the cut-off frequency decreases. These
observations combine to provide a coherent picture that there exists a new
glassy electron state in ultrathin granular Al films, with a growing
correlation length at low temperatures.
