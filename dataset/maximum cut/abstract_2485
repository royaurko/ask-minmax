We consider Higgs boson production through gluon--gluon fusion in hadron
collisions. We present a numerical program that computes the cross section up
to NNLO in QCD perturbation theory. The program allows the user to apply
arbitrary cuts on the momenta of the partons and of the photons or leptons that
are produced in the final state. We present selected numerical results at the
Tevatron and the LHC.
