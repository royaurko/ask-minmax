Let $\Delta(G)$ be the maximum degree of a graph $G$. Brooks' theorem states
that the only connected graphs with chromatic number $\chi(G)=\Delta(G)+1$ are
complete graphs and odd cycles. We prove a fractional analogue of Brooks'
theorem in this paper. Namely, we classify all connected graphs $G$ such that
the fractional chromatic number $\chi_f(G)$ is at least $\Delta(G)$. These
graphs are complete graphs, odd cycles, $C^2_8$, $C_5\boxtimes K_2$, and graphs
whose clique number $\omega(G)$ equals the maximum degree $\Delta(G)$. Among
the two sporadic graphs, the graph $C^2_8$ is the square graph of cycle $C_8$
while the other graph $C_5\boxtimes K_2$ is the strong product of $C_5$ and
$K_2$. In fact, we prove a stronger result; if a connected graph $G$ with
$\Delta(G)\geq 4$ is not one of the graphs listed above, then we have
$\chi_f(G)\leq \Delta(G)- 2/67$.
