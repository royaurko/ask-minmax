The {\em chromatic gap} is the difference between the chromatic number and
the clique number of a graph. Here we investigate $\gap(n)$, the maximum
chromatic gap over graphs on $n$ vertices. Can the extremal graphs be explored?
While computational problems related to the chromatic gap are hopeless, an
interplay between Ramsey theory and matching theory leads to a simple and
(almost) exact formula for $\gap(n)$ in terms of Ramsey numbers.
