We show in a model independent way the equality of the branching fractions
and strong phases for B-> D_1M and B-> D_2^*M at leading order in Lambda
_{QCD}/Q and alpha_s(Q) where Q={m_b,m_c,E_M} and M is a light meson. These
results apply in the color allowed and color suppressed channels and follow
from a factorization theorem in SCET combined with heavy quark symmetry. The
expected heavy quark symmetry suppression of leading order contributions in the
color allowed sector based on analysis of semileptonic decays, is shown to
disappear at maximum recoil. Subleading corrections are suppressed by at least
one power of Lambda_{QCD}/Q and this is explicitly verified for subleading
semileptonic form factors at maximum recoil.
