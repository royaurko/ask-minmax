Electronic structure of bismuth telluride nanowires with the growth
directions [110] and [015] is studied in the framework of anisotropic effective
mass method using the parabolic band approximation. The components of the
electron and hole effective mass tensor for six valleys are calculated for both
growth directions. For a square nanowire, in the temperature range from 77 K to
500 K, the dependence of the Seebeck coefficient, the electron thermal and
electrical conductivity as well as the figure of merit ZT on the nanowire
thickness and on the excess hole concentration are investigated in the
constant-relaxation-time approximation. The carrier confinement is shown to
play essential role for square nanowires with thickness less than 30 nm. The
confinement decreases both the carrier concentration and the thermal
conductivity but increases the maximum value of Seebeck coefficient in contrast
to the excess holes (impurities). The confinement effect is stronger for the
direction [015] than for the direction [110] due to the carrier mass difference
for these directions. The carrier confinement increases maximum value of ZT and
shifts it towards high temperatures. For the p-type bismuth telluride nanowires
with growth direction [110], the maximum value of the figure of merit is equal
to 1.3, 1.6, and 2.8, correspondingly, at temperatures 310 K, 390 K, 480 K and
the nanowire thicknesses 30 nm, 15 nm, and 7 nm. At the room temperature, the
figure of merit equals 1.2, 1.3, and 1.7, respectively.
