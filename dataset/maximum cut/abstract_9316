We analyze the proposal of achieving a Mott state of Laughlin wave functions
in an optical lattice [M. Popp {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. A 70, 053612 (2004)]
and study the consequences of considering the anharmonic corrections to each
single site potential expansion that were not taken into account until now. Our
result is that, although the anharmonic correction reduces the maximum
frequency at which the system can rotate before the atoms escape from each site
(centrifugal limit), the Laughlin state can still be achieved for a small
number of particles and a realistic value of the laser intensity.
