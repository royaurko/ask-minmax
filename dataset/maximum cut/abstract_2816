We study the relations between Multi-valued Decision Diagrams (MDD) and
tuples (i.e. elements of the Cartesian Product of variables). First, we improve
the existing methods for transforming a set of tuples, Global Cut Seeds,
sequences of tuples into MDDs. Then, we present some in-place algorithms for
adding and deleting tuples from an MDD. Next, we consider an MDD constraint
which is modified during the search by deleting some tuples. We give an
algorithm which adapts MDD-4R to these dynamic and persistent modifications.
Some experiments show that MDD constraints are competitive with Table
constraints.
