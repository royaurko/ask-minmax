The neutrino signal from SN1987A is analysed with respect to spin-flavour
oscillations between electron antineutrinos, $\bar{\nu}_{e}$, and muon
neutrinos, $\nu_{\mu}$, by means of a maximum likelihood analysis.
  Following Jegerlehner et al. best fit values for the total energy
released in neutrinos, $E_t$, and the temperature of the electron
antineutrino, $T_{\bar{\nu}_{e}}$, for a range of mixing parameters and
progenitor models are calculated. In particular the dependence of the inferred
quantities on the metallicity of the supernova is investigated and the
uncertainties involved in using the neutrino signal to determine the neutrino
magnetic moment are pointed out.
