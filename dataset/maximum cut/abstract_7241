We introduce a definition of the electromagnetic chirality of an object and
show that it has an upper bound. The upper bound is attained if and only if the
object is transparent for fields of one handedness (helicity). Additionally,
electromagnetic duality symmetry, i.e. helicity preservation upon scattering,
turns out to be a necessary condition for reciprocal scatterers to attain the
upper bound. We use these results to provide requirements for the design of
such extremal scatterers. The requirements can be formulated as constraints on
the polarizability tensors for dipolar scatterers or as material constitutive
relations. We also outline two applications for objects of maximum
electromagnetic chirality: A twofold resonantly enhanced {\em and} background
free circular dichroism measurement setup, and angle independent helicity
filtering glasses.
