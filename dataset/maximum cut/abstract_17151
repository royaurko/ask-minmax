Abundant phenomena in CoCr2-xMnxO4 (x = 0 ~ 2) samples such as magnetic
compensation, magnetostriction and exchange bias effect have been observed and
investigated in this work. A structure transition from cubic to tetragonal
symmetry has been found in the samples with x around 1.4. It has shown that the
doped Mn3+ ions initially occupy the A (Co) sites when x < 0.2, and then mainly
take the B1 (Cr) sites. This behavior results in a role conversion of magnetic
contributors, and thus a magnetic compensation between two competitively
magnetic sublattices at the composition near x = 0.5. Furthermore, temperature
compensation has also been found in the samples with x = 0.5 and 0.6, with the
compensation temperature in the range of 45 ~ 75 K. The Mn-doping also changes
the frustration degree and modulates the exchange interaction in this system,
and thus prevents the formation of long range conical order of spins.
Therefore, the magnetoelectric transition temperature at 23 K in CoCr2O4 is
shifted to lower temperature with increased dopants. The magnetostriction
effect in this Cobalt spinel system has been considered for the first time. The
strain has a maximum value of about 240 ppm at x = 0.2 and shows the similar
tendency as the compensation behaviors. Additionally, the exchange bias effect
observed in the samples with x < 0.5 shows a negative value under low cooling
field for x = 0.5.
