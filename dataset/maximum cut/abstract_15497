Some rigorous results and statistics of the solution space of Vertex-Covers
on bipartite graphs are given in this paper. Based on the $K\ddot{o}nig$'s
theorem, an exact solution space expression algorithm is proposed and
statistical analysis of the nodes' states is provided. The statistical results
fit well with the algorithmic results until the emergence of the unfrozen core,
which makes the fluctuation of statistical quantities and causes the replica
symmetric breaking in the solutions. Besides, the entropy of bipartite
Vertex-Cover solutions is calculated with the clustering entropy using a cycle
simplification technique for the unfrozen core. Furthermore, as generalization
of bipartite graphs, bipartite core graph is proposed, the solution space of
which can also be easily determined; and based on these results, how to
generate a $K\ddot{o}nig-Egerv\acute{a}ry$ subgraph is studied by a growth
process of adding edges. The investigation of solution space of bipartite graph
Vertex-Cover provides intensive understanding and some insights on the solution
space complexity, and will produce benefit for finding maximal
$K\ddot{o}nig-Egerv\acute{a}ry$ subgraphs, solving general graph Vertex-Cover
and recognizing the intrinsic hardness of NP-complete problems.
