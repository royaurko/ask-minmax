The relation of the thermal dilepton signal from deconfined matter, resulting
in central ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, to
the background yields from the Drell-Yan process and correlated semileptonic
decays of open charm and bottom mesons is analyzed. We demonstrate that very
stringent kinematical cuts offer a chance to identify the thermal signal in the
continuum region.
