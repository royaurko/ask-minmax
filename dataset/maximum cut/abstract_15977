We present evidence for approximately 400-d variations in the radial velocity
of HD 154791 (V934 Her), the suggested optical counterpart of 4U 1700+24. The
variations are correlated with the previously reported approximately 400 d
variations in the X-ray flux of 4U 1700+24, which supports the association of
these two objects, as well as the identification of this system as the second
known X-ray binary in which a neutron star accretes from the wind of a red
giant. The HD 154791 radial velocity variations can be fit with an eccentric
orbit with period 404 +/- 3 d, amplitude K=0.75 +/- 0.12 km/s and eccentricity
e=0.26 +/- 0.15. There are also indications of variations on longer time scales
>~ 2000 d. We have re-examined all available ASM data following an unusually
large X-ray outburst in 1997-98, and confirm that the 1-d averaged 2-10 keV
X-ray flux from 4U 1700+24 is modulated with a period of 400 +/- 20 d. The mean
profile of the persistent X-ray variations was approximately sinusoidal, with
an amplitude of 0.108 +/- 0.012 ASM count/s (corresponding to 31% rms). The
epoch of X-ray maximum was approximately 40 d after the time of periastron
according to the eccentric orbital fit. If the 400 d oscillations from HD
154791/4U 1700+24 are due to orbital motion, then the system parameters are
probably close to those of the only other neutron-star symbiotic-like binary,
GX 1+4. We discuss the similarities and differences between these two systems.
