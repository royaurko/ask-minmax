In this paper we survey the signals and backgrounds for a
strongly-interacting electroweak symmetry breaking sector at hadron
supercolliders in the TeV region. We study the process pp->WWX, and compute the
rates for the ``gold-plated'' channels, where W^{+/-}->l^{+/-}\nu and Z ->
l^+l^- (l = e,\mu), for a wide variety of models. Using a forward jet-tag, a
central jet-veto and a back-to-back lepton cut to suppress the Standard Model
backgrounds, we demonstrate that the SSC and LHC have substantial sensitivity
to strong interactions in the electroweak symmetry breaking sector.
