Diabatic description of rotational bands provides a clear-cut picture for
understanding the back-bending phenomena, where the internal structure of the
yrast band changes dramatically as a function of angular momentum. A
microscopic framework to obtain the diabatic bands within the mean-field
approximation is presented by making use of the selfconsistent collective
coordinate method. Applying the framework, both the ground state rotational
bands and the Stockholm bands are studied systematically for the rare-earth
deformed nuclei. An overall agreement has been achieved between the calculated
and observed rotational spectra. It is also shown that the inclusion of the
double-stretched quadrupole-pairing interaction is crucial to obtain an overall
agreement for the even-odd mass differences and the rotational spectra
simultaneously.
