In this paper we introduce a simple method of searching for the prime pairs
in the famous Goldbach Conjecture. The method, which is based on certain
integer identities as well as an observation related to the remainder property,
enables us to cut the search length by half and therefore can be considered as
a short cut in searching for the prime pairs in the Goldbach Conjecture.
