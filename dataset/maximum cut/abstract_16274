IRC +10420 and AFGL 2343 are the unique, known yellow hypergiants (YHGs)
presenting a heavy circumstellar envelope (CSE). We aim to study the
morphology, exceptional kinematics, and excitation conditions of their CSEs,
and the implications for mass-loss processes. We have mapped the 12CO J=2-1 and
1-0 emission in these YHGs with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer and the
30m telescope. We developed LVG models in order to analyze their circumstellar
characteristics. The maps show that the overall shape of both CSEs is
approximately spherical, although they also reveal several aspherical features.
The CSE around IRC +10420 shows a rounded extended halo surrounding a bright
inner region, with both components presenting aspherical characteristics. It
presents a brightness minimum at the center. The envelope around AFGL 2343 is a
detached shell, showing spherical symmetry and clumpiness at a level of about
15% of the maximum brightness. The envelopes expand isotropically at about 35
km/s, about two or three times faster than typical CSEs around AGB stars. High
temperatures (~ 200 K) are derived for the innermost regions in IRC +10420,
while denser and cooler (~ 30 K) gas is found in AFGL 2343. The mass-loss
processes in these YHGs have been found to be similar. The deduced mass-loss
rates (~ 10E-4 - 10E-3 Msun/yr) are much higher than those obtained in AGB
stars, and they present significant variations on time scales of ~ 1000 yr.
