This paper addresses the problem of predicting a wind farm's power generation
when no or few statistical data is available. The study is based on a
time-series wind speed model and on a simple dynamic model of a DFIG wind
turbine including cut-off and cut-in behaviours. The wind turbine is modeled as
a stochastic hybrid system with three operation modes. Numerical results,
obtained using Monte-Carlo simulations, provide the annual distribution of a
wind farm's active power generation. For different numbers of wind turbines, we
compare the numerical results obtained using the dynamic model with those
obtained considering the wind turbine's steady-state power curve. Simulations
show that the wind turbine's dynamics do not need to be considered for
analyzing the annual distribution of a wind farm generation.
