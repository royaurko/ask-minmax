We study the impact of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections
on partial decay rates in B --> X_u l nu decays, at leading-order in the 1/m_b
expansion for shape-function kinematics. These corrections are implemented
within a modified form of the BLNP framework, which allows for arbitrary
variations of the jet scale mu_i \sim 1.5 GeV. Our analysis includes a detailed
comparison between resummed and fixed-order perturbation theory, and between
the complete NNLO results and those obtained in the large-$\beta_0$
approximation. For the default choice mu_i=1.5 GeV used in current extractions
of |V_ub| within the BLNP framework, the NNLO corrections induce significant
downward shifts in the central values of partial decay rates with cuts on the
hadronic variable P_+, the hadronic invariant mass, and the lepton energy. At
the same time, perturbative uncertainties are reduced, especially those at the
jet scale, which are the dominant ones at next-to-leading order (NLO). For
higher values of mu_i and in fixed-order perturbation theory, the shifts
between NLO and NNLO are more moderate. We combine our new results with known
power-suppressed terms in order to illustrate the implications of our analysis
on the determination of |V_ub| from inclusive decays.
