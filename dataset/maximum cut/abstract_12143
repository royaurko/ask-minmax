Optical Kerr nonlinearity (n2) in n-type indium tin oxide (ITO) films coated
on glass substrates has been measured using Z-scans with 200-fs laser pulses at
wavelengths ranging from 720 to 780 nm. The magnitudes of the measured
nonlinearity in the ITO films were found to be dependent on the carrier
concentration with a maximum n2-value of 4.1 x 10-5 cm2/GW at 720-nm wavelength
and an electron density of Nd = 5.8 x 1020 cm-3. The Kerr nonlinearity was also
observed to be varied with the laser wavelength. By employing a femtosecond
time-resolved optical Kerr effect (OKE) technique, the relaxation time of OKE
in the ITO films is determined to be ~1 ps. These findings suggest that the
Kerr nonlinearity in ITO can be tailored by controlling the carrier
concentration, which should be highly desirable in optoelectronic devices for
ultrafast all-optical switching.
