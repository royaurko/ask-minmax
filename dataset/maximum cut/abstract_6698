At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Usain Bolt broke the world record for
the 100 m sprint. Just one year later, at the 2009 World Championships in
Athletics in Berlin he broke it again. A few months after Beijing, Eriksen et
al. studied Bolt's performance and predicted that Bolt could have run about
one-tenth of a second faster, which was confirmed in Berlin. In this paper we
extend the analysis of Eriksen et al. to model Bolt's velocity time-dependence
for the Beijing 2008 and Berlin 2009 records. We deduce the maximum force, the
maximum power, and the total mechanical energy produced by Bolt in both races.
Surprisingly, we conclude that all of these values were smaller in 2009 than in
2008.
