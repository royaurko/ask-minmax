We report the implementation of a tunable beam displacer, composed of a
polarizing beam splitter (PBS) and two mirrors, that divides an initially
polarized beam into two parallel beams whose separation can be continuously
tuned. The two output beams are linearly polarized with either vertical or
horizontal polarization and no optical path difference is introduced between
them. The wavelength dependence of the device as well as the maximum separation
between the beams achievable is limited mainly by the PBS characteristics.
