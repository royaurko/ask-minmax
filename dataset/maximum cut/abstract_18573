We apply a Harrison transformation to higher dimensional asymptotically flat
black hole solutions, which puts them into an external magnetic field. First,
we magnetize the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric in arbitrary spacetime
dimension n>=4. The thus generated exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell
equations describes a static black hole immersed in a Melvin "fluxbrane", and
generalizes previous results by Ernst for the case n=4. The magnetic field
deforms the shape of the event horizon, but the total area (as a function of
the mass) and the thermodynamics remain unaffected. The amount of flux through
a one-dimensional loop on the horizon exhibits a maximum for a finite value of
the magnetic field strength, and decreases for larger values. In the
Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit, the magnetized black hole becomes an
impulsive gravitational wave propagating in the Melvin background. Furthermore,
we discuss possible applications of a similar Harrison transformation to
rotating black objects. This enables us to magnetize the Myers-Perry hole and
the (dipole) Emparan-Reall ring at least in the special case when the vector
potential is parallel to a nonrotating Killing field. In particular, dipole
rings may be held in equilibrium even when their spin vanishes, thus
demonstrating (infinite) non-uniqueness of magnetized static uncharged black
holes in five dimensions. Physical properties of such rings are discussed.
