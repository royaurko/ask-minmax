We evaluate free-induction decay for the transverse components of a localized
electron spin coupled to a bath of nuclear spins via the Fermi contact
hyperfine interaction. Our perturbative treatment is valid for special
(narrowed) bath initial conditions and when the Zeeman energy of the electron
$b$ exceeds the total hyperfine coupling constant $A$: $b>A$. Using one unified
and systematic method, we recover previous results reported at short and long
times using different techniques. We find a new and unexpected modulation of
the free-induction-decay envelope, which is present even for a purely isotropic
hyperfine interaction without spin echoes and for a single nuclear species. We
give sub-leading corrections to the decoherence rate, and show that, in
general, the decoherence rate has a non-monotonic dependence on electron Zeeman
splitting, leading to a pronounced maximum. These results illustrate the
limitations of methods that make use of leading-order effective Hamiltonians
and re-exponentiation of short-time expansions for a strongly-interacting
system with non-Markovian (history-dependent) dynamics.
