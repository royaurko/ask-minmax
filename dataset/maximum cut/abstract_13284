Making use of the master equation and effective Hamiltonian approach, we
investigate the steady state entanglement in a three-qubit $XX$ model. Both
symmetric and nonsymmetric qubit-qubit couplings are considered. The system
(the three qubits) is coupled to two bosonic baths at different temperatures.
We calculate the steady state by the effective Hamiltonian approach and discuss
the dependence of the steady state entanglement on the temperatures and
couplings. The results show that for symmetric qubit-qubit couplings, the
entanglements between the nearest neighbor are equal, independent of the
temperatures of the two baths. The maximum of the entanglement arrives at
$T_L=T_R$. For nonsymmetric qubit-qubit couplings, however, the situation is
totally different. The baths at different temperatures would benefit the
entanglement and the entanglements between the nearest neighbors are no longer
equal. By examining the probability distribution of each eigenstate in the
steady state, we present an explanation for these observations. These results
suggest that the steady entanglement can be controlled by the temperature of
the two baths.
