In this work, the peak rate of the caching problem is investigated, under the
scenario that the users are with small buffer sizes and the number of users is
no less than the amount of files in the server. A novel coded caching strategy
is proposed for such a scenario, leading to a lower peak rate compared to
recent results in the literature. Furthermore, it is verified that our peak
rates coincides with the cut-set bound analytically in an information-theoretic
view.
