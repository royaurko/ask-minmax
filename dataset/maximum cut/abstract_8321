We present results of the simulation of the intensity distribution of radio
pulses from the Moon due to interaction of EeV neutrinos with lunar regolith.
The radiation mechanism is of coherent \^Cerenkov radiation of the negative
charge excess in the shower, known as Askar'yan effect. Several realistic
observational setups with ground radio telescopes are considered. Effective
detector volume is calculated using maximum-knowledge Monte Carlo code, and the
possibilities to set limits on the diffuse neutrino flux are discussed.
