A laser-Compton backscattering beam, which we call a `Laser-Electron Photon'
beam, was upgraded at the LEPS beamline of SPring-8. We accomplished the gains
in backscattered photon beam intensities by factors of 1.5--1.8 with the
injection of two adjacent laser beams or a higher power laser beam into the
storage ring. The maximum energy of the photon beam was also extended from 2.4
GeV to 2.9 GeV with deep-ultraviolet lasers. The upgraded beams have been
utilized for hadron photoproduction experiments at the LEPS beamline. Based on
the developed methods, we plan the simultaneous injection of four high power
laser beams at the LEPS2 beamline, which has been newly constructed at
SPring-8. As a simulation result, we expect an order of magnitude higher
intensities close to 10$^7$ sec$^{-1}$ and 10$^6$ sec$^{-1}$ for tagged photons
up to 2.4 GeV and 2.9 GeV, respectively.
