It has been conjectured (astro-ph/0103463) that a gravitational lens
consisting of n point masses can not produce more than 5(n-1) images as is
known to be the case for n = 2 and 3. The reasoning is based on the number of
finite limit points 2(n-1) which we believe to set the maximum number of
positive images and the fact that the number of negative images exceeds the
number of positive images by (n-1). It has been known that an n-point lens
system (n\ge 3) can produce (3n+1) images and so has been an explicit lens
configuration with (3n+1) images. We start with the well-known n-point lens
configuration that produces (3n+1) images and produce (2n-1) extra images by
adding a small (n+1)-th mass so that the resulting (n+1)-point lens
configuration has (2n) discrete limit points and produces 5n images of a
source. It still remains to confirm in abstraction that the maximum number of
positive image domains of a caustic domain is bounded by the number of the
limit points.
