Ultrahigh energy neutrinos (UHE\nu) scatter on relic neutrinos (R\nu)
producing Z bosons, which can decay hadronically producing protons (Z-burst).
We compare the predicted proton spectrum with the observed ultrahigh energy
cosmic ray (UHECR) spectrum and determine the mass of the heaviest R\nu via a
maximum likelihood analysis. Our prediction depends on the origin of the
power-like part of the UHECR spectrum: m_\nu=2.75^{+1.28}_{-0.97} eV for
Galactic halo and 0.26^{+0.20}_{-0.14} eV for extragalactic (EG) origin. The
necessary UHE\nu flux should be detected in the near future.
