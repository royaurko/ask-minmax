The constrained Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (cNMSSM) with
mSugra-like boundary conditions at the GUT scale implies a singlino-like LSP
with a mass just a few GeV below a stau NLSP. Hence, most of the squark/gluino
decay cascades contain two tau leptons. The gluino mass >~ 1.2 TeV is somewhat
larger than the squark masses of >~ 1 TeV. We simulate signal and background
events for such a scenario at the LHC, and propose cuts on the transverse
momenta of two jets, the missing transverse energy and the transverse momentum
of a hadronically decaying tau lepton. This dedicated analysis allows to
improve on the results of generic supersymmetry searches for a large part of
the parameter space of the cNMSSM. The distribution of the effective mass and
the signal rate provide sensitivity to distinguish the cNMSSM from the
constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in the stau-coannihilation
region.
