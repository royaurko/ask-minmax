An influence of the repulsive interactions on matter properties is considered
within the excluded volume van der Waals hadron-resonance gas model.
Quantitative results are presented for matter at the chemical freeze-out in
central nucleus-nucleus collisions at relativistic energies. In particular, it
is shown that repulsive interactions connected to non-zero size of created
particles lead to a significant decrease of collision energy at which the
net-baryon density has a maximum. A position of the transition point from
baryon to meson dominated matter depends on the difference between baryon and
meson hard-core radiuses.
