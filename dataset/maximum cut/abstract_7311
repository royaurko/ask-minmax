We present the detection of an intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence population
embedded in the nebular filaments surrounding the 30 Doradus region in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using HST/NICMOS. In addition to four previously
known luminous Class I infrared ``protostars,'' the NICMOS data reveal 20 new
sources with intrinsic infrared excess similar to Galactic pre-main sequence
stars. Based on their infrared brightness, these objects can be identified as
the LMC equivalent of Galactic pre-main sequence stars. The faintest LMC Young
Stellar Objects in the sample have colors similar to T Tauri and have about the
same brightness as T Tauri if placed at the distance of the LMC. We find no
evidence for a lower-mass cut-off in the initial mass function. Instead, the
whole spectrum of stellar masses from pre-main sequence stars with ~1.5Mo to
massive O stars still embedded in dense knots appears to be present in the
nebular filaments. The majority of the young stellar objects can be found to
the north of the central starburst cluster R136. This region is very likely
evolving into an OB association.
