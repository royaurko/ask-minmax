We analyze OGLE-2003-BLG-262, a relatively short, t_E=12.5+-0.1day,
microlensing event generated by a point-mass lens transiting the face of a K
giant source in the Galactic bulge. We use the resulting finite-source effects
to measure the angular Einstein radius, theta_E=195+-17muas, and so constrain
the lens mass to the full-width half-maximum interval 0.08 < M/M_sun < 0.54.
The lens-source relative proper motion is mu_rel = 27+-2 km/s/kpc. Both values
are typical of what is expected for lenses detected toward the bulge. Despite
the short duration of the event, we detect marginal evidence for a "parallax
asymmetry", but argue that this is more likely to be induced by acceleration of
the source, a binary lens, or possibly by statistical fluctuations. Although
OGLE-2003-BLG-262 is only the second published event to date in which the lens
transits the source, such events will become more common with the new OGLE-III
survey in place. We therefore give a detailed account of the analysis of this
event to facilitate the study of future events of this type.
