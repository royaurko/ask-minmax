We have developed a C++ implementation of the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM)
suitable for deconvolving VLBI polarisation data. The first results of this
implementation are presented and compared with CLEAN-based deconvolutions of
the same data. We present Faraday rotation measure and intrinsic polarisation
maps of AGN which have been made from MEM deconvolutions of multi-wavelength
observations of Stokes parameters I, Q and U. The advantages of using MEM are
demonstrated, in particular its enhanced resolution over the CLEAN algorithm.
