We study two types of monomial ideals associated to a poset $P$, the
letterplace ideals $L(n,P)$ and co-letterplace ideals $L(P,n)$. By cutting down
these ideals, or subideals of these, by regular sequences of variable
differences, we obtain many ideals studied recently in the literature:
multichain ideals and generalized Hibi type ideals, initial ideals of
determinantal ideals, strongly stable ideals, $d$-partite $d$-uniform ideals,
Ferrers ideals, and uniform face ideals.
