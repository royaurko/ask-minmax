Recent laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies have
established the presence of a new kink in the low-energy nodal dispersion of
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$+{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212). The energy scale (~8-15 meV) of
this kink appears below the maximum of the superconducting gap $\delta_0$.
Therefore it is difficult to interpret this feature in terms of the usual
coupling to a sharp dispersionless mode. In this paper we examine
electron-phonon coupling to the in-plane acoustic phonon branch arising from
the modulation of the screened Coulomb potential. We demonstrate that such a
coupling has a strong forward scattering peak, and as a consequence, a kink
occurs in the dispersion at an energy scale shifted by the local gap
$\delta(k)$. In addition, considerations for the reduction of screening with
underdoping naturally explains the observed doping dependence of the low-energy
kink. These results point to a strong coupling to the acoustic branch which is
peaked in the forward scattering direction and has important implications for
transport and pairing in the high-T$_c$ cuprates.
