We describe a model of electron transfer reactions affected by local binding
to the donor or acceptor sites of a particle in equilibrium with the solution.
The statistics of fluctuations of the donor-acceptor energy gap caused by
binding/unbinding events are non-Gaussian, and the resulting free energy
surfaces of electron transfer are non-parabolic. The band-width of the
charge-transfer optical transition is predicted to pass through a maximum as a
function of the concentration of binding particles in the solution. The model
is used to rationalize recent observations of pH-dependence of electron
transfer rates involving changes in the protonation state of the donor-acceptor
complex.
