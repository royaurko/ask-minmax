The multilayer secured DWT-DCT and YIQ color space based image watermarking
technique with robustness and better correlation is presented here. The
security levels are increased by using multiple pn sequences, Arnold
scrambling, DWT domain, DCT domain and color space conversions. Peak signal to
noise ratio and Normalized correlations are used as measurement metrics. The
512x512 sized color images with different histograms are used for testing and
watermark of size 64x64 is embedded in HL region of DWT and 4x4 DCT is used.
'Haar' wavelet is used for decomposition and direct flexing factor is used. We
got PSNR value is 63.9988 for flexing factor k=1 for Lena image and the maximum
NC 0.9781 for flexing factor k=4 in Q color space. The comparative performance
in Y, I and Q color space is presented. The technique is robust for different
attacks like scaling, compression, rotation etc.
