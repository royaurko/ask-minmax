We present high-resolution VLA observations of the molecular gas in the host
galaxy of the highest redshift quasar currently known, SDSS J1148+5251
(z=6.42). Our VLA data of the CO(3-2) emission have a maximum resolution of
0.17'' x 0.13'' (~1 kpc), and enable us to resolve the molecular gas emission
both spatially and in velocity. The molecular gas in J1148+5251 is extended to
a radius of 2.5 kpc, and the central region shows 2 peaks, separated by 0.3''
(1.7 kpc). These peaks account for about half of the total emission, while the
remainder is more extended. Each of these unresolved peaks contains a molecular
gas mass of ~5 x 10^9 M_sun (similar to the total mass found in nearby ULIRGS)
and has an intrinsic brightness temperature of ~35 K (averaged over the 1
kpc-sized beam), comparable to what is found in nearby starburst centers.
Assuming that the molecular gas is gravitationally bound, we estimate a
dynamical mass of ~4.5 x 10^10 M_sun within a radius of 2.5 kpc (~5.5 x 10^10
M_sun if corrected for a derived inclination of i~65 deg.). This dynamical mass
estimate leaves little room for matter other than the detected molecular gas,
and in particular the data are inconsistent with a ~10^12 M_sun stellar bulge
which would be predicted based on the M_BH-sigma_bulge relation. This finding
may indicate that black holes form prior to the assembly of the stellar bulges
and that the dark matter halos are less massive than predicted based on the
black hole/bulge mass relationship.
