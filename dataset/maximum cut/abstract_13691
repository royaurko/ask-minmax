We compare population synthesis results for inner and outer magnetosphere
emission models with the various characteristics measured in the first LAT
pulsar catalogue for both the radio-loud and radio-weak or radio-quiet
gamma-ray pulsars. We show that all models fail to reproduce the observations:
for each model there is a lack of luminous and energetic objects that suggest a
non dipolar magnetic field structure or spin-down evolution. The large
dispersion that we find in the simulated gamma-ray luminosity versus spin-down
power relation does not allow to use the present trend seen in the Fermi data
to distinguish among models. For each model and each Fermi detected pulsar, we
have generated light curves as a function of obliquity and inclination angles.
The theoretical curves were fitted to the observed one, using a
maximum-likelihood approach, to derive the best-fit orientations and to compare
how well each model can reproduce the data. Including the radio light-curve
gives an additional key constraint to restrict the orientation space
