A technology of obtaining the single-phase ceramic samples of La1-xKxMnO3
manganites and the dependence of their structural parameters on the content of
potassium has been described. Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in the obtained
samples has been measured by two independent methods: by classical direct
methodic and by a method of magnetic field modulation. The values of MCE
obtained by both methods have been substantially differed. The explanation of
the observed divergences is given. The correlation between the level of doping
and MCE value has been defined. The value of TC determined by the MCE maximum
has been conformed to the literature data received by other methods.
