The scalar models with exponential interaction, introduced in
arXiv:1506.00987, include theories with $\langle \phi\rangle\neq0$. Here, we
investigate the partition function of scalar theories with normal ordered
exponential interactions. The vev of the normal ordering of the exponential of
the integrated potential $$ e^{-Z_R[J]}=\langle 0| :e^{-\int
d^4xV(\phi)}:|0\rangle_J $$ generates the lowest order contributions to the
$N$-point function. We first investigate the case
$V(\phi)=\mu^D\exp(-\alpha\phi)$, and then focus on $V(\phi)=-2\nu
m^4\sinh({\phi/\nu m})$. The latter can be seen as an effective theory with
dimensionless scale parameter $\nu$. The standard normalization choice for
finite theories suggests setting $\nu=\sqrt{\Delta_{F,\Lambda}(0)}/m$, with
$\Delta_{F,\Lambda}(x)$ the Feynman propagator with cut-off on the momenta. For
large $\Lambda$ the model is well-described by $Z_R[J]$ $$
\langle\phi\rangle=2m $$ in agreement with the experimental data. In such a
limit the propagator corresponds to the free one. The investigation suggests a
natural way to get the lagrangian of the Standard Model, with a different Higgs
lagrangian, that may be tested in future experiments at LHC.
