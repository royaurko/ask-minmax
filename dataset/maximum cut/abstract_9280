In this paper we introduce a new lifetime distribution by compounding
exponential and Poisson-Lindley distributions, named exponential
Poisson-Lindley distribution. Several properties are derived, such as density,
failure rate, mean lifetime, moments, order statistics and R\'enyi entropy.
Furthermore, estimation by maximum likelihood and inference for large sample
are discussed. The paper is motivated by two applications to real data sets and
we hope that this model be able to attract wider applicability in survival and
reliability.
