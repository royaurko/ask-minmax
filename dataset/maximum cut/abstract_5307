Cosmological perturbation theory is a key tool to study the universe. The
linear or first order theory is well understood, however, developing and
applying the theory beyond linear order is at the cutting edge of current
research in theoretical cosmology. In this article, I will describe some
signatures of non-linear perturbation theory that do not exist at linear order,
focusing on vorticity generation at second order. In doing so, we discuss why
this, among other features such as induced gravitational waves and
non-Gaussianities, shows that cosmological perturbation theory is crucial for
testing models of the universe.
