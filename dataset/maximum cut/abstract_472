Bi-intuitionistic logic is the extension of intuitionistic logic with a
connective dual to implication. Bi-intuitionistic logic was introduced by
Rauszer as a Hilbert calculus with algebraic and Kripke semantics. But her
subsequent ``cut-free'' sequent calculus for BiInt has recently been shown by
Uustalu to fail cut-elimination. We present a new cut-free sequent calculus for
BiInt, and prove it sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics.
Ensuring completeness is complicated by the interaction between implication and
its dual, similarly to future and past modalities in tense logic. Our calculus
handles this interaction using extended sequents which pass information from
premises to conclusions using variables instantiated at the leaves of failed
derivation trees. Our simple termination argument allows our calculus to be
used for automated deduction, although this is not its main purpose.
