We consider spatially coupled code ensembles. A particular instance are
convolutional LDPC ensembles. It was recently shown that, for transmission over
the binary erasure channel, this coupling increases the belief propagation
threshold of the ensemble to the maximum a-priori threshold of the underlying
component ensemble. We report on empirical evidence which suggest that the same
phenomenon also occurs when transmission takes place over a general binary
memoryless symmetric channel. This is confirmed both by simulations as well as
by computing EBP GEXIT curves and by comparing the empirical BP thresholds of
coupled ensembles to the empirically determined MAP thresholds of the
underlying regular ensembles. We further consider ways of reducing the
rate-loss incurred by such constructions.
