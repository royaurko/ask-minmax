We consider a relativistic, degenerate, electron gas under the influence of a
strong magnetic field, which describes magnetized white dwarfs. Landau
quantization changes the density of states available to the electrons, thus
modifying the underlying equation of state. In the presence of very strong
magnetic fields a maximum of either one, two or three Landau level(s) is/are
occupied. We obtain the mass-radius relations for such white dwarfs and their
detailed investigation leads us to propose the existence of white dwarfs having
a mass ~2.3M_Sun, which overwhelmingly exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass limit.
