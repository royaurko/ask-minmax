Bezout's theorem gives us the degree of intersection of two properly
intersecting projective varieties. As two curves in P^3 never intersect
properly, Bezout's theorem cannot be directly used to bound the number of
intersection points of such curves. In this work, we bound the maximum number
of intersection points of two integral ACM curves in P^3. The bound that we
give is in many cases optimal as a function of only the degrees and the initial
degrees of the curves.
