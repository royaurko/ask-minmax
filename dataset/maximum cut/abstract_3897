The proton burning process p + p -> d + e(+) + \nu(e), important for the
stellar evolution of main-sequence stars of mass equal to or less than that of
the Sun, is computed in effective field theory using chiral perturbation
expansion to the next-to-next-to leading chiral order. This represents a
model-independent calculation consistent with low-energy effective theory of
QCD comparable in accuracy to the radiative np capture at thermal energy
previously calculated by first using very accurate two-nucleon wavefunctions
backed up by an effective field theory technique with a finite cut-off. The
result obtained thereby is found to support within theoretical uncertainties
the previous calculation of the same process by Bahcall and his co-workers.
