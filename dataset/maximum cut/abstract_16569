On the basis of the nonisometric transformations subgroup of the SO(4.2)
group, the nonlinear time inhomogeneity one-parameter conformal transformations
are constructed. The connection between the group parameter and the Hubble
constant H0 is established. It is shown that the existence of an anomalous
blue-shifted frequency drift is a pure kinematic manifestation of the time
inhomogeneity induced by the Universe expansion. This conclusion is confirmed
via a generalization of the standard Special Relativity clock synchronization
procedure to the space expanding case. The obtained formulae are in accordance
with the observable Pioneer Anomaly effect. The anomalous blue-shifted drift is
universal, does not depend on the presence of graviting centers and can be, in
principle, observed on any frequencies under suitable experimental conditions.
The explicit analytic expression for the speed of recession--intergalactic
distance ratio is obtained in the form of a function of the red shift z valid
in the whole range of its variation. In the small z limit this expression
exactly reproduces the Hubble law. The maximum value of this function at
z=0.475 quantitatively corresponds to the experimentally found value z(exp) =
0.46 +/- 0.13 of the transition from the decelerated to the accelerated
expansion of the Universe.
