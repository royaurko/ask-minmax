Effects from a finite top quark mass on the H+n-jet cross section through
gluon fusion are studied for $n=0/n\ge 1$ at NNLO/NLO QCD. For this purpose,
sub-leading terms in $1/m_t$ are calculated. We show that the asymptotic
expansion of the jet-vetoed cross section at NNLO is very well behaved and that
the heavy-top approximation is valid at the five permille level up to jet-veto
cuts of 300 GeV. For the inclusive Higgs+jet rate, we introduce a matching
procedure that allows for a reliable prediction of the top-mass effects using
the expansion in $1/m_t$. The quality of the effective field theory to evaluate
differential K-factors for the distribution of the hardest jet is found to be
better than 1-2% as long as the transverse momentum of the jet is integrated
out or remains below about 150 GeV.
