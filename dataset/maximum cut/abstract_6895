The assumption of log-concavity is a flexible and appealing nonparametric
shape constraint in distribution modelling. In this work, we study the
log-concave maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of a probability mass function
(pmf). We show that the MLE is strongly consistent and derive its pointwise
asymptotic theory under both the well- and misspecified setting. Our asymptotic
results are used to calculate confidence intervals for the true log-concave
pmf. Both the MLE and the associated confidence intervals may be easily
computed using the R package logcondiscr. We illustrate our theoretical results
using recent data from the H1N1 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.
