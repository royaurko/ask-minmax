Minimax decentralized detection is studied under two scenarios: with and
without a fusion center when the source of uncertainty is the Bayesian prior.
When there is no fusion center, the constraints in system design are
determined. Both for a single decision maker and multiple decision makers, the
maximum loss in detection performance due to robust decision making is
obtained. In the presence of a fusion center, the maximum achievable detection
performance is derived and is compared to that of a without fusion center
network. The results are finally generalized.
