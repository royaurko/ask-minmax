The results of B, V, R surface photometry of three polar-ring galaxies (PRGs)
-- A0017+2212, UGC1198, UGC4385 -- are presented. The data were acquired at the
6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy
of Sciences. It was shown that all three galaxies are peculiar late-type
spirals in the state of ongoing interaction or merging. We discuss available
photometric properties of the PRGs with spiral hosts and consider the
Tully-Fisher relation for different types of PRGs. In agreement with Iodice et
al. (2003), we have shown that true PRGs demonstrate ~1/3 larger maximum
rotation velocities than spiral galaxies of the same luminosity. Peculiar
objects with forming polar structures satisfy, on average, the Tully-Fisher
relation for disk galaxies but with large scatter.
