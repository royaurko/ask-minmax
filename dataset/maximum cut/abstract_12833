We propose an order index, phi, which quantifies the notion of ``life at the
edge of chaos'' when applied to genome sequences. It maps genomes to a number
from 0 (random and of infinite length) to 1 (fully ordered) and applies
regardless of sequence length. The 786 complete genomic sequences in GenBank
were found to have phi values in a very narrow range, 0.037+/-0.027. We show
this implies that genomes are halfway towards being completely random, namely,
at the edge of chaos. We argue that this narrow range represents the
neighborhood of a fixed-point in the space of sequences, and genomes are driven
there by the dynamics of a robust, predominantly neutral evolution process.
