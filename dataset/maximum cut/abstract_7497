We study the color confinement, the $q$-$\bar q$ pair creation and the
dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking of nonperturbative QCD by using the dual
Ginzburg-Landau theory, where QCD-monopole condensation plays an essential role
on the nonperturbative dynamics in the infrared region. As a result of the dual
Meissner effect, the linear static quark potential, which characterizes the
quark confinement, is obtained in the long distance within the quenched
approximation. We obtain a simple expression for the string tension similar to
the energy per unit length of a vortex in the superconductivity physics. The
dynamical effect of light quarks on the quark confining potential is
investigated in terms of the infrared screening effect due to the $q$-$\bar q$
pair creation or the cut of the hadronic string. The screening length of the
potential is estimated by using the Schwinger formula for the $q$-$\bar q$ pair
creation. We introduce the corresponding infrared cutoff to the strong
long-range correlation factor in the gluon propagator as a dynamical effect of
light quarks, and obtain a compact formula of the quark potential including the
screening effect in the infrared region. We investigate the dynamical
chiral-symmetry breaking by using the Schwinger-Dyson equation, where the gluon
propagator includes the nonperturbative effect related to
