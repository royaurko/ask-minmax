Motivated by a wide-spread use of convex optimization techniques, convexity
properties of bit error rate of the maximum likelihood detector operating in
the AWGN channel are studied for arbitrary constellations and bit mappings,
which may also include coding under maximum-likelihood decoding. Under this
generic setting, the pairwise probability of error and bit error rate are shown
to be convex functions of the SNR in the high SNR regime with
explicitly-determined boundary. The bit error rate is also shown to be a convex
function of the noise power in the low noise/high SNR regime.
