The asymptotic convergence of probability density function (pdf) and
convergence of differential entropy are examined for the non-stationary
processes that follow the maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt) and maximum
entropy production principle (MEPP). Asymptotic convergence of pdf provides new
justification of MEPP while convergence of differential entropy is important in
asymptotic analysis of communication systems. A set of equations describing the
dynamics of pdf under mass conservation and energy conservation constraints is
derived. It is shown that for pdfs with compact carrier the limit pdf is unique
and can be obtained from Jaynes's MaxEnt principle.
