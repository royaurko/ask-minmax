To accurately calculate efficiencies $\eta$ of experimentally produced
multijunction solar cells (MJSCs) and optimize their parameters, we offer
semi-analytical photoconversion formalism that incorporates radiative
recombination, Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, surface recombination at
the front and back surfaces of the cells, recombination in the space charge
region (SCR) and the recombination at the heterojunction boundaries.
Selfconsistent balance between the MJSC temperature and efficiency was imposed
by jointly solving the equations for the photocurrent, photovoltage, and heat
balance. Finally, we incorporate into the formalism the effect of additional
photocurrent decrease with subcell number increase. It is shown that for an
experimentally observed Shockley-Read-Hall lifetimes, the effect of
re-absorption and re-emission of photons on MJSC efficiency can be neglected
for non-concentrated radiation conditions. A significant efficiency $\eta$
increase can be achieved by improving the heat dissipation using radiators and
bringing the MJSC emissivity to unity, that is closer to black body radiation
rather than grey body radiation. Our calculated efficiencies compare well with
other numerical results available and are consistent with the experimentally
achieved efficiencies. The formalism can be used to optimize parameters of
MJSCs for maximum photoconversion efficiency.
