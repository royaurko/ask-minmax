The effects of various transition metal dopants on the electrical and thermal
transport properties of Fe1-xMxSi alloys (M= Co, Ir, Os) are reported. The
maximum thermoelectric figure of merit ZTmax is improved from 0.007 at 60 K for
pure FeSi to ZT = 0.08 at 100 K for 4% Ir doping. A comparison of the thermal
conductivity data among Os, Ir and Co doped alloys indicates strong
electron-phonon coupling in this compound. Because of this interaction, the
common approximation of dividing the total thermal conductivity into
independent electronic and lattice components ({\kappa}Total =
{\kappa}electronic + {\kappa}lattice) fails for these alloys. The effects of
grain size on thermoelectric properties of Fe0.96Ir0.04Si alloys are also
reported. The thermal conductivity can be lowered by about 50% with little or
no effect on the electrical resistivity or Seebeck coefficient. This results in
ZTmax = 0.125 at 100 K, still about a factor of five too low for solid-state
refrigeration applications.
