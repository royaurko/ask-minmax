Using finite element software developed for metal cutting by Third Wave
Systems we investigate the forces involved in chatter, a self-sustained
oscillation of the cutting tool. The phenomena is decomposed into a vibrating
tool cutting a flat surface work piece, and motionless tool cutting a work
piece with a wavy surface. While cutting the wavy surface, the shearplane was
seen to oscillate in advance of the oscillation of the depth of cut, as were
the cutting, thrust, and shear plane forces. The vibrating tool was used to
investigate process damping through the interaction of the relief face of the
tool and the workpiece. Crushing forces are isolated and compared to the
contact length between the tool and workpiece. We found that the wavelength
dependence of the forces depended on the relative size of the wavelength to the
length of the relief face of the tool. The results indicate that the damping
force from crushing will be proportional to the cutting speed for short tools,
and inversely proportional for long tools.
