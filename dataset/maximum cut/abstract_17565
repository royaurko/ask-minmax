Recently, Elshamounty et al. performed a reanalysis of the surface
temperature of the neutron star in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A on the
basis of Chandra data measured during last decade, and added a new data point.
We show that all reliably known temperature data of neutron stars including
those belonging to Cassiopea A can be comfortably explained in our "nuclear
medium cooling" scenario of neutron stars. The cooling rates account for
medium-modified one-pion exchange in dense matter, polarization effects in the
pair-breaking-formation processes operating on superfluid neutrons and protons
paired in the 1S_0 state, and other relevant processes. The emissivity of the
pair-breaking-formation process in the 3P_2 state is a tiny quantity within our
scenario. Crucial for a successful description of the Cassiopeia A cooling
proves to be the thermal conductivity from both, the electrons and nucleons,
being reduced by medium effects. Moreover, we exploit an EoS which stiffens at
high densities due to an excluded volume effect and is capable of describing a
maximum mass of 2.1 M_sun, thus including the recent measurements of PSR
J1614-2230 and PSR J0348+0432.
