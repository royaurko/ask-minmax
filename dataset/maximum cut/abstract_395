This work presents an approach to evaluate the exact value of the fractal
dimension of the cutting path $d^{CP}_f$ on hierarchical structures with finite
order of ramification. This represents the first renormalization group
treatment of the universality class of watersheds. By making use of the
self-similar property, we show that $d^{CP}_f$ depends only on the average
cutting path (CP) of the first generation of the structure. For the simplest
Wheastone hierarchical lattice (WHL), we present a mathematical proof. For a
larger WHL structure, the exact value of $d^{CP}_f$ is derived based on an
computer algorithm that identifies the length of all possible CP's of the first
generation.
