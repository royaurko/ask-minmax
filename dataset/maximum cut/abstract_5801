We have developed a technique to map the three-dimensional structure of the
local interstellar medium using a maximum entropy reconstruction technique. A
set of column densities N to stars of known distance can in principle be used
to recover a three-dimensional density field n, since the two quantities are
related by simple geometry through the equation N = C n, where C is a matrix
characterizing the stellar spatial distribution. In practice, however, there is
an infinte number of solutions to this equation. We use a maximum entropy
reconstruction algorithm to find the density field containing the least
information which is consistent with the observations. The solution obtained
with this technique is, in some sense, the model containing the minimum
structure. We apply the algorithm to several simulated data sets to demonstrate
its feasibility and success at recovering ``real'' density contrasts.
  This technique can be applied to any set of column densities whose end points
are specified. In a subsequent paper we shall describe the application of this
method to a set of stellar color excesses to derive a map of the dust
distribution, and to soft X-ray absorption columns to hot stars to derive a map
of the total density of the interstellar medium.
