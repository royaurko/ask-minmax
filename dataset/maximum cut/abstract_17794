Type-Iax supernovae (SN Iax) are stellar explosions that are
spectroscopically similar to some type-Ia supernovae (SN Ia) at maximum light,
except with lower ejecta velocities. They are also distinguished by lower
luminosities. At late times, their spectroscopic properties diverge from other
SN, but their composition (dominated by iron-group and intermediate-mass
elements) suggests a physical connection to normal SN Ia. These are not rare;
SN Iax occur at a rate between 5 and 30% of the normal SN Ia rate. The leading
models for SN Iax are thermonuclear explosions of accreting carbon-oxygen white
dwarfs that do not completely unbind the star, implying they are "less
successful" cousins of normal SN Ia, where complete disruption is observed.
Here we report the detection of the luminous, blue progenitor system of the
type-Iax SN 2012Z in deep pre-explosion imaging. Its luminosity, colors,
environment, and similarity to the progenitor of the Galactic helium nova V445
Puppis, suggest that SN 2012Z was the explosion of a white dwarf accreting from
a helium-star companion. Observations in the next few years, after SN 2012Z has
faded, could test this hypothesis, or alternatively show that this supernova
was actually the explosive death of a massive star.
