We present an $O^*(1.0919^n)$-time algorithm for finding a maximum
independent set in an $n$-vertex graph with degree bounded by 3, which improves
the previously known algorithm of running time $O^*(1.0977^n)$ by Bourgeois,
Escoffier and Paschos [IWPEC 2008]. We also present an $O^*(1.1923^k)$-time
algorithm to decide if a graph with degree bounded by 3 has a vertex cover of
size $k$, which improves the previously known algorithm of running time
$O^*(1.1939^k)$ by Chen, Kanj and Xia [ISAAC 2003].
  Two new branching techniques, \emph{branching on a bottle} and
\emph{branching on a 4-cycle}, are introduced, which help us to design simple
and fast algorithms for the maximum independent set and minimum vertex cover
problems and avoid tedious branching rules.
