We apply the method of Hasenfratz and Niedermayer to analytically construct
perfect lattice actions for the Gross--Neveu model. In the large $N$ limit
these actions display an exactly perfect scaling, i.e. cut-off artifacts are
completely eliminated even at arbitrarily short correlation length. Also the
energy spectrum coincides with the spectrum in the continuum and continuous
translation and rotation symmetries are restored in physical observables. This
is the first (analytic) construction of an exactly perfect lattice action at
finite correlation length.
