Massive, highly magnetized white dwarfs with fields up to $10^9$ G have been
observed and theoretically used for the description of a variety of
astrophysical phenomena. Ultramagnetized white dwarfs with uniform interior
fields up to $10^{18}$ G, have been recently purported to obey a new maximum
mass limit, $M_{\rm max}\approx 2.58~M_\odot$, which largely overcomes the
traditional Chandrasekhar value, $M_{\rm Ch}\approx 1.44~M_\odot$. Such a much
larger limit would make these astrophysical objects viable candidates for the
explanation of the superluminous population of type Ia supernovae. We show that
several macro and micro physical aspects such as gravitational, dynamical
stability, breaking of spherical symmetry, general relativity, inverse
$\beta$-decay, and pycnonuclear fusion reactions are of most relevance for the
self-consistent description of the structure and assessment of stability of
these objects. It is shown in this work that the first family of magnetized
white dwarfs indeed satisfy all the criteria of stability, while the
ultramagnetized white dwarfs are very unlikely to exist in nature since they
violate minimal requests of stability. Therefore, the canonical Chandrasekhar
mass limit of white dwarfs has to be still applied.
