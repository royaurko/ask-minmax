We apply new techniques developed in a previous paper to the study of some
surface effects in the 2D Ising model. We examine in particular the
pinning-depinning transition. The results are valid for all subcritical
temperatures. By duality we obtained new finite size effects on the asymptotic
behaviour of the two-point correlation function above the critical temperature.
The key-point of the analysis is to obtain good concentration properties of the
measure defined on the random lines giving the high-temperature representation
of the two-point correlation function, as a consequence of the sharp triangle
inequality: let tau(x) be the surface tension of an interface perpendicular to
x; then for any x,y
  tau(x)+tau(y)-tau(x+y) >= 1/kappa(||x||+||y||-||x+y||),
  where kappa is the maximum curvature of the Wulff shape and ||x|| the
Euclidean norm of x.
