This work addresses the question of achieving capacity with lattice codes in
multi-antenna block fading channels when the number of fading blocks tends to
infinity. A design criterion based on the normalized minimum determinant is
proposed for division algebra multiblock space-time codes over fading channels;
this plays a similar role to the Hermite invariant for Gaussian channels. It is
shown that this criterion is sufficient to guarantee transmission rates within
a constant gap from capacity both for slow fading channels and ergodic fading
channels. This performance is achieved both under maximum likelihood decoding
and naive lattice decoding. In the case of independent identically distributed
Rayleigh fading, it is also shown that the error probability vanishes
exponentially fast. In contrast to the standard approach in the literature
which employs random lattice ensembles, the existence results in this paper are
derived from number theory. First the gap to capacity is shown to depend on the
discriminant of the chosen division algebra; then class field theory is applied
to build families of algebras with small discriminants. The key element in the
construction is the choice of a sequence of division algebras whose centers are
number fields with small root discriminants.
