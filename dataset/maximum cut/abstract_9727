Existing methods for the estimation of stable distribution parameters, such
as those based on sample quantiles, sample characteristic functions or maximum
likelihood generally assume an independent sample. Little attention has been
paid to estimation from a dependent sample. In this paper, a method for the
estimation of stable distribution parameters from a dependent sample is
proposed based on the sample quantiles. The estimates are shown to be
asymptotically normal. The asymptotic variance is calculated for stable moving
average processes. Simulations from stable moving average processes are used to
demonstrate these estimators.
