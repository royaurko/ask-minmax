A simple step and search control strategy for extracting maximum output power
from grid connected Variable Speed Wind Energy Conversion System (VSWECS) is
implemented in this work. This system consists of a variable speed wind turbine
coupled to a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) through a gear box,
a DC-DC boost converter and a hysteresis current controlled Voltage Source
Converter (VSC). The Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) extracts maximum power
from the wind turbine from cut-into rated wind velocity by sensing only by DC
link power. This system can be connected to a micro-grid. Also it can be used
for supplying an isolated local load by means of converting the output of
Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) to DC and then convert to AC by
means of hysteresis current controlled Voltage Source Converter (VSI).
