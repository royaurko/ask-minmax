We investigate cut-elimination and cut-simulation in impredicative
(higher-order) logics. We illustrate that adding simple axioms such as Leibniz
equations to a calculus for an impredicative logic -- in our case a sequent
calculus for classical type theory -- is like adding cut. The phenomenon
equally applies to prominent axioms like Boolean- and functional
extensionality, induction, choice, and description. This calls for the
development of calculi where these principles are built-in instead of being
treated axiomatically.
