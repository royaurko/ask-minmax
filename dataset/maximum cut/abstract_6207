A series of spectra of the RV Tauri star R Scuti taken as it rose from a deep
minimum to a bright maximum during 2013 October and November reveals major
changes taking place in the photosphere and outer atmosphere of the star. This
may be the first such series of spectra and demonstrates the capability of
amateur spectroscopy for studying these complex stars.
