The magnetic compensation and magnetostriction properties in Fe doped CoCr2O4
samples have been investigated. Structural and magnetic measurements imply that
the doped Fe3+ ions initially occupy the B1(Cr) sites when x<0.1, and then
mainly take the A(Co) sites. This behaviour results in a role conversion of
magnetic contributors and a composition compensation between two competitively
magnetic sublattices at x=0.1. Temperature dependence compensation has also
been found in the samples with x=0.1~0.22, with the compensation temperature in
the range of 40~104 K. The Fe3+ doping also modulates the exchange interaction
of the system and prevents the formation of long range conical order of spins.
The magnetoelectric transition temperature at 23K in CoCr2O4 is shifted to
lower temperature by increasing the dopants. The magnetostriction effect in
this system has been observed for the first time. The strain has a maximum
value of about 280ppm at x=0.4. The magnetostriction is in consistent with the
behaviour of the two magnetic compensations.
