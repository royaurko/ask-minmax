We solve the recombination equation by taking into account the induced
recombinations and a physical cut off in the hydrogen spectrum. The effective
recombination coefficient is parametrized as a function of temperature and free
electron density and is about a factor of four larger than without the induced
recombination. This accelerates the last stage of the recombination processes
and diminishes the residual ionization by a factor of about 2.6. The number and
energy distribution of photons issuing from the hydrogen recombination are
calculated. The distortion of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum
depends strongly on the cosmological parameters \Omega, \Omega_b and H_0 and
differs essentially from the Planck-spectrum for wavelengths < 190 \mu m.
