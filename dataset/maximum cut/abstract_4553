The problem of stability in the machining processes is an important task. It
is strictly connected with the final quality of a product. In this paper we
consider vibrations of a tool-workpiece system in a straight turning process
induced by random disturbances and their effect on a product surface. Basing on
experimentally obtained system parameters we have done the simulations using
one degree of freedom model. The noise has been introduced to the model by the
Langevin equation. We have also analyzed the product surface shape and its
dependence on the level of noise.
