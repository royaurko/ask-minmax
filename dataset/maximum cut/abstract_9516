With the Monte Carlo methods, we systematically investigate the short-time
dynamics of domain-wall motion in the two-dimensional random-field Ising model
with a driving field ?DRFIM?. We accurately determine the depinning transition
field and critical exponents. Through two different definitions of the domain
interface, we examine the dynamics of overhangs and islands. At the depinning
transition, the dynamic effect of overhangs and islands reaches maximum. We
argue that this should be an important mechanism leading the DRFIM model to a
different universality class from the Edwards-Wilkinson equation with quenched
disorder
