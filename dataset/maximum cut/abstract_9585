The sheath region is probed in different complex plasma experiments using
dust particles in addition to measurement of the optical emission originating
from the plasma. The local maximum in optical emission coincides with the
breaking of quasi-neutrality at the sheath boundary as indicated by the
vertical force profile reconstructed from dust particle trajectories, as well
as by the local onset of dust density waves in high density dust clouds
suspended in a dielectric box.
