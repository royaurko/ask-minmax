We show that Be stars belong to a high velocity tail of a single B-type star
rotational velocity distribution in the main sequence (MS). We studied 127
galactic field Be stars and obtained their true equatorial velocity at the ZAMS
using models of stellar evolution with rotation. There is a sharp
mass-dependent cut in the ZAMS under which there is no Be star. Velocities
above this cut follow a Gaussian-tail distribution. B stars with ZAMS
rotational velocities lower than the cut probably cannot become Be.
