In this paper, we study the group and list group colorings of total graphs
and we give two group versions of the total and list total colorings
conjectures. We establish the group version of the total coloring conjecture
for the following classes of graphs: graphs with small maximum degree,
two-degenerate graphs, planner graphs with maximum degree at least 11, planner
graphs without certain small cycles, outerplanar and near-outerplanar graphs.
In addition, the group version of the list total coloring conjecture is
established for forests, outerplanar graphs and graphs with maximum degree at
most two.
