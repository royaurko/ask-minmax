Models for complex systems are often built with more parameters than can be
uniquely identified by available data. Because of the variety of causes,
identifying a lack of parameter identifiability typically requires mathematical
manipulation of models, monte carlo simulations, and examination of the Fisher
Information Matrix. A simple test for parameter estimability is introduced,
using Data Cloning, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo based algorithm. Together, Data
cloning and the ANOVA based test determine if the model parameters are
estimable and if so, determine their maximum likelihood estimates and provide
asymptotic standard errors. When not all model parameters are estimable, the
Data Cloning results and the ANOVA test can be used to determine estimable
parameter combinations or infer identifiability problems in the model
structure. The method is illustrated using three different real data systems
that are known to be difficult to analyze.
