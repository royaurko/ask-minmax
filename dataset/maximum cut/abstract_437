We describe families of monotone symplectic manifolds constructed via the
symplectic cutting procedure of Lerman from the cotangent bundle of manifolds
endowed with a free circle action. We also give obstructions to the monotone
Lagrangian embedding of some compact manifolds in these symplectic manifolds.
