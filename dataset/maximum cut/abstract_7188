Double stage diamond anvil cells (DAC) of two designs have been assembled and
tested. We used a standard symmetric DAC as a primary stage and CVD microanvils
machined by a focused ion beam - as a second. We evaluated pressure, stress,
and strain distributions in Au and Fe-Au samples as well as in secondary anvils
using synchrotron x-ray diffraction with a micro-focused beam. A maximum
pressure of 240 GPa was reached independent of the first stage anvil culet
size. We found that the stress field generated by the second stage anvils is
typical of conventional DAC experiments. The maximum pressures reached are
limited by strains developing in the secondary anvil and by cupping of the
first stage diamond anvil in the presented experimental designs. Also, our
experiments show that pressures of several megabars may be reached without
sacrificing the first stage diamond anvils.
