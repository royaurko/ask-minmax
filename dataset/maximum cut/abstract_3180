We present a simple Coulomb gas method to calculate analytically the
probability of rare events where the maximum eigenvalue of a random matrix is
much larger than its typical value. The large deviation function that
characterizes this probability is computed explicitly for Wishart and Gaussian
ensembles. The method is quite general and applies to other related problems,
e.g. the joint large deviation function for large fluctuations of top
eigenvalues. Our results are relevant to widely employed data compression
techniques, namely the principal components analysis. Analytical predictions
are verified by extensive numerical simulations.
