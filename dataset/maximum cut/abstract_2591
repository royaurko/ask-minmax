This paper discusses a new type of thin-shell wormhole constructed by
applying the cut-and-paste technique to two copies of a charged black hole in
generalized dilaton-axion gravity, which was inspired by low-energy string
theory. After analyzing various aspects of this thin-shell wormhole, we discuss
its stability to linearized spherically symmetric perturbations.
