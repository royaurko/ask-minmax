Near-Infrared (NIR) observations are presented for five Type IIn supernovae
(SN 1995N, SN 1997ab, SN 1998S, SN 1999Z, and SN 1999el) that exhibit strong
infrared excesses at late times (t >= 100 d). H- and K-band emission from these
objects is dominated by a continuum that rises toward longer wavelengths. The
data are interpreted as thermal emission from dust, probably situated in a
pre-existing circumstellar nebula. The IR luminosities implied by single
temperature blackbody fits are quite large,> 10^(41 - 42) erg s^-1, and the
emission evolves slowly, lasting for years after maximum light. For SN 1995N,
the integrated energy release via IR dust emission was 0.5 -- 1 * 10^50 erg. A
number of dust heating scenarios are considered, the most likely being an
infrared echo poweredby X-ray and UV emissions from the shock interaction with
a dense circumstellar medium.
