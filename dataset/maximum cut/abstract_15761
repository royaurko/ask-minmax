We present UBVRI light curves for the bright Type Ia supernovae SN 1990N in
NGC 4639 and SN 1991T in NGC 4527 based on photometry gathered in the course of
the Calan/Tololo supernova program. Both objects have well-sampled light curves
starting several days before maximum light and spanning well through the
exponential tail. These data supercede the preliminary photometry published by
Leibundgut et al (1991) and Phillips et al (1992). The host galaxies for these
supernovae have (or will have) accurate distances based on the Cepheid
period-luminosity relationship. The photometric data in this paper provide
template curves for the study of general population of Type Ia supernova and
accurate photometric indices needed for the Cepheid-supernova distance scale.
