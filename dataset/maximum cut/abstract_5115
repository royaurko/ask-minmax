The experimental search limit on the Higgs boson mass points to a "golden
region" in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model parameter space in which
the fine-tuning in the electroweak sector is minimized. One of the sbottoms is
relatively light since its mass parameter is related to that of the stop. The
decay products of the light sbottom typically include a W boson and a b jet. We
studied the pair production of the light sbottoms at the Large Hadron Collider
and examined its discovery potential via collider signature of 4 jets + 1
lepton + missing E_T. We analyzed the Standard Model backgrounds for this
channel and developed a set of cuts to identify the signal and suppress the
backgrounds. We showed that with 100 fb^{-1} integrated luminosity, a
significant level of 5 sigma could be reached for the light sbottom discovery
at the LHC.
