We investigate the information-theoretic throughout achievable on a fading
communication link when the receiver is equipped with one-bit analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs). The analysis is conducted for the setting where neither the
transmitter nor the receiver have a priori information on the realization of
the fading channels. This means that channel-state information needs to be
acquired at the receiver on the basis of the one-bit quantized channel outputs.
We show that least-squares (LS) channel estimation combined with joint pilot
and data processing is capacity achieving in the single-user,
single-receive-antenna case.
  We also investigate the achievable uplink throughput in a massive
multiple-input multiple-output system where each element of the antenna array
at the receiver base-station feeds a one-bit ADC. We show that LS channel
estimation and maximum-ratio combining are sufficient to support both multiuser
operation and the use of high-order constellations. This holds in spite of the
severe nonlinearity introduced by the one-bit ADCs.
