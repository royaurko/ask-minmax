We measured the initial M-H curves for a sample of the newly discovered
superconductor NdFeAsO0.82Fe0.18, which had a critical temperature, Tc, of 51
K, and was fabricated at the high pressure of 6 GPa. The lower critical field,
Hc1, was extracted from the deviation point of the Meissner linearity in the
M-H curves, which show linear temperature dependence in the low temperature
region down to 5 K. The Hc1(T) indicates no s-wave superconductivity, but
rather an unconventional superconductivity with a nodal gap structure.
Furthermore, the linearity of Hc1 at low temperature does not hold at high
temperature, but shows other characteristics, indicating that this
superconductor might have multi-gap features. Based on the low temperature
nodal gap structure, we estimate that the maximum gap magnitude delta 0 =
(1.6+- 0.2) kBTc.
