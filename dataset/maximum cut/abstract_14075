Maps of the radial magnetic field at a heliocentric distance of ten solar
radii are used as boundary conditions in the MHD code CRONOS to simulate a 3D
inner-heliospheric solar wind emanating from the rotating Sun out to 1 AU. The
input data for the magnetic field are the result of solar surface flux
transport modelling using observational data of sunspot groups coupled with a
current sheet source surface model. Amongst several advancements, this allows
for higher angular resolution than that of comparable observational data from
synoptic magnetograms. The required initial conditions for the other MHD
quantities are obtained following an empirical approach using an inverse
relation between flux tube expansion and radial solar wind speed. The
computations are performed for representative solar minimum and maximum
conditions, and the corresponding state of the solar wind up to the Earths
orbit is obtained. After a successful comparison of the latter with
observational data, they can be used to drive outer-heliospheric models.
