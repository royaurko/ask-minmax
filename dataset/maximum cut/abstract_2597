We calculate radiative corrections to the flavor-changing neutral current
process K --> pi l+ l-, both for charged and neutral kaon decays. While the
soft-photon approximation is shown to work well for the muon channels, we
discuss the necessity of further phase space cuts with electrons in the final
state. It is also shown how to transfer our results to other decays such as eta
--> gamma l+ l- or omega --> pi0 l+ l-.
