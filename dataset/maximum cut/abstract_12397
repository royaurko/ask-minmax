A sum rule is derived for elastic scattering of hadrons at high energies
which is in good agreement with experimental data on $p\bar{p}$ available upto
the maximum energy $\sqrt{s} = 2 TeV$. Physically, our sum rule reflects the
way unitarity correlates and limits how large the elastic amplitude can be as a
function of energy to how fast it decreases as a function of the momentum
transfer. The universality of our result is justified through our earlier
result on equipartition of quark and glue momenta obtained from the virial
theorem for massless quarks and the Wilson conjecture
