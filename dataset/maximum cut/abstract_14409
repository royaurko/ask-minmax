In this paper, we have evaluated various methods of time-frequency-selective
fading channels estimation in OFDM system and some of them improved under time
varying conditions. So, these different techniques will be studied through
different algorithms and for different schemes of modulations (16 QAM, BPSK,
QPSK, ...). Channel estimation gathers different schemes and algorithms, some
of them are dedicated for slowly time varying (such as block type arrangement
insertion, Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound, Kalman estimator, Subspace estimator,
...) whereas the others concern highly time varying channels (comb type
insertion, ...). There are others methods that are just suitable for stationary
channels like blind or semi blind estimators. For this aim, diverse algorithms
were used for these schemes such as Least Squares estimator LS, Least Minimum
Squares LMS, Minimum Mean-Square-Error MMSE, Linear Minimum Mean-Square-Error
LMMSE, Maximum Likelihood ML, ... to refine estimators shown previously.
