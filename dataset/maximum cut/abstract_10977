Ultraviolet (UV), optical and near infrared (NIR) observations of the type
IIP supernova (SN) 2007od are presented, covering from the maximum light to the
late phase, allowing to investigate in detail different physical phenomena in
the expanding ejecta. These data turn this object into one of the most peculiar
IIP ever studied. The early light curve of SN 2007od is similar to that of a
bright IIPs with a short plateau, a bright peak (MV = -18 mag), but a very
faint optical light curve at late time. However, with the inclusion of mid
infrared (MIR) observations during the radioactive decay we have estimate a
M(56Ni) ~ 2\times10^-2 M\odot. Modeling the bolometric light curve, ejecta
expansion velocities and black-body temperature, we estimate a total ejected
mass was 5 - 7.5 M\odot with a kinetic energy of at least 0.5 \times 10^51 erg.
The early spectra reveal a boxy H{\alpha} profile and high velocities features
of the Balmer series that suggest interaction between the ejecta and a close
circum-stellar matter (CSM). SN 2007od may be, therefore, an intermediate case
between a Type IIn SN and a typical Type IIP SN. Also late spectra show a clear
evidence of CSM and the presence of dust formed inside the ejecta. The episodes
of mass loss short before explosion, the bright plateau, along with the
relatively small amount of 56Ni and the faint [O I] observed in the nebular
spectra are consistent with a super-asympthotic giant branch (super-AGB)
progenitor (M~9.7 - 11 M\odot).
