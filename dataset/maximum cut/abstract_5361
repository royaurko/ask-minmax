The pt-differential inclusive production cross section of the prompt
charm-strange meson D_s in the rapidity range |y|<0.5 was measured in
proton--proton collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV at the LHC using the ALICE detector.
The analysis was performed on a data sample of 2.98 10^8 events collected with
a minimum-bias trigger. The corresponding integrated luminosity is L_int=4.8
nb^-1. Reconstructing the decay D_s -.> phi pi, with phi -> KK, and its charge
conjugate, about 480 D_s mesons were counted, after selection cuts, in the
transverse momentum range 2<pt<12 GeV/c. The results are compared with the
predictions from models based on perturbative QCD. The ratios of the cross
sections of four D meson species (namely D^0, D^+, D*^+ and D_s) were
determined both as a function of pt and integrated over pt after extrapolating
to full pt range, together with the strangeness suppression factor in charm
fragmentation. The obtained values are found to be compatible within
uncertainties with those measured by other experiments in e+e-, ep and pp
interactions at various centre-of-mass energies.
