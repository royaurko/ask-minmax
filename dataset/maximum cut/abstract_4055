A contrarian is someone who deliberately decides to oppoe the prevailing
choice of others. The Galam model of two state opinion dynamicsincorporates
agent updates by a single step random grouping in which all participants adopt
the opinion of their respective local majority group. The process is repeated
until a stable collective state is reached; the associated dynamics is fast.
Here we show that the introduction of contrarians may give rise to interesting
dynamics generated phases and even to a critical behavior at a contrarian
concentration $a_c$. For $a<a_c$ an ordered phase is generated with a clear cut
majority-minority splitting. By contrast when $a>a_c$ the resulting disordered
phase has no majority: agents keep shifting opinions but no symmetry breaking
(i.e., the appearance of a majority) takes place. Our results are employed to
explain the outcome of the 2000 American presidential elections and that of the
2002 German parliamentary elections. Those events are found to be inevitable.
On this basis the ``hung elections scenario'' is predicted to become a common
occurrence in modern democracies.
