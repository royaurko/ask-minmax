Classical fields counterpart of the ideal Bose gas statistics in a trap is
investigated by performing calculations in the canonical ensemble. There exists
the optimal cut-off which allows to match the full probability distribution of
the condensate population by its classical counterpart. Universal scaling of
that cut-off with temperature and dimensionality is derived.
