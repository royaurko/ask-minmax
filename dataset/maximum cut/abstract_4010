We investigated theoretically the Coulomb drag effect in coupled 2D electron
gases in a wide interval of magnetic field and temperature $ 1/\tau \ll
\omega_c \ll E_F/\hbar$, $T \ll E_F$,
 $\tau$ being intralayer scattering time, $\omega_c$ being the cyclotron
frequency. We show that the quantization of the electron spectrum leads to rich
parametric dependences of drag transresistance on temperature and magnetic
field. This is in contrast to usual resistance. New small energy scales are
found to cut typical excitation energies to values lower than temperature. This
may lead to a linear temperature dependence of transresistance even in a
relatively weak magnetic field and can explain some recent experimental data.
  We present a novel mechanism of Coulomb drag when the current in the active
layer causes a magnetoplasmon wind and the magnetoplasmons are absorbed by the
electrons of the passive layer providing a momentum transfer. We derived
general relations that describe the drag as a result of resonant tunneling of
magnetoplasmons.
