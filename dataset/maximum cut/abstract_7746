Up to two layers of epitaxial graphene have been grown on the Si-face of
two-inch SiC wafers exhibiting room-temperature Hall mobilities up to 1800
cm^2/Vs, measured from ungated, large, 160 micron x 200 micron Hall bars, and
up to 4000 cm^2/Vs, from top-gated, small, 1 micron x 1.5 micron Hall bars. The
growth process involved a combination of a cleaning step of the SiC in a
Si-containing gas, followed by an annealing step in Argon for epitaxial
graphene formation. The structure and morphology of this graphene has been
characterized using AFM, HRTEM, and Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, top-gated
radio frequency field effect transistors (RF-FETs) with a peak cutoff frequency
fT of 100 GHz for a gate length of 240 nm were fabricated using epitaxial
graphene grown on the Si face of SiC that exhibited Hall mobilities up to 1450
cm^2/Vs from ungated Hall bars and 1575 cm^2/Vs from top-gated ones. This is by
far the highest cut-off frequency measured from any kind of graphene.
