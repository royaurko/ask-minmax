Target motion analysis with wideband passive sonar has received much
attention. Maximum likelihood probabilistic data-association (ML-PDA)
represents an asymptotically efficient estimator for deterministic target
motion, and is especially well-suited for low-observable targets; the results
presented here apply to situations with higher signal to noise ratio as well,
including of course the situation of a deterministic target observed via clean
measurements without false alarms or missed detections. Here we study the
inverse problem, namely, how to identify the observing platform (following a
two-leg motion model) from the results of the target estimation process, i.e.
the estimated target state and the Fisher information matrix, quantities we
assume an eavesdropper might intercept. We tackle the problem and we present
observability properties, with supporting simulation results.
