Applying the Darmois-Israel thin shell formalism, we construct static and
dynamic thin shells around traversable wormholes. Firstly, by applying the
cut-and-paste technique we apply a linearized stability analysis to thin-shell
wormholes in the presence of a generic cosmological constant. We find that for
large positive values of the cosmological constant, i.e., the Schwarzschild-de
Sitter solution, the regions of stability significantly increase relatively to
the Schwarzschild case, analyzed by Poisson and Visser. Secondly, we construct
static thin shell solutions by matching an interior wormhole solution to a
vacuum exterior solution at a junction surface. In the spirit of minimizing the
usage of exotic matter we analyze the domains in which the weak and null energy
conditions are satisfied at the junction surface. The characteristics and
several physical properties of the surface stresses are explored, namely, we
determine regions where the sign of tangential surface pressure is positive and
negative (surface tension). An equation governing the behavior of the radial
pressure across the junction surface is deduced. Specific dimensions of the
wormhole, namely, the throat radius and the junction interface radius, are
found by taking into account the traversability conditions, and estimates for
the traversal time and velocity are also determined.
