The area swept out under a one-dimensional Brownian motion till its
first-passage time is analysed using a backward Fokker-Planck technique. We
obtain an exact expression of the area distribution for the zero drift case,
and provide various asymptotic results for the non-zero drift case, emphasising
the critical nature of the behaviour in the limit of vanishing drift. The
results offer important insights into the asymptotic behaviour of the
area-perimeter generating functions in a class of discrete polygons. We also
provide a succinct derivation for the distribution of the maximum displacement
observed till the first-passage time.
