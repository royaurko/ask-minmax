Most statistical software packages implement numerical strategies for
computation of maximum likelihood estimates in random effects models. Little is
known, however, about the algebraic complexity of this problem. For the one-way
layout with random effects and unbalanced group sizes, we give formulas for the
algebraic degree of the likelihood equations as well as the equations for
restricted maximum likelihood estimation. In particular, the latter approach is
shown to be algebraically less complex. The formulas are obtained by studying a
univariate rational equation whose solutions correspond to the solutions of the
likelihood equations. Applying techniques from computational algebra, we also
show that balanced two-way layouts with or without interaction have likelihood
equations of degree four. Our work suggests that algebraic methods allow one to
reliably find global optima of likelihood functions of linear mixed models with
a small number of variance components.
