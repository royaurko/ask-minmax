Immediately after they are born, neutron stars are characterized by an
entropy per baryon of order unity and by the presence of trapped neutrinos. If
the only hadrons in the star are nucleons, these effects slightly reduce the
maximum mass relative to cold, catalyzed matter. However, if negatively charged
particles in the form of hyperons, a kaon condensate, or quarks are also
present, these effects result in an increase in the maximum mass of $\sim
0.2{\rm M}_{\odot}$ compared to that of a cold, neutrino-free star. This could
lead to the delayed formation of a black hole; such a scenario is consistent
with our present knowledge of SN1987A.
