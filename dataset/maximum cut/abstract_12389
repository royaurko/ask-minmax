It has recently been suggested that the quark-gluon plasma formed in
heavy-ion collisions behaves as a nearly ideal fluid. That behavior may be
understood if the quark and antiquark mean-free- paths are very small in the
system, leading to a "sticky molasses" description of the plasma, as advocated
by the Stony Brook group. This behavior may be traced to the fact that there
are relatively low-energy $q\bar{q}$ resonance states in the plasma leading to
very large scattering lengths for the quarks. These resonances have been found
in lattice simulation of QCD using the maximum entropy method (MEM). We have
used a chiral quark model, which provides a simple representation of effects
due to instanton dynamics, to study the resonances obtained using the MEM
scheme. In the present work we use our model to study the optical potential of
a quark in the quark-gluon plasma and calculate the quark mean-free-path. Our
results represent a specific example of the dynamics of the plasma as described
by the Stony Brook group.
