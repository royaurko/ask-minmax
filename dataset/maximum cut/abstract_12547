This paper shows that in intensity correlation measurements there will be
clear and unambiguous signals that new-physics particles are, or aren't,
parabosons. For a parabosonic field in a dominant single-mode, there is a
diagonal P-representation in the "even and odd coherent states" basis. It is
used to analyze zero-time-interval intensity correlations of parabosons in a
maximum-entropic state. As the mean number of parabosons decreases, there is a
monotonic reduction to (2/p) of the constant bosonic ``factor of two''
proportionality of the second-order versus the squared first-order intensity
correlation function.
