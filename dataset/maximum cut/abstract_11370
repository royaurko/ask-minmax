Using a sample of 7 barred spirals from the BIMA Survey of Nearby Galaxies
(SONG), we compare the molecular gas distribution in the bar, to recent massive
star formation activity. In all 7 galaxies, Halpha is offset azimuthally from
the CO on the downstream side. The maximum offset, at the bar ends, ranges from
170-570 pc, with an average of 320 +/- 120 pc. We discuss whether the observed
offsets are consistent with the description of gas flows in bars provided by
the two main classes of models: n-body models and hydrodynamic models. This
