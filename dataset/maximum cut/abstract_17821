We have performed N-body simulations of tidally filling star clusters with a
range of orbits in a Milky Way-like potential to study the effects of orbital
inclination and eccentricity on their structure and evolution. At small
galactocentric distances Rgc, a non-zero inclination results in increased mass
loss rates. Tidal heating and disk shocking, the latter sometimes consisting of
two shocking events as the cluster moves towards and away from the disk, help
remove stars from the cluster. Clusters with inclined orbits at large Rgc have
decreased mass loss rates than the non-inclined case, since the strength the
disk potential decreases with Rgc. Clusters with inclined and eccentric orbits
experience increased tidal heating due to a constantly changing potential,
weaker disk shocks since passages occur at higher Rgc, and an additional tidal
shock at perigalacticon. The effects of orbital inclination decrease with
orbital eccentricity, as a highly eccentric cluster spends the majority of its
lifetime at a large Rgc. The limiting radii of clusters with inclined orbits
are best represented by the rt of the cluster when at its maximum height above
the disk, where the cluster spends the majority of its lifetime and the rate of
change in rt is a minimum. Conversely, the effective radius is independent of
inclination in all cases.
