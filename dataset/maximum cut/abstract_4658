The inclusive B -> Xs l+ l- decay rate in the large q^2 region (q^2 >
m_{\psi'}^2) receives significant nonperturbative corrections. The resulting
uncertainties can be drastically reduced by normalizing the rate to the B -> Xu
l nu rate with the same q^2 cut, which allows for much improved tests of short
distance physics. We calculate this ratio, including the order 1/m_b^3
nonperturbative corrections and the analytically known NNLO perturbative
corrections. Since in the large q^2 region an inclusive measurement may be
feasible via a sum over exclusive states, our results could be useful for
measurements at LHCb and possibly for studies of B -> Xd l+ l-.
