The electronic and thermoelectric properties of one to four monolayers of
MoS$_{2}$, MoSe$_{2}$, WS$_{2}$, and WSe$_{2}$ are calculated. For few layer
thicknesses,the near degeneracies of the conduction band $K$ and $\Sigma$
valleys and the valence band $\Gamma$ and $K$ valleys enhance the n-type and
p-type thermoelectric performance. The interlayer hybridization and energy
level splitting determine how the number of modes within $k_BT$ of a valley
minimum changes with layer thickness. In all cases, the maximum ZT coincides
with the greatest near-degeneracy within $k_BT$ of the band edge that results
in the sharpest turn-on of the density of modes. The thickness at which this
maximum occurs is, in general, not a monolayer. The transition from few layers
to bulk is discussed. Effective masses, energy gaps, power-factors, and ZT
values are tabulated for all materials and layer thicknesses.
