In a finite group G with subgroup H, the Chermak-Delgado measure of H (in G)
is defined as the product of the order of H with the order of the centralizer
of H. The Chermak-Delgado lattice of G, denoted CD(G), is the set of all
subgroups with maximal Chermak-Delgado measure; this set is a sublattice within
the subgroup lattice of G. In this paper we provide an example of a p-group P,
for any prime p, where CD(P) is lattice isomorphic to 2 copies of M_4 (a
quasiantichain of width 2) that are adjoined maximum-to-minimum. We introduce
terminology to describe this structure, called a 2-string of 2-diamonds, and we
also give two constructions for generalizing the example. The first
generalization results in a p-group with Chermak-Delgado lattice that, for any
positive integers n and l, is a 2l-string of n-dimensional cubes adjoined
maximum-to-minimum and the second generalization gives a construction for a
p-group with Chermak-Delgado lattice that is a 2l-string of M_(p+3)
(quasiantichains, each of width p + 1) adjoined maximum-to-minimum.
