A wormhole is constructed by cutting and joining two spacetimes satisfying
the low energy string equations with a dilaton field. In spacetimes described
by the "string metric" the dilaton energy-momentum tensor need not satisfy the
weak or dominant energy conditions. In the cases considered here the dilaton
field violates these energy conditions and is the source of the exotic matter
required to maintain the wormhole. There is also a surface stress-energy, that
must be produced by additional matter, where the spacetimes are joined. It is
shown that wormholes can be constructed for which this additional matter
satisfies the weak and dominant energy conditions, so that it could be a form
of "normal" matter. Charged dilaton wormholes with a coupling between the
dilaton and the electromagnetic field that is more general than in string
theory are also briefly discussed.
