In recent we introduced, developed and established a new concept, model,
methodology and principle for studying human longevity in terms of demographic
basis. We call the new model the "Weon model", which is a general model
modified from the Weibull model with an age-dependent shape parameter to
describe human survival and mortality curves. We demonstrate the application of
the Weon model to the mortality dynamics and the mathematical limit of
longevity (the mortality rate to be mathematically zero, implying a maximum
longevity) in the Section I. The mathematical limit of longevity can be induced
by the mortality dynamics in nature. As a result, we put forward the
complementarity principle, which explains the recent paradoxical trends that
the mathematical limit decreases as the longevity increases, in the Section II.
Our findings suggest that the human longevity can be limited by the
complementarity principle.
