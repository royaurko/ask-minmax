We present images taken with the Wide Field Planetary Camera (WFPC-2) on the
Hubble Space Telescope of 43 quasars selected from the 3CR radio catalog. The
redshift range of the targets is large --- 0.3 < z < 2. These data were taken
in the course of a large program that imaged 267 3CR radio galaxies and quasars
using the HST in "snapshot mode". Each quasar was centered on the Planetary
Camera (PC1) and was imaged through the F702W filter (bandpass similar to
Cousins R), typically for 5 and 10 minutes. Our analysis suggests that the
quasar fuzz contributes from <5% to nearly 100% in the most extreme case (about
20% being typical) of the total light from the quasar, with 16 of the quasars
(~40%) being unresolved according to the analysis of their light profiles (with
only 7 being considered unresolved determined by PSF subtraction of the quasar
images). Most of the host galaxies show twisted, asymmetric, or distorted
isophotes. About 1/4 of the quasar hosts have close (within a few arc seconds)
companions seen in projection and about 1/10 show obvious signs of tidal
interactions with a close companion. We find that these sources exhibit a
tendency for the principal axes of the radio and optical emission to align
similar but perhaps weaker than that observed for radio galaxies.
