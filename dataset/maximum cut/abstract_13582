A two-band Hubbard model is used to describe the band structure and phase
separation (PS) in multiband superconductors, especially in cuprates. We
predict a large peak in the density of states at the Fermi level in the case of
optimum doping, corresponding to the minimum energy difference between the
centers of two hole bands. For strong interband hybridization, a
metal-insulator transition occurs near this optimum doping level. We suggest a
mechanism of PS related to the redistribution of holes between two Hubbard
bands rather than to the usual antiferromagnetic correlations. We show that the
critical superconducting temperature $T_c$ can be about its maximum value
within a wide range of doping levels due to PS.
