We experimentally and theoretically studied a new left-handed (LH) structure
based on a photonic crystal (PC) with a negative refractive index. The
structure consists of triangular array of rectangular dielectric bars with
dielectric constant 9.61. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the
negative refraction and the superlensing phenomena in the microwave regime. The
results show high transmission for our structure for a wide range of incident
angles. Furthermore, surface termination within a specific cut of the structure
excite surface waves at the interface between air and PC and allow the
reconstruction of evanescent waves for a better focus and better transmission.
The normalized average field intensity calculated in both the source and image
planes shows almost the same full width at half maximum for the source and the
focused beam.
