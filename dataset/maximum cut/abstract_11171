We describe an accurate, one-dimensional, spherically symmetric, Lagrangian
hydrodynamics/gravity code, designed to study the effects of radiative cooling
and photo-ionization on the formation of protogalaxies. The code can treat an
arbitrary number of fluid shells (representing baryons) and collisionless
shells (representing cold dark matter). As a test of the code, we reproduce
analytic solutions for the pulsation behavior of a polytrope and for the
self-similar collapse of a spherically symmetric, cosmological perturbation. In
this paper, we concentrate on the effects of radiative cooling, examining the
ability of collapsing perturbations to cool within the age of the universe. In
contrast to some studies based on order-of- magnitude estimates, we find that
cooling arguments alone cannot explain the sharp upper cutoff observed in the
galaxy luminosity function.
