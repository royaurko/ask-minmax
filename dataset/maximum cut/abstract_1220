The Ultra-high energy cosmic ray energy spectrum summarized by the AGASA
collaboration indicates clearly that the cosmic ray spectrum extends well
beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cut-off at \sim 5 x 10^19 eV.
Furthermore, despite the small number statistics involved, some structure in
the spectrum may be emerging. Using numerical simulations, it is demonstrated
in the present work that these features are consistent with a spatial
distribution of sources that follows the distribution of luminous matter in the
local Universe. Therefore, from this point of view, there is no need for a
second high-energy component of cosmic rays dominating the spectrum beyond the
GZK cut-off.
