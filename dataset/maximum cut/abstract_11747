We study two superconducting systems using the Landau-Ginzburg equations. The
first is a superconducting half-space with an applied magnetic field parallel
to the surface. We calculate the maximum applied field that still supports
superconductivity in the material by solving the Landau-Ginzburg equations
analytically in asymptotic regimes of the Landau-Ginzburg parameter, kappa.
These results are then checked against numerical studies.
  The other system is a thin, current-carrying strip. Here we do the first
systematic study of nucleation of superconductivity in a normal strip and of
the motion of a normal-superconducting interface in the presence of a current.
This dissipative system requires solving the time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg
equations analytically and numerically.
