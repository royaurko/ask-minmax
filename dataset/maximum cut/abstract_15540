Off-stoichiometric alloys based on Ni 2 MnIn have drawn attention due to the
coupled first order magnetic and structural transformations, and the large
magnetocaloric entropy associated with the transformations. Here we describe
calorimetric and magnetic studies of four compositions. The results provide a
direct measure of entropy changes contributions including at the first-order
phase transitions, and thereby a determination of the maximum field-induced
entropy change corresponding to the giant magnetocaloric effect. We find a
large excess entropy change, attributed to magneto-elastic coupling, but only
in compositions with no ferromagnetic order in the high-temperature austenite
phase. Furthermore, a molecular field model corresponding to antiferromagnetism
of the low-temperature phases is in good agreement, and nearly independent of
composition, despite significant differences in overall magnetic response of
these materials.
