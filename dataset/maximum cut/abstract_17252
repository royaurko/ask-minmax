Monte Carlo simulations using entropic sampling to estimate the number of
configurations of a given energy are a valuable alternative to traditional
methods. We introduce {\it tomographic} entropic sampling, a scheme which uses
multiple studies, starting from different regions of configuration space, to
yield precise estimates of the number of configurations over the {\it full
range} of energies, {\it without} dividing the latter into subsets or windows.
Applied to the Ising model on the square lattice, the method yields the
critical temperature to an accuracy of about 0.01%, and critical exponents to
1% or better. Predictions for systems sizes L=10 - 160, for the temperature of
the specific heat maximum, and of the specific heat at the critical
temperature, are in very close agreement with exact results. For the Ising
model on the simple cubic lattice the critical temperature is given to within
0.003% of the best available estimate; the exponent ratios $\beta/\nu$ and
$\gamma/\nu$ are given to within about 0.4% and 1%, respectively, of the
literature values. In both two and three dimensions, results for the {\it
antiferromagnetic} critical point are fully consistent with those of the
ferromagnetic transition. Application to the lattice gas with nearest-neighbor
exclusion on the square lattice again yields the critical chemical potential
and exponent ratios $\beta/\nu$ and $\gamma/\nu$ to good precision.
