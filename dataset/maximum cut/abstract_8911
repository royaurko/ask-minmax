A general protocol in Quantum Information and Communication relies in the
ability of producing, transmitting and reconstructing, in general, qunits. In
this letter we show for the first time the experimental implementation of these
three basic steps on a pure state in a three dimensional space, by means of the
orbital angular momentum of the photons. The reconstruction of the qutrit is
performed with tomographic techniques and a Maximum-Likelihood estimation
method. In this way we also demonstrate that we can perform any transformation
in the three dimensional space.
