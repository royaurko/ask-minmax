An error occurred in the computation of a gradient in our paper entitled
"Blind maximum likelihood separation of a linear-quadratic mixture", presented
in ICA'2004. The equations (20) in Appendix and (17) in the text were not
correct. The current paper presents the correct version of these equations.
