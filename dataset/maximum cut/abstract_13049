We propose a new framework for dependence structure learning via copula.
Copula is a statistical theory on dependence and measurement of association.
Graphical models are considered as a type of special case of copula families,
named product copula. In this paper, a nonparametric algorithm for copula
estimation is presented. Then a Chow-Liu like method based on dependence
measure via copula is proposed to estimate maximum spanning product copula with
only bivariate dependence relations. The advantage of the framework is that
learning with empirical copula focuses only on dependence relations among
random variables, without knowing the properties of individual variables.
Another advantage is that copula is a universal model of dependence and
therefore the framework based on it can be generalized to deal with a wide
range of complex dependence relations. Experiments on both simulated data and
real application data show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
