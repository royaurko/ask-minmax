We consider graviton-induced Bremsstrahlung at future e^+e^- colliders in
both the ADD and RS models, with emphasis on the photon perpendicular momentum
and angular distribution. The photon spectrum is shown to be harder than in the
Standard Model, and there is an enhancement for photons making large angles
with respect to the beam. In the ADD scenario, the excess at large photon
perpendicular momenta should be measurable for values of the cut-off up to
about twice times the c.m. energy. In the RS scenario, radiative return to
graviton resonances below the c.m. energy can lead to large enhancements of the
cross section.
