Let lambda_s(n) denote the maximum length of a Davenport-Schinzel sequence of
order s on n symbols. For s=3 it is known that lambda_3(n) = Theta(n alpha(n))
(Hart and Sharir, 1986). For general s>=4 there are almost-tight upper and
lower bounds, both of the form n * 2^poly(alpha(n)) (Agarwal, Sharir, and Shor,
1989). Our first result is an improvement of the upper-bound technique of
Agarwal et al. We obtain improved upper bounds for s>=6, which are tight for
even s up to lower-order terms in the exponent. More importantly, we also
present a new technique for deriving upper bounds for lambda_s(n). With this
new technique we: (1) re-derive the upper bound of lambda_3(n) <= 2n alpha(n) +
O(n sqrt alpha(n)) (first shown by Klazar, 1999); (2) re-derive our own new
upper bounds for general s; and (3) obtain improved upper bounds for the
generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences considered by Adamec, Klazar, and
Valtr (1992). Regarding lower bounds, we show that lambda_3(n) >= 2n alpha(n) -
O(n), and therefore, the coefficient 2 is tight. We also present a simpler
version of the construction of Agarwal, Sharir, and Shor that achieves the
known lower bounds for even s>=4.
