The linear and nonlinear evolution of magnetic reconnection in collisionless
high-temperature plasmas with a strong guide field is analyzed on the basis of
a two-dimensional gyrofluid model. The linear growth rate of the reconnecting
instability is compared to analytical calculations over the whole spectrum of
linearly unstable wave numbers. In the strongly unstable regime (large \Delta
'), the nonlinear evolution of the reconnecting instability is found to undergo
two distinctive acceleration phases separated by a stall phase in which the
instantaneous growth rate decreases. The first acceleration phase is caused by
the formation of strong electric fields close to the X-point due to ion
gyration, while the second acceleration phase is driven by the development of
an open Petschek-like configuration due to both ion and electron temperature
effects. Furthermore, the maximum instantaneous growth rate is found to
increase dramatically over its linear value for decreasing diffusion layers.
This is a consequence of the fact that the peak instantaneous growth rate
becomes weakly dependent on the microscopic plasma parameters if the diffusion
region thickness is sufficiently smaller than the equilibrium magnetic field
scale length. When this condition is satisfied, the peak reconnection rate
asymptotes to a constant value.
