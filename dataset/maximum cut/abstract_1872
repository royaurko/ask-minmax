Zero-range processes with decreasing jump rates exhibit a condensation
transition, where a positive fraction of all particles condenses on a single
lattice site when the total density exceeds a critical value. We study the
onset of condensation, i.e. the behaviour of the maximum occupation number
after adding or subtracting a subextensive excess mass of particles at the
critical density. We establish a law of large numbers for the excess mass
fraction in the maximum, which turns out to jump from zero to a positive value
at a critical scale. Our results also include distributional limits for the
fluctuations of the maximum, which change from standard extreme value
statistics to Gaussian when the density crosses the critical point.
Fluctuations in the bulk are also covered, showing that the mass outside the
maximum is distributed homogeneously. In summary, we identify the detailed
behaviour at the critical scale including sub-leading terms, which provides a
full understanding of the crossover from sub- to supercritical behaviour.
