Discrete-time switched linear systems where switchings are governed by a
digraph are considered. The minimum (or average) dwell time that guarantees the
asymptotic stability can be computed by calculating the maximum cycle ratio (or
maximum cycle mean) of a doubly weighted digraph where weights depend on the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of subsystem matrices. The graph-based method is
applied to systems with defective subsystem matrices using Jordan
decomposition. In the case of bimodal switched systems scaling algorithms that
minimizes the condition number can be used to give a better minimum (or
average) dwell time estimates.
