AIC is commonly used for model selection but the precise value of AIC has no
direct interpretation. We are interested in quantifying a difference of risks
between two models. This may be useful for both an explanatory point of view or
for prediction, where a simpler model may be preferred if it does nearly as
well as a more complex model. The difference of risks can be interpreted by
linking the risks with relative errors in the computation of probabilities and
looking at the values obtained for simple models. A scale of values going from
negligible to large is proposed. We propose a normalization of a difference of
Akaike criteria for estimating the difference of expected Kullback-Leibler
risks between maximum likelihood estimators of the distribution in two
different models. The variability of this statistic can be estimated. Thus, an
interval can be constructed which contains the true difference of expected
Kullback-Leibler risks with a pre-specified probability. A simulation study
shows that the method works and it is illustrated on two examples. The first is
a study of the relationship between body-mass index and depression in elderly
people. The second is the choice between models of HIV dynamics, where one
model makes the distinction between activated CD4+ T lymphocytes and the other
does not.
