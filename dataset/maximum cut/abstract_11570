We present the transient nature of INTEGRAL source IGR J17285-2922,
identified from a single period of activity during an IBIS/ISGRI Galactic
Centre Deep Exposure in September 2003. The source has a maximum detection
significance of 14 sigma in the 20-100 keV energy range and exhibits a flux of
6.5 mCrab before it moves out of the ISGRI field of view. The source is visible
to at least 150 keV and its spectrum can be fit with a power law slope of
Gamma=2.1+/-0.17; a more physical model could not be fit due to poor
statistics. Detected characteristics are consistent with the source being a
Galactic low-mass X-ray binary harbouring a black hole or neutron star.
