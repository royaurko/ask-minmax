To investigate the stability of the protoneutron stars in their early
evolution, the minimum gravitational mass plays a fundamental role. This
quantity depends upon the temperature profile assumed. We study within a static
approach the stability of a protoneutron star. In particular we focus on a
suitable temperature profile suggested by dynamical calculations. We consider a
protoneutron star as composed of an isothermal core and an isentropic outer
part. To describe physical properties of the interior we employ a
microscopically derived equation of state for nuclear matter. For the outer
part we employ the Lattimer-Swesty equation of state. The global structure is
studied. The assumed temperature profile turns out to give a range of stability
which supports temperature values in line with those coming from dynamical
calculations. The maximum mass instead depends only upon the equation of state
employed.
