We present optical and infrared observations of the unusual Type Ia supernova
(SN) 2004eo. The light curves and spectra closely resemble those of the
prototypical SN 1992A, and the luminosity at maximum (M_B = -19.08) is close to
the average for a SN Ia. However, the ejected 56Ni mass derived by modelling
the bolometric light curve (about 0.45 solar masses) lies near the lower limit
of the 56Ni mass distribution observed in normal SNe Ia. Accordingly, SN 2004eo
shows a relatively rapid post-maximum decline in the light curve (Delta m_(B) =
1.46), small expansion velocities in the ejecta, and a depth ratio Si II 5972 /
Si II 6355 similar to that of SN 1992A. The physical properties of SN 2004eo
cause it to fall very close to the boundary between the faint, low velocity
gradient, and high velocity gradient subgroups proposed by Benetti et al.
(2005). Similar behaviour is seen in a few other SNe Ia. Thus, there may in
fact exist a few SNe Ia with intermediate physical properties.
