In this thesis we examine the method of counting $B\overline{B}$ events
produced in the BaBar experiment. The original method was proposed in 2000, but
improvements to track reconstruction and our understanding of the detector
since that date make it appropriate to revisit the $B$ Counting method. We
propose a new set of cuts designed to minimize the sensitivity to time-varying
backgrounds. We find the new method counts $B\overline{B}$ events with an
associated systematic uncertainty of $\pm 0.6%
