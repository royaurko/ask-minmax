A step-by-step approach is followed to study cosmic structures in the context
of Brans-Dicke theory with positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and
parameter $\omega$. First, it is shown that regular stationary black-hole
solutions have necessarily constant Brans-Dicke field $\phi$, can exist only
for $\omega=\infty$, and hence coincide with the General Relativity ones.
Generalizations of the theory in order to evade this black-hole no-hair theorem
are presented. It is also shown perturbatively, that in the absence of the
stationary cosmological horizon, black-holes exist with non-trivial
$\phi-$hair. Even more importantly, it is shown next, that the presence of a
stationary cosmological event horizon rules out any regular spherical
stationary solution, appropriate for the description of a star. Thus, to
describe a star one has to assume deviation from de Sitter asymptotics. Under
this assumption generic cosmic structures are studied perturbatively and is
shown that only for $\omega>0$ or $\omega\lesssim -5$ their predicted maximum
sizes are consistent with observations.
