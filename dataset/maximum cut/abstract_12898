We study the public goods game in the noisy case by considering the players
with inhomogeneous activity teaching on a square lattice. It is shown that the
introduction of the inhomogeneous activity of teaching of the players can
remarkably promote cooperation. By investigating the effects of noise on
cooperative behavior in detail, we find that the variation of cooperator
density $\rho_C$ with the noise parameter $\kappa$ displays several different
behaviors: $\rho_C$ monotonically increases (decreases) with $\kappa$; $\rho_C$
firstly increases (decreases) with $\kappa$ and then it decreases (increases)
monotonically after reaching its maximum (minimum) value, which depends on the
amount of the multiplication factor $r$, on whether the system is homogeneous
or inhomogeneous, and on whether the adopted updating is synchronous or
asynchronous. These results imply that the noise plays an important and
nontrivial role in the evolution of cooperation.
