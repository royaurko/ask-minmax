We compute the branching ratios for the rare top quark decays t to c gamma
and t to c Z mediated by effective flavor changing neutral couplings at the
next-to-leading order in QCD including the effects due to operator mixing.
After re-suming contributions of order [alpha_s log (Lambda / m_t)]^n, where
Lambda is the scale at which the effective operators are generated, at leading
log level using renormalization group methods, we compute finite matrix element
corrections and study the effects of experimental kinematic cuts on the
extracted branching ratios. We find that the t to c gamma decay can be used to
probe also the effective operators mediating t to c g processes, since these
can naturaly contribute 10% or more to the radiative decay. Conversely, any
experimental signal of t to c g would indicate a natural lower bound on t to
cZ, gamma.
