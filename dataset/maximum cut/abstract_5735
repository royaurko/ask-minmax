The schematic CERES method [8] is a recently developed method of cut
elimination for proof schemata, that is a sequence of proofs with a recursive
construction. Proof schemata can be thought of as a way to circumvent adding an
induction rule to the LK-calculus. In this work, we formalize a schematic
version of the infinitary pigeonhole principle, which we call the
Non-injectivity Assertion schema (NiA-schema), in the LKS-calculus [8], and
analyse the clause set schema extracted from the NiA-schema using some of the
structure provided by the schematic CERES method. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first appli- cation of the constructs built for proof analysis of
proof schemata to a mathematical argument since its publication. We discuss the
role of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) in schematic proof analysis, as well as
the shortcomings of the schematic CERES method concerning the formalization of
the NiA-schema, namely, the expressive power of the schematic resolution
calculus. We conclude with a discussion concerning the usage of ATP in
schematic proof analysis.
