Decentralized multiple access channels where each transmitter wants to
selfishly maximize his transmission energy-efficiency are considered.
Transmitters are assumed to choose freely their power control policy and
interact (through multiuser interference) several times. It is shown that the
corresponding conflict of interest can have a predictable outcome, namely a
finitely or discounted repeated game equilibrium. Remarkably, it is shown that
this equilibrium is Pareto-efficient under reasonable sufficient conditions and
the corresponding decentralized power control policies can be implemented under
realistic information assumptions: only individual channel state information
and a public signal are required to implement the equilibrium strategies.
Explicit equilibrium conditions are derived in terms of minimum number of game
stages or maximum discount factor. Both analytical and simulation results are
provided to compare the performance of the proposed power control policies with
those already existing and exploiting the same information assumptions namely,
those derived for the one-shot and Stackelberg games.
