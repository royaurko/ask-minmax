We show that the maximum number of convex polygons in a triangulation of $n$
points in the plane is $O(1.5029^n)$. This improves an earlier bound of
$O(1.6181^n)$ established by van Kreveld, L\"offler, and Pach (2012) and almost
matches the current best lower bound of $\Omega(1.5028^n)$ due to the same
contributors. Given a planar straight-line graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, we show how
to compute efficiently the number of convex polygons in $G$.
