Let us call as "Gaussian Gibbs energy" the quadratic form appearing in the
maximum likelihood (ML) criterion when fitting a zero-mean multidimensional
Gaussian distribution to one realization. We consider a continuous-time
Gaussian process $Z$ which belongs to the Mat\'ern family with known
"regularity" index $\nu \geq 1/2$. For estimating the range and the variance of
$Z$ from observations on a "dense" regular grid, corrupted by a Gaussian white
noise of known variance, we propose two simple estimating functions based on
the conditional Gibbs energy mean (CGEM) and the empirical variance (EV). We
show that the ratio of the large sample mean squared error of the resulting
CGEM-EV estimate of the range-parameter to the one of its ML estimate, and the
analog ratio for the variance-parameter, both converge (when the grid-step
tends to 0) toward a constant, only function of $\nu$, surprisingly close to 1
provided $\nu$ is not too large. This latter condition on $\nu$ has not to be
imposed to obtain the convergence to 1 of the analog ratio for the
microergodic-parameter. Possible extensions of this approach, which may benefit
from very easy numerical implementations, are briefly discussed.
