In this work, we explore asymptotically flat charged thin-shell wormholes of
third order Lovelock gravity in higher dimensions, taking into account the
cut-and-paste technique. Using the generalized junction conditions, we
determine the energy-momentum tensor of these solutions on the shell, and
explore the issue of the energy conditions and the amount of normal matter that
supports these thin-shell wormholes. Our analysis shows that for negative
second order and positive third-order Lovelock coefficients, there are
thin-shell wormhole solutions that respect the weak energy condition. In this
case, the amount of normal matter increases as the third-order Lovelock
coefficient decreases. We also find novel solutions which possess specific
regions where the energy conditions are satisfied for the case of a positive
second order and negative third-order Lovelock coefficients. Finally, a linear
stability analysis in higher dimensions around the static solutions is carried
out. Considering a specific cold equation of state, we find a wide range of
stability regions.
