The aim of this work was to simulate the behaviour of hip prostheses under
mechanical shocks. When hip joint is replaced by prosthesis, during the swing
phase of the leg, a microseparation between the prosthetic head and the cup
could occur. Two different sizes of femoral heads were studied: 28 and 32 mm
diameter, made, respectively, in alumina and zirconia. The shock-induced stress
was determined numerically using finite element analysis (FEA), Abaqus
software. The influence of inclination, force, material, and microseparation
was studied. In addition, an algorithm was developed from a probabilistic
model, Todinov's approach, to predict lifetime of head and cup. Simulations
showed maximum tensile stresses were reached on the cup's surfaces near to rim.
The worst case was the cup-head mounted at 30^{\circ}. All simulations and
tests showed bulk zirconia had a greater resistance to shocks than bulk
alumina. The probability of failure could be bigger than 0.9 when a porosity
greater than 0.7% vol. is present in the material. Simulating results showed
good agreement with experimental results. The tests and simulations are
promising for predicting the lifetime of ceramic prostheses.
