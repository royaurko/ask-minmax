In a recent paper \cite{ft} a new powerful method to calculate Feynman diagrams
was proposed. It consists in setting up a Taylor series expansion in the
external momenta squared. The Taylor coefficients are obtained from the
original diagram by differentiation and putting the external momenta equal to
zero. It was demonstrated that by a certain conformal mapping and subsequent
resummation by means of Pad\'{e} approximants it is possible to obtain high
precision numerical values of the Feynman integrals in the whole cut plane. The
real problem in this approach is the calculation of the Taylor coefficients for
the arbitrary mass case. Since their analytic evaluation by means of CA
packages uses enormous CPU and yields very lengthy expressions, we develop an
algorithm with the aim to set up a FORTRAN package for their numerical
evaluation. This development is guided by the possibilities offered by the
formulae manipulating language FORM \cite{FORM}.
