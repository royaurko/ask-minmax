We report the measurements of in-plane resistivity, Hall effect, and Nernst
effect in Zn doped YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ epitaxial thin films grown
by pulsed laser deposition technique. The pseudogap temperature, $T^*$,
determined from the temperature dependence of resistivity, does not change
significantly with Zn doping. Meanwhile the onset temperature ($T^{\nu}$) of
anomalous Nernst signal above $T_{c0}$, which is interpreted as evidence for
vortex-like excitations, decreases sharply as the superconducting transition
temperature $T_{c0}$ does. A significant decrease in the maximum of vortex
Nernst signal in mixed state is also observed, which is consistent with the
scenario that Zn impurities cause a decrease in the superfluid density and
therefore suppress the superconductivity. The phase diagram of $T^*$,
$T^{\nu}$, and $T_{c0}$ versus Zn content is presented and discussed.
