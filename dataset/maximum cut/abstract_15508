Density functional calculations have performed to study the band structures
of $Bi_2Te_3$-related binary ($Bi_2Te_3$, $Sb_2Te_3$, $Bi_2Se_3$, and
$Sb_2Se_3$) and $Sb$/$Se$ doped ternary compounds [$(Bi_{1-x}Sb_x)_2Te_3$ and
$Bi_2(Te_{1-y}Se_y)_3$]. It is found that the band gap can be increased by $Sb$
doping and it is monotonically increased by $Se$ doping. In ternary compounds,
the change of the conduction band structure is more significant, as compared to
the change of valence band. The band degeneracy of valence band maximum is
maintained to be 6 in binaries and ternaries. However, as going from $Bi_2Te_3$
to $Sb_2Te_3$ ($Bi_2Se_3$), the degeneracy of conduction band minimum is
reduced from 6 to 2(1). Based on the results of band structures, we suggest the
suitable stoichiometries of ternary compounds for high thermoelectric
performance.
