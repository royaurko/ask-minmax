We prove three strong approximation theorems for the `supermarket' or `join
the shortest queue' model -- a law of large numbers, a jump process
approximation and a central limit theorem. The estimates are carried through
rather explicitly. This allows us to estimate each of the infinitely many
components of the process in its own scale and to exhibit a cut-off in the set
of active components which grows slowly with the number of servers.
