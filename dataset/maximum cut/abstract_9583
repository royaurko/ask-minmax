Mixtures of factor analyzers are becoming more and more popular in the area
of model based clustering of high-dimensional data. According to the likelihood
approach in data modeling, it is well known that the unconstrained
log-likelihood function may present spurious maxima and singularities and this
is due to specific patterns of the estimated covariance structure, when their
determinant approaches 0. To reduce such drawbacks, in this paper we introduce
a procedure for the parameter estimation of mixtures of factor analyzers, which
maximizes the likelihood function in a constrained parameter space. We then
analyze and measure its performance, compared to the usual non-constrained
approach, via some simulations and applications to real data sets.
