The standard efficient testing procedures in the Generalized Inverse Gaussian
(GIG) family (also known as Halphen Type A family) are likelihood ratio tests,
hence rely on Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation of the three parameters of the
GIG. The particular form of GIG densities, involving modified Bessel functions,
prevents in general from a closed-form expression for ML estimators, which are
obtained at the expense of complex numerical approximation methods. On the
contrary, Method of Moments (MM) estimators allow for concise expressions, but
tests based on these estimators suffer from a lack of efficiency compared to
likelihood ratio tests. This is why, in recent years, trade-offs between ML and
MM estimators have been proposed, resulting in simpler yet not completely
efficient estimators and tests. In the present paper, we do not propose such a
trade-off but rather an optimal combination of both methods, our tests
inheriting efficiency from an ML-like construction and simplicity from the MM
estimators of the nuisance parameters. This goal shall be reached by attacking
the problem from a new angle, namely via the Le Cam methodology. Besides
providing simple efficient testing methods, the theoretical background of this
methodology further allows us to write out explicitly power expressions for our
tests. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows that, also at small sample sizes,
our simpler procedures do at least as good as the complex likelihood ratio
tests. We conclude the paper by applying our findings on two real-data sets.
