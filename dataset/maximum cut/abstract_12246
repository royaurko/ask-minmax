We compute gravitational radiation waveforms, spectra and energies for a
point particle of mass $m_0$ falling from rest at radius $r_0$ into a
Schwarzschild hole of mass $M$. This radiation is found to lowest order in
$(m_0/M)$ with the use of a Laplace transform. In contrast with numerical
relativity results for head-on collisions of equal-mass holes, the radiated
energy is found not to be a monotonically increasing function of initial
separation; there is a local radiated-energy maximum at $r_0\approx4.5M$. The
present results, along with results for infall from infinity, provide a
complete catalog of waveforms and spectra for particle infall. We give a
representative sample from that catalog and an interesting observation: Unlike
the simple spectra for other head-on collisions (either of particle and hole,
or of equal mass holes) the spectra for $\infty>r_0>\sim5M$ show a series of
evenly spaced bumps. A simple explanation is given for this. Lastly, our energy
vs. $r_0$ results are compared with approximation methods used elsewhere, for
small and for large initial separation.
