We consider the average distance between four bases in dimension six. The
distance between two orthonormal bases vanishes when the bases are the same,
and the distance reaches its maximal value of unity when the bases are
unbiased. We perform a numerical search for the maximum average distance and
find it to be strictly smaller than unity. This is strong evidence that no four
mutually unbiased bases exist in dimension six. We also provide a two-parameter
family of three bases which, together with the canonical basis, reach the
numerically-found maximum of the average distance, and we conduct a detailed
study of the structure of the extremal set of bases.
