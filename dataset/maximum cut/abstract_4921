Motivated by recently progresses in the study of BCFW recursion relation with
nonzero boundary contributions for theories with scalars and
fermions\cite{Bofeng}, in this short note we continue the study of boundary
contributions of gauge theory with the bad deformation. Unlike cases with
scalars or fermions, it is hard to use Feynman diagrams directly to obtain
boundary contributions, thus we propose another method based on the ${\cal
N}=4$ SYM theory. Using this method, we are able to write down a useful
on-shell recursion relation to calculate boundary contributions from related
theories. Our result shows the cut-constructibility of gauge theory even with
the bad deformation in some generalized sense.
