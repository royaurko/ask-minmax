Unitarity cuts of enhanced Pomeron diagrams are analyzed in the framework of
the Reggeon Field Theory. Assuming the validity of the
Abramovskii-Gribov-Kancheli cutting rules, we derive a complete set of cut
non-loop enhanced graphs and observe important cancellations between certain
sub-classes of the latter. We demonstrate also how the present method can be
generalized to take into consideration Pomeron loop contributions.
