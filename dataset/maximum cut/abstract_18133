We present observations of a new phenomenon in pulsating white dwarf stars:
large-amplitude outbursts at timescales much longer than the pulsation periods.
The cool (Teff = 11,010 K), hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating white dwarf PG
1149+057 was observed nearly continuously for more than 78.8 d by the extended
Kepler mission in K2 Campaign 1. The target showed 10 outburst events,
recurring roughly every 8 d and lasting roughly 15 hr, with maximum flux
excursions up to 45% in the Kepler bandpass. We demonstrate that the outbursts
affect the pulsations and therefore must come from the white dwarf.
Additionally, we argue that these events are not magnetic reconnection flares,
and are most likely connected to the stellar pulsations and the relatively deep
surface convection zone. PG 1149+057 is now the second cool pulsating white
dwarf to show this outburst phenomenon, after the first variable white dwarf
observed in the Kepler mission, KIC 4552982. Both stars have the same effective
temperature, within the uncertainties, and are among the coolest known
pulsating white dwarfs of typical mass. These outbursts provide fresh
observational insight into the red edge of the DAV instability strip and the
eventual cessation of pulsations in cool white dwarfs.
