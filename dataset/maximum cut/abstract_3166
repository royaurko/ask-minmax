A parameter estimation problem is considered for a diagonaliazable stochastic
evolution equation using a finite number of the Fourier coefficients of the
solution. The equation is driven by additive noise that is white in space and
fractional in time with the Hurst parameter $H\geq 1/2$.
  The objective is to study asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood
estimator as the number of the Fourier coefficients increases. A necessary and
sufficient condition for consistency and asymptotic normality is presented in
terms of the eigenvalues of the operators in the equation.
