The reaction matrix of a cavity with attached waveguides connects scattering
properties to properties of a corresponding closed billiard for which the
waveguides are cut off by straight walls. On the one hand this matrix is
directly related to the S-matrix, on the other hand it can be expressed by a
spectral sum over all eigenfunctions of the closed system. However, in the
physically relevant situation where these eigenfunctions vanish on the
impenetrable boundaries of the closed billiard, the spectral sum for the
reaction matrix, as it was used before, fails to converge and does not reliably
reproduce the scattering properties. We derive here a convergent representation
of the reaction matrix in terms of eigenmodes satisfying Dirichlet boundary
conditions and demonstrate its validity in the rectangular and the Sinai
billiards.
