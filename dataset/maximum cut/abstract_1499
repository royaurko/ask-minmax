We compute the almost-sure Hausdorff dimension of the double points of
chordal SLE_kappa for kappa > 4, confirming a prediction of Duplantier-Saleur
(1989) for the contours of the FK model. We also compute the dimension of the
cut points of chordal SLE_kappa for kappa > 4 as well as analogous dimensions
for the radial and whole-plane SLE_kappa(rho) processes for kappa > 0. We
derive these facts as consequences of a more general result in which we compute
the dimension of the intersection of two flow lines of the formal vector field
e^{ih/chi}, where h is a Gaussian free field and chi > 0, of different angles
with each other and with the domain boundary.
