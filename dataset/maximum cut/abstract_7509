Determining the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking will be one of the
primary functions of high energy colliders. We point out that most Higgs boson
searches pursued at hadron colliders require Yukawa interactions either in the
production or the decay of a Higgs boson. We propose a trilepton Higgs boson
search based only upon the gauge interactions of the Higgs. This strategy can
be utilized successfully for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson as well as
non-standard Higgs bosons which break electroweak symmetry but have little to
do with fermion mass generation. The trileptons come from Wh production
followed by Wh -> WWW^(*) -> 3l decays. A SM Higgs trilepton signal would be
difficult to detect at the Tevatron collider: with 100 fb^{-1} of data, only a
$3\sigma$ signal above background can be achieved after cuts if 140 GeV < mh <
175 GeV. Some discrimination of signal over background can be gained by
analyzing the opposite sign dilepton pT distributions. At the LHC with 30 (100)
fb^{-1} a clear discovery above the $5\sigma$ level is possible for a Higgs
mass in the range 140-185 (125-200) GeV. Prospects for a trilepton Higgs
discovery are greatly improved for models with non-standard Higgs sectors where
a Higgs boson couples preferentially to vector bosons rather than to fermions.
