PKS 2155-304 was observed with BeppoSAX in November 1997 for 64 ksec (total
elapsed time 33.5 hours) and, for the first time, simultaneously in gamma-rays
with EGRET on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory and with the ground based
TeV telescope CANGAROO, during a phase of high brightness in the X-ray band.
The LECS and MECS light curves show a pronounced flare (with an excursion of a
factor 3.5 between min and max), with evidence of spectral hardening at maximum
intensity. The source is weakly detected by the PDS in the 12-100 keV band with
no significant evidence of variability. The broad band X-ray data from Beppo
SAX are compared with the gamma-ray results and discussed in the framework of
homogenous synchrotron self Compton models.
