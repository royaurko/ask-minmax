One of severe limits of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) in future applications is
that zigzag GNRs (ZGNRs) are gapless, so cannot be used in field effect
transistors (FETs). In this paper, using tight-binding approach and first
principles method, we derived and proved a general edge (boundary) condition
for the opening of a significant bandgap in ZGNRs with defective edge
structures. The proposed semiconducting GNRs have some interesting properties
including the one that they can be embedded and integrated in a large piece of
graphene without the need of completely cutting them out. We also demonstrated
a new type of high-performance all-ZGNR FET.
