The Higgs boson may decay predominantly into a hidden sector, producing
lepton jets instead of the standard Higgs signatures. We propose a search
strategy for such a signal at hadron colliders. A promising channel is the
associated production of the Higgs with a Z or W, where the dominant background
is Z or W plus QCD jets. The lepton jets can be discriminated from QCD jets by
cutting on the electromagnetic fraction and charge ratio. The former is the
fraction of jet energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter and the
latter is the ratio of energy carried by charged particles to the
electromagnetic energy. We use a Monte Carlo description of detector response
to estimate QCD rejection efficiencies of order 10^-3 per jet. The expected
Higgs mass reach is about 155 GeV at the Tevatron with 10 fb^-1 of data and
about 135 GeV at the 7 TeV LHC with 1 fb^-1.
