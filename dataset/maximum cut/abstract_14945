We report on the firm detection of a cyclotron resonance scattering feature
(CRSF) in the X-ray spectrum of the Be X-ray binary pulsar, GRO J1008-57,
achieved by the Suzaku Hard X-ray Detector during a giant outburst which was
detected by the MAXI Gas Slit Camera in 2012 November. The Suzaku observation
was carried out on 2012 November 20, outburst maximum when the X-ray flux
reached $\sim 0.45$ Crab in 4-10 keV, which corresponds to a luminosity of $1.1
\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in 0.5--100 keV at 5.8 kpc. The obtained broadband
X-ray spectrum from 0.5 keV to 118 keV revealed a significant absorption
feature, considered as the fundamental CRSF, at $\sim 76$ keV. This
unambiguously reconfirm the previously suggested $\sim$ 80 keV spectral feature
in GRO J1008$-$57. The implied surface magnetic field, $6.6\times 10^{12}$ G,
is the highest among binary X-ray pulsars from which CRSFs have ever been
detected.
