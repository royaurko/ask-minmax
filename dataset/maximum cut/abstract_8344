General constraints on fluid velocity divergences for particles in quark
matter are derived from baryon number conservation and enforced electric charge
neutrality. A new oscillation pattern in three-flavor normal quark matter
satisfying these conditions is found and its bulk viscosity is calculated. The
result may have astrophysical implication for maximum rotation frequencies of
compact stars.
