We give a new proof of the following interesting fact recently proved by
Bower and Michael: if a d-dimensional rectangular box can be tiled using
translates of two types of rectangular bricks, then it can also be tiled in the
following way. We can cut the box across one of its sides into two boxes, one
of which can be tiled with the first brick only and the other one with the
second brick. Our proof relies on the Fourier Transform. We also show that no
such result is true for three, or more, types of bricks.
