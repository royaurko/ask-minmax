The nondiagonal generalized vector dominance model (GVDM) of photoabsorption
is elaborated using QCD-motivated picture of the (gamma)-(q,anti q) -
transition and subsequent meson dominated scattering of the (q, anti q)-pair on
the nucleon. The relativistic constituent quark model for a description of the
meson (q, anti q)-wave functionsis used. The meson-nucleon scattering is
calculated in the two-gluon exchange approximation. It is shown that the
destructive interference effects and corresponding cancellations in the
photoabsorption cross section formula are small, so the GVDM predictions are
incorrect if no extra cut-off factors in GVDM formulas are introduced.
