We use high spatial resolution observations and numerical simulations to
study the velocity distribution of solar photospheric magnetic bright points.
The observations were obtained with the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar
Atmosphere instrument at the Dunn Solar Telescope, while the numerical
simulations were undertaken with the MURaM code for average magnetic fields of
200 G and 400 G. We implemented an automated bright point detection and
tracking algorithm on the dataset, and studied the subsequent velocity
characteristics of over 6000 structures, finding an average velocity of
approximately 1 km/s, with maximum values of 7 km/s. Furthermore, merging
magnetic bright points were found to have considerably higher velocities, and
significantly longer lifetimes, than isolated structures. By implementing a new
and novel technique, we were able to estimate the background magnetic flux of
our observational data, which is consistent with a field strength of 400 G.
