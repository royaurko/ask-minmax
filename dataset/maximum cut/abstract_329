We discuss the implications of charged lepton energy cut to the hadronic
invariant mass spectrum in charmless semileptonic B decays. Charged-lepton
energy cut is inevitable in order to remove secondary leptonic events such as b
-> c, tau -> l, and to identify the chaged leptons at detectors experimentally.
We consider three possible lepton energy cuts, E_l^{cuts} = 0.6,1.5,2.3 GeV,
and found that with the most probable cuts E_l^{cut} = 1.5 GeV and M_X^{max} =
1.5~(1.86) GeV, 45 ~ 60 % ~(58 ~ 67 %) of decay events survive. Therefore, B ->
X_u l nu decay events can be efficiently distinguished from B -> X_c l nu decay
events. We also discuss the possible model dependence on the results.
