A new subcarrier combining technique is proposed for MC -CDMA receiver in
mobile Rayleigh fading channel. It exploits the structure formed by repeating
spreading sequences of users on different subcarriers to simultaneously
suppress multiple access interference (MAI) and provide implicit channel
tracking without any knowledge of the channel amplitudes or training sequences.
This is achieved by adaptively weighting each subcarrier in each symbol period
by employing a simple gradient descent algorithm to meet the constant modulus
(CM) criterion with judicious selection of step-size. Improved BER and user
capacity performance are shown with similar complexity in order of O(N)
compared with conventional maximum ratio combining and equal gain combining
techniques even under high channel Doppler rates.
