Boundary impurities are known to dramatically alter certain bulk properties
of 1+1 dimensional strongly correlated systems. The entanglement entropy of a
zero temperature Luttinger liquid bisected by a single impurity is computed
using a novel finite size scaling/bosonization scheme. For a Luttinger liquid
of length 2L and UV cut off, e, the boundary impurity correction (\delta S) to
the bulk logarithmic entanglement entropy (S_{ent} ~ ln(L/e)) scales as \delta
S ~ y ln(L/e), where y is the renormalized impurity coupling constant. In this
way, the bulk entanglement entropy within a region is related to scattering
from the region's boundary. In the repulsive case (g<1), \delta S diverges
(negatively) suggesting that the bulk entropy vanishes. Our results are
consistent with the recent conjecture that entanglement entropy decreases
irreversibly along renormalization group flow.
