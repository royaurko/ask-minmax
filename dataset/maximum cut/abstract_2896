The direct photon radiation from a hot and slightly strong interacting
fireball system of a rich baryon quark-gluon plasma, using the Boltzmann
distribution function for the incoming particles and Bose-Einstein distribution
for gluon and Fermi-Dirac distribution for quark,antiquark and Boltzmann
distribution for gluon are discussed subsequently. The first two distribution
functions are chosen for the photon production of the first case and the last
two functions are considered for the second case of my photon production. The
thermal photon emission rate is found that it is infra-red divergent for the
massless quarks and this divergence in the quark mass is regulated using
different cut-off in the quark mass. However, I remove this divergence using
the technique of Braaten and Pisarski in the thermal mass of the system in my
model of calculation with a coupling parameter of QGP fireball. Thus, the
production rate of the thermal photon is found to be smoothly worked by this
cut-off technique of this model and the result is found to be increasing
function with the increase of the variation in the value of the chemical
potential $\mu $
