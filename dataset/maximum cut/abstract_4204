Relatively light sneutrinos which are experimentally allowed and are not
theoretically disfavoured may significantly affect the currently popular search
strategies for supersymmetric particles by decaying dominantly into an
invisible channel. In certain cases the second lightest neutralino may also
decay invisibly leading to two extra carriers of missing energy (in addition to
the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) ) - the virtual LSPs (VLSPs). The
lighter charginos which would be produced in pairs with reasonably large
cross-sections at TEVATRON energies, decay dominantly into the hadronically
quiet lepton + sneutrino ($\not{E_T}$ ) modes with large branching ratios
leading to interesting unlike sign dilepton events which are not swamped by the
standard model background. The kinematical cuts required to eliminate the
backgrounds from WW, Drell-Yan and $\tau$ pair production are discussed in
detail. With 100 $pb^{-1}$ luminosity 10 - 35 background free events can be
found in a large region of the SUSY parameter space.
