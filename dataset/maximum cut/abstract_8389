We show that Abrikosov vortices moving towards the surface of a
superconductor emit electromagnetic radiation into free space. The frequency
distribution of the radiated intensity displays a pronounced maximum at
microwave frequencies around v_x/lambda, where lambda is the magnetic
penetration length. Coherent motion of a lattice of flux lines leads to
constructive interference and increases the strength of the radiated power by a
large factor.
