An extended radio emission after a soft X-ray (SXR) maximum was detected in
the active region NOAA 9077 by several observatories for the solar flare after
21:42 UT on July 10, 2000. Also some radio fine structures before the enduring
radio emission were observed with the 1.0-2.0 GHz spectrometer of Beijing
Astronomical Observatory (BAO) in the same time. We apply a shear-driven
quadrupolar reconnection model (SQR) to analyze the fine structures and the
related radio emission. We find that the footpoint shear motion of the flux
loop is accompanied with the emerging up of the loop during the reconnection
process. We tentatively interpret the extended radio emission as the nonthermal
radiation caused by a new reconnection process between emerging flux loop and
pre-existing overarching loop after the soft X-ray maximum.
