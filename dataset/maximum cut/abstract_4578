We analyze the recent total cross section data for $pp \to p\Lambda K^+$ near
threshold measured at COSY. Using an effective range approximation for the
on-shell $p\Lambda$ S-wave final state interaction we extract from these data
the combination ${\cal K} = \sqrt{2|K_s|^2+|K_t|^2} = 0.38$ fm$^4$ of the
singlet ($K_s$) and triplet ($K_t$) threshold transition amplitudes. We present
an exploratory calculation of various (tree-level) vector and pseudoscalar
meson exchange diagrams. Pointlike $\omega$-exchange alone and the combined
($\rho^0,\omega,K^{*+} $)-exchange can explain the experimental value of $\cal
K$. The pseudoscalar meson exchanges based on a SU(3) chiral Lagrangian turn
out to be too large. However, when adding $\pi^0$-exchange in combination with
the resonant $\pi N \to S_{11}(1650)\to K \Lambda$ transition and introducing
monopole form factors with a cut-off $\Lambda_c= 1.5$ GeV one is again able to
reproduce the experimental value of $\cal K$. More exclusive measurements are
necessary to reveal the details of the $pp\to p\Lambda K^+$ production
mechanism.
