We have obtained the correct expression for the centrifugal force acting on a
particle at the equatorial circumference of a rotating body in the locally
non-rotating frame of the Kerr geometry. Using this expression for the
equilibrium of an element on the surface of a slowly rotating Maclaurin
spheroid, we obtain the expression for the ellipticity (as discussed earlier by
Abramowicz and Miller) and determine the radius at which the ellipticity is
maximum.
