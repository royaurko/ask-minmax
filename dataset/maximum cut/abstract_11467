The interpretation of the old, cool white dwarfs recently found by
Oppenheimer et al. (2001) is still controversial. Whereas these contributors claim
that they have finally found the elusive ancient halo white dwarf population
that contributes significantly to the mass budget of the galactic halo, there
have been several other contributions that argue that these white dwarfs are
not genuine halo members but, instead, thick disk stars. We show here that the
interpretation of this sample is based on the adopted distances, which are
obtained from a color--magnitude calibration, and we demonstrate that when the
correct distances are used a sizeable fraction of these putative halo white
dwarfs belong indeed to the disk population. We also perform a maximum
likelihood analysis of the remaining set of white dwarfs and we find that they
most likely belong to the thick disk population. However, another possible
explanation is that this sample of white dwarfs has been drawn from a 1:1
mixture of the halo and disk white dwarf populations.
