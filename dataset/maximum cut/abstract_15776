Making use of a seminumerical method we develop a scenario of disk galaxy
formation and evolution in the framework of inflationary cold dark matter (CDM)
cosmologies. Within the virializing dark matter halos, disks in centrifugal
equilibrium are built-up and their galactic evolution is followed through an
approach which considers the gravitational interactions among the galaxy
components, the turbulence and energy balance of the ISM, the star formation
(SF) process due to disk gravitational instabilities, the stellar evolution and
the secular formation of a bulge. We find that the main properties and
correlations of disk galaxies are determined by the mass, the hierarchical mass
aggregation history and the primordial angular momentum. The models follow the
same trends across the Hubble sequence than the observed galaxies. The
predicted TF relation is in good agreement with the observations except for the
standart CDM. While the slope of this relation remains almost constant up to
intermediate redshifts, its zero-point decreases in the H-band and slightly
increases in the B-band. A maximum in the SF rate for most of the models is
attained at $z\sim 1.5-2.5$.
