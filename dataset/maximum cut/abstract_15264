We demonstrate plasma discharges with extremely high temperature of bulk
electrons at the large axially symmetric magnetic mirror device GDT (Budker
Institute, Novosibirsk). According to Thomson scattering measurements, the
on-axis electron temperature averaged over several sequential shots is 660
$\pm$ 50 eV with peak values exceeding 900 eV in few shots. This corresponds to
at least threefold increase as compared to previous experiments both at the GDT
and at other comparable machines, thus demonstrating the maximum
quasi-stationary (~1 ms) electron temperature achieved in open traps. The
breakthrough is made possible with application of sophisticated electron
cyclotron resonance heating in addition to standard heating by neutral beams.
The reported increase of the electron temperature along with previous
experiments, which demonstrated high-density plasma confinement with
$\beta\approx$ 60%, provide a firm basis for extrapolating to fusion relevant
applications of open magnetic systems.
