We present a direct measurement of the mass difference between $t$ and
$\bar{t}$ quarks using $\ttbar$ candidate events in the lepton+jets channel,
collected with the CDF II detector at Fermilab's 1.96 TeV Tevatron \ppbar
Collider. We make an event by event estimate of the mass difference to
construct templates for top quark pair signal events and background events. The
resulting mass difference distribution of data is compared to templates of
signals and background using a maximum likelihood fit. From a sample
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \invfb{5.6}, we measure a mass
difference, $\dmt = \mathrm{M}_{t} - \mathrm{M}_{\bar{t}} = -3.3 \pm 1.4(stat)
\pm 1.0(syst)}$, approximately two standard deviations away from the CPT
hypothesis of zero mass difference. This is the most precise measurement of a
mass difference between $t$ and its $\bar{t}$ partner to date.
