We investigate the effects of space noncommutativity and the generalized
uncertainty principle on the thermodynamics of a radiating Schwarzschild black
hole. We show that evaporation process is in such a way that black hole reaches
to a maximum temperature before its final stage of evolution and then cools
down to a nonsingular remnant with zero temperature and entropy. We compare our
results with more reliable results of string theory. This comparison Shows that
GUP and space noncommutativity are similar concepts at least from view point of
black hole thermodynamics.
