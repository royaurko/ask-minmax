We report on the magnetic and hyperthermia properties of iron nanoparticles
synthesized by organometallic chemistry. They are 5.5 nm in diameter and
display a saturation magnetization close to the bulk one. Magnetic properties
are dominated by the contribution of aggregates of nanoparticles with respect
to individual isolated nanoparticles. Alternative susceptibility measurements
are been performed on a low interacting system obtained after eliminating the
aggregates by centrifugation. A quantitative analysis using the Gittleman s
model allow a determination of the effective anisotropy Keff = 1.3 * 10^5
J.m^{-3}, more than two times the magnetocristalline value of bulk iron.
Hyperthermia measurements are performed on agglomerates of nanoparticles at a
magnetic field up to 66 mT and at frequencies in the range 5-300 kHz. Maximum
measured SAR is 280 W/g at 300 kHz and 66 mT. Specific absorption rate (SAR)
displays a square dependence with the magnetic field below 30 mT but deviates
from this power law at higher value. SAR is linear with the applied frequency
for mu_0H=19 mT. The deviations from the linear response theory are discussed.
A refined estimation of the optimal size of iron nanoparticles for hyperthermia
applications is provided using the determined effective anisotropy value.
