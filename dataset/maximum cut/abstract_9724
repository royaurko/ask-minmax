It is shown how tree-level multi-gluon helicity amplitudes with an arbitrary
number of off-shell external gluons can be calculated via BCFW recursion.
Compact expressions for helicity amplitudes for scattering processes of three
and four gluons, with up to three of them off-shell, are presented. Also,
maximum-helicity-violating configurations are identified for up to two
off-shell gluons, and the expressions for their helicity amplitudes for an
arbitrary number of on-shell gluons are derived.
