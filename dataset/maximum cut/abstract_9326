From a comparison of the total gamma-spectra calculated for different
functional dependencies of level density and radiative strength functions,
there were obtained both their square root relative differences and analogous
data for the used parameters. The analysis of these data showed that the total
uncertainty in determination of gamma-spectra intensities which is necessary to
obtain reliable values of parameters of cascade gamma-decay, most probably,
must not exceed one percent.
