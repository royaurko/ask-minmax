In [R. Planet, S. Santucci and J. Ortin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 094502
(2009)], we reported that both the size and duration of the global avalanches
observed during a forced imbibition process follow power law distributions with
cut-offs. Following a comment by G. Pruessner, we discuss here the right
procedure to perfom, in order to extract reliable exponents characterising
those pdf's.
