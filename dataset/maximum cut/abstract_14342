Simultaneous occurrence of big ferroelectricity and strong ferromagnetism has
been observed in Barium Hexaferrite ceramics. Barium hexaferrite (BaFe12O19)
powders with hexagonal crystal structure have been successfully synthesized by
polymer precursor method using barium acetate and ferric acetylacetonate as the
precursor. The powders were pressed into pellets, which were sintered into
ceramics at 1100^{\circ}C~1300^{\circ}C for 1 hour. The structure and
morphology have been determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Large spontaneous polarization was
observed in the BaFe12O19 ceramics at room temperature, exhibiting a clear
ferroelectric hysteresis loop. The maximum remanent polarization of BaFe12O19
ceramic is estimated to be Pr~11.8 {\mu}C/cm2. The FeO6 octahedron in its
perovskite-like hexagonal unit cell as well as the shift of Fe3+ off the center
of octahedron are proposed to be the origin of polarization in BaFe12O19. The
BaFe12O19 ceramic also shows strong ferromagnetism at room temperature.
