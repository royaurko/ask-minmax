We show that the chirality of artificial media, made of a planar periodic
arrangement of three-dimensional metallic meta-atoms, can be tailored. The
meta-atoms support localized plasmon polaritons and exhibit a chirality
exceeding that of pseudo-planar chiral metamaterials by an order of magnitude.
Two design approaches are investigated in detail. The first is the referential
example for a chiral structure, namely a Moebius strip. The second example is a
cut wire - split-ring resonator geometry that can be manufactured with
state-of-the-art nanofabrication technologies. Driven into resonance these
meta-atoms evoke a polarization rotation of $30^\circ$ per unit cell.
