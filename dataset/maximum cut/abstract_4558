A model is presented to describe electromagnetically induced two-nucleon
emission processes in a shell-model picture. Distortions in the outgoing
nucleon waves are accounted for by performing a partial-wave expansion in a
real mean-field potential. The antisymmetry condition for the A-body
wavefunctions is shown to be naturally preserved.
  The model is used to calculate ($\gamma$,pn) and ($\gamma$,pp) cross sections
off the target nuclei $^{16}$O and $^{12}$C for photon energies ranging from 50
MeV up to the $\bigtriangleup$(1232) isobar threshold. Effects due to the
pionic currents and intermediate $\bigtriangleup$ creation are implemented. The
impact of the distortions due to the interaction of the outgoing nucleon waves
with the (A-2) core is examined. Hadronic form factors are introduced to
regularize the $\pi$NN vertices and the sensitivity of the cross section to the
pion cut-off mass is examined. The relative contribution of the ($\gamma$,pp)
and the ($\gamma$,pn) channel to the total photoabsorption strength is
discussed. Further, the photon energy dependence of the
($\gamma$,pp)/($\gamma$,pn) ratio is investigated.
