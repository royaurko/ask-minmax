We present a new measurement of air shower muons made during atmospheric
ascent of the High Energy Antimatter Telescope balloon experiment. The muon
charge ratio mu+ / mu- is presented as a function of atmospheric depth in the
momentum interval 0.3-0.9 GeV/c. The differential mu- momentum spectra are
presented between 0.3 and about 50 GeV/c at atmospheric depths between 13 and
960 g/cm^2. We compare our measurements with other recent data and with Monte
Carlo calculations of the same type as those used in predicting atmospheric
neutrino fluxes. We find that our measured mu- fluxes are smaller than the
predictions by as much as 70% at shallow atmospheric depths, by about 20% at
the depth of shower maximum, and are in good agreement with the predictions at
greater depths. We explore the consequences of this on the question of
atmospheric neutrino production.
