LUX is a two-phase (liquid/gas) xenon time projection chamber designed to
detect nuclear recoils from interactions with dark matter particles. Signals
from the LUX detector are processed by custom-built analog electronics which
provide properly shaped signals for the trigger and data acquisition (DAQ)
systems. The DAQ is comprised of commercial digitizers with firmware customized
for the LUX experiment. Data acquisition systems in rare-event searches must
accommodate high rate and large dynamic range during precision calibrations
involving radioactive sources, while also delivering low threshold for maximum
sensitivity. The LUX DAQ meets these challenges using real-time baseline sup-
pression that allows for a maximum event acquisition rate in excess of 1.5 kHz
with virtually no deadtime. This paper describes the LUX DAQ and the novel
acquisition techniques employed in the LUX experiment.
