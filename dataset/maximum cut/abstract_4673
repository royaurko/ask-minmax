The sensitivity of Standard Model Higgs boson searches at the Tevatron
experiments with a mass 135<MH<190 GeV using the channel H->WW->ll+MET (l=e,mu)
is discussed. Three new event selections involving Higgs in association with
one or two high PT hadronic jets are discussed. Using Leading Order Matrix
Elements and a conservative cut-based analysis a 95% confidence level exclusion
on sigmaxBR(H->WW), 1.6 times larger than that predicted by the Standard Model
for MH=165 GeV, may be achieved with 5fb-1 of integrated luminosity. By
combining these three event selections with the existing analysis, the
sensitivity of CDF and D0 could improve significantly.
