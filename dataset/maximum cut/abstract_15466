Suppose an experiment is conducted on pairs of objects with outcome responses
a continuous variable measuring the interactions among the pairs. Furthermore,
assume the response variable is hard to measure numerically but easy to be
coded into ordered categories such as low, moderate, and high levels of
interaction. In this paper we estimate the unknown interaction values from the
information contained in the coded data and the design structure of the
experiment. The method of estimation is shown to enjoy several optimal
properties such as explaining maximum variance in the responses with minimum
number of parameters and for any probability distribution underlying the
responses. Other properties of the method include: the interactions have the
simple interpretation of correlation, size of error is estimable from the
experiment, and only a single run of each pair is needed to carry out the
experiment. We also explore possible applications of the technique. Three
applications are presented, one on protein interaction, a second on drug
combination, and the third on computer imaging. The first two applications are
illustrated using real life data while for the third application the data are
generated via binary coding of an image.
