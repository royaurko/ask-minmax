We consider compact astrophysical objects formed from dark matter fermions of
mass 250 GeV to 100 TeV or from massless fermions hidden by vacuum structure of
similar energy scale. These macroscopic objects have maximum stable masses of
sub-planetary scale (asteroids) and radii of micron to centimeter scale. We
describe the surface gravity and tidal forces near these compact ultra dense
objects, as pertinent to signatures of their collisions with visible matter
objects.
