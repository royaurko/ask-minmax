We adopt an isotropic representation of the Fourier-transformed two-point
correlation tensor of the magnetic field for estimating magnetic energy and
helicity spectra as well as current helicity spectra of individual active
regions and the change of their spectral indices with the solar cycle. The
departure of the spectral index of current helicity from 5/3 is analyzed, and
it is found that it is lower than that of magnetic energy. There is no obvious
relationship between the change of the normalized magnetic helicity and the
integral scale of the magnetic field for individual active regions. The
evolution of the spectral index reflects the development and distribution of
various scales of magnetic structures in active regions. It is found that
around solar maximum the magnetic energy and helicity spectra are steeper.
