In the context of the evaluation of possibly using the Fermilab Electron
Cooler for the proposed low-energy RHIC run at BNL, operating the cooler at 1.6
MeV electron beam energy was tested in a short beam line configuration. The
main conclusion of this feasibility study is that the cooler's beam generation
system is suitable for BNL needs. The beam recirculation was stable for all
tested parameters. In particular, a beam current of 0.38 A was achieved with
the cathode magnetic field up to the maximum value presently available of 250
G. The energy ripple was measured to be 40 eV. A striking difference with
running the 4.3 MeV beam (nominal for operation at FNAL) is that no unprovoked
beam recirculation interruptions were observed.
