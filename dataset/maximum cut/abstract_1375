We present the results of applying new object classification techniques to
difference images in the context of the Nearby Supernova Factory supernova
search. Most current supernova searches subtract reference images from new
images, identify objects in these difference images, and apply simple threshold
cuts on parameters such as statistical significance, shape, and motion to
reject objects such as cosmic rays, asteroids, and subtraction artifacts.
Although most static objects subtract cleanly, even a very low false positive
detection rate can lead to hundreds of non-supernova candidates which must be
vetted by human inspection before triggering additional followup. In comparison
to simple threshold cuts, more sophisticated methods such as Boosted Decision
Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines provide dramatically better
object discrimination. At the Nearby Supernova Factory, we reduced the number
of non-supernova candidates by a factor of 10 while increasing our supernova
identification efficiency. Methods such as these will be crucial for
maintaining a reasonable false positive rate in the automated transient alert
pipelines of upcoming projects such as PanSTARRS and LSST.
