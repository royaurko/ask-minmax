The problem of a mutual dependence of parameters of the Standard Model is
considered in the framework of the compensation approach. Conditions for a
spontaneous generation of four electro-weak boson effective interactions are
shown to lead to a set of equations for parameters of the interaction. In case
of a realization of a non-trivial solution of a set of compensation equations,
parameter $\sin^2\theta_W$ is defined. The existence of non-trivial solutions
is demonstrated, which provide a satisfactory value for the electromagnetic
fine structure constant $\alpha$ at scale $M_Z$: $\alpha(M_Z) = 0.007756$.
Within the range of experimental limitations we demonstrate the existence of
two solutions for the problem. There is a solution with high effective cut-off
being close to the Planck mass by the order of magnitude. Another solution
corresponds to the effective cut-off in $10^2$ TeV range and leads to
prediction of observable effects in the production of a top pair accompanied by
an electro-weak boson. The results being obtained may be considered as sound
arguments on behalf of a possibility of a calculation of parameters of the
Standard Model.
