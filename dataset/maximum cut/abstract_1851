There is a fundamental relationship between belief propagation and maximum a
posteriori decoding. The case of transmission over the binary erasure channel
was investigated in detail in a companion paper. This paper investigates the
extension to general memoryless channels (paying special attention to the
binary case). An area theorem for transmission over general memoryless channels
is introduced and some of its many consequences are discussed. We show that
this area theorem gives rise to an upper-bound on the maximum a posteriori
threshold for sparse graph codes. In situations where this bound is tight, the
extrinsic soft bit estimates delivered by the belief propagation decoder
coincide with the correct a posteriori probabilities above the maximum a
posteriori threshold. More generally, it is conjectured that the fundamental
relationship between the maximum a posteriori and the belief propagation
decoder which was observed for transmission over the binary erasure channel
carries over to the general case. We finally demonstrate that in order for the
design rate of an ensemble to approach the capacity under belief propagation
decoding the component codes have to be perfectly matched, a statement which is
well known for the special case of transmission over the binary erasure
channel.
