Metallic contamination was key to the discovery of semiconductor nanowires,
but today it stands in the way of their adoption by the semiconductor industry.
This is because many of the metallic catalysts required for nanowire growth are
not compatible with standard CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor)
fabrication processes. Nanowire synthesis with those metals which are CMOS
compatible, such as aluminium and copper, necessitate temperatures higher than
450 C, which is the maximum temperature allowed in CMOS processing. Here, we
demonstrate that the synthesis temperature of silicon nanowires using copper
based catalysts is limited by catalyst preparation. We show that the
appropriate catalyst can be produced by chemical means at temperatures as low
as 400 C. This is achieved by oxidizing the catalyst precursor, contradicting
the accepted wisdom that oxygen prevents metal-catalyzed nanowire growth. By
simultaneously solving material compatibility and temperature issues, this
catalyst synthesis could represent an important step towards real-world
applications of semiconductor nanowires.
