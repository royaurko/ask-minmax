We construct a radiation-hydrodynamics model for the obscuring toroidal
structure in active galactic nuclei. In this model the obscuration is produced
at parsec scale by a dense, dusty wind which is supported by infrared radiation
pressure on dust grains. To find the distribution of radiation pressure, we
numerically solve the 2D radiation transfer problem in a flux limited diffusion
approximation. We iteratively couple the solution with calculations of
stationary 1D models for the wind, and obtain the z-component of the velocity.
Our results demonstrate that for AGN luminosities greater than 0.1 Ledd
external illumination can support a geometrically thick obscuration via
outflows driven by infrared radiation pressure. The terminal velocity of
marginally Compton-thin models (0.2<tau_T<0.6), is comparable to or greater
than the escape velocity. In Compton thick models the maximum value of the
vertical component of the velocity is lower than the escape velocity,
suggesting that a significant part of our torus is in the form of failed wind.
The results demonstrate that obscuration via normal or failed infrared-driven
winds is a viable option for the AGN torus problem and AGN unification models.
Such winds can also provide an important channel for AGN feedback.
