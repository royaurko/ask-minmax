Using data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) covering the
period from 1995 to 1998, we study the change with solar activity in solar
f-mode frequencies. The results are compared with similar changes detected from
the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) data. We find variations in f-mode
frequencies which are correlated with solar activity indices. If these changes
are due to variation in solar radius then the implications are that the solar
radius decreases by about 5 km from minimum to maximum activity.
