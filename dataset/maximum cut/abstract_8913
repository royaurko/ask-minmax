Counterfactual reasoning and contextuality is defined and critically
evaluated with regard to its nonempirical content. To this end, a uniqueness
property of states, explosion views and link observables are introduced. If
only a single context associated with a particular maximum set of observables
can be operationalized, then a context translation principle resolves
measurements of different contexts.
