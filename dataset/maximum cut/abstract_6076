We answer the following question of R. L. Graham: What is the discrepancy of
the lexicographically-least binary de Bruijn sequence? Here, "discrepancy"
refers to the maximum (absolute) difference between the number of ones and the
number of zeros in any initial segment of the sequence. We show that the answer
is $\Theta(2^n \log n/n)$.
