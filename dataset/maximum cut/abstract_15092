A venerable history of models have shown that simple and complex cell
responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) are adapted to the statistics of
natural images. These models are based, either explicitly or implicitly, on the
assumption that neural responses represent maximum likelihood or a posteriori
inferences in a generative model trained on natural images and thus provide a
normative account of steady-state neural responses in V1. However, such models
have very different structural and dynamical properties to the brain. In
particular, these models violate Dale's law, have gradient ascent, rather than
oscillatory dynamics, and approach a single fixed point in response to fixed
input. We give a solution to all of these problems, by suggesting that the
brain samples possible explanations of incoming data using a mechanism inspired
by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Our sampler has recurrent connections that obey
Dale's law, gives rise to oscillatory dynamics, and continues sampling in
response to fixed input, rather than reaching a single fixed point. These
properties of our model allow it to match three key aspects of neural responses
in V1. First, the oscillation frequency increases with stimulus contrast.
Second, there are large transient increases in firing rate upon stimulus onset.
Third, excitation and inhibition are balanced, and inhibition lags excitation.
