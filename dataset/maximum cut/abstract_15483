High--velocity features (HVF), especially of Ca II, are frequently seen in
Type Ia supernovae observed prior to B-band maximum (Bmax). These HVF start at
more than 25,000 km/s in the days after first light, and slow to about 18,000
km/s near Bmax. To recreate the Ca II near-infrared triplet (CaNIR) HVF in SN
2011fe, we consider the interaction between a Type Ia supernova and a compact
circumstellar shell, employing a hydrodynamic 1-D simulation using FLASH. We
generate synthetic spectra from the hydrodynamic results using syn++. We show
that the CaNIR HVF and its velocity evolution is better explained by a
supernova model interacting with a shell than a model without a shell, and
briefly discuss the implications for progenitor models.
