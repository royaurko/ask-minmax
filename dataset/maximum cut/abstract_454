We discuss the local cutting of single-walled carbon nanotubes by a voltage
pulse to the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. The tip voltage ($\mid V
\mid \ge $~3.8 eV) is the key physical quantity in the cutting process. After
reviewing several possible physical mechanisms we conclude that the cutting
process relies on the weakening of the carbon-carbon bonds through a
combination of localized particle-hole excitations induced by inelastically
tunneling electrons and elastic deformation due to the electric field between
tip and sample. The carbon network releases part of the induced mechanical
stress by forming topological defects that act as nucleation centers for the
formation of dislocations that dynamically propagate towards bond-breaking.
