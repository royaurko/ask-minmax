The problem of detecting the sparsity pattern of a k-sparse vector in R^n
from m random noisy measurements is of interest in many areas such as system
identification, denoising, pattern recognition, and compressed sensing. This
paper addresses the scaling of the number of measurements m, with signal
dimension n and sparsity-level nonzeros k, for asymptotically-reliable
detection. We show a necessary condition for perfect recovery at any given SNR
for all algorithms, regardless of complexity, is m = Omega(k log(n-k))
measurements. Conversely, it is shown that this scaling of Omega(k log(n-k))
measurements is sufficient for a remarkably simple ``maximum correlation''
estimator. Hence this scaling is optimal and does not require more
sophisticated techniques such as lasso or matching pursuit. The constants for
both the necessary and sufficient conditions are precisely defined in terms of
the minimum-to-average ratio of the nonzero components and the SNR. The
necessary condition improves upon previous results for maximum likelihood
estimation. For lasso, it also provides a necessary condition at any SNR and
for low SNR improves upon previous work. The sufficient condition provides the
first asymptotically-reliable detection guarantee at finite SNR.
