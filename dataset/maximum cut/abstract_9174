We present a procedure for the determination of the interaction potential
from the knowledge of the radial pair distribution function. The method,
realized inside an inverse Monte Carlo simulation scheme, is based on the
application of the Maximum Entropy Principle of information theory and the
interaction potential emerges as the asymptotic expression of the transition
probability. Results obtained for high density monoatomic fluids are very
satisfactory and provide an accurate extraction of the potential, despite a
modest computational effort.
