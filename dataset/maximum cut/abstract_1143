The MaxEnt solutions are shown to display a variety of behaviors (beyond the
traditional and customary exponential one) if adequate dynamical information is
inserted into the concomitant entropic-variational principle. In particular, we
show both theoretically and numerically that power laws and power laws with
exponential cut-offs emerge as equilibrium densities in proportional and other
dynamics.
