Let $x_{i,j}$, $1 \le i \le m$, $1 \le j \le n_i$, be observations from a
doubly-indexed sequence $\{X_{i,j}\}$ of independent random variables (all of
them discrete, or all of them absolutely continuous). Suppose that each
$X_{i,j}$ has the PDF $f(x\mid\theta_i)$ from a one-parameter family of PDFs
$f(x\mid \theta)$. Mild assumptions are described under which there is a
unique, non-decreasing compound response estimate of $\mathbf \theta=<\theta_1,
\hdots \theta_m>$ that maximizes the compound likelihood function among all
non-decreasing response estimates. An efficient algorithm is described to
compute this unique estimate.
  The same theory and algorithm also give the unique non-increasing compound
response estimate that maximizes likelihood among all non-increasing response
estimates. One simply reverses the order represented by the index $i$.
