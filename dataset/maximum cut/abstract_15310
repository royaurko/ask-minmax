Hydrogen sensors have been prepared using nickel oxide (NiO) and
lithium-doped nickel oxide (NiO:Li) thin films, deposited on glass substrates
by the sol-gel spin coating technique. The surface morphology, structure,
optical and electrical properties of the obtained films were studied. Hydrogen
sensing results are presented for three operating temperatures (140, 160, and
180 {\deg}C) and for hydrogen concentrations ranging from 1000 to 15000 ppm in
synthetic air. The NiO and NiO:Li (2% and 8% doping concentrations) sensors
show maximum responses for the operating temperature of 180 {\deg}C. When
tested at different hydrogen concentrations in air, the lithium-doped NiO
sensors showed a higher response than the undoped NiO films.
