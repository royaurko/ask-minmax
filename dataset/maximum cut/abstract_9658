We consider discrete graphical models Markov with respect to a graph $G$ and
propose two distributed marginal methods to estimate the maximum likelihood
estimate of the canonical parameter of the model. Both methods are based on a
relaxation of the marginal likelihood obtained by considering the density of
the variables represented by a vertex $v$ of $G$ and a neighborhood. The two
methods differ by the size of the neighborhood of $v$. We show that the
estimates are consistent and that those obtained with the larger neighborhood
have smaller asymptotic variance than the ones obtained through the smaller
neighborhood.
