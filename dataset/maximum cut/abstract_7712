The present study illuminates the relation between null cusped Wilson loops
and their corresponding amplitudes. We find that, compared to the case with no
self-crossing, the one loop expectation value of a self-intersecting Wilson
loop develops an additional 1/\epsilon singularity associated to the
intersection. Interestingly, the same 1/\epsilon pole exists in the finite part
of the one loop amplitude, appearing in the BDS conjecture, at the
corresponding kinematic limit. At two loops, we explore the behaviour of the
remainder function R, encoding the deviation of the amplitude from the BDS
conjecture. By analysing the renormalisation group equations for the Wilson
loop with a simple self-crossing, we argue that, when approaching the
configuration with a self-crossing (u_2 \to 1, u_1\approx u_3), R diverges in
the imaginary direction like R ~ i \pi \log^3(1-u_2). This behaviour can be
attributed to the non-trivial analytic continuation needed when passing from
the Euclidean to the physical region and suggests that R has a branch cut in
the negative u_2 axis when the two other cross ratios are approximately equal
(u_1 \approx u_3).
