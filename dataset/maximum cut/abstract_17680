A magnetohydrodynamic model is used to determine conditions under which the
Lorentz force accelerates plasma to type 2 spicule speeds in the chromosphere.
The model generalizes a previous model to include a more realistic pre-spicule
state, and the vertical viscous force. Two cases of acceleration under upper
chromospheric conditions are considered. The magnetic field strength for these
cases is <= 12.5 and 25 G. Plasma is accelerated to terminal vertical speeds of
66 and 78 km/s in 100 s, compared with 124 and 397 km/s for the case of zero
viscosity. The flows are localized within horizontal diameters ~ 80 and 50 km.
The total thermal energy generated by viscous dissipation is ~ 10 times larger
than that due to Joule dissipation, but the magnitude of the total cooling due
to rarefaction is >~ this energy. Compressive heating dominates during the
early phase of acceleration. The maximum energy injected into the corona by
type 2 spicules, defined as the energy flux in the upper chromosphere, may
largely balance total coronal energy losses in quiet regions, possibly also in
coronal holes, but not in active regions. It is proposed that magnetic flux
emergence in inter-granular regions drives type 2 spicules.
