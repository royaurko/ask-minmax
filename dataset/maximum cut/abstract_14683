In a one-dimensional elastic medium with finite correlation length and purely
relaxational dynamics, we calculate the time dependence of the elastic force
F(t) exchanged between two active inclusions that trigger an elastic
deformation at t=0. We consider (i) linear inclusions coupling to the field
with a finite force, and (ii) non-linear inclusions imposing a finite
deformation. In the non-linear case, the force exhibits a transient maximum
much larger than the equilibrium force, diverging as ~L^(-2) at separations L
shorter than the field's correlation length. Both the mean-field and the
Casimir component of the interaction are calculated. We also discuss the
typical appearance time and equilibration time of the force, comparing the
linear and the non-linear cases. The existence of a high transient force in the
non-linear case should be a generic feature of elastically-mediated
interactions.
