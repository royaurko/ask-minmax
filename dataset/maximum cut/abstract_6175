We calculate the information capacities of a time-correlated
amplitude-damping channel, provided the sender and receiver share prior
entanglement. Our analytical results show that the noisy channel with zero
capacity can transmit information if it has finite memory. The capacities
increase as the memory increases attaining maximum value for perfect memory
channel.
