We investigate the dynamics of the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) model
of water in the supercooled region. The dynamics at negative pressures show a
minimum in the diffusion constant $D$ when the density is decreased at constant
temperature, complementary to the known maximum of $D$ at higher pressures. A
similar trend in the rotational diffusion is also observed.
