A complete numerical calculation of the temperature anisotropies and
polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in the presence of a
stochastic helical magnetic field is presented which includes the contributions
due to scalar, vector and tensor modes. The correlation functions of the
magnetic field contributions are calculated numerically including a Gaussian
window function to effectively cut off the magnetic field spectrum due to
damping. Apart from parity-even correlations the helical nature of the magnetic
field induces parity-odd correlations between the E- and B-mode of polarization
(EB) as well as between temperature (T) and the polarization B-mode (TB).
