Nonlinear stochastic differential equations generating signals with 1/f
spectrum have been used so far to describe socio-economical systems. In this
paper we consider the motion of a Brownian particle in an inhomogeneous
environment such that the motion can be described by the equation yielding 1/f
spectrum in a broad range of frequencies. The inhomogeneous environment can be
a result, for example, of a linear potential affecting the Brownian particle
together with the medium where steady state heat transfer is present due to the
difference of temperatures at the ends of the medium. The correlation of
collisions between the Brownian particle and the surrounding molecules can lead
to the situation where the finite correlation time becomes important, thus we
have investigated the effect of colored noise in our model. Existence of
colored noise leads to the additional restriction of the diffusion and
exponential cut-off of the distribution of particle positions. Narrower power
law part in the distribution of the particle positions results in the narrower
range of frequencies where the spectrum has power law behavior.
