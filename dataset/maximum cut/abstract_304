Associated to each ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $\omega$ and each map
$p:\omega\rightarrow \omega$ is a Dedekind cut in the ultrapower
$\omega^{\omega}/p( \mathcal{U})$. Blass has characterized, under CH, the cuts
obtainable when $\mathcal{U}$ is taken to be either a p-point ultrafilter, a
weakly-Ramsey ultrafilter or a Ramsey ultrafilter.
  Dobrinen and Todorcevic have introduced the topological Ramsey space
$\mathcal{R}_{1}$. Associated to the space $\mathcal{R}_{1}$ is a notion of
Ramsey ultrafilter for $\mathcal{R}_{1}$ generalizing the familiar notion of
Ramsey ultrafilter on $\omega$. We characterize, under CH, the cuts obtainable
when $\mathcal{U}$ is taken to be a Ramsey for $\mathcal{R}_{1}$ ultrafilter
and $p$ is taken to be any map. In particular, we show that the only cut
obtainable is the standard cut, whose lower half consists of the collection of
equivalence classes of constants maps.
  Forcing with $\mathcal{R}_{1}$ using almost-reduction adjoins an ultrafilter
which is Ramsey for $\mathcal{R}_{1}$. For such ultrafilters $\mathcal{U}_{1}$,
Dobrinen and Todorcevic have shown that the Rudin-Keisler types of the p-points
within the Tukey type of $\mathcal{U}_{1}$ consists of a strictly increasing
chain of rapid p-points of order type $\omega$. We show that for any
Rudin-Keisler mapping between any two p-points within the Tukey type of
$\mathcal{U}_{1}$ the only cut obtainable is the standard cut. These results
imply existence theorems for special kinds of ultrafilters.
