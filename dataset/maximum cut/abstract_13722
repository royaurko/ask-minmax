We demonstrate by a large set of merger simulations for symmetric binary
neutron stars (NSs) that there is a tight correlation between the frequency
peak of the postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) emission and the physical
properties of the nuclear equation of state (EoS), e.g. expressed by the radius
of the maximum-mass Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkhoff configuration. Therefore, a
single measurement of the peak frequency of the postmerger GW signal will
constrain the NS EoS significantly. For plausible optimistic merger-rate
estimates a corresponding detection with Advanced LIGO is likely to happen
within an operation time of roughly a year.
