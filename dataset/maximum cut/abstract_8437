We analyze the possibilities of pairing between two different fermion species
in asymmetric matter at low density. While the direct interaction allows
pairing only for very small asymmetries, the pairing mediated by polarization
effects is always possible, with a pronounced maximum at finite asymmetry. We
present analytical results up to second order in the low-density parameter $k_F
a$.
