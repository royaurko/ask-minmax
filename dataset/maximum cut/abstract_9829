It is well known that Hill estimator is a pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator
and these approache is however not robust against outliersis, neither the
estimator of the risk premium based on this estimator given by Necir and
Meraghni(2009). In this paper we use the so called t-Hill estimator proposed by
Fabi\'an(2001) to estimate the tail index of loss rather than the Hill
estimator and to derive a new estimator for the distortion risk premium. We
establish the asymptotic distribution of the new estimator. We illustrate the
performance and the robustness of the estimator for small and large sample size
in a simulation study.
