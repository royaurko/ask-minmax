A prototype laser ion source that could demonstrate the possibility of
producing intense pulsed high charge state ion beams has been established with
a commercial Nd:YAG laser (E max = 3 J, 1064 nm, 8-10 ns) to produce laser
plasma for the research of Laser Ion Source (LIS). At the laser ion source test
bench, high purity (99.998 %) aluminum and lead targets have been tested for
laser plasma experiment. An Electrostatic Ion Analyzer (EIA) and Electron
Multiply Tube (EMT) detector were used to analyze the charge state and energy
distribution of the ions produced by the laser ion source. The maximum charge
states of Al12+ and Pb7+ were achieved. The results will be presented and
discussed in this paper.
