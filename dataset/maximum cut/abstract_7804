In some extensions of the standard model with extended Higgs sectors, events
from new particle production may pass the selection criteria for Higgs search
in different channels at the LHC - 14 TeV and mimic Higgs signals. This
intriguing possibility is illustrated by PYTHIA based simulations using several
representative points in the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric
standard model (MSSM) including a point in the minimal supergravity model
consistent with the Dark matter (DM) relic density data. Our simulations
explore the interplay between the charged Higgs signal and typical
squark-gluino events. We argue that the standard selections like the one based
on the polarization properties of the $\tau$'s from charged Higgs decay, though
adequate for handling the SM background, may not be very efficient in the
presence of SUSY backgrounds. We then propose an alternative search strategy
based on pure kinematics which sufficiently controls both the SM and the MSSM
backgrounds. For charged Higgs masses ($H^{\pm}$) in the deep decoupling regime
(600 GeV $\lsim m_{H^{\pm}} \lsim$ 800 GeV) this method works well and extends
the LHC reach close to 800 GeV for an integrated luminosity of 30 $fb^{-1}$
with or without the SUSY background. For a lighter charged Higgs a judicious
combination of the old selections and some of the cuts proposed by us may
disentangle the Higgs signal from the squark-gluino backgrounds quite
effectively.
