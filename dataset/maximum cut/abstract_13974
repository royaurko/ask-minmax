Microring optical modulators are being explored extensively for
energy-efficient photonic communication networks in future high-performance
computing systems and microprocessors, because they can significantly reduce
the power consumption of optical transmitters via the resonant circulation of
light. However, resonant modulators have traditionally suffered from a
trade-off between their power consumption and maximum operation bit rate, which
were thought to depend oppositely upon the cavity linewidth. Here, we break
this linewidth limitation using a silicon microring. By controlling the rate at
which light enters and exits the microring, we demonstrate modulation free of
the parasitic cavity linewidth limitations at up to 40 GHz, more than 6x the
cavity linewidth. The device operated at 28 Gb/s using single-ended drive
signals less than 1.5 V. The results show that high-Q resonant modulators can
be designed to be simultaneously low-power and high-speed, features which are
mutually incompatible in typical resonant modulators studied to date.
