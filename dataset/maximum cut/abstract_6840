A graph drawn in the plane is called k-quasi-planar if it does not contain k
pairwise crossing edges. It has been conjectured for a long time that for every
fixed k, the maximum number of edges of a k-quasi-planar graph with n vertices
is O(n). The best known upper bound is n(\log n)^{O(\log k)}. In the present
note, we improve this bound to (n\log n)2^{\alpha^{c_k}(n)} in the special case
where the graph is drawn in such a way that every pair of edges meet at most
once. Here \alpha(n) denotes the (extremely slowly growing) inverse of the
Ackermann function. We also make further progress on the conjecture for
k-quasi-planar graphs in which every edge is drawn as an x-monotone curve.
Extending some ideas of Valtr, we prove that the maximum number of edges of
such graphs is at most 2^{ck^6}n\log n.
