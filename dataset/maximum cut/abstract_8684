We study the initial value problem of new inflation models in the scheme of
supergravity. We find that an inflaton generally acquires a mass of the order
of the Hubble parameter via gravitationally suppressed interactions with
particles in the thermal bath of the universe. This additional mass term
stabilizes dynamically the inflaton at the local maximum of the potential,
which offers the initial condition of new inflation.
