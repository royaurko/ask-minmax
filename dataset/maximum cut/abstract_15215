We consider models of cooling neutron stars with nucleon cores which possess
moderately strong triplet-state superfluidity of neutrons. When the internal
temperature drops below the maximum of the critical temperature over the core,
$T_{\rm C}$, this superfluidity sets in. It produces a neutrino outburst due to
Cooper pairing of neutrons which greatly accelerates the cooling. We show that
the cooling of the star with internal temperature $T$ within $0.6\,T_{\rm C}
\lesssim T \leq T_{\rm C}$ is described by analytic self-similar relations. A
measurement of the effective surface temperature of the star and its decline,
supplemented by assumptions on star's mass, radius and composition of
heat-blanketing envelope, allows one to construct a family of cooling models
parametrized by the value of $T_{\rm C}$. Each model reconstructs cooling
history of the star including its neutrino emission level before neutron
superfluidity onset and the intensity of Cooper pairing neutrinos. The results
are applied to interpret the observations of the neutron star in the Cassiopeia
A supernova remnant.
