We give an explicit characterization of linearly repetitive cut and project
sets, answering a question of Lagarias and Pleasants. Our results allow us to
calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the collection of linearly repetitive cut
and project sets, for all choices of dimension and codimension of the cut and
project setup, and to exhibit specific examples, for all pairs of dimension and
codimension in which they exist.
