We describe a model named No-Scale F-SU(5) which is simultaneously capable of
explaining the dual signals emerging at the LHC of i) a 124-126 GeV Higgs boson
mass m_h, and ii) tantalizing low-statistics excesses in the multi-jet data
which may attributable to supersymmetry. These targets tend to be mutually
exclusive in more conventional approaches. The unified mechanism responsible
for both effects is the introduction of a rather unique set of vector-like
multiplets at the TeV scale, dubbed flippons, which i) can elevate m_h by
around 3-4 GeV via radiative loop corrections, and ii) flatten the running of
the strong coupling and color-charged gaugino, resulting in a prominent
collider signal from production of light gluino pairs. This well motivated
theoretical framework maintains consistency with all key phenomenological
constraints, and all residual parameterization freedom may in principle be
fixed by a combination of the two experiments described. We project that the
already collected luminosity of 5 fb^-1 may be sufficient to definitively
establish the status of this model, given appropriate data selection cuts.
