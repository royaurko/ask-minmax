In General Relativity there is a maximum mass allowed for neutron stars that,
if exceeded, entails their collapse into a black hole. Its precise value
depends on details of the nuclear matter equation of state about which we are
much more certain thanks to recent progress in low-energy effective theories.
  The discovery of a two-solar mass neutron star, near that maximum mass, when
analyzed with modern equations of state, implies that Newton's gravitational
constant in the star cannot exceed its value on Earth by more than 8% at 95%
confidence level. This is a remarkable leap of ten orders of magnitude in the
gravitational field intensity at which the constant has been constrained.
