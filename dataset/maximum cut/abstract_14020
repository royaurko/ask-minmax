We study the detailed temperature and composition dependence of the
resistivity, $\rho(T)$, and thermopower, $S(T)$, for a series of layered
bismuth chalcogenides Bi$_2$Te$_{3-x}$Se$_x$, and report the stoichiometry
dependence of the optical band gap. In the resistivity of the most compensated
member, Bi$_2$Te$_{2.1}$Se$_{0.9}$, we find a low-temperature plateau whose
onset temperature correlates with the high-temperature activation energy. For
the whole series $S(T)$ can be described by a simple model for an extrinsic
semiconductor. By substituting Se for Te, the Fermi level is tuned from the
valence band into the conduction band. The maximum values of $S(T)$, bulk band
gap as well the activation energy in the resistivity are found for $x \approx
0.9$.
