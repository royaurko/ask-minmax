We present a high-power optical parametric oscillator-based frequency comb in
the mid-infrared wavelength region using periodically poled lithium niobate.
The system is synchronously pumped by a 10-W femtosecond Yb:fiber laser
centered at 1.07 um and is singly resonant for the signal. The idler (signal)
wavelength can be continuously tuned from 2.8 to 4.8 um (1.76 to 1.37 um) with
a simultaneous bandwidth as high as 0.3 um and a maximum average idler output
power of 1.50 W. We also demonstrate the performance of the stabilized comb by
recording the heterodyne beat with a narrow-linewidth diode laser. This OPO is
an ideal source for frequency comb spectroscopy in the mid-IR.
