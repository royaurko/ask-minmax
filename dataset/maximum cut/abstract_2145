We study contributions to $b \rightarrow s \gamma$ from anomalous $WW\gamma$
interactions. Although these anomalous interactions are not renormalizable, the
contributions are cut-off independent. Using recent results from the CLEO
collaboration on inclusive radiative B decays, we obtain bounds for the
anomalous CP conserving and CP violating couplings. The constraints on the CP
conserving couplings are comparable with or better than constraints from other
experiments.
