We present a catalog of 9316 spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4. We have selected the stars through
photometric cuts and spectroscopic modeling, backed up by a set of visual
inspections. Roughly 6000 of the stars are new discoveries, roughly doubling
the number of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs. We analyze the stars by
performing temperature and surface gravity fits to grids of pure hydrogen and
helium atmospheres. Among the rare outliers are a set of presumed helium-core
DA white dwarfs with estimated masses below 0.3 Msun, including two candidates
that may be the lowest masses yet found. We also present a list of 928 hot
subdwarfs.
