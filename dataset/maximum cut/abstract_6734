A detailed study of the effects of phase fluctuation and dephasing on the
dynamics of the entanglement generated from a coherently pumped correlated
emission laser is presented. It is found that the time evolution of the
entanglement is significantly reliant on the phase fluctuation and dephasing,
particularly, at early stages of the lasing process. In the absence of external
driving radiation, the degree of entanglement and intensity turns out to attain
a maximum value just before starting to exhibit oscillation which dies at
longer time scale. However, in case the driving mechanism is on, the
oscillatory nature disappears due to the additional induced coherent
superposition and the degree of entanglement would be larger at steady state.
Moreover, the degree of entanglement as predicted by the logarithmic negativity
and the Duan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller criteria exhibits a similar nature when there
is no driving radiation, although such a trend is eroded with increasing
strength of the pumping radiation at longer time scale. The other important
aspect of the phase fluctuation and dephasing is the possibility of relaxing
the time at which the maximum entanglement is detected.
