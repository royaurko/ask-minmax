Representation in terms of a new parameter, exoticity, a measure of
n-deficiency or p-richness, clearly brings out the saturation tendency of the
product's maximum exoticity in a compound nuclear reaction as the compound
nucleus is made more and more exotic using radioactive projectile (RIBs). The
effect of this saturation on the production of new proton-rich species with
RIBs over a wide Z-range has been discussed.
