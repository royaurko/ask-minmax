We present a general Bayesian method for quantifying the statistical
reliability of one-dimensional measures of scientific quality based on citation
data. Two quality measures used in practice -- ``papers per year'' and
``Hirsch's $h$'' -- are shown to lack the accuracy and precision necessary to
be useful. The mean, median and maximum number of citations are on the other
hand reliable and permit accurate predictions of future contributor performance on
the basis of as few as 50 publications.
