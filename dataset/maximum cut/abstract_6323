The idea of a unified model for quasars and micro-quasars has been considered
for a long time, despite the different environments and physical conditions
where both classes of objects reside. Here we show the existence of a simple
scaling law, relating the maximum size of a jet to the properties of the gas
medium into which it expands. This appears to be valid for all types of
hydrodynamical jets, and can be thought of as a broad unified model. The
expansion velocity of the jet and the physical properties of the surrounding
gas combine in such a way that a limit to the maximum extent of jets at
different scales can be obtained.
