We explore the potential of the CERN-LHC to access strongly interacting gauge
boson systems via weak-boson scattering processes with W+W-jj, ZZjj, W+Zjj and
W-Zjj final states, focusing on the leptonic decay modes of the gauge bosons.
Cross sections and kinematic distributions for two representative scenarios of
strong interactions in the weak sector and all relevant background processes
are computed with fully-flexible parton-level Monte-Carlo programs that allow
for the implementation of dedicated selection cuts. We find that models with
new resonances give rise to very distinctive distributions of the decay
leptons. The perturbative treatment of the signal processes is under excellent
control.
