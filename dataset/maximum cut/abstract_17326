We consider observational signatures of the collisions and partial
destructions of giant exoplanets at the chaotic stage of the planetary systems
evolution. The rate of these collisions in the Galaxy is estimated to be
~0.01-1 per yr. In the inelastic collision with a small relative velocity and
small impact parameter, the planets may sufficiently lose their kinetic energy
and merge together. Otherwise, if the planet is experienced a shallow
tangential collision, it flews safety away. At the same time, the planets loss
some part of their gas envelopes during mutual collisions. Collisions of the
giant planets must be accompanied also by the radiation of energy from the
radio to optical bands. The optical and near UV flashes result from the
collision heating of the planet surface layers. Additionally, the collision
compression and collapse of the powerful magnetosphere of giant planets are
possible, with a successive generation of the radio bursts. According to our
estimations, the corresponding rate the radio bursts is ~0.01-1 bursts per year
with the maximum spectral flux ~30mJy at the frequencies ~3GHz and with a
duration of the each burst ~1.5 hours. These signals are available for
registration by the existing radio telescopes.
