Using the explicit numerical solution of the axially-symmetric
Gross-Pitaevskii equation we study the oscillation of the Bose-Einstein
condensate induced by a periodic variation in the atomic scattering length $a$.
When the frequency of oscillation of $a$ is an even multiple of the radial or
axial trap frequency, respectively, the radial or axial oscillation of the
condensate exhibits resonance with novel feature. In this nonlinear problem
without damping, at resonance in the steady state the amplitude of oscillation
passes through maximum and minimum. Such growth and decay cycle of the
amplitude may keep on repeating. Similar behavior is also observed in a
rotating Bose-Einstein condensate.
