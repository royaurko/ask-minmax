We present a systematic study of the dijet suppression at RHIC using the
VNI/BMS parton cascade. We examine the modification of the dijet asymmetry A_j
and the within-cone transverse energy distribution (jet-shape) along with
partonic fragmentation distributions z and j_t in terms of: qhat; the path
length of leading and sub-leading jets; cuts on the jet energy distributions;
jet cone angle and the jet-medium interaction mechanism. We find that A_j is
most sensitive to qhat and relatively insensitive to the nature of the
jet-medium interaction mechanism. The jet profile is dominated by qhat and the
nature of the interaction mechanism. The partonic fragmentation distributions
clearly show the jet modification and differentiate between elastic and
radiative+elastic modes.
