We propose a stochastic mean field model of heat engine partitioned by a
finite-mass piston. The time evolution equations for the density and the
temperature of the enclosed gas are proposed, taking into account the
stochastic equation of motion of the piston, and the energy conservation for
the gas. Though the heat cycle consisting of finite-time heating and cooling
processes is under strong non-equilibrium situations, i. e., the ratio of
temperatures of two reservoirs is large, we analyze the efficiency and the
power, and derive the semi-analytical expression for the efficiency. We find
that the obtained efficiency at the maximum power operation is close to the
Chambadal-Novikov-Curzon-Ahlborn (CNCA) efficiency, if the piston is
sufficiently heavy and elastic for collisions with particles, even when the
system is far from equilibrium. However, the extra heat due to the finiteness
of the piston-mass or its inelasticity lowers the efficiency from the CNCA
efficiency. The results of our stochastic mean field model are consistent with
those for our event driven molecular dynamics simulation.
