Let K be a random variable following a truncated exponential distribution.
Such distributions are described by a single parameter here denoted by
$\gamma$. The determination of $\gamma$ by Maximum Likelihood methods leads to
a transcendental equation. We note that this can be solved in terms of the
inverse Langevin function. We develop approximations to this guided by work of
Suehrcke and McCormick.
