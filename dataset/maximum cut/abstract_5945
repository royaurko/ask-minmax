We discuss what is an appropriate set of explanatory variables in order to
predict the absolute magnitude at the maximum of Type Ia supernovae. In order
to have a good prediction, the error for future data, which is called the
"generalization error," should be small. We use cross-validation in order to
control the generalization error and LASSO-type estimator in order to choose
the set of variables. This approach can be used even in the case that the
number of samples is smaller than the number of candidate variables. We studied
the Berkeley supernova database with our approach. Candidates of the
explanatory variables include normalized spectral data, variables about lines,
and previously proposed flux-ratios, as well as the color and light-curve
widths. As a result, we confirmed the past understanding about Type Ia
supernova: i) The absolute magnitude at maximum depends on the color and
light-curve width. ii) The light-curve width depends on the strength of Si II.
Recent studies have suggested to add more variables in order to explain the
absolute magnitude. However, our analysis does not support to add any other
variables in order to have a better generalization error.
