Long slit spectroscopic data for 7 early-type galaxies with X-ray emission
have been analyzed to derive velocity dispersion and radial velocity profiles.
Major axis rotation curves out to $R\sim R_e$ are presented. Adding these new
data to those available in the literature, we have built a sample of early-type
galaxies with detected X-ray emission and known kinematics (central velocity
dispersion $\sigma_0$ and maximum rotational velocity $v_r$). Using this sample
we investigate from an observational point of view the role of rotation and
flattening on the X-ray emission, particularly with regard to the X-ray
underluminosity of flat systems. The trend between the X-ray to optical ratio
$L_X/L_B$, a measure of the hot gas content of the galaxies, and $v_r/\sigma_0$
is L-shaped, with the X-ray brightest objects confined at $v_r/\sigma_0 <0.4$,
both for Es and S0s. Neither for low or intermediate, nor for high $L_X/L_B$,
there is any clear correlation between X-ray emission and rotational
properties. The trend between $L_X/L_B$ and the ellipticity $\epsilon$ is also
L-shaped: there are no high $L_X/L_B$ objects with high $\epsilon$. The
existence of a relation between $v_r/\sigma_0$ and $\epsilon$ makes it
difficult to assess whether rotation or flattening is at the basis of the
trends found. Our observational findings are finally discussed in connection
with the effects that rotation and flattening are predicted to have in the
cooling flow and in the wind/outflow/inflow scenarios.
