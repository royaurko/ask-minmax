Neutron-deuteron scattering in the context of ``pion-less'' Effective Field
Theory at very low energies is investigated to next-to-next-to-leading order.
Convergence is improved by fitting the two-nucleon contact interactions to the
tail of the deuteron wave-function, a procedure known as Z-parameterisation and
extended here to the three-nucleon system. The improvement is particularly
striking in the doublet-S wave (triton) channel, where better agreement to
potential-model calculations and better convergence from order to order in the
power counting is achieved for momenta as high as \sim 120 MeV. Investigating
the cut-off dependence of the phase-shifts, one confirms numerically the
analytical finding that the first momentum-dependent three-body force enters at
N2LO. The other partial waves converge also substantially faster.
Effective-range parameters of the nd-system are determined, e.g. for the
quartet-S-wave scattering length a_q=[6.35\pm0.02] fm, which compares
favourably both in magnitude and uncertainty with recent high-precision
potential-model determinations. Differential cross-sections up to
E_{lab}\approx 15 MeV agree with data.
