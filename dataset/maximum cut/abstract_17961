Query Expansion using Pseudo Relevance Feedback is a useful and a popular
technique for reformulating the query. In our proposed query expansion method,
we assume that relevant information can be found within a document near the
central idea. The document is normally divided into sections, paragraphs and
lines. The proposed method tries to extract keywords that are closer to the
central theme of the document. The expansion terms are obtained by
equi-frequency partition of the documents obtained from pseudo relevance
feedback and by using tf-idf scores. The idf factor is calculated for number of
partitions in documents. The group of words for query expansion is selected
using the following approaches: the highest score, average score and a group of
words that has maximum number of keywords. As each query behaved differently
for different methods, the effect of these methods in selecting the words for
query expansion is investigated. From this initial study, we extend the
experiment to develop a rule-based statistical model that automatically selects
the best group of words incorporating the tf-idf scoring and the 3 approaches
explained here, in the future. The experiments were performed on FIRE 2011
Adhoc Hindi and English test collections on 50 queries each, using Terrier as
retrieval engine.
