We study the reconstruction of the source function in space-time directly
from the measured HBT correlation function using the Maximum Entropy Principle.
We find that the problem is ill-defined without at least one additional
theoretical constraint as input. Using the requirement of a finite source
lifetime for the latter we find a new Gaussian parametrization of the source
function directly in terms of the measured HBT radius parameters and its
lifetime, where the latter is a free parameter which is not directly measurable
by HBT. We discuss the implications of our results for the remaining freedom in
building source models consistent with a given set of measured HBT radius
parameters.
