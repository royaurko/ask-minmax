The measurement of top quark spin correlation is an important tool for
precise studies of top quark interactions. In this letter I construct a
quantization axis maximizing the spin correlation at the LHC within the
Standard Model. Using this axis a spin correlation of 48% or even more, on
applying additional cuts, can be reached. This represents a significant
improvement compared to the helicity bases studied thus far.
