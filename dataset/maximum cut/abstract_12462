We study D- and DF-strings in a D3${\bar {\rm D}}3$ system by using
Dirac-Born-Infeld type action. In the presence of an electric flux from the
transverse direction, we discuss gravitating thick D-string solutions of a
spatial manifold, ${\rm S}^{2}\times {\rm R}^{1}$, in which straight D-strings
stretched along the R${}^{1}$ direction are attached to the south and north
poles of the two-sphere. There is a horizon along its equator, which means the
structure of black strings is formed. We also discuss the BPS limit for thin
parallel D- and DF-strings in both flat and curved spacetime. We obtain the BPS
sum rule for an arbitrarily-separated multi-string configuration with a
Gaussian type tachyon potential. At the site of each thin BPS D(F)-string, the
pressure takes a finite value. We find that there exists a maximum deficit
angle $\pi$ in the conical geometry induced by thin BPS D- and DF-strings.
