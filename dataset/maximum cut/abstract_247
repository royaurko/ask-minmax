A method to separate pentagon contributions from the evaluation of the cut
constructible part of primitive amplitudes within the framework of
D-dimensional unitarity is proposed. The cut constructible part is thus
reconstructed with significantly higher accuracy as demonstrated by the
numerical analysis presented here.
