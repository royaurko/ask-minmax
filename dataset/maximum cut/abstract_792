The production of gluons in a jet is considered in limited phase space,
either with a cut in transverse momentum with respect to the jet axis
$k_\perp<k_\perp^{cut}$ or with a cut in absolute momentum $|\vec{k} |
<k^{cut}$. It is shown in the perturbative QCD calculations that in the soft
limit $k_\perp^{cut} \to 0$ the multiplicity distribution becomes Poissonian,
whereas for $k^{cut} \to 0$ the distribution remains non-Poissonian. The
Poissonian limit is a consequence of the soft gluon coherence in the genuine
multiparticle correlations. We also investigate how incoherent hadronization
processes could possibly modify the predictions for small cut-off parameters.
