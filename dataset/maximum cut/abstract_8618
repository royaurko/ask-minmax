A study of charm fragmentation into $D_s^{*+}$ and $D_s^+$ in $e^+e^-$
annihilations at $\sqrt{s}$=10.5 GeV is presented. This study using $4.72 \pm
0.05$ fb$^{-1}$ of CLEO II data reports measurements of the cross-sections
$\sigma(D_s^{*+})$ and $\sigma(D_s^+)$ in momentum regions above $x=0.44$,
where $x$ is the $D_s$ momentum divided by the maximum kinematically allowed
$D_s$ momentum. The $D_s$ vector to vector plus pseudoscalar production ratio
is measured to be $P_V(x(D_s^+)>0.44)=0.44\pm0.04$
