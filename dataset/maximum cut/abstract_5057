We use series expansion techniques for analyzing properties of the phase
transition between the Mott insulating and superfluid phase for bosons on the
kagome lattice, and the multicritical point in the ground-state phase diagram
for unit-filling is calculated. It is seen that of the clusters that contribute
with non-zero weights to the ground state energy, many contain rings. The decay
exponents of ground state correlations are also obtained within the Mott phase.
For single-particle excited states, quasiparticle dispersion and effective
masses for particles and holes are computed along certain symmetry cuts in the
first Brillouin zone. Furthermore at eighth order, the coherence-length
critical exponent is found to be comparably close to that of the 3D XY model.
