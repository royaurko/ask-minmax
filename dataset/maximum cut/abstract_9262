We report the effect on the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of a
Nb film proximity coupled to the synthetic antiferromagnet Fe/{Cr/Fe}_(N-1). We
find that there is a parity dependence of Tc on the total number of Fe layers,
N; locally Tc is always a maximum when N is even, and a minimum when N is odd.
The Fe electron mean free path and coherence length are indicative of dirty
limit behavior; as such, we numerically model our data using the linearized
Usadel equations with good correlation.
