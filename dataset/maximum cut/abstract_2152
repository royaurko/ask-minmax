In weakly interacting quark-gluon plasmas diffusion of color is found to be
much slower than the diffusion of spin and flavor because color is easily
exchanged by the gluons in the very singular forward scattering processes.  If
the infrared divergence is cut off by a magnetic mass, $m_{mag}\sim \alpha_sT$,
the color diffusion is $D_{color}\sim (\alpha_s\ln(1/\alpha_s)T)^{-1}$, a
factor $\alpha_s$ smaller than spin and flavor diffusion. A similar effect is
expected in electroweak plasmas above $M_W$ due to $W^\pm$ exchanges. The color
conductivity in quark-gluon plasmas and the electrical conductivity in
electroweak plasmas are correspondingly small in relativistic heavy ion
collisions and the very early universe.
