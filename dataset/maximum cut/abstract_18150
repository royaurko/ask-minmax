High magnetic fields (> 1 T) are measured by NMR magnetometers with
un-rivaled precision if the precessing spin sample provides long coherence
times. The longest coherence times are found in diluted ${}^{3}$He samples,
which can be hyperpolarized for sufficient signal strength. In order to have
minimal influence on the homogeneity and value of the measured magnetic field
the optimal container for the ${}^{3}$He should be a perfect sphere. A fused
silica sphere with an inner diameter of 8 mm and an outer diameter of 12 mm was
made from two hemispheres by diffusion bonding leaving only a small hole for
cleaning and evacuation. This hole was closed in vacuum by a CO${}_{2}$ laser
and the inner volume was filled with a few mbars of ${}^3$He via wall
permeation. NMR-measurements on such a sample had coherence times of 5 min.
While the hemispheres were produced with < 1 $\mu$m deviation from sphericity,
the bonding left a step of ca. 50 $\mu$m at maximum. The influence of such a
mismatch, its orientation and materials in the direct vicinity of the sample
are analyzed by FEM-simulations and discussed in view of coherence times and
absolute fields.
