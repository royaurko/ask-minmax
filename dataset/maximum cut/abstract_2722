Whispering gallery modes in birefringent crystalline resonators are
investigated. We experimentally investigate the XY--cut resonators made with
LiNbO$_3$, LiTaO$_3$ and BBO and observe strong influence of the resonator's
shape and birefringence on the quality factor of the extraordinary polarized
modes. We show that extraordinary modes can have lower Q and even be suppressed
due to polarization conversion loss. The ordinary ray modes retain the high Q
due to inhibited reflection phenomenon.
