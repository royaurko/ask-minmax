We studied the magnetic properties of bulk LaCrO3; a GdFeO3-type distorted
perovskite, with a predominant antiferromagnetic phase transition at ~ 290 K.
The bulk LaCrO3 exhibits intrinsic weak ferromagnetism at room temperature,
which may arise due to the tilting of CrO6 octahedra, resulting in a non-zero
net magnetic moment, as confirmed from the magnetization measurements. A broad
magnetically-induced entropy change (-{\Delta}S) is observed with the maximum
at 290 K, close to room temperature in LaCrO3 system.
