The renormalisation of NN scattering in theories with zero-range interactions
is examined using a cut-off regularisation and taking the cut-off to infinity.
Inclusion of contact interactions that depend on energy as well as momentum
allows the effective range to be fitted to experiment with any desired sign or
magnitude. However, power counting breaks down: terms of different orders in
the potential can contribute to the scattering amplitude at the same order.
