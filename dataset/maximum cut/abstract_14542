One of the ultimate goals of Manifold Learning (ML) is to reconstruct an
unknown nonlinear low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional
observation space by a given set of data points from the manifold. We derive a
local lower bound for the maximum reconstruction error in a small neighborhood
of an arbitrary point. The lower bound is defined in terms of the distance
between tangent spaces to the original manifold and the estimated manifold at
the considered point and reconstructed point, respectively. We propose an
amplification of the ML, called Tangent Bundle ML, in which the proximity not
only between the original manifold and its estimator but also between their
tangent spaces is required. We present a new algorithm that solves this problem
and gives a new solution for the ML also.
