The jet-jet profile, or detailed manner, in which transverse energy and mass
are distributed around the jet-jet system resulting from the hadronic decay of
a $Z$ boson in the process Higgs$\to ZZ$ at a proton-proton collider energy of
$40\tev$ is carefully examined. Two observables are defined that can be used to
help distinguish the $\ell^+\ell^-$-jet-jet signal from Higgs decay from the
``ordinary'' QCD background arising from the large transverse momentum
production of single $Z$ bosons plus the associated jets. By making cuts on
these observables, signal to background enhancement factors greater than $100$
can be obtained.
