A numerical study of the Faddeev equation for bosons is made with two-body
interactions at or close to the Unitary limit. Separable interactions are
obtained from phase-shifts defined by scattering length and effective range. In
EFT-language this would correspond to NLO. Both ground and Efimov state
energies are calculated. For effective ranges $r_0 > 0$ and rank-1 potentials
the total energy $E_T$ is found to converge with momentum cut-off $\Lambda$ for
$\Lambda > \sim 10/r_0$ . In the Unitary limit ($1/a=r_0= 0$) the energy does
however diverge. It is shown (analytically) that in this case
$E_T=E_u\Lambda^2$. Calculations give $E_u=-0.108$ for the ground state and
$E_u=-1.\times10^{-4}$ for the single Efimov state found. The cut-off
divergence is remedied by modifying the off-shell t-matrix by replacing the
rank-1 by a rank-2 phase-shift equivalent potential. This is somewhat similar
to the counterterm method suggested by Bedaque et al. This investigation is
exploratory and does not refer to any specific physical system.
