The diquark exotics which couple to a pair of quarks are predicted by the
Compositeness and Superstring inspired E_{6} model. We study the single
production of scalar diquarks at LHeC based gamma p collider options. The
background for three jet final states are examined through appropriate
kinematical cuts. We discuss the possibility of measurements for the charges of
scalar diquarks (qq and qq').
