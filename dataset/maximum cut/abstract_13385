This paper presents a feedback/feedforward nonlinear controller for
variable-speed wind turbines with doubly fed induction generators. By
appropriately adjusting the rotor voltages and the blade pitch angle, the
controller simultaneously enables: (a) control of the active power in both the
maximum power tracking and power regulation modes, (b) seamless switching
between the two modes, and (c) control of the reactive power so that a
desirable power factor is maintained. Unlike many existing designs, the
controller is developed based on original, nonlinear,
electromechanically-coupled models of wind turbines, without attempting
approximate linearization. Its development consists of three steps: (i) employ
feedback linearization to exactly cancel some of the nonlinearities and perform
arbitrary pole placement, (ii) design a speed controller that makes the rotor
angular velocity track a desired reference whenever possible, and (iii)
introduce a Lyapunov-like function and present a gradient-based approach for
minimizing this function. The effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated
through simulation of a wind turbine operating under several scenarios.
