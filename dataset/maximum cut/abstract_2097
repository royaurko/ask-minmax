We construct thin shell Lorentzian wormholes in higher dimensional
Einstein-Maxwell theory applying the ' Cut and Paste ' technique proposed by
Visser. The linearized stability is analyzed under radial perturbations around
some assumed higher dimensional spherically symmetric static solution of the
Einstein field equations in presence of Electromagnetic field. We determine the
total amount of exotic matter, which is concentrated at the wormhole throat.
