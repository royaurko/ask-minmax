The differential energy spectrum of the cosmic radiation from solar
modulation energies up to 5x10**19 eV is correctly predicted by a recent theory
of the knee and ankle which uses only one normalization point. This remarkable
quantitative result, spanning over many decades in energy and intensity, along
with the existence of the second knee at 6x10**17 eV, is obtained assuming
constant spectral indices of individual ions at the cosmic-ray sources and no
other critical hypotheses. In this study the chemical composition of the cosmic
radiation is evaluated as a direct consequence of the theory. The computed mean
logarithmic mass exhibits a rising trend from 1.8 to 3.0 in the range
10**15-10**17 eV, a maximum value of 3.2 at 3x10**17 eV, and a characteristic
lightening above 3x10**17 eV up to 4x10**18 eV. All of these distinctive
features are in accord with the data of many experiments. Two additional
consequences intrinsic to the theory are qualitatively discussed: (1) some
limitative bounds on the mechanism accelerating cosmic rays; (2) the degree of
isotropy implied by the residence time of the cosmic rays in the Galaxy.
