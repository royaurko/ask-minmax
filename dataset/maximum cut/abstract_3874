Cut-sky orthogonal mode analyses of the COBE-DMR 53 and 90 GHz sky maps are
used to determine the normalization of a variety of open cosmogonical models
based on the cold dark matter scenario. To constrain the allowed
cosmological-parameter range for these open cosmogonies, the predictions of the
DMR-normalized models are compared to various observational measures of
cosmography and large-scale structure, viz.: the age of the universe;
small-scale dynamical estimates of the clustered-mass density parameter
(Omega_0); constraints on the Hubble parameter (h), the X-ray cluster
baryonic-mass fraction (Omega_B/Omega_0), and the matter power spectrum shape
parameter; estimates of the mass perturbation amplitude; and constraints on the
large-scale peculiar velocity field. The open-bubble inflation model is
consistent with current determinations of the 95% confidence level range of
these observational constraints.
