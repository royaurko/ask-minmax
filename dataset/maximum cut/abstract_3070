We report thermal-expansion and specific-heat data of the series
La_1-xCa_xCoO_3 for 0 <= x <= 0.3. For x = 0 the thermal-expansion coefficient
alpha(T) features a pronounced maximum around T = 50 K caused by a
temperature-dependent spin-state transition from a low-spin state (S=0) at low
temperatures towards a higher spin state of the Co^3+ ions. The partial
substitution of the La^3+ ions by divalent Ca^2+ ions causes drastic changes in
the macroscopic properties of LaCoO_3. Around x ~ 0.125 the large maximum in
alpha(T) has completely vanished. With further increasing x three different
anomalies develop.
