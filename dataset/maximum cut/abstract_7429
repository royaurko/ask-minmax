We investigate the 21 cm signals from the UV ionizing sources in the
reionization epoch. The formation and evolution of 21 cm emission and
absorption regions depend essentially on the kinetics of photons in the
physical and frequency spaces. To solve the radiative transfer equation, we use
the WENO algorithm, which is effective to capture the sharp ionization profile
and the cut-off at the front of light $(r=ct)$ and to handle the small fraction
of neutral hydrogen and helium in the ionized sphere. We show that a spherical
shell of 21 cm emission and absorption will develop around a point source once
the speed of the ionization front (I-front) is significantly lower than the
speed of light. The 21 cm shell extends from the I-front to the front of light;
its inner part is the emission region and its outer part is the absorption
region. The 21 cm emission region depends strongly on the intensity,
frequency-spectrum and life-time of the UV ionizing source. For a source of
short life-time, no 21 cm emission region can be formed if the source dies out
before the I-front speed is significantly lower than the speed of light. Yet, a
21 cm absorption region can form and develop even after the emission of the
source ceases.
