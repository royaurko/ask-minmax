In this paper we extend the results of Kirwan et alii on convexity properties
of the moment map for Hamiltonian group actions, and on the connectedness of
the fibers of the moment map, to the case of non-compact orbifolds.
 Our motivation is twofold. First, the category of orbifolds is important in
symplectic geometry because, generically, the symplectic quotient of a
symplectic manifold is an orbifold. Second, our proof is conceptually very
simple since it reduces the non-abelian case to the abelian case.
