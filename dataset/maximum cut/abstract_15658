We have measured the 3He(e,e'pp)n reaction at an incident energy of 4.7 GeV
over a wide kinematic range. We identified spectator correlated pp and pn
nucleon pairs using kinematic cuts and measured their relative and total
momentum distributions. This is the first measurement of the ratio of pp to pn
pairs as a function of pair total momentum, $p_{tot}$. For pair relative
momenta between 0.3 and 0.5 GeV/c, the ratio is very small at low $p_{tot}$ and
rises to approximately 0.5 at large $p_{tot}$. This shows the dominance of
tensor over central correlations at this relative momentum.
