We discuss $\beta$-equilibrated and charge neutral matter involving hyperons
and $\bar K$ condensates within relativistic models. It is observed that
populations of baryons are strongly affected by the presence of antikaon
condensates. Also, the equation of state including $\bar K$ condensates becomes
softer resulting in a smaller maximum mass neutron star.
