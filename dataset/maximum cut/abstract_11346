Weak gravitational lensing observations probe the spectrum and evolution of
density fluctuations and the cosmological parameters which govern them but are
currently limited to small fields and subject to selection biases. We show how
the expected signal from large-scale structure arises from the contributions
from and correlations between individual halos. We determine the convergence
power spectrum as a function of the maximum halo mass and so provide the means
to interpret results from surveys that lack high mass halos either through
selection criteria or small fields. Since shot noise from rare massive halos is
mainly responsible for the sample variance below 10', our method should aid our
ability to extract cosmological information from small fields.
