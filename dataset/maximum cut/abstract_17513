We propose and analyze a combined finite volume--nonconforming finite element
scheme on general meshes to simulate the two compressible phase flow in porous
media. The diffusion term, which can be anisotropic and heterogeneous, is
discretized by piecewise linear nonconforming triangular finite elements. The
other terms are discretized by means of a cell-centered finite volume scheme on
a dual mesh, where the dual volumes are constructed around the sides of the
original mesh. The relative permeability of each phase is decentred according
the sign of the velocity at the dual interface. This technique also ensures the
validity of the discrete maximum principle for the saturation under a non
restrictive shape regularity of the space mesh and the positiveness of all
transmissibilities. Next, a priori estimates on the pressures and a function of
the saturation that denote capillary terms are established. These stabilities
results lead to some compactness arguments based on the use of the Kolmogorov
compactness theorem, and allow us to derive the convergence of a subsequence of
the sequence of approximate solutions to a weak solution of the continuous
equations, provided the mesh size tends to zero. The proof is given for the
complete system when the density of the each phase depends on the own pressure.
