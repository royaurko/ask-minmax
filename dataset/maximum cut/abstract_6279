We investigate the condensation of $\bar K^0$ meson along with $K^-$
condensation in the neutrino trapped matter with and without hyperons.
Calculations are performed in the relativistic mean field models in which both
the baryon-baryon and (anti)kaon-baryon interactions are mediated by meson
exchange. In the neutrino trapped matter relevant to protoneutron stars, the
critical density of $K^-$ condensation is shifted considerably to higher
density whereas that of $\bar K^0$ condensation is shifted slightly to higher
density with respect to that of the neutrino free case. The onset of $K^-$
condensation always occurs earlier than that of $\bar K^0$ condensation. A
significant region of maximum mass protoneutron stars is found to contain $\bar
K^0$ condensate for larger values of the antikaon potential. With the
appearance of $\bar K^0$ condensation, there is a region of symmetric nuclear
matter in the inner core of a protoneutron star. It is found that the maximum
mass of a protoneutron star containing $K^-$ and $\bar K^0$ condensate is
greater than that of the corresponding neutron star. We revisit the implication
of this scenario in the context of the metastability of protoneutron stars and
their evolution to low mass black holes.
