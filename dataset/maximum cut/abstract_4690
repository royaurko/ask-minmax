Lattice simulations employing reweighting and Taylor expansion techniques
have predicted a (\mu,T)-phase diagram according to general expectations, with
an analytic quark-hadron crossover at \mu=0 turning into a first order
transition at some critical chemical potential \mu_E. By contrast, recent
simulations using imgainary \mu followed by analytic continuation obtained a
critical structure in the {m_{u,d},m_s,T,\mu} parameter space favouring the
absence of a critical point and first order line. I review the evidence for the
latter scenario, arguing that the various raw data are not inconsistent with
each other. Rather, the discrepancy appears when attempting to extract
continuum results from the coarse (N_t=4) lattices simulated so far, and can be
explained by cut-off effects. New (as yet unpublished) data are presented,
which for N_f=3 and on N_t=4 confirm the scenario without a critical point.
Moreover, simulations on finer N_t=6 lattices show that even if there is a
critical point, continuum extrapolation moves it to significantly larger values
of \mu_E than anticipated on coarse lattices.
