We report on a novel optofluidic system consisting of a silica-based 1D
photonic crystal, integrated planar waveguides and electrically insulated
fluidic channels. An array of pillars in a microfluidic channel designed for
electrochromatography is used as a resonator for on-column label-free
refractive index detection. The resonator was fabricated in a silicon
oxynitride platform, to support electroosmotic flow, and operated at 1.55
microns. Different aqueous solutions of ethanol with refractive indices ranging
from n = 1.3330 to 1.3616 were pumped into the column/resonator and the
transmission spectra were recorded. Linear shifts of the resonant wavelengths
yielded a maximum sensitivity of 480 nm/RIU and a minimum difference of 0.007
RIU was measured.
