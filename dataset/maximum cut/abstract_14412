We study the ground-state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 J1-J2 Heisenberg
model on the square lattice with an accurate Bosonic resonating valence-bond
(RVB) wave function. In contrast to the RVB ansatz based on Schwinger Fermions,
the representation based on Schwinger Bosons, supplemented by a variational
Monte Carlo technique enforcing the exact projection onto the physical
subspace, is able to describe a fully gapped spin liquid in the strongly
frustrated regime. In particular, a fully symmetric Z2 spin liquid is stable
between two antiferromagnetic phases; a continuous transition at J2=0.4J1, when
the Marshall sign rule begins to be essentially violated, and a first-order
transition around J2=0.6J1 are present. Most importantly, the triplet gap is
found to have a non-monotonic behavior, reaching a maximum around J2=0.51J1,
when the lowest spinon excitation moves from the \Gamma to the M point, i.e.,
k=(\pi,0).
