The intimate relationship between coherent states and geodesics is pointed
out. For homogenous manifolds on which the exponential from the Lie algebra to
the Lie group equals the geodesic exponential, and in particular for symmetric
spaces, it is proved that the cut locus of the point $0$ is equal to the set of
coherent vectors orthogonal to $\vert 0>$. A simple method to calculate the
conjugate locus in Hermitian symmetric spaces with significance in the coherent
state approach is presented. The results are illustrated on the complex
Grassmann manifold.
