A long-term decrease in downward surface solar radiation from the 1950s to
the 1980s ("global dimming") followed by a multi-decadal increase up to the
present ("brightening") have been detected in many regions worldwide. In
addition, some researchers have suggested the existence of an "early
brightening" period in the first half of 20th century. However, this latter
phenomenon is an open issue due to the opposite results found in literature and
the scarcity of solar radiation data during this period. This paper contributes
to this relevant discussion analyzing, for the first time in Southern Europe,
the atmospheric column transparency derived from pyrheliometer measurements in
Madrid (Spain) for the period 1911-1928. This time series is one of the three
longest dataset during the first quarter of the 20th century in Europe. The
results showed the great effects of the Katmai eruption (June 1912, Alaska) on
transparency values during 1912-1913 with maximum relative anomalies around 8%.
Outside the period affected by this volcano, the atmospheric transparency
exhibited a stable behavior with a slight negative trend without any
statistical significance on an annual and seasonal basis. Overall, there is no
evidence of a possible early brightening period in direct solar radiation in
Madrid. This phenomenon is currently an open issue and further research is
needed using the few sites with available experimental records during the first
half of the 20th century.
