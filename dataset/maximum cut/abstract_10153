We investigate the stationary state of a model system evolving according to a
modified focusing truncated nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) used to
describe the envelope of Langmuir waves in a plasma. We restrict the system to
have a finite number of normal modes each of which is in contact with a
Langevin heat bath at temperature $T$. Arbitrarily large realizations of the
field are prevented by restricting each mode to a maximum amplitude. We
consider a simple modeling of wave-breaking in which each mode is set equal to
zero when it reaches its maximum amplitude. Without wave-breaking the
stationary state is given by a Gibbs measure. With wave-breaking the system
attains a nonequilibrium stationary state which is the unique invariant measure
of the time evolution. A mean field analysis shows that the system exhibits a
transition from a regime of low field values at small $|\lambda|$, to a regime
of higher field values at large $|\lambda|$, where $\lambda<0$ specifies the
strength of the nonlinearity in the focusing case. Field values at large
$|\lambda|$ are significantly smaller with wave-breaking than without
wave-breaking.
