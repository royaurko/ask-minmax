We propose iterative proportional scaling (IPS) via decomposable submodels
for maximizing likelihood function of a hierarchical model for contingency
tables. In ordinary IPS the proportional scaling is performed by cycling
through the elements of the generating class of a hierarchical model. We
propose to adjust more marginals at each step. This is accomplished by
expressing the generating class as a union of decomposable submodels and
cycling through the decomposable models. We prove convergence of our proposed
procedure, if the amount of scaling is adjusted properly at each step. We also
analyze the proposed algorithms around the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) in
detail. Faster convergence of our proposed procedure is illustrated by
numerical examples.
