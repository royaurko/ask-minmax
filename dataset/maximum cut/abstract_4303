We investigate the probability to find a b or tau in SUSY production with the
mSUGRA model. We find that in the entire parameter space the probability per
event to find a b-jet of E_T^b > 50 GeV within CMS acceptance (eta < 2.4) is
significant for all tan(beta), varying from a 10 % level to 90 % depending on
the m_0, m_1/2 region. The probabilities per event to find a tau with the same
kinematical cuts is also significant and it increases sharply with tan(beta).
These findings point to the central role a microvertex device would play in
case that SUSY (mSUGRA) is indeed realized in nature and found at the LHC.
First investigations done in the context of the more general MSSM scenario
confirm the findings based on mSUGRA.
