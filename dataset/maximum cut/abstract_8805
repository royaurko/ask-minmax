We define a centrally symmetric analogue of the cyclic polytope and study its
facial structure. We conjecture that our polytopes provide asymptotically the
largest number of faces in all dimensions among all centrally symmetric
polytopes with n vertices of a given even dimension d=2k when d is fixed and n
grows. For a fixed even dimension d=2k and an integer 0< j <k we prove that the
maximum possible number of j-dimensional faces of a centrally symmetric
d-dimensional polytope with n vertices is at least (c_j(d)+o(1)) {n \choose
j+1} for some c_j(d)>0 and at most (1-2^{-d}+o(1)){n \choose j+1} as n grows.
We show that c_1(d) \geq (d-2)/(d-1).
