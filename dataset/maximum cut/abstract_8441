We study a model for water with a tunable intra-molecular interaction
$J_\sigma$, using mean field theory and off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations.
For all $J_\sigma\geq 0$, the model displays a temperature of maximum
density.For a finite intra-molecular interaction $J_\sigma > 0$,our
calculations support the presence of a liquid-liquid phase transition with a
possible liquid-liquid critical point for water, likely pre-empted by
inevitable freezing. For J=0 the liquid-liquid critical point disappears at
T=0.
