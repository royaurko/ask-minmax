Low-energy quasiparticle excitations in the superconducting (SC) state of
UBe$_{13}$ were studied by means of specific-heat ($C$) measurements in a
rotating field. Quite unexpectedly, the magnetic-field dependence of $C(H)$ is
linear in $H$ with no angular dependence at low fields in the SC state,
implying that the gap is fully open over the Fermi surfaces, in stark contrast
to the previous expectation. In addition, a characteristic cubic anisotropy of
$C(H)$ was observed above 2~T with a maximum (minimum) for $H$ $||$ $[001]$
($[111]$) within the $(1\bar{1}0)$ plane, both in the normal as well as in the
SC states. This oscillation possibly originates from the anisotropic response
of the heavy quasiparticle bands, and might be a key to understand the unusual
properties of UBe$_{13}$.
