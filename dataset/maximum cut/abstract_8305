We propose a new multi-object spectrograph for the VLT. MAXIMUS (MAXimum
MUltiplex Spectrograph) will fully exploit the multiplexing capabilities of the
OzPoz fibre positioner in order to extend and complement FLAMES and VIMOS in
covering observational parameter space, and to meet the increasing demand for
multi-object spectroscopy by ESO users in the next decade.
