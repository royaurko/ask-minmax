The Schinzel hypothesis claims (but it seems hopeless to prove) that any
irreducible Q[x] polynomial without a constant factor assumes infinitely many
prime values at integer places. On the other hand, it is easy to see that a
reducible Q[x] polynomial can have only finitely many such places. In this
paper we prove that a reducible Z[x] polynomial of degree n (where n is not 4
or 5) can have at most n+2 such places, and there exist examples with n+1
places. If the Schinzel hypothesis and the k-prime-tuple conjecture are true,
then there are also polynomials with n+2 such places. (For n=4 or 5 the maximum
possible value is 8.) If a Z[x] polynomial is the product of two non-constant
integer-valued Q[x] polynomials, then there are at most 1.87234...n+o(n) such
places. Even in this case, the number of integer places with positive prime
values is at most n. More generally, if f=gh \in R[x] is a product of two
non-constant real polynomials, then the number of real places x such that
|g(x)|=1 or |h(x)=1|, while f(x)>1, is at most n. For a natural complex version
of this last statement we give a counterexample. Furthermore, we briefly
consider the generalized problem of assuming values in a fixed finite set of
integers.
