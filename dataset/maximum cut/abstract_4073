Losses as function of the a.c. magnetic field amplitude ($B_0$) were measured
at 77 K in untwisted BSCCO(2223)/Ag tapes, at different frequencies, by
measuring the imaginary part of the a.c. susceptibility. In particular, loss
measurements were performed in the portions of the same tape, obtained by
cutting it in pieces with different length, starting from around 12 cm down to
1 cm. The results show that the measured losses depend on the sample length but
this observed behaviour is not always due to the coupling mechanism among the
filaments. In this work we discuss the observed experimental behaviour of
different typology of tapes by analysing data comparing them with analytical
models in order to fully characterize the tapes with regard to the coupling
mechanism.
