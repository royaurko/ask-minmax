We study experimentally the fluctuations of the injected and dissipated
energy in a system of a colloidal particle trapped in a double well potential
periodically modulated by an external perturbation. The work done by the
external force and the dissipated energy are measured close to the stochastic
resonance where the injected power is maximum. We show that the steady state
fluctuation theorem holds in this system.
