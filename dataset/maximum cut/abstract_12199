Ballistic transportation introduces new challenges in the thermodynamic
properties of a gas of particles. For example, violation of mixing, ergodicity
and of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem may occur, since all these processes
are connected. In this work, we obtain results for all ranges of diffusion,
i.e., both for subdiffusion and superdiffusion, where the bath is such that it
gives origin to a colored noise. In this way we obtain the skewness and the
non-Gaussian factor for the probability distribution function of the dynamical
variable. We put particular emphasis on ballistic diffusion, and we demonstrate
that in this case, although the second law of thermodynamics is preserved, the
entropy does not reach a maximum and a non-Gaussian behavior occurs. This
implies the non-applicability of the central limit theorem.
