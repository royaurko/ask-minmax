We present the discovery of three new Scattered Kuiper Belt Objects (SKBOs)
from a wide-field survey of the ecliptic. This continuing survey has to date
covered 20.2 square degrees to a limiting red magnitude of 23.6. We combine the
data from this new survey with an existing survey conducted at the University
of Hawaii 2.2m telescope to constrain the number and mass of the SKBOs. The
SKBOs are characterized by large eccentricities, perihelia near 35 AU, and
semi-major axes > 50 AU. Using a maximum-likelihood model, we estimate the
total number of SKBOs larger than 100 km in diameter to be N = 3.1 (+1.9/-1.3)
x 10^4 (1 sigma) and the total mass of SKBOs to be about 0.05 Earth masses,
demonstrating that the SKBOs are similar in number and mass to the Kuiper Belt
inside 50 AU.
