The asymptotic behavior as t\to\infty and r\to\infty of the hard-thermal-loop
propagator D^{\mu\nu}(t,r) is computed in the Coulomb gauge. The asymptotic
falloff is always a power law though generally different in the deep time-like
and space-like regions. The contributions of quasiparticle poles and Landau
branch cuts are computed. The most difficult calculation is the contribution of
the branch cut in the transverse propagator D^{ij}(t,r). For QED this produces
a leading behavior of order T/r in both the time-like and space-like regions.
The inclusion of a magnetic mass so as to describe QCD makes the leading
behavior 1/(Tr^{3}), thus improving the infrared convergence. The asymptotic
space-like behavior of all contributions (longitudinal and transverse, poles
and cuts) is confirmed by also computing in the Euclidean formalism and
analytically continuing. The results are compared will those for free gauge
bosons at finite temperature.
