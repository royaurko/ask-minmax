We study the expected X-ray luminosity of stellar merger products several
years after merger. The X-ray emission is assumed to result from magnetic
activity. The extended envelope of the merger product possesses a large
convective region and it is expected to rotate fast. The rotation and
convection might give rise to an efficient dynamo operation, therefore we
expect strong magnetic activity. Using well known relations connecting magnetic
activity and X-ray luminosity in other types of magnetically active stars, we
estimate that the strong X-ray luminosity will start several years after
merger, will reach a maximum of L_x~3x10^{30} erg/sec, and will slowly decline
on a time scale of ~100 years. We predict that X-ray emission from V838 Mon
which erupted in 2002 will be detected in 2008 with 20 hours of observation.
