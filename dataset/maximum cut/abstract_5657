We present different chemical evolution models for the ultrafaint dwarf
galaxy Bootes I. We either assume that the galaxy accretes its mass through
smooth infall of gas of primordial chemical composition (classical models) or
adopt mass accretion histories derived from the combination of merger trees
with semi-analytical modelling (cosmologically-motivated models). Furthermore,
we consider models with and without taking into account inhomogeneous mixing in
the ISM within the galaxy. The theoretical predictions are then compared to
each other and to the body of the available data. From this analysis, we
confirm previous findings that Bootes I has formed stars with very low
efficiency but, at variance with previous studies, we do not find a clear-cut
indication that supernova explosions have sustained long-lasting galactic-scale
outflows in this galaxy. Therefore, we suggest that external mechanisms such as
ram pressure stripping and tidal stripping are needed to explain the absence of
neutral gas in Bootes I today.
