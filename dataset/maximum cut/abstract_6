We consider the problem of determining the maximum number of moves required
to sort a permutation of $[n]$ using cut-and-paste operations, in which a
segment is cut out and then pasted into the remaining string, possibly
reversed. We give short proofs that every permutation of $[n]$ can be
transformed to the identity in at most $\flr{2n/3}$ such moves and that some
permutations require at least $\flr{n/2}$ moves.
