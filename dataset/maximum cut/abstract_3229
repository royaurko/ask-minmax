For every integer $r\ge3$ and every $\eps>0$ we construct a graph with
maximum degree $r-1$ whose circular total chromatic number is in the interval
$(r,r+\eps)$. This proves that (i) every integer $r\ge3$ is an accumulation
point of the set of circular total chromatic numbers of graphs, and (ii) for
every $\Delta\ge2$, the set of circular total chromatic numbers of graphs with
maximum degree $\Delta$ is infinite. All these results hold for the set of
circular total chromatic numbers of bipartite graphs as well.
