We investigate engineering applications of recycled nylon fibers obtained
from waste fishing nets, focusing our attention on the use of recycled nylon
fibers as tensile reinforcement of cementitious mortars. We begin by
characterizing the tensile behavior of both unconditioned and alkali-cured
recycled nylon fibers obtained through manual cutting of waste fishing net
filaments, with the aim of assessing the resistance of such materials to
chemical attacks. Next, we deal with compression and bending tests on
cementitious mortars reinforced with recycled nylon fibers, and establish
comparisons with the experimental behavior of the unreinforced material. In our
analysis of different weight fractions and aspect ratios of the reinforcing
fibers, we observe marked increases in the tensile strength and toughness of
the nylon reinforced mortar, as compared with the unreinforced material. The
presented results emphasize the high environmental and mechanical potential of
recycled nylon fibers for the reinforcement of sustainable construction
materials.
