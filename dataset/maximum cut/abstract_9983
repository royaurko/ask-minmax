We study the distribution of interstellar matter near the galactic plane on
the basis of open star clusters and reviewed the correlation of extinction with
different physical parameters of the clusters to understand the galactic
structure. It is seen from the extinction towards open clusters that about 90%
of the absorbing material lie within -5<b<5 deg of the galactic plane. The mean
thickness of the absorbing material, which is determined in terms of half-width
value \beta, is estimated to be about 125+/-21 pc. We show that the
interstellar absorption follows a sinusoidal variation with galactic longitude
and maximum and minimum absorptions occur at l ~ 48+/-4 deg and l ~ 228+/-4 deg
respectively. It is found that the galactic plane defined by the reddening
material is inclined by an angle of 0.6+/-0.4 deg to the formal galactic plane
and inclination is maximum at l ~ 54+/-6 deg. The reddening analysis has been
used to constrain the Solar offset which is found to be about 22.8+/-3.3 pc
above the reddening plane. We obtained a scale height of 53+/-5 pc for the
distribution of open clusters while it is 186+/-25 pc for the distribution of
reddening material from the reddening plane.
