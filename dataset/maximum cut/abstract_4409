We develop the formalizm for calculating semi inclusive observables at high
energy in the JIMWLK/KLWMIJ approach. We consider several examples including
diffractive processes, elastic and inclusive over the target degrees of
freedom, scattering with fixed total transverse momentum transfer and inclusive
gluon production. We discuss evolution of these observables with respect to
various rapidity variables involved in their definitions (total rapidity,
rapidity gap, width of diffractive interval etc.). We also discuss the dipole
model limit of these observables and derive closed simple (as opposed to
functional) differential equations in this approximation. We point out that
there are some interesting differences between the full JIMWLK/KLWMIJ evolution
and the dipole model evolution of diffractive cross section. In particular we
show that in the dipole approximation the target does not diffract beyond the
valence rapidity interval, consistently with the intuition suggested by the
Pomeron fan diagramms. On the other hand such diffractive processes do exist in
the full JIMWLK/KLWMIJ approach, albeit suppressed by the factor 1/N_c^2.
