We study the mixing time of systematic scan Markov chains on finite spin
systems. It is known that, in a single site setting, the mixing time of
systematic scan can be bounded in terms of the influences sites have on each
other. We generalise this technique for bounding the mixing time of systematic
scan to block dynamics, a setting in which a (constant size) set of sites are
updated simultaneously. In particular we consider the parameter alpha,
corresponding to the maximum influence on any site, and show that if alpha<1
then the corresponding systematic scan Markov chain mixes rapidly. As
applications of this method we prove O(log n) mixing of systematic scan (for
any scan order) for heat-bath updates of edges for proper q-colourings of a
general graph with maximum vertex-degree Delta when q>=2Delta. We also apply
the method to improve the number of colours required in order to obtain mixing
in O(log n) scans for systematic scan for heat-bath updates on trees, using
some suitable block updates.
