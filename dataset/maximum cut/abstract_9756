In this paper we study uniform tail-probability estimates in regularized
estimation, by making use of the polynomial type large deviation inequality for
the associated statistical random fields. The statistical random fields in our
model setup may be of mixed-rates type, may not be locally asymptotically
quadratic. Our results provide a measure of rate of consistency in variable
selection in sparse estimation, and also enable us to verify various arguments
requiring convergence of moments of estimator-dependent statistics, such as the
expected maximum-likelihood for AIC-type model criteria.
