An unusual solar burst was observed simultaneously by two decameter radio
telescopes UTR-2 (Kharkov, Ukraine) and URAN-2 (Poltava, Ukraine) on 3 June
2011 in the frequency range 16-28 MHz. The observed radio burst has some
unusual properties, which are not typical for the other types of solar radio
bursts. The frequency drift rate of it was positive (about 500 kHz s$^{-1}$) at
frequencies higher than 22 MHz and negative (100 kHz s$^{-1}$) at lower
frequencies. The full duration of this event varies from 50 s up to 80 s,
depending on the frequency. The maximum radio flux of the unusual burst reaches
$\approx 10^3$ s.f.u and its polarization does not exceed 10%. This burst has a
fine frequency-time structure of unusual appearance. It consists of stripes
with the frequency bandwidth 300-400 kHz. We consider that several accompanied
radio and optical events observed by SOHO and STEREO spacecraft are possibly
associated with the reported radio burst. A model that may interpret the
observed unusual solar radio burst is proposed.
