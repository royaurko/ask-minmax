The model of fresh inflation with increasing cosmological parameter provides
sufficient e-folds to solve the flatness/horizon problem and the density
fluctuations agree with experimental values. In this model the temperature
increases during inflation and reach its maximum value when inflation ends
(where the number of e-folds is $N(t_e) \gg 60$). The most important
characteristic of this model is that provides a natural transition between the
end of inflation and the epoch when the universe is radiation dominated.
