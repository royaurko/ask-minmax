The Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy SOFIA will become
operational with the next two years. It will be the biggest astronomical
airborne observatory ever build, comprising a 3m-class telescope onboard a
Boeing 747SP. A suite of first-light instruments is under development striving
for cutting edge technology to make SOFIA a milestone in infrared astronomy.
Here we present an overview over the instrumentation and an update on the
current status.
