Chaotic, eddy-like motions dominated by inertial-vortex forces begin
immediately at Planck scales in a hot big-bang cosmological model. This
quantum-gravitational-dynamics epoch produced not only the first
space-time-energy of the universe but the first large Reynolds number
turbulence and turbulent mixing with Kolmogorov and Batchelor-Obukhov-Corrsin
velocity and temperature gradient spectra. Strong-force-freeze-out and
inflation produced the first fossil temperature turbulence by stretching the
fluctuations beyond the horizon scale ct of causal connection at light speed c
in time t. The spectrum increases toward a maximum at the smallest (fossilized
Planck) scales, contrary to either the flat Harrison-Zel'dovich form usually
assumed or Tilted forms with maxima at large (fossilized strong-force) scales
used to explain observed plasma epoch temperature fluctuations as acoustic. A
second transition to turbulence was inhibited by buoyancy forces from the first
structures, as indicated by observations that dT/T in the cosmic microwave
background radiation is only 10^-5 except at the spectral peak and increases
smoothly as wavenumber k^1/6. The peak is therefore due to gravitational
structure not sound.
