Debye temperature, TD, of Fe100-xCrx disordered alloys with 0<x<99.9 was
determined from the temperature dependence of the centre shift of 57Fe
Mossbauer spectra recorded in the temperature range of 80-300K. Its
compositional dependence shows an interesting non-monotonous behaviour. For
0<x<~45 as well as for ~75<x<~95 the Debye temperature is enhanced relative to
its value of a metallic iron, and at x=~3 there is a local maximum having a
relative height of ~12% compared to a pure iron. For ~45<x<~75 and for x>~95
the Debye temperature is smaller than the one for the metallic iron, with a
local minimum at x=~55 at which the relative decrease of TD amounts to ~12%.
The first maximum coincides quite well with that found for the spin-waves
stiffness coefficient, D0, while the pretty steep decrease observed for x>~95
which is indicative of a decoupling of the probe Fe atoms from the underlying
chromium matrix is likely related to the spin-density waves which constitute
the magnetic structure of chromium in that interval of composition. The
harmonic force constant calculated from the Debye temperature of the least
Fe-concentrated alloy (x>99.9) amounts to only 23% of the one characteristic of
a pure chromium.
