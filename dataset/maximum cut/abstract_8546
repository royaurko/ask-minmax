We report a rather high dependence of the dielectric permittivity on the
magnetic field in La2/3Ca1/3MnO3. The variation is maximum at around 270 K,
little above the Curie temperature, TC, and it reaches a 30% under only 0.5 T.
We attribute this phenomenon to the space-charge or interfacial polarization
produced between the insulator and the metallic regions segregated
intrinsically in the material above TC.
