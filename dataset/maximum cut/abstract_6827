The statistical properties of ensemble of disordered 1D steric spin-chains
(SSC) of various length are investigated. Using 1D spin-glass type classical
Hamiltonian, the recurrent trigonometrical equations for stationary points and
corresponding conditions for the construction of stable 1D SSCs are found. The
ideal ensemble of spin-chains is analyzed and the latent interconnections
between random angles and interaction constants for each set of three
nearest-neighboring spins are found. It is analytically proved and by numerical
calculation is shown that the interaction constant satisfies L\'{e}vy's
alpha-stable distribution law. Energy distribution in ensemble is calculated
depending on different conditions of possible polarization of spin-chains. It
is specifically shown that the dimensional effects in the form of set of local
maximums in the energy distribution arise when the number of spin-chains M <<
N_x^2 (where N_x is number of spins in a chain) while in the case when M ~
N_x^2 energy distribution has one global maximum and ensemble of spin-chains
satisfies Birkhoff's ergodic theorem. Effective algorithm for parallel
simulation of problem which includes calculation of different statistic
parameters of 1D SSCs ensemble is elaborated.
