An analysis by the ATLAS Collaboration has recently shown, contrary to
popular belief, that a combination of strategic cuts, excellent mass
resolution, and detailed knowledge of the QCD backgrounds from direct
measurements can be used to extract a signal in the $Z' \to jj$ channel in
excess of $6\sigma$ for certain classes of extended electroweak models. We
explore the possibility that the data extracted from $Z$ dijet peak will have
sufficient statistical power as to supply information on the couplings of the
$Z'$ provided it is used in conjunction with complimentary results from the $Z'
\to \ell^+ \ell^-$ `discovery' channel. We show, for a 1 TeV $Z'$ produced at
the SSC, that this technique can provide a powerful new tool with which to
identify the origin of $Z'$'s.
