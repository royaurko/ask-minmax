Maximum length CA has wide range of applications in design of linear block
code, cryptographic primitives and VLSI testing particularly in
Built-In-Self-Test. In this paper, an algorithm to compute all $n$-cell maximum
length CA-rule vectors is proposed. Also rule vectors for each primitive
polynomial in GF(2^2) to GF(2^{12} have been computed by simulation and they
have been listed.Programmable rule vectors based maximum length CA can be used
to design cryptographic primitives.
