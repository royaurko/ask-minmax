The Lorentz transfomation is derived in 5D flat pseudo-complex affine space
or TT Space. The TT space or pseudo-Complex space accomodates one
uncompactified time-like extra dimension. It is shown that the maximum
allowable speed for particles living in TT space exceeds the speed of light, c,
the absolute speed of the Minkowski space.
