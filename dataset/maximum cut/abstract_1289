We show that the Standard Model Higgs decay $h^0 \to W^+W ^- \to l^+ l^- \nu
{\bar\nu}$ is the most sensitive mode for SM Higgs searches in the range
155-180 GeV. The previously considered mode $h^0 \to Z^0 Z^{0*} \to l^+ l^-
l^+l^-$ has a significantly lower search sensitivity. We place particular
emphasis on two new cuts based on (i) the boost and (ii) the spin-correlation
of the $W^+W^-$-system. The distribution we obtain from our combined cuts shows
a mass sensitive peak which probably allows a mass determination to $\pm$ 5 GeV
for 5 fb^{-1}. This contribution complements our earlier published paper.
