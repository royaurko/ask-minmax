The free energy expansion of a two-band pair-transfer superconductor is
developed. A critical in temperature and a noncritical coherence length appear.
The effective in-plane $\xi_{ab}$, $H_{c2}\sp c\sim \xi_{ab}\sp{-2}$ and the
thermodynamic critical magnetic field ($H_{c0}$) on the whole hole doping ($p$)
scale are calculated for a "typical'' cuprate. A doping-prepared bare spectrum
with normal state gaps quenched by doping has been used. The coherence length
$\xi_{ab}$ falls with $p$ first rapidly. A moderate enhancement starts when the
"cold'' defect band overlap with the valence band is reached. At overdoping
$\xi_{ab}$ rises markedly. The $H_{c2}\sp c$ curve shows a maximum before
$T_{cmax}$. The bell-like $H_{c0}$-curve follows closely $T_c$, superconducting
gaps, and superfluid density. The theoretical $\xi_{ab}(p)$ nonmonotonic curve
on the whole doping scale agrees with a recent experimental finding.
