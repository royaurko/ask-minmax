We present simultaneous and continuous observations of H_alpha, H_beta, NaI
D_1, D_2 and HeI D_3 lines of the chromospherically active binary HR 1099. We
have observed HR 1099 for more than 3 weeks almost continuously and monitored
two flares. An increase in H_alpha, CaII H & K, H_beta, HeI D_3 and HeI
lambda6678 and a strong filling-in of the NaI D_1, D_2 and MgI b triplet during
one of the flares are observed. We have found that the flares took place at the
same phase (0.85) of the binary orbit, and both of them seems to occur near the
limb. Several X-rays flares were also detected by ASM on board RXTE. Rotational
modulation in the X-rays light curve has been detected with maximum flux when
the active K1IV star is in front.
