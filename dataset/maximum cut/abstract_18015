Tunka-Rex is the radio extension of the Tunka cosmic-ray observatory in
Siberia close to Lake Baikal. Since October 2012 Tunka-Rex measures the radio
signal of air-showers in coincidence with the non-imaging air-Cherenkov array
Tunka-133. Furthermore, this year additional antennas will go into operation
triggered by the new scintillator array Tunka-Grande measuring the secondary
electrons and muons of air showers. Tunka-Rex is a demonstrator for how
economic an antenna array can be without losing significant performance: we
have decided for simple and robust SALLA antennas, and we share the existing
DAQ running in slave mode with the PMT detectors and the scintillators,
respectively. This means that Tunka-Rex is triggered externally, and does not
need its own infrastructure and DAQ for hybrid measurements. By this, the
performance and the added value of the supplementary radio measurements can be
studied, in particular, the precision for the reconstructed energy and the
shower maximum in the energy range of approximately $10^{17}-10^{18}\,$eV. Here
we show first results on the energy reconstruction indicating that radio
measurements can compete with air-Cherenkov measurements in precision.
Moreover, we discuss future plans for Tunka-Rex.
