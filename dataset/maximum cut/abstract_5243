We discuss a laser-trapped cold-atom superfluid qubit system. Each qubit is
proposed as a macroscopic two-state system based on a set of Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) currents circulating in a ring, cut with a Josephson barrier.
We review the effective low energy description of a single BEC ring. In
particular, it is demonstrated that such system has a set of metastable current
states which, for certain range of parameters, form an effective two-state
system, or a qubit. We show how this qubit can be initialized and manipulated
with currently available laser-trapping techniques. We also discuss mechanisms
of coupling several such ring qubits as well as measuring individual qubit-ring
systems.
