We argue that spin-sensitive quasiparticle scattering may generate
electron-hole imbalance in superconducting structures, such as, e.g.,
superconducting-normal hybrids with spin-active interfaces. We elucidate a
transparent physical mechanism for this effect demonstrating that scattering
rates for electrons and holes at such interfaces differ from each other.
Explicitly evaluating the wave functions of electron-like and hole-like
excitations in superconducting-normal bilayers we derive a general expression
for the thermoelectric current and show that -- in the presence of
electron-hole imbalance -- this current can reach maximum values as high as the
critical current of a superconductor.
