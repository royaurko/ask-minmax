Berg and Purcell [Biophys. J. 20, 193 (1977)] calculated how the accuracy of
concentration sensing by single-celled organisms is limited by noise from the
small number of counted molecules. Here we generalize their results to the
sensing of concentration ramps, which is often the biologically relevant
situation (e.g. during bacterial chemotaxis). We calculate lower bounds on the
uncertainty of ramp sensing by three measurement devices: a single receptor, an
absorbing sphere, and a monitoring sphere. We contrast two strategies, simple
linear regression of the input signal versus maximum likelihood estimation, and
show that the latter can be twice as accurate as the former. Finally, we
consider biological implementations of these two strategies, and identify
possible signatures that maximum likelihood estimation is implemented by real
biological systems.
