A mechanism for the formation of a 90{\deg} misfit dislocation at the
Ge/Si(001) interface has been determined from atomic scale simulations based on
the Stillinger-Weber interatomic potential function. A minimum energy path
connecting the coherent epitaxial state to a final state with a 90{\deg} misfit
dislocation was found using the nudged elastic band method with atomic
structure generated using a repulsive bias activation procedure. The energy
along the path exhibits a first maximum as a 60{\deg} dislocation nucleates. An
intermediate minimum along the path corresponds to an extended 60{\deg}
dislocation. A subsequent energy maximum then occurs as a second 60{\deg}
dislocation nucleates in a complementary, mirror glide plane, simultaneously
starting from the surface and from the first 60{\deg} dislocation. The
activation energy of the nucleation of the second dislocation is 30% lower than
that of the first one showing that the formation of the second 60{\deg}
dislocation is aided by the presence of the first one. An understanding of the
formation mechanism of 90{\deg} misfit dislocations could help design
procedures for growing strain released Ge overlayers on Si(001) surfaces.
