In this work we compare the predictions of two representative hadronic
interaction models, EPOS 1.99, and QGSJET II-03 with several extensive air
showers (EAS) parameters for proton and iron primaries in the energy range
$10^{17}$ - $10^{19} eV$ using CORSIKA-6990. The EAS parameters depth of shower
maximum, shower size, size of muon shower, muon number distribution, electron
number distribution,size of hadron shower, hadron energy sum, electron muon
correlations, and, hadron energy spectra are studied in this paper.
