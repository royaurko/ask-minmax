We measure the statistical polarization of quadrupolar nuclear spins in a
sub-micrometer (0.6 um^3) particle of GaAs using magnetic resonance force
microscopy. The crystalline sample is cut out of a GaAs wafer and attached to a
micro-mechanical cantilever force sensor using a focused ion beam technique.
Nuclear magnetic resonance is demonstrated on ensembles containing less than 5
x 10^8 nuclear spins and occupying a volume of around (300 nm)^3 in GaAs with
reduced volumes possible in future experiments. We discuss how the further
reduction of this detection volume will bring the spin ensemble into a regime
where random spin fluctuations, rather than Boltzmann polarization, dominate
its dynamics. The detection of statistical polarization in GaAs therefore
represents an important ?rst step toward 3D magnetic resonance imaging of III-V
materials on the nanometer-scale.
