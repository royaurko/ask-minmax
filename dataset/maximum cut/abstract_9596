Sound velocities of vitreous silica are measured under He compression in the
pressure range 0-6 GPa by Brillouin light scattering. It is found that the
well-known anomalous maximum in the pressure dependence of the compressibility
is suppressed by He incorporation into the silica network. This shows that the
elastic anomaly relates to the collapse of the largest interstitial voids in
the structure. The huge difference between the static and the acoustic
compressibilities indicates that the amount of incorporated helium still
increases at 6 GPa.
