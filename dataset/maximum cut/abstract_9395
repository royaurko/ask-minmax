Using Monte Carlo simulations a lattice gas model with only repulsive
interactions was checked for the presence of anomalies. We show that this
system exhibits the density (temperature of maximum density - TMD) and
di?ffusion anomalies as present in liquid water. These anomalous behavior exist
in the region of the chemical potential vs temperature phase diagram where two
structured phases are present. A fragile-to-strong dynamic transition is also
observed in the vicinity of the TMD line.
