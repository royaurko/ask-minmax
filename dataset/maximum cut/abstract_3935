The energy carried in the gravitational wave signal from an eccentric binary
is spread across several harmonics of the orbital frequency. The inclusion of
the harmonics in the analysis of the gravitational wave signal increases the
signal-to-noise ratio of the detected signal for binaries whose fundamental
frequency is below the galactic confusion-limited noise cut-off. This can allow
for an improved angular resolution for sources whose orbital period is greater
than 2000 s. Globular cluster sources include possible binary black holes and
neutron stars which may have high eccentricities. Cluster dynamics may also
enhance the eccentricities of double white dwarf binaries and white
dwarf-neutron star binaries over the galactic sources. Preliminary results of
the expected signal-to-noise ratio for selected globular cluster binaries are
presented.
