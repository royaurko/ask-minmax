We report measurements of the field and angular dependences of Jc of truly
epitaxial Co-doped BaFe2As2 thin films grown on SrTiO3/(La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 with
different SrTiO3 template thicknesses. The films show Jc comparable to Jc of
single crystals and a maximum pinning force Fp(0.6Tc) > 5 GN/m3 at H/Hirr ~ 0.5
indicative of strong vortex pinning effective up to high fields. Due to the
strong correlated c-axis pinning, Jc for field along the c-axis exceeds Jc for
H//ab plane, inverting the expectation of the Hc2 anisotropy. HRTEM reveals
that the strong vortex pinning is due to a high density of nanosize columnar
defects.
