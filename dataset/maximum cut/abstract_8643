When applying the maximum entropy method (MEM) to the analysis of hadron
correlation functions in QCD a central issue is to understand to what extent
this method can distinguish bound states, resonances and continuum
contributions to spectral functions. We discuss these issues by analyzing meson
and diquark correlation functions at zero temperature as well as free quark
anti-quark correlators. The latter test the applicability of MEM to high
temperature QCD.
