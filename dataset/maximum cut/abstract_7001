In this paper, a derandomized algorithm for sampling decoding is proposed to
achieve near-optimal performance in lattice decoding. By setting a probability
threshold to sample candidates, the whole sampling procedure becomes
deterministic, which brings considerable performance improvement and complexity
reduction over to the randomized sampling. Moreover, the upper bound on the
sample size K, which corresponds to near-maximum likelihood (ML) performance,
is derived. We also find that the proposed algorithm can be used as an
efficient tool to implement soft-output decoding in multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. An upper bound of the sphere radius R in list
sphere decoding (LSD) is derived. Based on it, we demonstrate that the
derandomized sampling algorithm is capable of achieving near-maximum a
posteriori (MAP) performance. Simulation results show that near-optimum
performance can be achieved by a moderate size K in both lattice decoding and
soft-output decoding.
