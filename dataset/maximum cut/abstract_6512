We study the decay of a very massive closed superstring (i.e. \alpha' M^2>>
1) in the unique state of maximum angular momentum. This is done in flat
ten-dimensional spacetime and in the regime of weak string coupling, where the
dominant decay channel is into two states of masses M_1, M_2. We find that the
lifetime surprisingly grows with the first power of the mass M: T =c \alpha' M.
We also compute the decay rate for each values of M_1, M_2. We find that, for
large M, the dynamics selects only special channels of decay: modulo processes
which are exponentially suppressed, for every decay into a state of given mass
M_1, the mass M_2 of the other state is uniquely determined.
