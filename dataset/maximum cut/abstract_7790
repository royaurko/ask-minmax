Motivated by the recent experimental observation of exclusive chi_c events at
the Tevatron, we revisit earlier studies of central exclusive scalar chi_c0
meson production, before generalising the existing formalism to include chi_c1
and chi_c2 mesons. Although chi_c0 production was previously assumed to be
dominant, we find that the chi_c1 and chi_c2 rates for the experimentally
considered chi_c -> J/psi gamma -> mu+ mu- gamma decay process are in fact
comparable to the chi_c0 rate. We have developed a new Monte Carlo event
generator, SuperCHIC, which models the central exclusive production of the
three chi_c states via this decay chain, and have explored possible ways of
distinguishing them, given that their mass differences are not resolvable
within the current experimental set-up. Although we find that the severity of
current experimental cuts appears to preclude this, the acceptance does not
change crucially between the three states and so our conclusions regarding the
overall rates remain unchanged. This therefore raises the interesting
possibility that exclusive chi_c1 and chi_c2 production has already been
observed at the Tevatron.
