In this paper we derive a Tully Fisher relation from measured I band
photometry and H$\alpha$ rotation curves of a large survey of southern sky
spiral galaxies, obtained in Persic \& Salucci (1995) by deprojecting and
folding the raw H$\alpha$ data of Mathewson, Ford \& Buchhorn (1992). We
calibrate the relation by combining several of the largest clusters in the
survey, using an iterative maximum likelihood procedure to account for
observational selection effects and Malmquist bias. We also incorporate a
simple model for the line of sight depth of each cluster. Our results indicate
a Tully Fisher relation of intrinsic dispersion $\sim0.3$ mag, corresponding to
a distance error dispersion of $13\%$. Application of this relation to mapping
the large scale velocity field is underway.
