Using Herschel's HIFI instrument we have observed [C II] along a cut through
S140 and high-J transitions of CO and HCO+ at two positions on the cut,
corresponding to the externally irradiated ionization front and the embedded
massive star forming core IRS1. The HIFI data were combined with available
ground-based observations and modeled using the KOSMA-tau model for photon
dominated regions. Here we derive the physical conditions in S140 and in
particular the origin of [C II] emission around IRS1. We identify three
distinct regions of [C II] emission from the cut, one close to the embedded
source IRS1, one associated with the ionization front and one further into the
cloud. The line emission can be understood in terms of a clumpy model of
photon-dominated regions. At the position of IRS1, we identify at least two
distinct components contributing to the [C II] emission, one of them a small,
hot component, which can possibly be identified with the irradiated outflow
walls. This is consistent with the fact that the [C II] peak at IRS1 coincides
with shocked H2 emission at the edges of the outflow cavity. We note that
previously available observations of IRS1 can be well reproduced by a
single-component KOSMA-tau model. Thus it is HIFI's unprecedented spatial and
spectral resolution, as well as its sensitivity which has allowed us to uncover
an additional hot gas component in the S140 region.
