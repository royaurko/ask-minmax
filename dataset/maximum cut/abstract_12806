We study the Anderson localization of Bogolyubov quasiparticles in an
interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (with healing length \xi) subjected to a
random potential (with finite correlation length \sigma_R). We derive
analytically the Lyapunov exponent as a function of the quasiparticle momentum
k and we study the localization maximum k_{max}. For 1D speckle potentials, we
find that k_{max} is proportional to 1/\xi when \xi is much larger than
\sigma_R while k_{max} is proportional to 1/\sigma_R when \xi is much smaller
than \sigma_R, and that the localization is strongest when \xi is of the order
of \sigma_R. Numerical calculations support our analysis and our estimates
indicate that the localization of the Bogolyubov quasiparticles is accessible
in current experiments with ultracold atoms.
