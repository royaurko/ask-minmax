We investigated the in-plane anisotropy on the resistivity and thermopower of
Bi2-xPbxSr2Co2Oy single crystals, which have a misfit structure between the
hexagonal CoO2 layer and the rock salt Bi2Sr2O4 layer. The resistivity and
thermopower show significantly large anisotropy, which exceeds two at maximum.
This anisotropy would come from the anisotropic pseudogap formation enhanced by
the misfit structure. The thermopower changes with Pb doping to take a maximum
at x=0.4. The misfit structure improves the thermoelectric properties through
chemical pressure. The power factor is as large as 9 muW/cmK2 at 100 K for
x=0.6, which is the highest value for thermoelectric oxides at 100 K.
