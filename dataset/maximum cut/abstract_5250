We introduce a new jet shape -- N-subjettiness -- designed to identify
boosted hadronically-decaying objects like electroweak bosons and top quarks.
Combined with a jet invariant mass cut, N-subjettiness is an effective
discriminating variable for tagging boosted objects and rejecting the
background of QCD jets with large invariant mass. In efficiency studies of
boosted W bosons and top quarks, we find tagging efficiencies of 30% are
achievable with fake rates of 1%. We also consider the discovery potential for
new heavy resonances that decay to pairs of boosted objects, and find
significant improvements are possible using N-subjettiness. In this way,
N-subjettiness combines the advantages of jet shapes with the discriminating
power seen in previous jet substructure algorithms.
