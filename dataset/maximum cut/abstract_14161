In this paper, the linear programming (LP) decoder for binary linear codes,
introduced by Feldman, et al. is extended to joint-decoding of binary-input
finite-state channels. In particular, we provide a rigorous definition of LP
joint-decoding pseudo-codewords (JD-PCWs) that enables evaluation of the
pairwise error probability between codewords and JD-PCWs. This leads naturally
to a provable upper bound on decoder failure probability. If the channel is a
finite-state intersymbol interference channel, then the LP joint decoder also
has the maximum-likelihood (ML) certificate property and all integer valued
solutions are codewords. In this case, the performance loss relative to ML
decoding can be explained completely by fractional valued JD-PCWs.
