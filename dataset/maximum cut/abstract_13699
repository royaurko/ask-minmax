The velocity distribution of the dark matter particles on the outskirts of
the Solar System remains unclear. We suggest to determine it using
experimentally found properties of the oldest halo objects. Indeed, the oldest
halo stars and globular clusters form a collisionless system, as well as dark
matter particles do, and they evolved in the same gravitational field. If we
accept this analogy, we can show that the velocity distribution of the dark
matter particles should be highly anisotropic and have a sharp maximum near
$\upsilon\sim 500$ {km/s}. The distribution is totally different from the
Maxwell one.
  We analyze the influence of the distribution function on the results of dark
matter detection experiments. It is found that the direct detection signal
should differ noticeably from the one calculated from the Maxwell distribution
with $<\upsilon>\simeq 220$ {km/s}, which is conventional for direct detection
experiments (the ratio depends on the detector properties and typically falls
within the range between 6 and 0.2). Moreover, the sharp distinction from the
Maxwell distribution can be very essential to the observations of dark matter
annihilation.
