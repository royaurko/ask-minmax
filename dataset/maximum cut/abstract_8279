A numerical code is described for constructing Doppler maps from the orbital
variation of line profiles of (mass transfering) binaries. It uses an algorithm
related to Richardson-Lucy iteration, and is much faster than the standard
algorithm used for ME problems. The method has been tested on data of
cataclysmic variables (including WZ Sge and SS Cyg), producing maps of up to
300X300 points. It includes an IDL-based set of routines for manipulating and
plotting the input and output data, and can be downloaded from
