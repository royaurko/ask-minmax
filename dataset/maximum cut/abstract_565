It is shown that using of the equation of motion of the Universe scale factor
allows calculation of the contribution of the vacuum fluctuations to the
acceleration of the Universe expansion. Renormalization of the equation is
needed only in the case of massive particles. Under a known number of the
different kinds of fundamental fields, this provides determination of momentum
of the ultraviolet cut-off from the observed value of acceleration.
