We use a recently derived diagrammatic formulation of the dynamics of
interacting Brownian particles [G. Szamel, J. Chem. Phys. 127, 084515 (2007)]
to study a four-point dynamic density correlation function. We re-sum a class
of diagrams which separate into two disconnected components upon cutting a
single propagator. The resulting formula for the four-point correlation
function can be expressed in terms of three-point functions closely related to
the three-point susceptibility introduced by Biroli et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.
97, 195701 (2006)] and the standard two-point correlation function. The
four-point function has a structure very similar to that proposed by Berthier
and collaborators [Science 310, 1797 (2005), J. Chem. Phys. 126, 184503
(2007)]. It exhibits a small wave vector divergence at the mode-coupling
transition.
