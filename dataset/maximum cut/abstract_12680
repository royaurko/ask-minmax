The nature of boundedness of orbits of a particle moving in a central force
field is investigated. General conditions for circular orbits and their
stability are discussed. In a bounded central field orbit, a particle moves
clockwise or anticlockwise, depending on its angular momentum, and at the same
time oscillates between a minimum and a maximum radial distance, defining an
inner and an outer annulus. There are generic orbits suggested in popular texts
displaying the general features of a central orbit. In this work it is
demonstrated that some of these orbits, seemingly possible at the first glance,
are not compatible with a central force field. For power law forces, the
general nature of boundedness and geometric shape of orbits are investigated.
