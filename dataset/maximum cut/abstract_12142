The scaling approach recently proposed by Landau and Ott for isothermal
magnetization curves is extended to the average kinetic energy density of the
condensate. Two low $T_c$ superconductors, Nb and $Li_{2}Pd_{3}B$ are studied
and their isothermal reversible magnetization shown to display Landau and Ott
scaling. Good agreement is obtained for the upper critical field $H_{c2}(T)$,
determined from the Abrikosov approximation for the reversible region (standard
linear extrapolation of the magnetization curve), and from the maximum of the
kinetic energy curves. For the full range of data, which includes the
irreversible region, the isothermal $d.M.B/H^2$ curves for $Li_2Pd_3B$ show an
impressive collapse into a single curve over the entire range of field
measurements. The Nb isothermal $d.M.B/H^2$ curves exhibit the interesting
feature of a constant and temperature independent minimum value.
