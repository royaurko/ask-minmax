Information entropy and Zipf's law in the field of information theory have
been used for studying the disassembly of nuclei in the framework of the
isospin dependent lattice gas model and molecular dynamical model. We found
that the information entropy in the event space is maximum at the phase
transition point and the mass of the cluster show exactly inversely to its
rank, i.e. Zipf's law appears. Both novel criteria are useful in searching the
nuclear liquid gas phase transition experimentally and theoretically.
