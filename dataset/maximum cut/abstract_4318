We reanalyze deep inelastic scattering data of BCDMS Collaboration by
including proper cuts of ranges with large systematic errors. We perform also
the fits of high statistic deep inelastic scattering data of BCDMS, SLAC, NM
and BFP Collaborations taking the data separately and in combined way and find
good agreement between these analyses. We extract the values of the QCD
coupling constant \alpha_s(M^2_Z) up to NLO level. The fits of the combined
data for the nonsinglet part of the structure function F_2 predict the coupling
constant value \alpha_s(M^2_Z) = 0.1174 \pm 0.0007 (stat) \pm 0.0019 (syst) \pm
0.0010 (normalization). The fits of the combined data for both: the nonsinglet
part of F_2 and the singlet one, lead to the values \alpha_s(M^2_Z) = 0.1177
\pm 0.0007 (stat) \pm 0.0021 (syst) \pm 0.0009 (normalization). Both above
values are in very good agreement with each other.
