The explanation of the suppression of high-pT hadron yields at RHIC in terms
of jet-quenching implies that the multiplicity distributions of particles
inside a jet and jet-like particle correlations differ strongly in
nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC or at the LHC from those observed at e+e- or
hadron colliders. We present a framework for describing the medium-induced
modification, which has a direct interpretation in terms of a probabilistic
medium-modified parton cascade, and which treats leading and subleading partons
on an equal footing. We show that our approach can account for the strong
suppression of single inclusive hadron spectra measured in Au-Au collisions at
RHIC, and that this implies a characteristic distortion of the single inclusive
distribution of soft partons inside the jet. We determine, as a function of the
jet energy, to what extent the soft fragments within a jet can be measured
above some momentum cut.
