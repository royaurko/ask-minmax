Recent published data on the isoscalar gap in symmetric nuclear matter using
the Paris force and the corresponding BHF single particle dispersion are
corrected leading to an extremely high proton-neutron gap of $\Delta \sim 8$
MeV at $\rho \sim 0.5\rho_0$. Arguments whether this value can be reduced due
to screening effects are discussed. A density dependent delta interaction with
cut off is adjusted so as to approximately reproduce the nuclear matter values
with the Paris force.
