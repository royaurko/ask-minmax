In this paper, after briefly reviewing the theory of vectorial vortices, we
describe our technological approach to generating the necessary phase helix,
and report results obtained with the first optical vectorial vortex coronagraph
(OVVC) in the laboratory. To implement the geometrical phase ramp, we make use
of Liquid Crystal Polymers (LCP), which we believe to be the most efficient
technological path to quickly synthesize optical vectorial vortices of
virtually any topological charge. With the first prototype device of
topological charge 2, a maximum peak-to-peak attenuation of 1.4e-2 and a
residual light level of 3e-5 at an angular separation of 3.5 l/d (at which
point our current noise floor is reached) have been obtained at a wavelength of
1.55 microns. These results demonstrate the validity of using space-variant
birefringence distributions to generate a new family of coronagraphs usable in
natural unpolarized light, opening a path to high performance coronagraphs that
are achromatic and have low-sensitivity to low-order wavefront aberrations.
