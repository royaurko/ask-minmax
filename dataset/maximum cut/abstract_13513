The temperature distribution in nanowires due to Joule heating is studied
analytically using a continuum model and a Green's function approach. We show
that the temperatures reached in nanowires can be much lower than that
predicted by bulk models of Joule heating, due to heat loss at the nanowire
surface that is important at nanoscopic dimensions, even when the thermal
conductivity of the environment is relatively low. In addition, we find that
the maximum temperature in the nanowire scales weakly with length, in contrast
to the bulk system. A simple criterion is presented to assess the importance of
these effects. The results have implications for the experimental measurements
of nanowire thermal properties, for thermoelectric applications, and for
controlling thermal effects in nanowire electronic devices.
