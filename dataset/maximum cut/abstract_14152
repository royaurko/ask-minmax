We present results from a wide-field imaging campaign at the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope to study the spectacular outburst of comet
17P/Holmes in late 2007. Using image-processing techniques we probe inside the
spherical dust coma and find sixteen fragments having both spatial distribution
and kinematics consistent with isotropic ejection from the nucleus. Photometry
of the fragments is inconsistent with scattering from monolithic, inert bodies.
Instead, each detected fragment appears to be an active cometesimal producing
its own dust coma. By scaling from the coma of the primary nucleus of
17P/Holmes, assumed to be 1.7 km in radius, we infer that the sixteen fragments
have maximum effective radii between ~ 10 m and ~ 100 m on UT 2007 Nov. 6. The
fragments subsequently fade at a common rate of ~ 0.2 mag/day, consistent with
steady depletion of ices from these bodies in the heat of the Sun. Our
characterization of the fragments supports the hypothesis that a large piece of
material broke away from the nucleus and crumbled, expelling smaller, icy
shards into the larger dust coma around the nucleus.
