In this paper we study the operation of cutting off edges of a simple
$3$-polytope $P$ along the graph $\Gamma$. We give the criterion when the
resulting polytope is simple and when it is flag. As a corollary we prove the
analog of Eberhard's theorem about the realization of polygon vectors of simple
$3$-polytopes for flag polytopes.
