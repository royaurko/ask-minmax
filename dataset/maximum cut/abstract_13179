We study the structures of hybrid stars with leptons at finite temperature
under beta equilibrium. For the quark phase, we use the three flavor
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. For the hadron phase, we adopt nuclear equation
of state (EOS) by Shen et al.. This EOS is in the framework of the relativistic
mean field theory including the tree body effects. For the hadron-quark phase
transition, we impose the bulk Gibbs construction or the Maxwell construction
to take into account uncertainties by {\it finite size effects}. We find that
the pure quark phase does not appear in stable star cores in all cases. With
the phase transition, the maximum masses increase $\sim 10 %$ for high lepton
fraction. On the contrary, without the transition, they decrease $\sim 10 %$.
We also find that, in the NJL model, the lepton fraction is more important for
structures of unstable stars than the temperature. This result is important for
many astrophysical phenomena such as the core collapse of massive stars.
