The BPS states of N=2 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(2) are
constructed as non-trivial finite-energy solutions of the worldvolume theory of
a threebrane probe in F theory. The solutions preserve 1/2 of N=2 supersymmetry
and provide a worldvolume realization of strings stretching from the probe to a
sevenbrane. The positions of the sevenbranes correspond to singularities in the
field theory moduli space and to curvature singularities in the supergravity
background. We explicitly show how the UV cut off of the effective field theory
is mapped into an IR cut off in the supergravity. Finally, we discuss some
features of the moduli spaces of these solutions.
