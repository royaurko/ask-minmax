We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 (DR5) u,g,r,i,z
photometry to study Milky Way halo substructure in the area around the North
Galactic Cap. A simple color cut (g-r < 0.4) reveals the tidal stream of the
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal, as well as a number of other stellar structures
in the field. Two branches (A and B) of the Sagittarius stream are clearly
visible in an RGB-composite image created from 3 magnitude slices, and there is
also evidence for a still more distant wrap behind the A branch. A comparison
of these data with numerical models suggests that the shape of the Galactic
dark halo is close to spherical.
