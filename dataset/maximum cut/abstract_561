We examine a two-dimensional electron waveguide with a cut-circle cavity and
conical leads. By considering Wigner delay times and the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker
conductance for this system, we probe the effects of the closed billiard energy
spectrum on scattering properties in the limit of weakly coupled leads. We
investigate how lead placement and cavity shape affect these conductance and
time delay spectra of the waveguide.
