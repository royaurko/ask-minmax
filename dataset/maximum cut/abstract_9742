A supercapacitor electrode was fabricated from a nanocomposite consisting of
multiwall carbon nanotubes and titanium oxide nanoparticles. Conventional
electrochemical characterizations cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic
charge-discharge in a lithium-based electrolyte gave a specific capacitance of
345 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g. Unconventional electrochemical
characterization techniques that allow one to obtain the peak capacitance
associated with intercalation and to distinguish between electrostatic and
faradaic charge storage are described and applied to the electrode
measurements. The advantages of the unconventional techniques are shown by
comparison to the conventional ones. Finally, the maximum energy density
obtained was 31 Wh/kg.
