The incoherent pion photoproduction reaction gd-->pi-pp is considered
theoretically in a wide energy region Eth =< Eg =< 2700 MeV. The model applied
contains the impulse approximation as well as the NN- and piN-FSI amplitudes.
The aim of the paper is to study a reliable way for getting the information on
elementary gn-->pi-p reaction cross section beyond the impulse approximation
for gd-->pi-pp. For the elementary gN-->piN, NN-->NN, and piN-->piN amplitudes,
the results of the GW DAC are used. There are no additional theoretical
constraints. The calculated cross section dSigma/dOmega(gd->pi-pp) are compared
with existing data. The procedure used to extract information on the
differential cross section dSigma/dOmega(gn-->pi-p) on the neutron from the
deuteron data using the FSI correction factor R is discussed. The calculations
for R versus pi-p CM angle \theta_1 of the outgoing pion are performed at
different photon-beam energies with kinematical cuts for "quasi-free" process
gn-->pi-p. The results show a sizeable FSI effect R \neq 1 from S-wave part of
pp-FSI at small angles close to \theta_1 ~ 0: this region narrows as the photon
energy increases. At larger angles, the effect is small (|R-1|<<1) and agrees
with estimations of FSI in the Glauber approach.
