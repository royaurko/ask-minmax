The optimally doped 122 iron-based superconductor Ba(0.6)K(0.4)Fe2As2 has
been studied by 57Fe Moessbauer spectroscopy versus temperature ranging from
4.2 K till 300 K with particular attention paid to the superconducting
transition around 38 K. The spectra do not contain magnetic components and they
exhibit quasi-continuous distribution of quadrupole split doublets. A
distribution follows the electric field gradient (EFG) spatial modulation
(wave) - EFGW. The EFGW is accompanied by some charge density wave (CDW) having
about an order of magnitude lesser influence on the spectrum. The EFGW could be
modeled as widely separated narrow sheets with the EFG increasing from small
till maximum value almost linearly and subsequently dropping back to the
original value in a similar fashion - across the sheet. One encounters very
small and almost constant EFG between sheets. The EFGW shape and amplitude as
well as the amplitude of CDW are strongly affected by a superconducting
transition. All modulations are damped significantly at transition (38 K) and
recover at a temperature being about 14 K lower. The maximum quadrupole
splitting at 4.2 K amounts to about 2.1 mm/s, while the dispersion of CDW seen
on the iron nuclei could be estimated far away from the superconducting gap
opening and at low temperature as 0.5 el./a.u.^3. It drops to about 0.3
el./a.u.^3 just below transition to the superconducting state.
