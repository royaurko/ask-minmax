Spectra of the magnetic white dwarf binary AM Her were obtained with the Far
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) during three consecutive spacecraft
orbits. These observations were split into 19 spectra of about 5 min duration
(0.025P binary phase) partially covering the binary orbit. We report the
phase-related changes in the far ultraviolet continuum light curve and the
emission lines, noting particularly the behavior of O VI. We discuss the fluxes
and velocities of the narrow and broad O VI emissions. We find the FUV light
curve has maximum amplitude at ~1000A, although at shorter wavelengths the
continuum may be strongly affected by overlapping Lyman lines. Weak, narrow
Lyman absorption lines are present. Their velocities don't appear to vary over
the observed orbital phases, and their mean value is consistent with the
systemic velocity.
