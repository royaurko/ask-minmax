Binary black hole simulations have traditionally been computationally very
expensive: current simulations are performed in supercomputers involving dozens
if not hundreds of processors, thus systematic studies of the parameter space
of binary black hole encounters still seem prohibitive with current technology.
Here we show how the multi-layered refinement level code BAM can be used on
dual processor workstations to simulate certain binary black hole systems. BAM,
based on the moving punctures method, provides grid structures composed of
boxes of increasing resolution near the center of the grid. In the case of
binaries, the highest resolution boxes are placed around each black hole and
they track them in their orbits until the final merger when a single set of
levels surrounds the black hole remnant. This is particularly useful when
simulating spinning black holes since the gravitational fields gradients are
larger. We present simulations of binaries with equal mass black holes with
spins parallel to the binary axis and intrinsic magnitude of S/m^2= 0.75. Our
results compare favorably to those of previous simulations of this particular
system. We show that the moving punctures method produces stable simulations at
maximum spatial resolutions up to M/160 and for durations of up to the
equivalent of 20 orbital periods.
