We demonstrate high yield fabrication of field effect transistors (FET) using
chemically reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets suspended in water assembled via
dielectrophoresis. The two terminal resistances of the devices were improved by
an order of magnitude upon mild annealing at 200 0C in Ar/H2 environment for 1
hour. With the application of a backgate voltage, all of the devices showed FET
behavior with maximum hole and electron mobilities of 4.0 and 1.5 cm2/Vs
respectively. This study shows promise for scaled up fabrication of graphene
based nanoelectronic devices.
