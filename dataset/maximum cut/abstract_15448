We theoretically study spin and charge currents through finite-size
two-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor/uniform ferromagnet/s-wave
superconductor (SFS) junctions with intrinsic spin-orbit interactions (ISOIs)
using a quasiclassical approach. Considering experimentally realistic
parameters, we demonstrate that the combination of spontaneously broken
time-reversal symmetry and lack of inversion symmetry can result in
spontaneously accumulated spin currents at the edges of finite-size
two-dimensional magnetic SF hybrids. Due to the spontaneous edge spin
accumulation, the corners of the F wire host the maximum spin current density.
We further reveal that this type edge phenomena are robust and independent of
either the actual type of ISOIs or exchange field orientation. Moreover, we
study spin current-phase relations in these diffusive spin-orbit coupled SFS
junctions. Our results unveil net spin currents, not accompanied by charge
supercurrent, that spontaneously accumulate at the sample edges through a
modulating superconducting phase difference. Finally, we discuss possible
experimental implementations to observe these edge phenomena.
