Let G be a connected reductive quasisplit algebraic group over a field L
which is a finite extension of the p-adic numbers. We construct an exact
sequence modelled on (the dual of) the BGG resolution involving locally
analytic principal series representations for G(L). This leads to an exact
sequence involving spaces of overconvergent p-adic automorphic forms for
certain groups compact modulo centre at infinity.
