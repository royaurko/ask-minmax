I describe a simple heat-engine derivation of the maximum overburden pressure
that can be generated in frost heave. The method stems from the fact that
useful work can, in principle, be extracted from the forces generated by an
advancing solidification front via the frost heave mechanism. Using an
idealized frost heave engine, together with the maximum thermodynamic
efficiency of any heat engine, one can derive the maximum overburden pressure.
A similar argument can also produce the maximum thermodynamic buoyancy force on
a foreign object within a solid surrounded by a premelted layer.
