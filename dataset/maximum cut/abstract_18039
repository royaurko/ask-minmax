We report on the determination of the astrometric, spin and orbital
parameters for PSR J1953+1846A, a "black widow" binary millisecond pulsar in
the globular cluster M71. By using the accurate position and orbital parameters
obtained from radio timing, we identified the optical companion in ACS/Hubble
Space Telescope images. It turns out to be a faint (m_F606W>=24, m_F814W>=23)
and variable star located at only ~0.06" from the pulsar timing position. The
light curve shows a maximum at the pulsar inferior conjunction and a minimum at
the pulsar superior conjunction, thus confirming the association with the
system. The shape of the optical modulation suggests that the companion star is
heated, likely by the pulsar wind. The comparison with the X-ray light curve
possibly suggests the presence of an intra-binary shock due to the interaction
between the pulsar wind and the material released by the companion. This is the
second identification (after COM-M5C) of an optical companion to a black widow
pulsar in a globular cluster. Interestingly, the two companions show a similar
light curve and share the same position in the color magnitude diagram.
