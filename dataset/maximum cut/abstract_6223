In this paper, we construct linear codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ with bounded
$GC$-content. The codes are obtained using a greedy algorithm over
$\mathbb{Z}_4$. Further, upper and lower bounds are derived for the maximum
size of DNA codes of length $n$ with constant $GC$-content $w$ and edit
distance $d$.
