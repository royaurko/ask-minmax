New measurements with good statistics will make it possible to observe the
time variation of cosmic antiprotons at 1 AU through the approaching peak of
solar activity. We report a new computation of the interstellar antiproton
spectrum expected from collisions between cosmic protons and the interstellar
gas. This spectrum is then used as input to a steady-state drift model of solar
modulation, in order to provide predictions for the antiproton spectrum as well
as the antiproton/proton ratio at 1 AU. Our model predicts a surprisingly
large, rapid increase in the antiproton/proton ratio through the next solar
maximum, followed by a large excursion in the ratio during the following
decade.
