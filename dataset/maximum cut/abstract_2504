We study the sutured Floer homology invariants of the sutured manifold
obtained by cutting a knot complement along a Seifert surface, R. We show that
these invariants are finer than the "top term" of the knot Floer homology,
which they contain. In particular, we use sutured Floer homology to distinguish
two non-isotopic minimal genus Seifert surfaces for the knot 8_3. A key
ingredient for this technique is finding appropriate Heegaard diagrams for the
sutured manifold associated to the complement of a Seifert surface.
