We present a cosmological landscape where the classical closed string tachyon
field plays an important role in the framework of a critical bosonic
compactification. Our cosmological solutions for a universe with constant
curvature describes an finite inflationary stage which expands till a maximum
value before undergoes a big crunch as the tachyon reaches the minimum of its
potential.
