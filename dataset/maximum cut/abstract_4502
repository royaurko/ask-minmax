We review the subject of Kahler anomalies in gauged supergravity, emphasizing
that field equations are inconsistent when the Kahler potential is
non-invariant under gauge transformations or when there are elementary
Fayet-Iliopoulos couplings. Flux vacua solutions of string theory with gauged
U(1) shift symmetries appear to avoid this problem. The covariant Kahler
anomalies involve tensors which are composite functions of the scalars as well
as the gauge field strength and space-time curvature tensors. Anomaly
cancellation conditions will be discussed in a sequel to this paper.
