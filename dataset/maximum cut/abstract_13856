We investigate the statistical properties of the correlation matrix between
individual stocks traded in the Korean stock market using the random matrix
theory (RMT) and observe how these affect the portfolio weights in the
Markowitz portfolio theory. We find that the distribution of the correlation
matrix is positively skewed and changes over time. We find that the eigenvalue
distribution of original correlation matrix deviates from the eigenvalues
predicted by the RMT, and the largest eigenvalue is 52 times larger than the
maximum value among the eigenvalues predicted by the RMT. The $\beta_{473}$
coefficient, which reflect the largest eigenvalue property, is 0.8, while one
of the eigenvalues in the RMT is approximately zero. Notably, we show that the
entropy function $E(\sigma)$ with the portfolio risk $\sigma$ for the original
and filtered correlation matrices are consistent with a power-law function,
$E(\sigma) \sim \sigma^{-\gamma}$, with the exponent $\gamma \sim 2.92$ and
those for Asian currency crisis decreases significantly.
