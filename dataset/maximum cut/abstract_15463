In order to clarify a possible role of small-scale dynamo in formation of
solar magnetic field, we suggest an observational test for small-scale dynamo
action based on statistics of anti-Hale sunspot groups. As we have shown,
according to theoretical expectations the small-scale dynamo action has to
provide a population of sunspot groups which do not follow the Hale polarity
law, and the density of such groups on the time-latitude diagram is expected to
be independent on the phase of the solar cycle. Correspondingly, a percentage
of the anti-Hale groups is expected to reach its maximum values during solar
minima. For several solar cycles, we considered statistics of anti-Hale groups
obtained by several scientific teams, including ours, to find that the
percentage of anti-Hale groups becomes indeed maximal during a solar minimum.
Our interpretation is that this fact may be explained by the small-scale dynamo
action inside the solar convective zone.
