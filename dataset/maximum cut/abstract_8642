Using the maximum entropy method, spectral functions of the pseudo-scalar and
vector mesons are extracted from lattice Monte Carlo data of the imaginary time
Green's functions. The resonance and continuum structures as well as the ground
state peaks are successfully obtained. Error analysis of the resultant spectral
functions is also given on the basis of the Bayes probability theory.
