Recent advances in measuring and interpreting cosmic rays from the spectral
ankle to the highest energies are briefly reviewed. The prime question at the
highest energies is about the origin of the flux suppression observed at E ~
4x10^{19} eV. Is this the long awaited GZK-effect or the exhaustion of sources?
The key to answering this question will be provided by the largely unknown mass
composition at the highest energies. The high level of isotropy observed even
at the highest energies challenges models of a proton dominated composition if
extragalactic magnetic fields are on the order of a few nG or less. We shall
discuss the experimental and theoretical progress in the field and the
prospects for the next decade.
