We show that for every cubic graph G with sufficiently large girth there
exists a probability distribution on edge-cuts of G such that each edge is in a
randomly chosen cut with probability at least 0.88672. This implies that G
contains an edge-cut of size at least 1.33008n, where n is the number of
vertices of G, and has fractional cut covering number at most 1.127752. The
lower bound on the size of maximum edge-cut also applies to random cubic
graphs. Specifically, a random n-vertex cubic graph a.a.s. contains an edge cut
of size 1.33008n.
