Optically-thick envelopes may form following the tidal disruption of a star
by a massive black hole. Such envelopes would reprocess hard radiation from
accretion close to the black hole into the UV and optical bands producing
AGN-luminosity flares with duration ~1 year. We show that due to relativistic
effects, the envelopes are convective. If convection is efficient, then the
structure of the envelopes is similar to that described in previous work;
however, the photospheric radius is shown to be very sensitive to the
luminosity at the envelope base, suggesting that either the envelope collapses
or the envelope expands to a maximum radius at which point a wind may set in.
For an envelope without winds, we find a maximum photospheric radius of ~10^16
cm (i.e. minimum effective temperature ~6,000 K). The evolution of the
envelopes is described based on simple energy arguments.
