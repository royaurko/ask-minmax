This paper contains some estimates for the {\it integral-uniform} norm and
the uniform norm of a wide class of random polynomials. The family of
integral-uniform norms introduced by Kasin and Tzafriri is a natural
generalization of the maximum norm taken over a net. We prove some properties
of the integral-uniform norms. The given application of the established
estimates demonstrates that the integral-uniform norms may be useful whenever
one is interested in the properties of a function distribution.
  Key words: integral-uniform norm; random polynomials with respect to a
general function system; trigonometric polynomials with random coefficients.
