We have fit the normal, well observed, Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) SN 1994D
with non-LTE spectra of the deflagration model W7. We find that well before
maximum luminosity W7 fits the optical spectra of SN 1994D. After maximum
brightness the quality of the fits weakens as the spectrum forms in a core rich
in iron peak elements. We show the basic structure of W7 is likely to be
representative of the typical SN Ia. We have shown that like W7, the typical SN
Ia has a layer of unburned C+O composition at v > 15000 \kmps, followed by
layers of C-burned and O-burned material with a density structure similar to
W7. We present UVOIR (UBVRIJKH) synthetic photometry and colors and compare
with observation. We have computed the distance to the host galaxy, NGC 4526,
obtaining a distance modulus of \mu = 30.8 \pm 0.3. We discuss further
application of this direct measurement of SNe Ia distances. We also discuss
some simple modifications to W7 that could improve the quality of the fits to
the observations.
