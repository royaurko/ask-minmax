$\tilde{q}_L \tilde{q}_L$ production is one of the main SUSY production
processes in the MSSM, which occurs due to the chirality flip caused by the
Majorana gluino mass. This process is one of the sources of same sign two
lepton (SS2$l$) events, however, gluino production also contributes to this
channel. In this paper, we develop a method to identify gluino and squark
production separately in the SS2$l$ channel, based on cuts on the kinematical
configuration of the jets. We applied the method to the MSSM, a model with an
extended gluino sector, and the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity (LHT), and
found a distinctive difference between these models when considering the
numbers of SS2$l$ events selected by the cuts.
