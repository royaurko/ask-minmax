A new technique for the detection of outliers in contingency tables is
introduced. Outliers thereby are unexpected cell counts with respect to
classical loglinear Poisson models. Subsets of cell counts called minimal
patterns are defined, corresponding to non-singular design matrices and leading
to potentially uncontaminated maximum-likelihood estimates of the model
parameters and thereby the expected cell counts. A criterion to easily produce
minimal patterns in the two-way case under independence is derived, based on
the analysis of the positions of the chosen cells. A simulation study and a
couple of real-data examples are presented to illustrate the performances of
the newly developed outlier identification algorithm, and to compare it with
other existing methods.
