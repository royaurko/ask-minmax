The magnetocapacitance of a two-dimensional electron system (2DES) is
investigated experimentally, both under and away from Quantum Hall (QH)
conditions, at frequencies between 1 kHz and 100 MHz. The nature of the
capacitive signal in a bounded 2DES is determined by a resistive cut-off
frequency 1/$\tau \propto \sigma_{xx}$, the longitudinal magnetoconductivity. A
new response mechanism is reported for angular frequencies $\omega > 1/\tau$,
which is controlled by the $\em transverse$ or Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$
and the boundaries of the sample, even at frequencies far below those of the
Edge Magnetoplasma resonances and away from the QH-conditions.
