In a totally ordered set the notion of sorting a finite sequence is defined
through a suitable permutation of the sequence's indices. In this paper we
prove a simple formula that explicitly describes how the elements of a sequence
are related to those of its sorted counterpart. As this formula relies only on
the minimum and maximum functions we use it to define the notion of sorting for
lattices. A major difference of sorting in lattices is that it does not
guarantee that sequence elements are only rearranged. However, we can show that
other fundamental properties that are associated with sorting are preserved.
