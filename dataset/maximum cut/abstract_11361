We have completed spectroscopic observations using LRIS on the Keck 1
telescope of 30 very high redshift quasars, 11 selected for the presence of
damped Ly-alpha absorption systems and 19 with redshifts z > 3.5 not previously
surveyed for absorption systems. We have surveyed an additional 10 QSOs with
the Lick 120'' and the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We have combined these with
previous data resulting in a statistical sample of 646 QSOs and 85 damped
Ly-alpha absorbers with column densities N(HI) >= 2 x 10^20 atoms/cm^2 covering
the redshift range 0.008 <= z <= 4.694. To make the data in our statistical
sample more readily available for comparison with scenarios from various
cosmological models, we provide tables that includes all 646 QSOs from our new
survey and previously published surveys. They list the minimum and maximum
redshift defining the redshift path along each line of sight, the QSO emission
redshift, and when an absorber is detected, the absorption redshift and
measured HI column density. [see the paper for the complete abstract]
