We have obtained deep, near-IR images of nearly 100 host galaxies of nearby
quasars and Seyferts. We find the near-IR light to be a good tracer of luminous
mass in these galaxies. For the most luminous quasars there is a correlation
between the maximum allowed B-band nuclear luminosity and the host galaxy mass,
a ``luminosity/host-mass limit''. Comparing our images with images from HST, we
find that the hosts of these very luminous quasars are likely early type
galaxies, even for radio-quiet objects whose lower-luminosity counterparts
traditionally live in spirals. We speculate that the luminosity/host-mass limit
represents a physical limit on the size of black hole that can exist in a given
galaxy spheroid mass. We discuss the promises of NICMOS for detecting the hosts
of luminous quasars.
