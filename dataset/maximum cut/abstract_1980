We have studied the relation between the color evolution of Type Ia
Supernovae (SNe Ia) from maximum light to the Lira law regime and the presence
of narrow absorption features. Based on a nearby sample of 89 SNe Ia we have
found that the rate of change of B-V colors at late phases (between 35 and 80
days after maximum) varies significantly among different SNe Ia. At maximum
light, faster Lira law B-V decliners have significantly higher equivalent
widths of blended Na I D1 & D2 narrow absorption lines, redder colors and lower
R_V reddening laws. We do not find faster Lira law B-V decliners to have a
strong preference for younger galaxy environments, where higher interstellar
material (ISM) column densities would be expected. We interpret these results
as evidence for the presence of circumstellar material (CSM). The differences
in colors and reddening laws found at maximum light are also present 55 days
afterward, but unlike the colors at maximum, they show a significant variation
among different host galaxy morphological types. This suggests that the effect
of ISM on the colors is more apparent at late times. Finally, we discuss how
the transversal expansion of the ejecta in an inhomogeneous ISM could mimic
some of these findings.
