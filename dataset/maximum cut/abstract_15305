An edge coloring of a graph $G$ is called an acyclic edge coloring if it is
proper (i.e. adjacent edges receive different colors) and every cycle in $G$
contains edges of at least three different colors (there are no bichromatic
cycles in $G$). The least number of colors needed for an acyclic edge coloring
of $G$ is called the acyclic chromatic index of $G$ and is denoted by $a'(G)$.
It is conjectured by Fiam\v{c}ik and independently by Alon et al. that $a'(G)
\leq \Delta(G)+2$, where $\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degree of $G$.
However, the best known general bound is $a'(G)\leq 4(\Delta(G)-1)$ due to
Esperet and Parreau. We apply a generalization of the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma
that we call the Local Action Lemma to show that if $G$ contains no copy of a
given bipartite graph $H$, then $a'(G) \leq 3\Delta(G)+o(\Delta(G))$. Moreover,
for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a constant $c$ such that if $g(G)\geq
c$, then $a'(G)\leq(2+\varepsilon)\Delta(G)+o(\Delta(G))$, where $g(G)$ denotes
the girth of $G$.
