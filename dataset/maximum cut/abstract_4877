Making use of the Effective Field Theory(EFT) expansion recently developed by
the contributors, we compute the charge form factor of triton up to
next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO). The three-nucleon forces(3NF) is
required for renormalization of the three-nucleon system and it effects are
predicted for process and is qualitatively supported by available experimental
data. We also show that, by including higher order corrections, the calculated
charge form factor and charge radius of $^3$H are in satisfactory agreement
with the experimental data and the realistic Argonne $v_{18}$ two-nucleon and
Urbana IX potential models calculations. This method makes possible a high
precision few-body calculations in nuclear physics. Our result converges order
by order in low energy expansion and also cut-off independent.
