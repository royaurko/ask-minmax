We demonstrate a Kerr-lens mode locked folded cavity using a planar
(non-Brewster) Ti:sapphire crystal as a gain and Kerr medium, thus cancelling
the nonlinear astigmatism caused by a Brewster cut Kerr medium. Our method uses
a novel cavity folding in which the intra-cavity laser beam propagates in two
perpendicular planes such that the astigmatism of one mirror is compensated by
the other mirror, enabling the introduction of an astigmatic free, planar-cut
gain medium. We demonstrate that this configuration is inherently free of
nonlinear astigmatism, which in standard cavity folding needs a special power
specific compensation.
