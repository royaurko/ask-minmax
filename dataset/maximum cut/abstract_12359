We discuss the quark parton structure of the $\Lambda$ baryon and the
fragmentation of quarks into $\Lambda$ baryons. We show that the hyperfine
interaction, responsible for the $\Delta$-$N$ and $\Sigma^0$-$\Lambda$ mass
splittings, leads not only to sizeable SU(3) and SU(6) symmetry breaking in the
quark distributions of the $\Lambda$, but also to significant polarized
non-strange quark distributions. The same arguments suggest flavor asymmetric
quark fragmentation functions and non-zero polarized non-strange quark
fragmentation functions. The calculated fragmentation functions give a good
description of all measured observables. We predict significant positive
$\Lambda$ polarization in semi-inclusive DIS experiments while models based on
SU(3) flavor symmetry predict zero or negative $\Lambda$ polarization. Our
approach also provides a natural explanation for the dependence of the maximum
of the $\xi=\ln(1/z)$ spectrum on the mass of the particles produced in
$e^+e^-$ annihilation.
