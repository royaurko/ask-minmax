In this paper we derive an expression for the conserved Pauli-Lubanski scalar
in 't Hooft's polygon approach to 2+1-dimensional gravity coupled to point
particles. We find that it is represented by an extra spatial shift $\Delta$ in
addition to the usual identification rule (being a rotation over the cut). For
two particles this invariant is expressed in terms of 't Hooft's phase-space
variables and we check its classical limit.
