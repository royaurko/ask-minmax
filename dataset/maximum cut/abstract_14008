By using the recent nonperturbative equation of state of the quark gluon
plasma derived in the formalism of the Field Correlator Method, we investigate
the bulk properties of the strange quark matter in beta-equilibrium and with
charge neutrality at T=p=0. The results show that the stability of strange
quark matter with respect to $^{56}Fe$ is strongly dependent on the model
parameters, namely, the gluon condensate $G_2$ and the q$\bar{\rm q}$
interaction potential $V_1$. A remarkable result is that the width of the
stability window decreases as $V_1$ increases, being maximum at $V_1=0$ and
nearly zero at $V_1=0.5$ GeV. For $V_1$ in the range $0\leq V_1\leq0.5$ GeV,
all values of $G_2$ are lower than $0.006-0.007\;{\rm GeV}^4$ obtained from
comparison with lattice results at $T_c\;(\mu=0)\sim170$ MeV. These results do
not favor the possibilities for the existence of (either nonnegative or
negative) absolutely stable strange quark matter.
