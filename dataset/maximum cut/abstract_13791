Herein, we examined the dependence of protein adsorption on the nanoparticle
surface in the presence of functional groups. Our UV-visible spectrophotometry,
transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and dynamic light
scattering measurements evidently suggested that the functional groups play an
important role in the formation of nanoparticle-protein corona. We found that
uncoated and surfactant-free silver nanoparticles derived from a laser ablation
process promoted a maximum protein (bovine serum albumin) coating due to
increased changes in entropy. On the other hand, BSA displayed a lower affinity
for electrostatically stabilized nanoparticles due to the constrained entropy
changes.
