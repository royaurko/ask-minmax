The vortex-liquid and vortex-solid phases in single crystals of
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ placed in tilted magnetic fields are studied
by in-plane resistivity measurements using the Corbino geometry to avoid
spurious surface barrier effects. It was found that the anisotropy of the
vortex-solid phase increases with temperature and exhibits a maximum at
$T\approx 0.97 T_c$. In contrast, the anisotropy of the vortex-liquid rises
monotonically across the whole measured temperature range. The observed
behavior is discussed in the context of dimensional crossover and thermal
fluctuations of vortices in the strongly layered system.
