Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has been a popular representation
method for pattern classification problem. It tries to decompose a nonnegative
matrix of data samples as the product of a nonnegative basic matrix and a
nonnegative coefficient matrix, and the coefficient matrix is used as the new
representation. However, traditional NMF methods ignore the class labels of the
data samples. In this paper, we proposed a supervised novel NMF algorithm to
improve the discriminative ability of the new representation. Using the class
labels, we separate all the data sample pairs into within-class pairs and
between-class pairs. To improve the discriminate ability of the new NMF
representations, we hope that the maximum distance of the within-class pairs in
the new NMF space could be minimized, while the minimum distance of the
between-class pairs pairs could be maximized. With this criterion, we construct
an objective function and optimize it with regard to basic and coefficient
matrices and slack variables alternatively, resulting in a iterative algorithm.
