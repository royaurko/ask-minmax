Entanglement of the excitonic states in the system of two coupled
semiconductor microcrystallites, whose sizes are much larger than the Bohr
radius of exciton in bulk semiconductor but smaller than the relevant optical
wavelength, is quantified in terms of the entropy of entanglement. It is
observed that the nonlinear interaction between excitons increases the maximum
values of the entropy of the entanglement more than that of the linear coupling
model. Therefore, a system of two coupled microcrystallites can be used as a
good source of entanglement with fixed exciton number. The relationship between
the entropy of the entanglement and the population imbalance of two
microcrystallites is numerically shown and the uppermost envelope function for
them is estimated by applying the Jaynes principle.
