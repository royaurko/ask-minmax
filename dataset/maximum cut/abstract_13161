We studied the thermodynamics of the one-dimensional J1-J2 spin-1/2
Heisenberg chain for ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor bonds J1 < 0 and
frustrating antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor bonds J1 > 0 using full
diagonalization of finite rings and a second-order Green-function formalism.
Thereby we focus on J2 < |J1|/4 where the ground state is still ferromagnetic,
but the frustration influences the thermodynamic properties. We found that
their critical indices are not changed by J2. The analysis of the
low-temperature behavior of the susceptibility chi leads to the conclusion that
this behavior changes from chi \propto T^{-2} at J2 < |J1|/4 to chi \propto
T^{-3/2} at the quantum-critical point J2=|J1|/4. Another effect of the
frustration is the appearance of an extra low-T maximum in the specific heat
C_v(T) for J2 \gtrsim |J1|/8, indicating its strong influence on the low-energy
spectrum.
