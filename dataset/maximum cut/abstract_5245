We report on the search for 0.1-10 GeV emission from magnetars in 17 months
of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations. No significant evidence for
gamma-ray emission from any of the currently-known magnetars is found. The most
stringent upper limits to date on their persistent emission in the Fermi-LAT
energy range are estimated between ~10^{-12}-10^{-10} erg/s/cm2, depending on
the source. We also searched for gamma-ray pulsations and possible outbursts,
also with no significant detection. The upper limits derived support the
presence of a cut-off at an energy below a few MeV in the persistent emission
of magnetars. They also show the likely need for a revision of current models
of outer gap emission from strongly magnetized pulsars, which, in some
realizations, predict detectable GeV emission from magnetars at flux levels
exceeding the upper limits identified here using the Fermi-LAT observations.
