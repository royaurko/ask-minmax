In this paper we studied the double scaling limit of a random unitary matrix
ensemble near a singular point where a new cut is emerging from the support of
the equilibrium measure. We obtained the asymptotic of the correlation kernel
by using the Riemann-Hilbert approach. We have shown that the kernel near the
critical point is given by the correlation kernel of a random unitary matrix
ensemble with weight $e^{-x^{2\nu}}$. This provides a rigorous proof of the
previous results of Eynard.
