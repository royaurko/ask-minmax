We present high performance fiber-coupled niobium titanium nitride
superconducting nanowire single photon detectors fabricated on thermally
oxidized silicon substrates. The best device showed a system detection
efficiency (DE) of 74%, dark count rate of 100 c/s, and full width at half
maximum timing jitter of 68 ps under a bias current of 18.0 uA with a practical
Gifford-McMahon cryocooler system. We also introduced six detectors into the
cryocooler and confirmed that the system DE of all detectors was higher than
67% at the dark count rate of 100 c/s.
