This paper aims to unify and extend existing techniques for deriving upper
bounds on the transient of max-plus matrix powers. To this aim, we introduce
the concept of weak CSR expansions: A^t=CS^tR + B^t. We observe that most of
the known bounds (implicitly) take the maximum of (i) a bound for the weak CSR
expansion to hold, which does not depend on the values of the entries of the
matrix but only on its pattern, and (ii) a bound for the CS^tR term to
dominate. To improve and analyze (i), we consider various cycle replacement
techniques and show that some of the known bounds for indices and exponents of
digraphs apply here. We also show how to make use of various parameters of
digraphs. To improve and analyze (ii), we introduce three different kinds of
weak CSR expansions (named after Nachtigall, Hartman-Arguelles, and Cycle
Threshold). As a result, we obtain a collection of bounds, in general
incomparable to one another, but better than the bounds found in the
literature.
