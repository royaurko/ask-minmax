We investigate the nonextensive $q$-distribution function for a gas in the
presence of an external field of force possessing a potential $U({\bf r})$. In
the case of a dilute gas, we show that the power law distribution including the
potential energy factor term can rigorously be deduced based on kinetic
theoretical arguments. This result is significant as a preliminary to the
discussion of long range interactions according to nonextensive
thermostatistics and the underlying kinetic theory. As an application, the
historical problem of the unbounded isothermal planetary atmospheres is
rediscussed. It is found that the maximum height for the equilibrium atmosphere
is $z_{max} = K_{B}T/mg(1-q)$. In the extensive limit, the exponential
Boltzmann factor is recovered and the length of the atmosphere becomes
infinite.
