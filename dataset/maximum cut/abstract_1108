The qualitative properties of local random invariant manifolds for stochastic
partial differential equations with quadratic nonlinearities and multiplicative
noise is studied by a cut off technique. By a detail estimates on the Perron
fixed point equation describing the local random invariant manifold, the
structure near a bifurcation is given.
