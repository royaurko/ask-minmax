In a series of papers we have found statistically significant correlations
between arrival directions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and BL Lacertae
objects. Recently, our calculations were partly repeated by Evans, Ferrer and
Sarkar with different conclusions. We demonstrate that the criticism of Evans,
Ferrer and Sarkar is incorrect. We also present the details of our method.
