The ~15.1 years period found in the long-term UBV photoelectric and
photographic photometry of the symbiotic nova V1016 Cyg is detected also in the
(J-K) colour index and in the UV continuum and emission line fluxes from IUE
and HUT spectra. It could be interpreted either as the effect of recurrent
enhanced mass loss episodes from the Mira type variable companion to a hot
component along its ultra-wide orbit (proposed from recent HST observations) or
the true orbital period of the inner, unresolved binary of a triple system. A
410-day delay of the maximum of UV emission lines fluxes with respect to the
maximum of continuum was found. The pulsation period of the Mira type variable
was improved to 474+/-6 days.
