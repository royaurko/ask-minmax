In tunnel junctions with ferroelectric barriers, switching the polarization
direction modifies the electrostatic potential profile and the associated
average tunnel barrier height. This results in strong changes of the tunnel
transmission and associated resistance. The information readout in
ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) is thus resistive and non-destructive,
which is an advantage compared to the case of conventional ferroelectric
memories (FeRAMs). Initially, endurance limitation (i.e. fatigue) was the main
factor hampering the industrialization of FeRAMs. Systematic investigations of
switching dynamics for various ferroelectric and electrode materials have
resolved this issue, with endurance now reaching $10^{14}$ cycles. Here we
investigate data retention and endurance in fully patterned submicron
Co/BiFeO$_3$/Ca$_{0.96}$Ce$_{0.04}$MnO$_3$ FTJs. We report good reproducibility
with high resistance contrasts and extend the maximum reported endurance of
FTJs by three orders of magnitude ($4\times10^6$ cycles). Our results indicate
that here fatigue is not limited by a decrease of the polarization or an
increase of the leakage but rather by domain wall pinning. We propose
directions to access extreme and intermediate resistance states more reliably
and further strengthen the potential of FTJs for non-volatile memory
applications.
