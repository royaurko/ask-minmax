Polarization in classical Be stars results from Thomson scattering of the
unpolarized light from the Be star in the circumstellar disc. Theory and
observations agree that the maximum degree of polarization from isolated Be
stars is < 4%. We report on the first optical polarimetric observations of the
Be/X-ray binary EXO\,2030+375. We find that the optical (R band) light is
strongly linearly polarized with a degee of polarization of 19%, the highest
ever measured either in a classical or Be/X-ray binary. We argue that the
interstellar medium cannot account for this high polarization degree and that a
substantial amount must be intrinsic to the source. We propose that it may
result from the alignment of non-spherical ferromagnetic grains in the Be star
disc due to the strong neutron star magnetic field.
