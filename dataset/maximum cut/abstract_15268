The propagation of TeV-PeV cosmic rays (CR) in our Galaxy can be described as
a diffusive process. We discuss here two effects, with important observational
consequences, that cannot be predicted by the diffusion approximation in its
usual form. First, we present an explanation for the CR anisotropies observed
at small angular scales on the sky. We show that the local magnetic field
configuration within a CR mean free path from Earth naturally results in CR
flux anisotropies at small and medium scales. Second, we point out that TeV-PeV
CRs should be expected to diffuse strongly anisotropically in the interstellar
medium on scales smaller than the maximum scale of spatial fluctuations of the
field, $\sim 100$ pc. This notably questions the usual assumptions on CR
diffusion around sources.
