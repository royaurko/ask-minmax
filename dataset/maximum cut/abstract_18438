We report the discovery of a new gravitational lens system from the CLASS
survey, CLASS B0631+519. VLA, MERLIN and VLBA observations show a doubly-imaged
radio core, a doubly-imaged lobe and a second lobe that is probably
quadruply-imaged. The maximum image separation is 1.16 arcseconds. The VLBA
resolves the most magnified image of the flat-spectrum radio core into a number
of sub-components spread across approximately 20 milli-arcseconds. Optical and
near-infrared imaging with the ACS and NICMOS cameras on the HST show that
there are two galaxies along the line of sight to the lensed source, as was
previously discovered by optical spectroscopy. The nearer galaxy at z=0.0896 is
a small blue irregular, while the more distant galaxy at z=0.6196 is an
elliptical type and appears to contribute most of the lensing effect. The host
galaxy of the lensed source is visible in NICMOS imaging as a set of arcs that
form an almost complete Einstein ring. Mass modelling using non-parametric
techniques can reproduce the ring and indicates that the irregular galaxy has a
(localised) effect on the flux density distribution in the Einstein ring at the
5-10% level.
