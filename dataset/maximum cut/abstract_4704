We present the calculation of the dominant next to leading order QCD
corrections to Higgs boson production in association with three jets via vector
boson fusion in the form of a NLO parton-level Monte Carlo program. QCD
corrections to integrated cross sections are modest, while the shapes of some
kinematical distributions change appreciably at NLO. Scale uncertainties are
shown to be reduced at NLO for the total cross section and for distributions.
We consider a central jet veto at the LHC and analyze the veto probability for
typical vector boson fusion cuts. Scale uncertainties of the veto probability
are sufficiently small at NLO for precise Higgs coupling measurements at the
LHC.
