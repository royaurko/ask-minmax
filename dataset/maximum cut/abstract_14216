We study few-body problems in mixed dimensions with $N \ge 2$ heavy atoms
trapped individually in parallel one-dimensional tubes or two-dimensional
disks, and a single light atom travels freely in three dimensions. By using the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we find three- and four-body bound states for a
broad region of heavy-light atom scattering length combinations. Specifically,
the existence of trimer and tetramer states persist to negative scattering
lengths regime, where no two-body bound state is present. These few-body bound
states are analogous to the Efimov states in three dimensions, but are stable
against three-body recombination due to geometric separation. In addition, we
find that the binding energy of the ground trimer and tetramer state reaches
its maximum value when the scattering lengths are comparable to the separation
between the low-dimensional traps. This resonant behavior is a unique feature
for the few-body bound states in mixed dimensions.
