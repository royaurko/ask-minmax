For lattice models with compact field integration (nonlinear sigma models
over compact manifolds and gauge theories with compact groups) and satisfying
some discrete symmetry, the change of sign of the bare coupling g_0^2 at zero
results in a mere discontinuity in the average energy rather than the
catastrophic instability occurring in theories with integration over
arbitrarily large fields. This indicates that the large order of perturbative
series and the non-perturbative contributions should have unexpected features.
Using the large-N limit of 2-dimensional nonlinear O(N) sigma model, we discuss
the complex singularities of the average energy for complex 't Hooft coupling
lambda= g_0^2N. A striking difference with the usual situation is the absence
of cut along the negative real axis. We show that the zeros of the partition
function can only be inside a clover shape region of the complex lambda plane.
We calculate the density of states and use the result to verify numerically the
statement about the zeros. We propose dispersive representations of the
derivatives of the average energy for an approximate expression of the
discontinuity. The discontinuity is purely non-perturbative and contributions
at small negative coupling in one dispersive representation are essential to
guarantee that the derivatives become exponentially small when lambda -> 0^+ We
discuss the implications for gauge theories.
