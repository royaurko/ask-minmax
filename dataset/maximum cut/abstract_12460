The conventional interpretation of the Hawking-Moss (HM) solution implies a
transition rate between vacua that depends only on the values of the potential
in the initial vacuum and at the top of a potential barrier, leading to the
implausible conclusion that transitions to distant vacua can be as likely as
those to a nearby one. I analyze this issue using a nongravitational example
with analogous properties. I show that such HM bounce do not give reliable rate
calculations, but are instead related to the probability of finding a
quasistable configuration at a local potential maximum.
