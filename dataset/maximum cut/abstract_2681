In this work, shells are mathematically constructed by applying the cut and
paste procedure to D-dimensional spherically symmetric geometries. The weak
energy condition for the matter on the shells is briefly analyzed. The
dynamical evolution is studied, and the general formalism for the stability of
static solutions is presented. Several examples corresponding to different
spacetime dimensions and values of the parameters are considered.
