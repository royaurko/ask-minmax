The aim our work is to create virtual humans as intelligent entities, which
includes approximate the maximum as possible the virtual agent animation to the
natural human behavior. In order to accomplish this task, our agent must be
capable to interact with the environment, interacting with objects and other
agents. The virtual agent needs to act as real person, so he should be capable
to extract semantic information from the geometric model of the world where he
is inserted, based on his own perception, and he realizes his own decision. The
movement of the individuals is representing by the combination of two
approaches of movement which are, the social force model and the based-rule
model. These movements are influenced by a set of socio-psychological rules to
give a more realistic result.
