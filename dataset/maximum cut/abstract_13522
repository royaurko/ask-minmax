We present here ^{13}C and ^{133}Cs NMR spin lattice relaxation T_{1} data in
the A15 and fcc-Cs_{3}C_{60} phases for increasing hydrostatic pressure through
the transition at p_{c} from a Mott insulator to a superconductor. We evidence
that for p>> p_{c} the (T_{1}T)^{-1} data above T_{c} display metallic like
Korringa constant values which match quantitatively previous data taken on
other A_{3}C_{60} compounds. However below the pressure for which T_{c} goes
through a maximum, (T_{1}T)^{-1} is markedly increased with respect to the
Korringa values expected in a simple BCS scenario. This points out the
importance of electronic correlations near the Mott transition. For p > p_{c}
singular T dependences of (T_{1}T)^{-1} are detected for T >> T_{c}. It will be
shown that they can be ascribed to a large variation with temperature of the
Mott transition pressure p_{c} towards a liquid-gas like critical point, as
found at high T for usual Mott transitions.
