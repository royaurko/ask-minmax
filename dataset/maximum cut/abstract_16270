Intervening HI 21-cm absorption systems at z > 1.0 are very rare and only 4
confirmed detections have been reported in the literature. Despite their
scarcity, they provide interesting and unique insights into the physical
conditions in the interstellar medium of high-z galaxies. Moreover, they can
provide independent constraints on the variation of fundamental constants. We
report 3 new detections based on our ongoing Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope
(GMRT) survey for 21-cm absorbers at 1.10< z_abs< 1.45 from candidate damped
Lyman_alpha systems. The 21-cm lines are narrow for the z_abs = 1.3710 system
towards SDSS J0108-0037 and z_abs = 1.1726 system toward SDSS J2358-1020. Based
on line full-width at half maximum, the kinetic temperatures are <= 5200 K and
<=800 K, respectively. The 21-cm absorption profile of the third system, z_abs
=1.1908 system towards SDSS J0804+3012, is shallow, broad and complex,
extending up to 100 km/s. The centroids of the 21-cm lines are found to be
shifted with respect to the corresponding centroids of the metal lines derived
from SDSS spectra. This may mean that the 21-cm absorption is not associated
with the strongest metal line component.
