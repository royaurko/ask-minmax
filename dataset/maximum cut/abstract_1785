This paper is devoted to investigate the structure of the pseudo-Newtonian
force and potential of the stringy black holes. We discuss conditions for the
force character from an attractive to repulsive. It is also found that the
force will reach a maximum under certain conditions. Also, the ratio of mass
and charge is evaluated for the maximum force.
