The contribution of the quiet Sun to solar irradiance variability, due either
to changes of the solar effective temperature or to the presence of unresolved
magnetic field, is still poorly understood. In this study we investigate
spectral line diagnostics that are sensitive to both temperature variations and
the presence of small scale unresolved magnetic features in these areas of the
solar atmosphere. Specifically we study the dependence on the magnetic flux
density of three parameters describing the shape of two magnetically sensitive
FeI lines, at 630.2 nm and 617.3 nm, namely the line core intensity (IC), full
width at half maximum (FWHM), and the equivalent width (EQW). To this aim we
analyze observations of active region NOAA 11172, acquired with IBIS at the
Dunn Solar Telescope, as well as results from numerical synthesis. Our results
show that IC is sensitive to both temperature and magnetic flux density
variations, FWHM is mostly affected by magnetic field changes, and EQW is
mostly sensitive to temperature. Variations of a few percent of the measured
line parameters are found in observational data that was spatially degraded to
represent quiet-Sun, disk-centre, medium resolution observations. It is
therefore possible to disentangle magnetic from pure thermodynamic effects by
comparison of temporal variations of the EQW and the FWHM of either the two FeI
lines.
