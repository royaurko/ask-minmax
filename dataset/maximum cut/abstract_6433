We investigate the periodic Anderson-Holstein model by using the dynamical
mean-field theory combined with the exact diagonalization method. For the
strong electron-phonon coupling $g\simg g_c$, the system shows an anomalous
heavy-fermion behaviour which is accompanied by a large lattice fluctuation and
an extreme phonon softening. We also calculate an effective potential for the
ions and find that a simple harmonic potential for $g\siml g_c$ changes into a
double-well potential for $g\simg g_c$. The effective pairing interaction
between the conduction electrons shows a maximum at $g \approx g_c$ where the
superconducting transition temperature is expected to be maximum.
