Scintillation properties of pure CsI crystals used in the shower calorimeter
being built for precise determination of the pi+ -> pi0 e+ nu decay rate are
reported. Seventy-four individual crystals, polished and wrapped in Teflon
foil, were examined in a multiwire drift chamber system specially designed for
transmission cosmic muon tomography. Critical elements of the apparatus and
reconstruction algorithms enabling measurement of spatial detector optical
nonuniformities are described. Results are compared with a Monte Carlo
simulation of the light response of an ideal detector. The deduced optical
nonuniformity contributions to the FWHM energy resolution of the PIBETA CsI
calorimeter for the pi+ -> e+ nu 69.8 MeV positrons and the monoenergetic 70.8
MeV photons were 2.7% and 3.7%, respectively. The upper limit of optical
nonuniformity correction to the 69.8 MeV positron low-energy tail between 5 MeV
and 55 MeV was +0.2%, as opposed to the +0.3% tail contribution for the photon
of the equivalent total energy. Imposing the 5 MeV calorimeter veto cut to
suppress the electromagnetic losses, GEANT-evaluated positron and photon
lineshape tail fractions summed over all above-threshold ADCs were found to be
2.36+-0.05(stat)+-0.20(sys)% and 4.68+-0.07(stat)+-0.20(sys)%, respectively.
