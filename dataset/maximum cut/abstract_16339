We report the electrical resistivity, Hall coefficient, thermoelectric power,
specific heat, and thermal conductivity on single crystals of the type-VIII
clathrate Ba8Ga16Sn30 grown from Sn-flux. Negative S and R_H over a wide
temperature range indicate that electrons dominate electrical transport
properties. Both rho(T) and S(T) show typical behavior of a heavily doped
semiconductor. The absolute value of S increases monotonically to 243 uV/K with
increasing temperature up to 550 K. The large S may originate from the low
carrier concentration n=3.7x10^19 cm^(-3). Hall mobility u_H shows a maximum of
62 cm^2/Vs around 70 K. The analysis of temperature dependence of u_H suggests
a crossover of dominant scattering mechanism from ionized impurity to acoustic
phonon scattering with increasing temperature. The existence of local vibration
modes of Ba atoms in cages composed of Ga and Sn atoms is evidenced by analysis
of experimental data of structural refinement and specific heat, which give an
Einstein temperature of 50 K and a Debye temperature of 200 K. This local
vibration of Ba atoms should be responsible for the low thermal conductivity
(1.1 W/m K at 150 K). The potential of type-VIII clathrate compounds for
thermoelectric application is discussed.
