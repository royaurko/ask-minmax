We present observations carried out using the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias
and an interpretative model of the dust environment of activated asteroid
313P/Gibbs. We discuss three different models relating to different values of
the dust parameters, i.e, dust loss rate, maximum and minimum sizes of
particles, power index of the size distribution, and emission pattern. The best
model corresponds with an isotropic emission of particles which started on
August 1st. The size of grains were in the range of $0.1-2000$ $\mu$m, with
velocities for 100 $\mu$m particles between $0.4-1.9$ m$~$s$^{-1}$, with a dust
production rate in the range of $0.2-0.8$ kg$~$s$^{-1}$. The dust tails'
brightness and morphology are best interpreted in terms of a model of sustained
and low dust emission driven by water-ice sublimation, spanning since 2014
August 1st, and triggered by a short impulsive event. This event produced an
emission of small particles of about 0.1 $\mu$m with velocities of $\sim$4
m$~$s$^{-1}$. From our model we deduce that the activity of this Main-Belt
Comet continued for, at least, four months, since activation.
