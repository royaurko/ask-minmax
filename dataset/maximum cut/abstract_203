In the inverse seesaw mechanism where the spontaneously broken B-L symmetry
induces tiny B-L violating Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos,
non-standard Higgs signatures can arise due to a possible Higgs doublet and
singlet mixing and/or Higgs boson decays to a left- and right-handed neutrino.
This leads to a remarkable feature of hadronically quiet di-lepton final states
which can exhibit, in particular, lepton flavour violating signatures coming
from flavour-dependent neutrino Yukawa couplings. In this process, one lepton
coming from the right-handed decay could be soft enough can be missed by the
trigger level cuts of CMS and ATLAS for the di-lepton plus missing energy
signature. The prospects of such a signature are investigated for 8 TeV and 14
TeV center of mass energy of the LHC, taking the maximum value of the allowed
neutrino Yukawa coupling and the right-handed neutrino mass of 100 GeV. A
PYTHIA level simulation shows that the integrated luminosity of 10--20/fb and
1.6/fb for 8 TeV is required to observe the inclusive leptonic and lepton
flavour violating signatures, respectively. For 14 TeV, the reach is more and a
larger parameter space of the inverse seesaw model can be probed.
