Carbon nanotube Schottky diodes have been fabricated in an
all-photolithographic process using dissimilar contact metals on high-frequency
compatible substrates (quartz and sapphire). Diodes show near-ideal behavior,
and rectify currents of up to 100 nA and at frequencies up to 18 GHz. The
voltage and frequency dependence is used to estimate the junction capacitance
of ~10-18 F and the intrinsic device cut-off frequency of ~400 GHz.
