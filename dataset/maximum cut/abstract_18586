We investigate the Higgs boson sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM) in the framework of the three most prominent soft SUSY-breaking
scenarios, mSUGRA, MGMSB and mAMSB. For each scenario, we determine the
parameters at the electroweak scale from the set of input variables at higher
energy scales (depending on the specific scenario) and evaluate the Higgs boson
properties. The latter are based on results obtained within the
Feynman-diagrammatic approach by taking into account the complete one-loop and
the dominant two-loop contributions. The maximum value of the mass of the
lightest neutral CP-even MSSM Higgs boson, m_h, is determined in the three
scenarios, and the behavior of the Higgs couplings to fermions and gauge bosons
is investigated. Restrictions on tan beta and on the set of higher-energy scale
parameters are derived from the lower limits arising from the Higgs search at
LEP2. We furthermore discuss the regions of parameter space in the three
scenarios compatible with interpreting the excess observed at LEP2 as a Higgs
signal, with m_h = (115.0 + 1.3 - 0.9) GeV. The case where the events observed
at LEP2 could originate from the production of the heavier neutral CP-even
Higgs boson is also considered. The implications of a possible Higgs signal at
115 GeV for SUSY searches at future colliders are briefly discussed for each of
the three scenarios.
