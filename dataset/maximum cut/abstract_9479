The difference between consecutive daily Sunspot Numbers was analysed. Its
distribution was approximated on a large time scale with an exponential law. In
order to verify this approximation a Maximum Entropy distribution was generated
by a modified version of the Simulated Annealing algorithm. The exponential
approximation holds for the generated distribution too. The exponential law is
characteristic for time scales covering whole cycles and it is mostly a
characteristic of the Sunspot Number fluctuations and not of its average
variation.
