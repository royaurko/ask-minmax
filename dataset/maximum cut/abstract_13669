The specific heat capacity of a two-dimensional electron gas is derived for
two types of the density of states, namely, the Dirac delta function spectrum
and that based on a Gaussian function. For the first time, a closed form
expression of the specific heat for each case is obtained at half-filling. When
the chemical potential is temperature-independent, the temperature is
calculated at which the specific heat is a maximum. Here the effects of the
broadening of the Landau levels are distinguished from those of the different
filling factors. In general, the results derived herein hold for any
thermodynamic system having similar resonant states.
