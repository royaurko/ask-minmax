A setup is proposed to enhance tracking of very small particles, by using
optical tweezers embedded within a Sagnac interferometer. The achievable
signal-to-noise ratio is shown to be enhanced over that for a standard optical
tweezers setup. The enhancement factor increases asymptotically as the
interferometer visibility approaches 100%, but is capped at a maximum given by
the ratio of the trapping field intensity to the detector saturation threshold.
For an achievable visibility of 99%, the signal-to-noise ratio is enhanced by a
factor of 200, and the minimum trackable particle size is 2.4 times smaller
than without the interferometer.
