Sunspot numbers form a comprehensive, long-duration proxy of solar activity
and have been used numerous times to empirically investigate the properties of
the solar cycle. A number of correlations have been discovered over the 24
cycles for which observational records are available. Here we carry out a
sophisticated statistical analysis of the sunspot record that reaffirms these
correlations, and sets up an empirical predictive framework for future cycles.
An advantage of our approach is that it allows for rigorous assessment of both
the statistical significance of various cycle features and the uncertainty
associated with predictions. We summarize the data into three sequential
relations that estimate the amplitude, duration, and time of rise to maximum
for any cycle, given the values from the previous cycle. We find that there is
no indication of a persistence in predictive power beyond one cycle, and
conclude that the dynamo does not retain memory beyond one cycle. Based on
sunspot records up to October 2011, we obtain, for Cycle 24, an estimated
maximum smoothed monthly sunspot number of 97 +- 15, to occur in
January--February 2014 +- 6 months.
