Quantum conditions on the control of dynamics of a system coupled to an
environment are obtained. Specifically, consider a system initially in a system
subspace $H_{0}$ of dimensionality $M_{0}$, which evolves to populate system
subspaces $H_{1}$, $H_{2}$ of dimensionality $M_{1}$, $M_{2}$. Then there
always exists an initial state in $H_0$ that does not evolve into $H_2$ if
$M_{0}>dM_{2},$ where $2 \leq d \leq (M_0 +M_1 +M_2)^2$ is the number of
operators in the Kraus representation. Note, significantly, that the maximum
$d$ can be far smaller than the dimension of the bath. If this condition is not
satisfied then dynamics from $H_{0}$ that avoids $H_{2}$ can only be attained
physically under stringent conditions. An example from molecular dynamics and
spectroscopy, i.e. donor to acceptor energy transfer, is provided.
