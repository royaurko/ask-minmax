We model the nucleosynthesis during a radiative interpulse phase of a
rotating 3Msun Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star. We find an enhanced
production of the neutron source species C13 compared to non-rotating models
due to shear mixing of protons and C12 at the core-envelope interface. We
estimate that the resulting total production of heavy elements by slow neutron
capture s-process is too low to account for most observations. This due to the
fact that rotationally induced mixing during the interpulse phase causes a
pollution of the C13 pocket layer with the neutron poison N14. As a result we
find a maximum neutron exposure of tau_max=0.04mbarn^{-1} in the s-process
layer of our solar metallicity model with rotation. This is about a factor of 5
to 10 less than required to reproduce the observed stellar s-process abundance
patterns. We compare our results with models that include hydrodynamic
overshooting mixing, and with simple parametric models including the combined
effects of overshooting and mixing in the interpulse. Within the parametric
model a range of mixing efficiencies during the interpulse phase correlates
with a spread in the s-process efficiency. Such a spread is observed in AGB and
post-AGB stars as well as in pre-solar SiC grains.
