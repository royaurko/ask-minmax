Emergence of singularity of vorticity at a single point, not related to any
symmetry of the initial distribution, has been demonstrated numerically for the
first time. Behavior of the maximum of vorticity near the point of collapse
closely follows the dependence 1/(t0-t), where t0 is the time of collapse. This
agrees with the interpretation of collapse in an ideal incompressible fluid as
of the process of vortex lines breaking.
