We search for signatures of the extra neutral gauge boson $ Z^\prime$,
predicted in some extensions of the Standard Model, from the analysis of some
distributions for $p + p \longrightarrow \mu^+ + \mu^- + X$, where the only
exotic particle involved is $ Z^\prime$. In addition to the invariant mass and
charge asymmetry distributions, we propose in our search to use the transverse
momentum distribution ($p_T$) as an observable. We do our calculation for two
values of the LHC center of mass energy (7 and 14 TeV), corresponding to 1 and
100 fb$^{-1}$ of luminosity, in order to compare our findings from some models
with the distributions following from the Standard Model. By applying
convenient cuts in the invariant mass, we show that the final particles $p_T$
distributions can reveal the presence of an extra neutral gauge boson
contribution. We also claim that it is possible to disentangle the models
considered here and we emphasize that the minimal version of the model, based
on ${SU (3)_C \times SU (3)_L \times U (1)_X}$ symmetry, presents the more
clear signatures for $ Z^\prime$ existence.
