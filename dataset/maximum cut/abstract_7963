Solar eruptions are due to a sudden destabilization of force-free coronal
magnetic fields. But the detailed mechanisms which can bring the corona towards
an eruptive stage, then trigger and drive the eruption, and finally make it
explosive, are not fully understood. A large variety of storage-and-release
models have been developed and opposed to each other since 40 years. For
example, photospheric flux emergence vs. flux cancellation, localized coronal
reconnection vs. large-scale ideal instabilities and loss of equilibria,
tether-cutting vs. breakout reconnection, and so on. The competition between
all these approaches has led to a tremendous drive in developing and testing
all these concepts, by coupling state-of-the-art models and observations.
Thanks to these developments, it now becomes possible to compare all these
models with one another, and to revisit their interpretation in light of their
common and their different behaviors. This approach leads me to argue that no
more than two distinct physical mechanisms can actually initiate and drive
prominence eruptions: the magnetic breakout and the torus instability. In this
view, all other processes (including flux emergence, flux cancellation, flare
reconnection and long-range couplings) should be considered as various ways
that lead to, or that strengthen, one of the aforementioned driving mechanisms.
