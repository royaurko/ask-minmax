The SKA's design is driven by the needs of cutting-edge radio astronomy for
sensitivity and spacial resolution. However its design is also driven by the
desire to explore the transient radio Universe. In addition to pulsars, the SKA
will be able to carry out high time resolution observations of several classes
of known and predicted transient sources. Here we consider a selection of them,
and describe how observational demands affect the instrument's design.
