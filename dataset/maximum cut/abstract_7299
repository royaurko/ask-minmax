IC 4329A is the brightest known Seyfert galaxy in hard (~2-30 keV) X-rays and
is likely to be representative of Seyfert 1 galaxies as a class. A recent 100
ks BeppoSAX observation (Perola et al. 1999) clearly confirmed the presence of
a warm absorber, a reflection component (R~0.6), and a high-energy cut-off in
the power law at Ec~270 keV. Its richness in spectral features, combined with
its large flux (~1.6 x 10**-10 erg/cm2s between 2-10 keV), make this target
ideal for multiple observations (in particular with BeppoSAX) to search for
spectral variations. Results obtained from 3 follow-up observations (40 ks
each) are presented here. The first and most important goal of this study was
to probe the origin of the Compton reflection component observed in Seyfert
galaxies by monitoring the variability of the reflection continuum and FeK line
in response to primary continuum variations. The second goal was to search for
variability in the high energy cutoff. We obtain however no conclusive results
on any of these issues. In fact, all four observations unfortunately caught the
source at almost the same flux, showing only little, and marginal, spectral
changes between different observations.
