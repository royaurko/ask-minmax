Recently, several high-resolution parameter estimation algorithms have been
developed to exploit the structure of strictly second-order (SO) non-circular
(NC) signals. They achieve a higher estimation accuracy and can resolve up to
twice as many signal sources compared to the traditional methods for arbitrary
signals. In this paper, as a benchmark for these NC methods, we derive the
closed-form deterministic R-D NC Cramer-Rao bound (NC CRB) for the
multi-dimensional parameter estimation of strictly non-circular (rectilinear)
signal sources. Assuming a separable centro-symmetric R-D array, we show that
in some special cases, the deterministic R-D NC CRB reduces to the existing
deterministic R-D CRB for arbitrary signals. This suggests that no gain from
strictly non-circular sources (NC gain) can be achieved in these cases. For
more general scenarios, finding an analytical expression of the NC gain for an
arbitrary number of sources is very challenging. Thus, in this paper, we
simplify the derived NC CRB and the existing CRB for the special case of two
closely-spaced strictly non-circular sources captured by a uniform linear array
(ULA). Subsequently, we use these simplified CRB expressions to analytically
compute the maximum achievable asymptotic NC gain for the considered two source
case. The resulting expression only depends on the various physical parameters
and we find the conditions that provide the largest NC gain for two sources.
Our analysis is supported by extensive simulation results.
