We calculate the steady-state properties of neutrino-driven winds from
strongly magnetized, rotating proto-neutron stars (`proto-magnetars') under the
assumption that the outflow geometry is set by the force-free magnetic field of
an aligned dipole. Our goal is to assess proto-magnetars as sites of r-process
nucleosynthesis and gamma-ray burst engines. One dimensional solutions
calculated along flux tubes corresponding to different polar field lines are
stitched together to determine the global properties of the flow at a given
neutrino luminosity and rotation period. Proto-magnetars with rotation periods
of P~2-5 ms are shown to produce outflows more favorable for the production of
third-peak r-process nuclei due to their much shorter expansion times through
the seed nucleus formation region, yet only moderately lower entropies, as
compared to normal spherical PNS winds. Proto-magnetars with moderately rapid
birth periods P~3-5 ms may thus represent a promising Galactic r-process site
which is compatible with a variety of other observations, including the recent
discovery of possible magnetar-powered supernovae in metal poor galaxies. We
also confirm previous results that the outflows from proto-magnetars with P~1-2
ms can achieve maximum Lorentz factors Gamma ~ 100-1000 in the range necessary
to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The implications of GRB jets with a heavy
nuclei-dominated composition as sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays are
also addressed.
