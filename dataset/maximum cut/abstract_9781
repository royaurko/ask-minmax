The $hp$-version of the finite element method is applied to a singularly
perturbed reaction-diffusion equation posed in one- and two-dimensional domains
with analytic boundary. On suitably designed \emph{Spectral Boundary Layer
meshes}, robust exponential convergence in a balanced norm is shown. This
balanced norm is stronger than the energy norm in that the boundary layers are
$O(1)$ uniformly in the singular perturbation parameter. Robust exponential
convergence in the maximum norm is also established. The theoretical findings
are illustrated with two numerical experiments.
