In recent work we revisited the phase diagram of hard ellipsoids of
revolution (spheroids) by means of replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations.
This was done by setting random initial configurations, and allows to confirm
the formation of sm2 crystal structures at high densities [Phys. Rev. E 75,
020402 (2007)] for large anisotropies and stretched-fcc for small anisotropies.
In this work we employed the same technique but setting the starting cells as
sm2 crystal structures having the maximum known packing density [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 92, 255506 (2004)]. This procedure yields a very rich behavior for
quasi-spherical oblates and prolates. These systems, from low to high
pressures, show the following phases: isotropic fluid, plastic solid,
stretched-fcc solid, and sm2 solid. The first three transitions are first
order, whereas the last one is a subtle, probably high order transition. This
picture is consistent with the fact of having the sm2 structure capable of
producing the maximally achievable density.
