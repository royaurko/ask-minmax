In a social group its members are caled here agents. Any two agents from the
group may interact. The interaction consists of the exchange of information and
it costs some energy. There exist subgroups of interacting agents which are
nonreducibile. The structure, configuration of interactions between agents in
the group, forms a macroscopic structure. The statistical equilibrium due to
microreversibility is characterised by the maximum of entropy and by the
minimum of energy, costs of information exchange. Thus we have a structure
which is equivalent to random cellular networks /N. Rivier, Physica 23D (1986)
129-137/. We will use methods described by Rivier to study social behaviour of
agents. Their social behaviour is discussed. The social behaviour is discussed.
Three empiricaly observed dependences of personal radius dependence on some
factors enabled us to characterise the quantitz which characterises
verification of information.
