We investigate the distribution of the intrinsic extinction in NGC1569 using
an extinction map derived from the H_alpha/H_beta emission line ratio. We
compare the extinction distribution to that of the dust emission traced by
SPITZER IRAC(8microns) and MIPS (24microns) maps. The intrinsic extinction
shows spatial variations, from zones with negligible extinction to zones with
values up to A(V)=0.8mag. We find an extinction shell and establish a relation
between this shell and the interstellar expanding structure produced by the
stellar winds comig from the Super Star Cluster (SSCs) A and B in the center of
the galaxy. We suggest that the extinction shell has been produced by the
accumulation of dust at the border of the shell. Although we find a good
spatial correlation between the Balmer extinction and infrared emission, there
is a spatial displacement between the 8microns and 24microns maxima and the
maximum in Balmer extinction which needs further investigation.
