The eigenvalue problem for an irreducible non negative matrix $A=[a_{ij}]$ in
the max-algebra is the form $A \otimes x = \lambda x$ where $(A \otimes x)_i =
\max (a_{ij}x_j), x=(x_1,x_2, \dots, x_n)^t $ and $\lambda $ refers to maximum
cycle geometric mean $\mu (A) $. In this paper we exhibit a method to compute
$\mu (A)$ and max-eigenvector by using mutation of matrices. Since the order of
power method algorithm is $O(n^3)$, the advantage of this paper present a
faster procedure.
