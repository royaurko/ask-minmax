We present momentum resolved single-particle spectra for the
three-dimensional Hubbard model for the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetically
ordered phase obtained within the dynamical cluster approximation. The
effective cluster problem is solved by continuous-time Quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. The absence of a time discretization error and the ability to
perform Monte Carlo measurements directly in Matsubara frequencies enable us to
analytically continue the self-energies by maximum entropy, which is essential
to obtain momentum resolved spectral functions for the N'eel state. We
investigate the dependence on temperature and interaction strength and the
effect of magnetic frustration introduced by a next-nearest neighbor hopping.
One particular question we address here is the influence of the frustrating
interaction on the metal insulator transition of the three-dimensional Hubbard
model.
