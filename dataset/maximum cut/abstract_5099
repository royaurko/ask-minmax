The Coulomb-gauge ghost propagator, and the color-Coulomb potential, are
computed in an ensemble of configurations derived from our recently proposed
Yang-Mills vacuum wavefunctional in 2+1 dimensions. The results are compared to
the corresponding values obtained by standard Monte Carlo simulations in three
Euclidean dimensions. The agreement is quite striking for the Coulomb-gauge
ghost propagator. The color-Coulomb potential rises linearly at large
distances, but its determination suffers from rather large statistical
fluctuations, due to configurations with very low values of $\mu_0$, the lowest
eigenvalue of the Coulomb-gauge Faddeev-Popov operator. However, if one imposes
cuts on the data, effectively leaving out configurations with very low $\mu_0$,
the agreement of the potential in both sets of configurations is again
satisfactory, although the errorbars grow systematically as the cutoff is
eliminated.
