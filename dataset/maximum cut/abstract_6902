The polarised spectrum of stellar radiation encodes valuable information on
the conditions of stellar atmospheres and the magnetic fields that permeate
them. In this paper, we give explicit expressions to estimate the magnetic
field vector and its associated error from the observed Stokes parameters. We
study the solar case where specific intensities are observed and then the
stellar case, where we receive the polarised flux. In this second case, we
concentrate on the explicit expression for the case of a slow rotator with a
dipolar magnetic field geometry. Moreover, we also give explicit formulae to
retrieve the magnetic field vector from the LSD profiles without assuming mean
values for the LSD artificial spectral line. The formulae have been obtained
assuming that the spectral lines can be described in the weak field regime and
using a maximum likelihood approach. The errors are recovered by means of the
hermitian matrix. The bias of the estimators are analysed in depth.
