We describe the full characterization of the biaxial nonlinear crystal BiB3O6
(BiBO) as a polarization entangled photon source using non-collinear type-II
parametric down-conversion. We consider the relevant parameters for crystal
design, such as cutting angles, polarization of the photons, effective
nonlinearity, spatial and temporal walk-offs, crystal thickness and the effect
of the pump laser bandwidth. Experimental results showing entanglement
generation with high rates and a comparison to the well investigated
beta-BaB2O4 (BBO) crystal are presented as well. Changing the down-conversion
crystal of a polarization entangled photon source from BBO to BiBO enhances the
generation rate as if the pump power was increased by more than three times.
Such an improvement is currently required for the generation of multiphoton
entangled states.
