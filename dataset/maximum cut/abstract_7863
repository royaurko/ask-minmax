A nonlocal bipartite unitary gate can sometimes be implemented using prior
entanglement and only one round of classical communication in which the two
parties send messages to each other simultaneously. This cuts the classical
communication time by a half compared to the usual protocols, which require
back-and-forth classical communication. We introduce such a "fast" protocol
that can implement a class of controlled unitaries exactly, where the
controlled operators form a subset of a projective representation of a finite
group, which may be Abelian or non-Abelian. The entanglement cost is only
related to the size of the group and is independent of the dimension of the
systems. We also introduce a second fast protocol that can implement any given
controlled unitary approximately. This protocol uses the algebraic structure of
right quasigroups, which are generalizations of quasigroups, the latter being
equivalent to Latin squares. This second protocol could optionally use shared
classical randomness as a resource, in addition to using entanglement. When
compared with other known fast unitary protocols, the entanglement cost of this
second protocol is lower for general controlled unitaries except for some rare
cases.
