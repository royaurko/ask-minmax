Relaxation processes of dislocation systems are studied by two-dimensional
dynamical simulations. In order to capture generic features, three physically
different scenarios were studied and power-law decays found for various
physical quantities. Our main finding is that all these are the consequence of
the underlying scaling property of the dislocation velocity distribution.
Scaling is found to break down at some cut-off time increasing with system
size. The absence of intrinsic relaxation time indicates that criticality is
ubiquitous in all states studied. These features are reminiscent to glassy
systems, and can be attributed to the inherent quenched disorder in the
position of the slip planes.
