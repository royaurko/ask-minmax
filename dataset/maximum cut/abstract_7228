The problem of finding low rank $m\times m$ matrices in a real affine
subspace of dimension n has many applications in information and systems
theory, where low rank is synonymous of structure and parcimony. We design a
symbolic computation algorithm to solve this problem efficiently, exactly and
rigorously: the input are the rational coefficients of the matrices spanning
the affine subspace as well as the expected maximum rank, and the output is a
rational parametrization encoding a finite set of points that intersects each
connected component of the low rank real algebraic set. The complexity of our
algorithm is studied thoroughly. It is essentially polynomial in
binomial(n+m(m--r),n) where r is the expected maximum rank; it improves on the
state-of-the-art in the field. Moreover, computer experiments show the
practical efficiency of our approach.
