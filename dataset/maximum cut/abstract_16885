The Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey discovered Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) in an almost unexplored intermediate redshift range of
$0.05 < z < 0.4$ and provided densely sampled multi-color light curves for SN
candidates. Followup spectroscopy of this survey was carried out with the
Subaru telescope and spectra of 71 SN Ia candidates were obtained. One spectrum
was observed per candidate except for a peculiar variable. This paper presents
the method for processing these spectra. The observed wavelength ranges of our
spectra are 4000 to 9000 {\AA} for Year 2005 and 3600 to 9000 {\AA} for Year
2006. Most SN Ia spectra have signal to noise ratios (S/N) between 4 and 10 per
2 {\AA} averaged over the entire wavelength region. We developed a new code to
extract the SN spectral component from spectra contaminated by the host galaxy.
Of 71 SN Ia candidates, 59 are identified as normal SNe Ia and 3 are peculiar
SNe Ia. The range of spectral phases varies from -7 days to +30 days from
maximum brightness. There are also 7 SNe II, 1 possible hypernova and 1 AGN.
