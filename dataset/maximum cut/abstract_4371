We study the stability of the effective higgs potential in the split
supersymmetry and Little Higgs models. In particular, we study the effects of
higher dimensional operators in the effective potential on the higgs mass
predictions. We find that the size and sign of the higher dimensional operators
can significantly change the higgs mass required to maintain vacuum stability
in Split Susy models. In the Little Higgs models the effects of higher
dimensional operators can be large because of a relatively lower cut-off scale.
Working with a specific model we find that a contribution from the higher
dimensional operator with coefficient of O(1) can destabilize the vacuum.
