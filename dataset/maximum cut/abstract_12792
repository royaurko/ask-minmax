We find that peaks in the autocorrelation of angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy data of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ in the superconducting
state show dispersive behavior for binding energies smaller than the maximum
superconducting energy gap. For higher energies, though, a striking anomalous
dispersion is observed that is a consequence of the interaction of the
electrons with collective excitations. In contrast, in the pseudogap phase, we
only observe dispersionless behavior for the autocorrelation peaks. The
implications of our findings in regards to Fourier transformed scanning
tunneling spectroscopy data are discussed.
