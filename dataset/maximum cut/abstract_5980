The results of experiments on atmospheric neutrinos are summarized, with the
important exception of Superkamiokande. The main emphasis is given to the
Soudan-2 and MACRO experiments. Both experiments observe atmospheric neutrino
anomalies in agreement with nu_mu-->> nu_tau oscillations with maximum mixing.
The nu_mu-->> nu_sterile oscillation is disfavored by the MACRO experiment.
