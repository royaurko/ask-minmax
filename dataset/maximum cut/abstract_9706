We find, for all sufficiently large $n$ and each $k$, the maximum number of
edges in an $n$-vertex graph which does not contain $k+1$ vertex-disjoint
triangles.
  This extends a result of Moon [Canad. J. Math. 20 (1968), 96-102] which is in
turn an extension of Mantel's Theorem. Our result can also be viewed as a
density version of the Corradi-Hajnal Theorem.
