Open circuit voltage decay measurements are performed on methylammonium lead
iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite solar cells to investigate the charge carrier
recombination dynamics. The measurements are compared to the two reference
polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells based on P3HT:PC60BM and
PTB7:PC70BM blends. In the perovskite devices, two very different time domains
of the voltage decay are found, with a first drop on a short time scale that is
similar to the organic solar cells. However, two major differences are also
observed. 65-70% of the maximum photovoltage persists on much longer
timescales, and the recombination dynamics are dependent on the illumination
intensity.
