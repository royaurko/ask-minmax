The end section of a carbon nanotube, cut by acid treatment, contains
hydrophillic oxygen groups. Water molecules can self-assemble around these
groups to seal off a carbon nanotube and form an "aqueous valve". Molecular
dynamics simulations on single-wall (12,12) and (15,15) tubes with dangling
carboxyl groups show that the formation of aqueous valves can be achieved both
in the absence of and in the presence of high pressure hydrogen. Furthermore,
significant diffusion barriers through aqueous valves are identified. It
indicates that such valves could hold hydrogen inside the tube with GPa
pressure. Releasing hydrogen is easily achieved by melting the "aqueous valve".
Such a design provides a recyclable and non- destructive way to store hydrogen
in GPa pressure. Under the storage conditions dictated by sealing off the
container in liquid water, the hydrogen density inside the container is higher
than that for solid hydrogen, which promises excellent weight storage
efficiency.
