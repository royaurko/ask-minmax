A ground-based polarimeter, PIQUE, operating at 90 GHz has set a new limit on
the magnitude of any polarized anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background.
The combination of the scan strategy and full width half maximum beam of 0.235
degrees gives broad window functions with average multipoles, l = 211+294-146
and l = 212+229-135 for the E- and B-mode window functions, respectively. A
joint likelihood analysis yields simultaneous 95% confidence level flat band
power limits of 14 and 13 microkelvin on the amplitudes of the E- and B-mode
angular power spectra, respectively. Assuming no B-modes, a 95% confidence
limit of 10 microkelvin is placed on the amplitude of the E-mode angular power
spectrum alone.
