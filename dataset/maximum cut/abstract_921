In this paper we present INTEGRAL observations of 7 AGNs: two newly
discovered type 1 Seyferts, IGR J18027-1455 and IGR J21247+5058, and five well
known Seyferts, NGC 6814 (type 1.5), Cyg A (Type 2), MCG-05-23-16 (type 2), ESO
103-G035 (type2) and GRS1734-292. For IGR J18027-1455 and IGR J21247+5058 only
INTEGRAL/IBIS data were available, while broadband spectra are presented and
discussed for the remaining 5 sources for which either BeppoSAX or ASCA data
were used in conjunction with INTEGRAL measurements. In the cases of NGC 6814
and GRS 1734-292, data taken in different periods indicate variability in the
flux: in the case of NGC 6814 by a factor of 16 over a period of about 10
years. Although limited in size, our sample can be used to investigate the
parameter space of both the photon index and cut-off energy. The mean photon
index is 1.8, while the cut-off energy ranges from 30-50 keV to greater than
200 keV; in the particular case of MCG-05-23-16, ESO 103-G035 and GRS 1734-292
the cut-off energy is well constrained at or below 100 keV. We have also tested
an enlarged sample, which includes INTEGRAL data of 3 more AGNs, against the
correlation found by a number of contributors between the photon index and the
cut-off energy but have found no evidence for a relation between these two
parameters. Our analysis indicates that there is a diversity in cut-off
energies in the primary continuum of Seyfert galaxies.
