Single-top production processes have been studied using 0.7 fb-1 of data from
7 TeV center-of-mass energy proton-proton collisions collected with the ATLAS
detector at the LHC. Single-top is electroweak top production and the standard
model includes three production modes. Each contains a Wtb vertex, allowing the
possibility of a direct measurement of the CKM matrix element |Vtb|. Single-top
could also be sensitive to new physics, such as flavor changing neutral
currents or heavy W' bosons. Using cut-based selections, a limit of < 39.1 pb
is set for dilepton Wt production and < 26.5 pb for s-channel production. For
the t-channel measurement, both cut-based and neural network analyses are
performed and the cross-section is measured to be 90 +32 -22 pb, where 65 +28
-19 pb is expected according to standard model.
