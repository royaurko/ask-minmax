Recent investigations of the Dyson-Schwinger equations and Monte-Carlo
lattice calculations resulted in a coherent description of the fully dressed
gluon, ghost and quark propagators in Landau gauge QCD. In the Dyson-Schwinger
approach the infrared behaviour of these propagators is determined
analytically. For finite spacelike momenta the gluon, ghost and quark
propagators are compared to available corresponding results of lattice
Monte-Carlo calculations. For all three propagators an almost quantitative
agreement is found. These results for the non-perturbative propagators allow an
analytical verification of the Kugo-Ojima confinement criterion. Our numerical
analysis clearly reveals positivity violation for the gluon propagator
generated by a cut in the complex momentum plane. The non-perturbative strong
running coupling resulting from these propagators possesses an infrared fixed
point. The quark propagator obtained from quenched and unquenched calculations
displays dynamical chiral symmetry breaking with quark masses close to
``phenomenological'' and lattice values. We confirm that linear extrapolations
of the quark propagator for different bare masses to the chiral limit are
inaccurate.
