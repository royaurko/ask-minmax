Two types of self-gravitating particle solutions found in several theories
with non-Abelian fields are smoothly connected by a family of non-trivial black
holes. There exists a maximum point of the black hole entropy, where the
stability of solutions changes. This criterion is universal, and the changes in
stability follow from a catastrophe-theoretic analysis of the potential
function defined by black hole entropy.
