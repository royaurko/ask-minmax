We obtain an explicit solution of the momentum constraint for conformally
flat, maximal slicing, initial data which gives an alternative to the purely
longitudinal extrinsic curvature of Bowen and York. The new solution is
related, in a precise form, with the extrinsic curvature of a Kerr slice. We
study these new initial data representing spinning black holes by numerically
solving the Hamiltonian constraint. They have the following features: i)
Contain less radiation, for all allowed values of the rotation parameter, than
the corresponding single spinning Bowen-York black hole. ii) The maximum
rotation parameter $J/m^2$ reached by this solution is higher than that of the
purely longitudinal solution allowing thus to describe holes closer to a
maximally rotating Kerr one. We discuss the physical interpretation of these
properties and their relation with the weak cosmic censorship conjecture.
Finally, we generalize the data for multiple black holes using the ``puncture''
and isometric formulations.
