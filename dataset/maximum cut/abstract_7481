We review the results of a model of how nucleation of a new universe occurs,
assuming a di quark identification for soliton-anti soliton constituent parts
of a scalar field. Initially, we employ a false vacuum potential system;
however ,when cosmological expansion is dominated by the Einstein cosmological
constant at the end of chaotic inflation, the initial di quark scalar field is
not consistent with respect to a semi classical consistency conditions we
analyze as the potential changes to the chaotic inflationary potential utilized
by Guth. We use Scherrer's derivation of a sound speed being zero during
initial inflationary cosmology, and obtain a sound speed approaching unity as
the slope of the scalar field moves away from a thin wall approximation. All
this is to aid in a data reconstruction problem of how to account for the
initial origins of CMB due to dark matter since effective field theories as
presently constructed require a cut off value for applicability of their
potential structure. This is often at the cost of, especially in early universe
theoretical models, of clearly defined baryogenesis, and of a well defined
mechanism of phase transitions.
