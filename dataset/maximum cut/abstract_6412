The resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) was measured in an insulating
SrCuO$_{2}$ with changing the incident photon energy ($h\nu$) near the Cu $1s$
absorption edge (K-edge). Complex structures and their dependences on the
momentum transfer($\Delta k$) and $h\nu$ were observed. The $h\nu$ dependence
of the RIXS spectra measured for a constant $\Delta k$=2.4$\pi$ has shown a
remarkable enhancement near the absorption maximum and a shift of the spectral
weight toward larger loss-energy with increasing $h\nu$. Also, the energy of
the inelastic loss peak in the RIXS spectra for the fixed excitation at 8.993
keV, 10 eV below the absorption maximum, has shown a clear dependence on
$\Delta k$. These results are in a qualitative agreement with a theoretical
prediction. Full utilization of the potential of the high brilliance X ray
light source at BL19LXU of SPring-8 with 27 m long insertion device will open
up a breakthrough in RIXS for heavy transition metal compounds in accordance
with the improvement in focussing and analyzing elements.
