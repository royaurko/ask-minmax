The simulation of particle cascades initiated in the atmosphere by ultra high
energy cosmic ray particles involves the generation and propagation of a huge
amount of particles. As it is unpractical to follow every particle to its end,
particles below a certain energy ($E_{Cut}$) are discarded from the simulation.
In this article we study in detail the influence that this cut has on the total
energy deposited in the atmosphere by the particle cascade in AIRES
simulations. The energy deposit is directly related to the emission of
fluorescence light and is critical for the accurate simulation of shower
signals in fluorescence detectors. Not correcting for the discarded particles
introduces a bias on several shower observables related to the energy deposit
that can range from 3 to 30% or more depending on the $E_{Cut}$ value used. A
prescription for the correct treatment of these particles is proposed, and the
resulting corrections to the total energy deposit are addressed, including a
new universal parametrization of the mean energy deposit per particle. The low
energy cut is introduced in the simulations to reduce the required CPU time per
shower at the expense of simulation accuracy. We find that a 0.4 MeV cut for
electrons and 0.9 MeV cut for gammas is an adequate compromise, and that the
proposed prescription is capablable of removing the bias introduced by this
cut. The prescription is independent of the energy cut value and can be used to
correct and compare simulations made with different energy cuts.
