Previous top-down studies of jet stopping in strongly-coupled QCD-like
plasmas with gravity duals have been in the infinite 't Hooft coupling limit
lambda -> infinity. They have found that, though a wide range of jet stopping
distances are possible depending on initial conditions, the maximum jet
stopping distance l_max scales with energy as E^(1/3) at large energy. But it
has always been unclear whether the large-coupling and high-energy limits
commute. In this paper, we use the string alpha' expansion in AdS-CFT to study
the corrections to the lambda=infinity result in powers of 1/lambda. For the
particular type of "jets" that we study, we find that (i) the naive expansion
in 1/lambda breaks down for certain initial conditions but (ii) the relative
corrections to the maximum stopping distance are small when 1/lambda is small.
More specifically, we find that the expansion in 1/lambda is well behaved for
jets whose stopping distance l_stop is in the range lambda^(-1/6) l_max <<
l_stop <~ l_max, but the expansion breaks down (and the fate of lambda=infinity
results is uncertain) for jets created in such a way that l_stop <<
lambda^(-1/6) l_max. The analysis requires assessing the effects of all
higher-derivative corrections to the supergravity action for the gravity dual.
