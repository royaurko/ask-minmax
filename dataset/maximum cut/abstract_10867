SN 1999aw was discovered during the first campaign of the Nearby Galaxies
Supernova Search (NGSS) project. This luminous, slow-declining (Delta m_{15}
(B) = 0.81 \pm 0.03) Type Ia supernova was noteworthy in at least two respects.
First, it occurred in an extremely low luminosity host galaxy that was not
visible in the template images, nor in initial subsequent deep imaging.
Secondly, the photometric and spectral properties of this supernova indicate
that it very likely was similar to the subclass of Type Ia supernovae whose
prototype is SN 1999aa. This paper presents the BVRI and J_{s} HK_{s}
lightcurves of SN 1999aw (through 100 days past maximum light), as well as
several epochs of optical spectra. From these data we calculate the bolometric
light curve, and give estimates of the luminosity at maximum light and the
initial ^{56}Ni mass. In addition, we present deep BVI images obtained recently
with the Baade 6.5-meter telescope at Las Campanas Observatory which reveal the
remarkably low-luminosity host galaxy.
