In the context of the sensational results concerning superluminal velocities,
announced recently by the OPERA Collaboration, we have proposed a classical
model yielding a statistically calculated measured velocity of a beam, higher
than the velocity of the particles constituting the beam. The two key elements
of our model, necessary and sufficient to obtain this curious result, are a
time-dependent "transmission" function and statistical method of the
maximum-likelihood estimation.
