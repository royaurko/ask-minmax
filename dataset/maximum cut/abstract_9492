The energy of a dislocation loop in a continuum elastic solid under pressure
is considered within the framework of classical mechanics. For a circular loop,
this is a function with a maximum at pressures that are well within reach of
experimental conditions for solid helium suggesting, in this case, that
dislocation loops can be generated by a pressure-assisted thermally activated
process. It is also pointed out that pinned dislocations segments can alter the
shear response of solid helium, by an amount consistent with current
measurements, without any unpinning.
