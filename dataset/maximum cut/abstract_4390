We derive the triply differential spectrum for the inclusive rare decay B ->
Xs l+ l- in the shape function region, in which Xs is jet-like with $mX^2
\lesssim mb \Lambda_QCD$. Experimental cuts make this a relevant region. The
perturbative and non-perturbative parts of the matrix elements can be defined
with the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, which is used to incorporate alphas
corrections consistently. We show that, with a suitable power counting for the
dilepton invariant mass, the same universal jet and shape functions appear as
in B-> Xs gamma and B-> Xu l nu decays. Parts of the usual alphas(m_b)
corrections go into the jet function at a lower scale, and parts go into the
non-perturbative shape function. For B -> Xs l+ l-, the perturbative series in
alphas are of a different character above and below mu=mb. We introduce a
``split matching'' method that allows the series in these regions to be treated
independently.
