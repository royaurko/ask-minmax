We describe a new approximation algorithm for Max Cut. Our algorithm runs in
$\tilde O(n^2)$ time, where $n$ is the number of vertices, and achieves an
approximation ratio of $.531$. On instances in which an optimal solution cuts a
$1-\epsilon$ fraction of edges, our algorithm finds a solution that cuts a
$1-4\sqrt{\epsilon} + 8\epsilon-o(1)$ fraction of edges.
  Our main result is a variant of spectral partitioning, which can be
implemented in nearly linear time. Given a graph in which the Max Cut optimum
is a $1-\epsilon$ fraction of edges, our spectral partitioning algorithm finds
a set $S$ of vertices and a bipartition $L,R=S-L$ of $S$ such that at least a
$1-O(\sqrt \epsilon)$ fraction of the edges incident on $S$ have one endpoint
in $L$ and one endpoint in $R$. (This can be seen as an analog of Cheeger's
inequality for the smallest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a graph.)
Iterating this procedure yields the approximation results stated above.
  A different, more complicated, variant of spectral partitioning leads to an
$\tilde O(n^3)$ time algorithm that cuts $1/2 + e^{-\Omega(1/\eps)}$ fraction
of edges in graphs in which the optimum is $1/2 + \epsilon$.
