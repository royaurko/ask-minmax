It is shown that the distribution derived from the principle of maximum
Tsallis entropy is a superposable Levy-type distribution. Concomitantly, the
leading order correction to the limit distribution is also deduced. This
demonstration fills an important gap in the derivation of the Levy-stable
distribution from the nonextensive statistical framework.
