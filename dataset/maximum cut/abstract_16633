Spacetime Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are used to solve hyperbolic
PDEs describing wavelike physical phenomena. When the PDEs are nonlinear, the
speed of propagation of the phenomena, called the wavespeed, at any point in
the spacetime domain is computed as part of the solution. We give an advancing
front algorithm to construct a simplicial mesh of the spacetime domain suitable
for DG solutions. Given a simplicial mesh of a bounded linear or planar space
domain M, we incrementally construct a mesh of the spacetime domain M x
[0,infinity) such that the solution can be computed in constant time per
element. We add a patch of spacetime elements to the mesh at every step. The
boundary of every patch is causal which means that the elements in the patch
can be solved immediately and that the patches in the mesh are partially
ordered by dependence. The elements in a single patch are coupled because they
share implicit faces; however, the number of elements in each patch is bounded.
The main contribution of this paper is sufficient constraints on the progress
in time made by the algorithm at each step which guarantee that a new patch
with causal boundary can be added to the mesh at every step even when the
wavespeed is increasing discontinuously. Our algorithm adapts to the local
gradation of the space mesh as well as the wavespeed that most constrains
progress at each step. Previous algorithms have been restricted at each step by
the maximum wavespeed throughout the entire spacetime domain.
