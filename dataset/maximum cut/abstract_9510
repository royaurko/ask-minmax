In this paper, we investigate the solutions for a generalized fractional
diffusion equation that extends some known diffusion equations by taking a
spatial time-dependent diffusion coefficient and an external force into
account, which subjects to the natural boundaries and the generic initial
condition. We obtain explicit analytical expressions for the probability
distribution and study the relation between our solutions and those obtained
within the maximum entropy principle by using the Tsallis entropy.
