We present a consistent analysis of the signal as well as the irreducible
background for the search of the SM Higgs boson in the ZZ decay channel at the
LHC. Soft-gluons effects are resummed up to next-to-leading logarithmic
accuracy, and the results are compared to those obtained with fixed order
calculations and the MC@NLO event generator. The soft-gluon effects are
typically modest but should be taken into account when precise predictions are
demanded. Our results show that the signal over background ratio can be
significantly enhanced with a cut on the transverse momentum pt(ZZ) of the ZZ
pair. We also introduce a fully transverse angular variable that could give
information about the CP nature of the Higgs boson.
