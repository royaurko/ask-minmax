We have made a topological study of cosmic microwave background (CMB)
polarization maps by simulating the AMiBA experiment results. A $\Lambda$CDM
CMB sky is adopted to make mock interferometric observations designed for the
AMiBA experiment. CMB polarization fields are reconstructed from the AMiBA mock
visibility data using the maximum entropy method. We have also considered
effects of Galactic foregrounds on the CMB polarization fields. The genus
statistic is calculated from the simulated $Q$ and $U$ polarization maps, where
$Q$ and $U$ are Stokes parameters. Our study shows that the Galactic foreground
emission, even at low Galactic latitude, is expected to have small effects on
the CMB polarization field. Increasing survey area and integration time is
essential to detect non-Gaussian signals of cosmological origin through genus
measurement.
