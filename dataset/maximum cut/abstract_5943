Computed Tomography (CT) measures the attenuation coefficient of an object
and converts the value assigned to each voxel into a CT number. In radiation
therapy, CT number, which is directly proportional to the linear attenuation
coefficient, is required to be converted to electron density for radiation dose
calculation for cancer treatment. However, if various tube voltages were
applied to take the patient CT image without applying the specific CT number to
electron density conversion curve, the accuracy of dose calculation would be
unassured. In this study, changes in CT numbers for different materials due to
change in tube voltage were demonstrated and the dose calculation errors in
percentage depth dose (PDD) and a clinical case were analyzed. The maximum dose
difference in PDD from TPS dose calculation and Monte Carlo simulation were 1.3
% and 1.1 % respectively when applying the same CT number to electron density
conversion curve to the 80 kVp and 140 kVp images. In the clinical case, the
different CT number to electron density conversion curves from 80 kVp and 140
kVp were applied to the same image and the maximum differences in mean,
maximum, and minimum doses were 1.1 %, 1.2 %, 1.0 % respectively at the central
region of the phantom and 0.6 %, 0.9 %, 0.8 % respectively at the peripheral
region of the phantom.
