When unequal-mass black holes merge, the final black hole receives a ``kick''
due to the asymmetric loss of linear momentum in the gravitational radiation
emitted during the merger. The magnitude of this kick has important
astrophysical consequences. Recent breakthroughs in numerical relativity allow
us to perform the largest parameter study undertaken to date in numerical
simulations of binary black hole inspirals. We study non-spinning black-hole
binaries with mass ratios from $q=M_1/M_2=1$ to $q =0.25$ ($\eta = q/(1 + q)^2$
from 0.25 to 0.16). We accurately calculate the velocity of the kick to within
6%, and the final spin of the black holes to within 2%. A maximum kick of
$175.2\pm11$ km s$^{-1}$ is achieved for $\eta = 0.195 \pm 0.005$.
