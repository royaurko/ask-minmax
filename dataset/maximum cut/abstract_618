Following hep-th/0211098 we study the matrix model which describes the
topological A-model on T^{*}(S^{3}/\ZZ_p). We show that the resolvent has
square root branch cuts and it follows that this is a p cut single matrix
model. We solve for the resolvent and find the spectral curve. We comment on
how this is related to large N transitions and mirror symmetry.
