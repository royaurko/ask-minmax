The stochastic block model (SBM) with two communities, or equivalently the
planted bisection model, is a popular model of random graph exhibiting a
cluster behaviour. In the symmetric case, the graph has two equally sized
clusters and vertices connect with probability $p$ within clusters and $q$
across clusters. In the past two decades, a large body of literature in
statistics and computer science has focused on providing lower-bounds on the
scaling of $|p-q|$ to ensure exact recovery. In this paper, we identify a sharp
threshold phenomenon for exact recovery: if $\alpha=pn/\log(n)$ and
$\beta=qn/\log(n)$ are constant (with $\alpha>\beta$), recovering the
communities with high probability is possible if $\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2} -
\sqrt{\alpha \beta}>1$ and impossible if $\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2} - \sqrt{\alpha
\beta}<1$. In particular, this improves the existing bounds. This also sets a
new line of sight for efficient clustering algorithms. While maximum likelihood
(ML) achieves the optimal threshold (by definition), it is in the worst-case
NP-hard. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm based on a semidefinite
programming relaxation of ML, which is proved to succeed in recovering the
communities close to the threshold, while numerical experiments suggest it may
achieve the threshold. An efficient algorithm which succeeds all the way down
to the threshold is also obtained using a partial recovery algorithm combined
with a local improvement procedure.
