We study the homogeneous nucleation process in Stillinger-Weber silicon in
the NVT ensemble. A clear first-order transition from the liquid to crystal
phase is observed thermodynamically with kinetic and structural evidence of the
transformation. At 0.75 T_m, the critical cluster size is about 175 atoms. The
lifetime distribution of clusters as a function of the maximum size their reach
follows an inverse gaussian distribution as was predicted recently from the
classical theory of nucleation (CNT). However, while there is a qualitative
agreement with the CNT, the free energy curve obtained from the simulations
differs significantly from the theoretical predictions, suggesting that the
low-density liquid phase found recently could play a role in the nucleation
process.
