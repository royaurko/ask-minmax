We enumerate P-positions in the game of Nim in two different ways. In one
series of sequences we enumerate them by the maximum number of counters in a
pile. In another series of sequences we enumerate them by the total number of
counters.
  We show that the game of Nim can be viewed as a cellular automaton, where the
total number of counters divided by 2 can be considered as a generation in
which P-positions are born. We prove that the three-pile Nim sequence
enumerated by the total number of counters is a famous toothpick sequence based
on the Ulam-Warburton cellular automaton. We introduce 10 new sequences.
