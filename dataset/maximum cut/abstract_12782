In our previous work, we introduced a double-sided technique that utilizes
but not reject the host interference. Due to its nice property of utilizing but
not rejecting the host interference, it has a big advantage over the host
interference schemes in that the perceptual analysis can be easily implemented
for our scheme to achieve the locally bounded maximum embedding strength. Thus,
in this work, we detail how to implement the perceptual analysis in our
double-sided schemes since the perceptual analysis is very important for
improving the fidelity of watermarked contents. Through the extensive
performance comparisons, we can further validate the performance advantage of
our double-sided schemes.
