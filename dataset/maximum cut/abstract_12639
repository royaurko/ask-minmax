In this work we discuss two methods of calculation of quark propagation in
the quark-gluon plasma. Both methods make use of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.
The essential difference of these calculations is the treatment of
deconfinement. A model of confinement is not included in the work of Gastineau,
Blanquier and Aichelin [hep-ph/0404207], however, the meson states they
consider are still bound for temperatures greater than the deconfinement
temperature T_c. On the other hand, our model deals with unconfined quarks and
includes a description of the q(bar)q resonances found in lattice QCD studies
that make use of the maximum entropy method (MEM). We compare the q{bar)q cross
sections calculated in these models.
