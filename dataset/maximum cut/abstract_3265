The very fast, FeII-class Nova Ophiuchi 2010 N.1 rised rapidly to maximum
brightness (the last 2.2 mag in V band were covered in 3.4 days), maximum that
was reached on Jan. 18.3, 2010 at V=8.5, B-V=+0.95, V-Rc=+0.75, and V-Ic=+1.50.
The rapid and smooth decline was charaterized by t2(V)=10.0 and t3(V)=23.5
days. The reddening affecting the nova was E(B-V)=0.7 and its distance d=7.4
kpc, for an height above the galactic plane of z=0.6 kpc.
