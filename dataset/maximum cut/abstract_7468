The capacity regions are investigated for two relay broadcast channels
(RBCs), where relay links are incorporated into standard two-user broadcast
channels to support user cooperation. In the first channel, the Partially
Cooperative Relay Broadcast Channel, only one user in the system can act as a
relay and transmit to the other user through a relay link. An achievable rate
region is derived based on the relay using the decode-and-forward scheme. An
outer bound on the capacity region is derived and is shown to be tighter than
the cut-set bound. For the special case where the Partially Cooperative RBC is
degraded, the achievable rate region is shown to be tight and provides the
capacity region. Gaussian Partially Cooperative RBCs and Partially Cooperative
RBCs with feedback are further studied. In the second channel model being
studied in the paper, the Fully Cooperative Relay Broadcast Channel, both users
can act as relay nodes and transmit to each other through relay links. This is
a more general model than the Partially Cooperative RBC. All the results for
Partially Cooperative RBCs are correspondingly generalized to the Fully
Cooperative RBCs. It is further shown that the AWGN Fully Cooperative RBC has a
larger achievable rate region than the AWGN Partially Cooperative RBC. The
results illustrate that relaying and user cooperation are powerful techniques
in improving the capacity of broadcast channels.
