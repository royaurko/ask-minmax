Perturbative Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills theory within the first order formalism
is considered. Using a differential equation technique and dimensional
regularization, analytic results for both the ultraviolet divergent and finite
parts of the two-point functions at one-loop order are derived. It is shown how
the non-ultraviolet divergent parts of the results are finite at spacelike
momenta with kinematical singularities on the light-cone and subsequent branch
cuts extending into the timelike region.
