In long baseline interferometry, the raw fringe contrast must be calibrated
to obtain the true visibility and then those observables that can be
interpreted in terms of astrophysical parameters. The selection of suitable
calibration stars is crucial for obtaining the ultimate precision of
interferometric instruments like the VLTI. We have developed software SearchCal
that builds an evolutive catalog of stars suitable as calibrators within any
given user-defined angular distance and magnitude around the scientific target.
We present the first version of SearchCal dedicated to the bright-object case 
V<=10; K<=5). Star catalogs available at the CDS are consulted via web
requests. They provide all the useful information for selecting of calibrators.
Missing photometries are computed with an accuracy of 0.1 mag and the missing
angular diameters are calculated with a precision better than 10%. For each
star the squared visibility is computed by taking the wavelength and the
maximum baseline of the foreseen observation into account.} SearchCal is
integrated into ASPRO, the interferometric observing preparation software
developed by the JMMC, available at the address: http://mariotti.fr.
