Let X be a linearly ordered set of arbitrary size (finite or infinite).
Natural functions on such a set one can define using the linear order include
maximum, minimum and median functions. While it is clear what the clone
generated by the maximum or the minimum looks like, this is not obvious for
median functions. We show that every clone on X contains either no median
function or all median functions, that is, the median functions generate each
other.
