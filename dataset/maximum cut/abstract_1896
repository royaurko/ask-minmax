An edge-coloring of a graph $G$ with colors $1,...,t$ is called an interval
$t$-coloring if all colors are used, and the colors of edges incident to any
vertex of $G$ are distinct and form an interval of integers. In 1991 Erd\H{o}s
constructed a bipartite graph with 27 vertices and maximum degree 13 which has
no interval coloring. Erd\H{o}s's counterexample is the smallest (in a sense of
maximum degree) known bipartite graph which is not interval colorable. On the
other hand, in 1992 Hansen showed that all bipartite graphs with maximum degree
at most 3 have an interval coloring. In this paper we give some methods for
constructing of interval non-edge-colorable bipartite graphs. In particular, by
these methods, we construct three bipartite graphs which have no interval
coloring, contain 20,19,21 vertices and have maximum degree 11,12,13,
respectively. This partially answers a question that arose in [T.R. Jensen, B.
Toft, Graph coloring problems, Wiley Interscience Series in Discrete
Mathematics and Optimization, 1995, p. 204]. We also consider similar problems
for bipartite multigraphs.
