We point out that the non-critical version of the k-fractional superstring
theory can be described by k-cut critical points of the matrix models. In
particular, in comparison with the spectrum structure of fractional
super-Liouville theory, we show that (p,q) minimal fractional superstring
theories appear in the Z_k-symmetry breaking critical points of the k-cut
two-matrix models and the operator contents and string susceptibility coincide
on both sides. By using this correspondence, we also propose a set of primary
operators of the fractional superconformal ghost system which consistently
produces the correct gravitational scaling critical exponents of the on-shell
vertex operators.
