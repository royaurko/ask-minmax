The lowest order QED radiative corrections to the cross-section of the
recharged process of transition of two charged pions to two neutral ones and to
the pionium life time are calculated in frames of scalar QED. It is argued that
the ultraviolet cut--off of the loop momentum is to be chosen of order of
$\rho$ meson mass. This fact permits to perform the calculation in frames of
Effective Chiral Lagrangian theory with vector-meson dominance. The Coulomb
factor corresponding to interaction in the initial state, shown, is to be
removed to avoid the double counting. Resulting value of the radiative
correction to the pionium life time is -0.25%.
