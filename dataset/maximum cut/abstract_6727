The strong maximum principle ((SMP) in short) for subsolutions of the
radiative transfer type equations is shown in this paper. We treat a general
class of integro-differential equations, defined in the product space of the
space variable "x" and the velocity variable "v".
  The equations consist of two terms : a nonlocal integral operator in v
variable, and a first-order partial-differential operator in x variable. The
nonlocal term represents the jump process in v direction, and the term of the
first-order partial differential operator describes the drift in x direction.
In particular, the drift in x is generated by the velocity variable v. Based on
the idea of the propagation of maxima, we give a general sufficient condition
((A) in the paper) so that the (SMP) holds for the present class of nonlocal
equations. The framework of the viscosity solution is used to formulate the
problem, and the related existence and uniqueness of solutions are also given.
