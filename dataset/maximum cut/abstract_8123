We present the X-shooter Lens Survey (XLENS) data. The main goal of XLENS is
to disentangle the stellar and dark matter content of massive early-type
galaxies (ETGs), through combined strong gravitational lensing, dynamics and
spectroscopic stellar population studies. The sample consists of 11 lens
galaxies covering the redshift range from $0.1$ to $0.45$ and having stellar
velocity dispersions between $250$ and $380\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. All
galaxies have multi-band, high-quality HST imaging. We have obtained long-slit
spectra of the lens galaxies with X-shooter on the VLT. We are able to
disentangle the dark and luminous mass components by combining lensing and
extended kinematics data-sets, and we are also able to precisely constrain
stellar mass-to-light ratios and infer the value of the low-mass cut-off of the
IMF, by adding spectroscopic stellar population information. Our goal is to
correlate these IMF parameters with ETG masses and investigate the relation
between baryonic and non-baryonic matter during the mass assembly and structure
formation processes. In this paper we provide an overview of the survey,
highlighting its scientific motivations, main goals and techniques. We present
the current sample, briefly describing the data reduction and analysis process,
and we present the first results on spatially resolved kinematics.
