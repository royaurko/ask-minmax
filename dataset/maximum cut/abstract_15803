The third phase of the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) has recently been
completed, bringing the total number of sources imaged to over 15000 in the
CLASS and JVAS combined survey. In the VLA observations carried out in March
and April of 1998, two new candidate lensed systems were discovered: CLASS
B1152+199 and B1359+154. B1152+199 is a 1.6 arcsecond double, with a background
quasar at z=1.019 lensed by a foreground galaxy at z=0.439. The relatively flat
radio spectra of the lensed images, combined with a previous ROSAT detection of
the source, make B1152+199 a strong candidate for time delay studies at both
radio and X-ray wavelengths. B1359+154 is a quadruply lensed quasar at z=3.235,
with a maximum image separation of 1.7 arcseconds. As yet, the redshift of the
lensing object in this system is undetermined. The steep spectral index of the
source suggests that B1359+154 will not exhibit strong variability, and is
therefore unlikely to be useful for determining the Hubble constant from
measured time delays.
