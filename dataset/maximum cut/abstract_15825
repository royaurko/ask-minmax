The absolute K magnitudes and kinematic parameters of about 350 oxygen-rich
Long-Period Variable stars are calibrated, by means of an up-to-date
maximum-likelihood method, using Hipparcos parallaxes and proper motions
together with radial velocities and, as additional data, periods and V-K colour
indices. Four groups, differing by their kinematics and mean magnitudes, are
found. For each of them, we also obtain the distributions of magnitude, period
and de-reddened colour of the base population, as well as de-biased
period-luminosity-colour relations and their two-dimensional projections. The
SRa semiregulars do not seem to constitute a separate class of LPVs. The SRb
appear to belong to two populations of different ages. In a PL diagram, they
constitute two evolutionary sequences towards the Mira stage. The Miras of the
disk appear to pulsate on a lower-order mode. The slopes of their de-biased PL
and PC relations are found to be very different from the ones of the Oxygen
Miras of the LMC. This suggests that a significant number of so-called Miras of
the LMC are misclassified. This also suggests that the Miras of the LMC do not
constitute a homogeneous group, but include a significant proportion of
metal-deficient stars, suggesting a relatively smooth star formation history.
As a consequence, one may not trivially transpose the LMC period-luminosity
relation from one galaxy to the other.
