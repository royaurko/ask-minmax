Using the combined Greenwich (1874-1976) and Solar Optical Observatories
Network (1977-2009) data on sunspot groups, we study the long-term variations
in the mean daily rates of growth and decay of sunspot groups. We find that the
minimum and the maximum values of the annually averaged daily mean growth rates
are ~52% per day and ~183% per day, respectively, whereas the corresponding
values of the annually averaged daily mean decay rates are ~21% per day and
~44% per day, respectively. The average value (over the period 1874-2009) of
the growth rate is about 70% more than that of the decay rate. The growth and
the decay rates vary by about 35% and 13%, respectively, on a 60-year
time-scale. From the beginning of Cycle 23 the growth rate is substantially
decreased and near the end (2007-2008) the growth rate is lowest in the past
about 100 years.
