We construct interpolating functions fully compatible with S-duality. We then
consider the problem of resumming perturbative expansions for anomalous
dimensions of low twist non-protected operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.
When the rank of the gauge group is small, the interpolations suggest that
anomalous dimensions of leading twist operators take their maximum value at the
point $\tau =\exp(i\pi/3)$. For fixed spin and large enough rank, there is a
level-crossing region, where the anomalous dimension of the leading twist
operator reaches its maximum and then bounces back.
