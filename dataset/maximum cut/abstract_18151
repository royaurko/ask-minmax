The influence of electrical and thermal contact resistance on the efficiency
of a segmented thermoelectric generator is investigated. We consider 12
different segmented $p$-legs and 12 different segmented $n$-legs, using 8
different $p$-type and 8 different $n$-type thermoelectric materials. For all
systems a universal influence of both the electrical and thermal contact
resistance is observed on the leg's efficiency, when the systems are analyzed
in terms of the contribution of the contact resistance to the total resistance
of the leg. The results are compared with the analytical model of Min and Rowe
(1992). In order for the efficiency not to decrease more than 20%, the contact
electrical resistance should be less than 30% of the total leg resistance for
zero thermal contact resistance, while the thermal contact resistance should be
less than 20% for zero electrical contact resistance. The universal behavior
also allowed the maximum tolerable contact resistance for a segmented system to
be found, i.e. the resistance at which a leg of only the high temperature
thermoelectric material has the same efficiency as the segmented leg with a
contact resistance at the interface. If e.g. segmentation increases the
efficiency by 30% then an electrical contact resistance of 30% or a thermal
contact resistance of 20% can be tolerated.
