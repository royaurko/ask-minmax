Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and heuristic predictive estimation (HPE)
are two widely used approaches in industrial uncertainty analysis. We review
them from the point of view of decision theory, using Bayesian inference as a
gold standard for comparison. The main drawback of MLE is that it may fail to
properly account for the uncertainty on the physical process generating the
data, especially when only a small amount of data are available. HPE offers an
improvement in that it takes this uncertainty into account. However, we show
that this approach is actually equivalent to Bayes estimation for a particular
cost function that is not explicitly chosen by the decision maker. This may
produce results that are suboptimal from a decisional perspective. These
results plead for a systematic use of Bayes estimators based on carefully
defined cost functions.
