The structure of the singularity that is formed in a relativistically large
amplitude plasma wave close to the wavebreaking limit is found by using a
simple waterbag electron distribution function. The electron density
distribution in the breaking wave has a typical "peakon" form. The maximum
value of the electric field in a thermal breaking plasma is obtained and
compared to the cold plasma limit. The results of computer simulations for
different initial electron distribution functions are in agreement with the
theoretical conclusions.
