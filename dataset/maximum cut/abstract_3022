The microwave behavior of polymer metacomposites containing parallel Fe-based
and continuous/short-cut Co-based microwire arrays has been investigated. A
magnetic field-tunable metacomposite feature has been identified in the dense
continuous hybrid composite confirmed by the transmission windows in the
frequency band of 1 to 3.5 GHz. The complex magnetically tuned
redshift-blueshift evolution of the transmission window is reasoned to result
from the competition between the dynamic wire-wire interaction and the
ferromagnetic resonance of Fe-based wires. Increasing Co-based inter-wire
spacing to 10 mm in the continuous hybrid composites, a remarkable dual-band
transmission window in the 1.5-3.5 GHz and 9-17 GHz is respectively induced by
the ferromagnetic resonance of Fe-based wires and the magnetic resonance
arising between Fe-Co wire couples. The hybridization of parallel Fe-based and
short-cut Co-based wires in the polymer composite leads to a significant
enhancement of the transmission window in the frequency band of 1 to 6 GHz due
to the band-stop nature of Co-based wires. The advanced hybridized microwire
metacomposites are arguably demonstrated to be particularly attractive for
microwave cloaking and radio frequency barcoding applications.
