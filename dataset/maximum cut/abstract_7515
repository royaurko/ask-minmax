The ALEPH data on the vector and axial-vector spectral functions, extracted
from tau-lepton decays is used in order to test local and global duality, as
well as a set of four QCD chiral sum rules. These are the Das-Mathur-Okubo sum
rule, the first and second Weinberg sum rules, and a relation for the
electromagnetic pion mass difference. We find these sum rules to be poorly
saturated, even when the upper limit in the dispersion integrals is as high as
$3 GeV^{2}$. Since perturbative QCD, plus condensates, is expected to be valid
for $|q^{2}| \geq \cal{O}$$(1 GeV^{2})$ in the whole complex energy plane,
except in the vicinity of the right hand cut, we propose a modified set of sum
rules with weight factors that vanish at the end of the integration range on
the real axis. These sum rules are found to be precociously saturated by the
data to a remarkable extent. As a byproduct, we extract for the low energy
renormalization constant $\bar{L}_{10}$ the value $- 4 \bar{L}_{10}= 2.43
\times 10^{-2}$, to be compared with the standard value $- 4 \bar{L}_{10} =
(2.73 \pm 0.12) \times 10^{-2}$. This in turn implies a pion polarizability
$\alpha_{E} = 3.7 \times 10^{-4} fm^{3}$.
