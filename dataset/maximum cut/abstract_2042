We develop a simple systematic method, valid for all strengths of disorder,
to obtain analytically for the first time the full distribution of conductance
P(g) for a quasi one dimensional wire in the absence of electron-electron
interaction. We show that in the crossover region between the metallic and
insulating regimes, P(g) is highly asymmetric, given by an essentially `one
sided' log-normal distribution. For larger disorder, the tail of the log-normal
distribution for g > 1 is cut off by a Gaussian.
