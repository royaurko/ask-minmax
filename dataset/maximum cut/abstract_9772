Current research proposes a natural environment for the space-time codes and
in this context it is obtained a new design criterion for space-time codes in
multi-antenna communication channels. The objective of this criterion is to
minimize the pairwise error probability of the maximum likelihood decoder,
endowed with the matrix spectrum norm. The random matrix theory is used and an
approximation function for the probability density function is obtained for the
largest eigenvalue of a Wishart Matrix.
