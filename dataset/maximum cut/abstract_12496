We consider a modulated process S which, conditional on a background process
X, has independent increments. Assuming that S drifts to -infinity and that its
increments (jumps) are heavy-tailed (in a sense made precise in the paper), we
exhibit natural conditions under which the asymptotics of the tail distribution
of the overall maximum of S can be computed. We present results in discrete and
in continuous time. In particular, in the absence of modulation, the process S
in continuous time reduces to a Levy process with heavy-tailed Levy measure. A
central point of the paper is that we make full use of the so-called
``principle of a single big jump'' in order to obtain both upper and lower
bounds. Thus, the proofs are entirely probabilistic. The paper is motivated by
queueing and Levy stochastic networks.
