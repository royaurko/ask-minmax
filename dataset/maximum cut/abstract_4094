We study the magnetic susceptibility of one-dimensional S=1/2
antiferromagnets containing non-magnetic impurities which cut the chain into
finite segments. For the susceptibility of long anisotropic Heisenberg
chain-segments with open boundaries we derive a parameter-free result at low
temperatures using field theory methods and the Bethe Ansatz. The analytical
result is verified by comparing with Quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations. We then
show that the partitioning of the chain into finite segments can explain the
Curie-like contribution observed in recent experiments on
Sr_2Cu_{1-x}Pd_xO_{3+\delta}. Possible additional paramagnetic impurities seem
to play only a minor role.
