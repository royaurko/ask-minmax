An overview of the theory of the upper critical field in dirty two-gap
superconductors, with a particular emphasis on MgB$_2$ is given. We focus here
on the maximum $H_{c2}$ which may be achieved by increasing intraband
scattering, and on the limitations imposed by weak interband scattering and
paramagnetic effects. In particular, we discuss recent experiments which have
recently demonstrated ten-fold increase of $H_{c2}$ in dirty carbon-doped films
as compared to single crystals, so that the $H_{c2}(0)$ parallel to the ab
planes may approach the BCS paramagnetic limit, $H_p[T] = 1.84T_c[K] \simeq
60-70T$. New effects produced by weak interband scattering in the two-gap
Ginzburg-Landau equations and $H_{c2}(T)$ in ultrathin MgB$_2$ films are
addressed.
