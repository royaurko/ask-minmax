Operational risk models commonly employ maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
to fit loss data to heavy-tailed distributions. Yet several desirable
properties of MLE (e.g. asymptotic normality) are generally valid only for
large sample-sizes, a situation rarely encountered in operational risk. We
study MLE in operational risk models for small sample-sizes across a range of
loss severity distributions. We apply these results to assess (1) the
approximation of parameter confidence intervals by asymptotic normality, and
(2) value-at-risk (VaR) stability as a function of sample-size. Finally, we
discuss implications for operational risk modeling.
