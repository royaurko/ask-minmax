Using molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the structure of a system
of particles interacting through a continuous core-softened interparticle
potential. We found for the translational order parameter, t, a local maximum
at a density $\rho_{t-max}$ and a local minimum at $\rho_{t-min} >
\rho_{t-max}$. Between $\rho_{t-max}$ and $\rho_{t-min}$, the $t$ parameter
anomalously decreases upon pressure. For the orientational order parameter,
$Q_6$, was observed a maximum at a density $\rho_{t-max}< \rho_{Qmax} <
\rho_{t-min}$. For densities between $\rho_{Qmax}$ and $\rho_{t-min}$, both the
translational (t) and orientational ($Q_6$) order parameters have anomalous
behavior. We know that this system also exhibits density and diffusion anomaly.
We found that the region in the pressure-temperature phase-diagram of the
structural anomaly englobes the region of the diffusion anomaly that is larger
than the region limited by the temperature of maximum density. This cascade of
anomalies (structural, dynamic and thermodynamic) for our model has the same
hierarchy of that one observed for the SPC/E water.
