The $\Sigma(1385)$ resonance, or $\Sigma^*$, is well-known as part of the
standard baryon decuplet with spin $J=3/2$. Measurements of the reaction
$\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^{*0}$ are difficult to extract due to overlap with the
nearby $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance. However, the reaction $\gamma n \to K^+
\Sigma^{*-}$ has no overlap with the $\Lambda(1405)$ due to its charge. Here we
report the first measurement of cross sections and beam asymmetries for
photoproduction of the \sigs from a deuteron target. % where the $K^+$ and
$\pi^-$ are detected in the LEPS spectrometer. The cross sections at forward
angles range from 0.4 to 1.2 $\mu$b, with a broad maximum near $E_\gamma \simeq
1.8$ GeV. The beam asymmetries are negative, in contrast to postive values for
the $\gamma n \to K^+\Sigma^-$ reaction.
