Fermi Gamma ray Space Telescope measurements of spectra, variability time
scale, and maximum photon energy give lower limits to the apparent jet powers
and, through gammagamma opacity arguments, the bulk Lorentz factors of
relativistic jets. The maximum cosmic-ray particle energy is limited by these
two quantities in Fermi acceleration scenarios. Recent data are used to
constrain the maximum energies of cosmic-ray protons and Fe nuclei accelerated
in colliding shells of GRBs and blazars. The Fermi results indicate that Fe
rather than protons are more likely to be accelerated to ultra-high energies in
AGNs, whereas powerful GRBs can accelerate both protons and Fe to >~ 10^{20}
eV. Emissivity of nonthermal radiation from radio galaxies and blazars is
estimated from the First Fermi AGN Catalog, and shown to favor BL Lac objects
and FR1 radio galaxies over flat spectrum radio quasars, FR2 radio galaxies,
and long-duration GRBs as the sources of UHECRs.
