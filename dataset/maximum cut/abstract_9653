We show how some attractive information--theoretic properties of Gaussians
pass over to more general families of stable densities. We define a new score
function for symmetric stable laws, and use it to give a stable version of the
heat equation. Using this, we derive a version of the de Bruijn identity,
allowing us to write the derivative of relative entropy as an inner product of
score functions. We discuss maximum entropy properties of symmetric stable
densities.
