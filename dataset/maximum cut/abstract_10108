A lightning surge generator generates a high voltage surge with 1.2 microsec.
rise time. The generator fed a spark gap of two pointed electrodes at 0.7 to
1.2 m distances. Gap breakdown occurred between 0.1 and 3 microsec. after the
maximum generator voltage of approximately 850 kV. Various scintillator
detectors with different response time recorded bursts of hard radiation in
nearly all surges. The bursts were detected over the time span between
approximately half of the maximum surge voltage and full gap breakdown. The
consistent timing of the bursts with the high-voltage surge excluded background
radiation as source for the high intensity pulses. In spite of the symmetry of
the gap, negative surges produced more intense radiation than positive. This
has been attributed to additional positive discharges from the measurement
cabinet which occurred for negative surges. Some hard radiation signals were
equivalent to several MeV. Pile-up occurs of lesser energy X-ray quanta, but
still with a large fraction of these with an energy of the order of 100 keV.
The bursts occurred within the 4 nanosec. time resolution of the fastest
detector. The relation between the energy of the X-ray quanta and the signal
from the scintillation detector is quite complicated, as shown by the
measurements.
