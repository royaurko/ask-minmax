In a previous paper we investigated means for constraining the mass
distribution of cluster galaxies by weak lensing. We concluded that a
comprehensive method should treat the lensing effects of individual cluster
galaxies and those resulting from a general cluster component simultaneously.
To this end we now develop a non-parametric maximum likelihood cluster
reconstruction algorithm that can implicitly take into account the presence of
cluster galaxies. The method includes an entropy-like regularization
prescription and directly uses the ellipticities of individual source galaxy
images as observables rather than relying on an averaged ellipticity field. The
mass distribution of cluster galaxies is described by parametrized models. For
each set of galaxy parameters the cluster reconstruction algorithm allows to
determine the best representation of the global underlying cluster component
that is consistent with the presence of the cluster galaxies and the observed
image ellipticities of background galaxies. Tests with simulations yielded
convincing and robust results.
  We applied the method to a WFPC2 image of the cluster Cl0939+4713 and
obtained a detection of the lensing effects of luminous elliptical cluster
galaxies. We consider this application as a successful test of our technique.
However, the small size of the image we analysed does not yet allow to draw
strong conclusions regarding the mass distribution of cluster galaxies.
