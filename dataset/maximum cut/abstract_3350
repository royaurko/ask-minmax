We show that the secrecy function conjecture that states that the maximum of
the secrecy function of an $l$-modular lattice occurs at $1/\sqrt{l}$ is false,
by proving that the 4-modular lattice $C^(4) = \mathbb{Z} \oplus
\sqrt{2}\mathbb{Z} \oplus 2\mathbb{Z}$ fails to satisfy this conjecture. We
also indicate how the secrecy function must be modified in the $l$-modular case
to have a more reasonable chance for it to have a maximum at $1/\sqrt{l}$, and
show that the conjecture, modified with this new secrecy function, is true for
various odd 2-modular lattices.
