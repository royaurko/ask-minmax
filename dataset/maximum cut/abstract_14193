We theoretically investigate the indirect optical injection of carriers and
spins in bulk silicon, using an empirical pseudopotential description of
electron states and an adiabatic bond charge model for phonon states. We
identify the selection rules, the contribution to the carrier and spin
injection in each conduction band valley from each phonon branch and each
valence band, and the temperature dependence of these processes. The transition
from the heavy hole band to the lowest conduction band dominates the injection
due to the large joint density of states. For incident light propagating along
the $[00\bar{1}]$ direction, the injection rates and the degree of spin
polarization of injected electrons show strong valley anisotropy. The maximum
degree of spin polarization is at the injection edge with values 25% at low
temperature and 15% at high temperature.
