Considering an expanding locally anisotropic (ELA) metric with the Sun as
central mass and the heuristic ansatz for the dimensionless functional exponent
parameter 'alpha=3+alpha_2(r_1)(1-U_Sun)^2' with a linear ansatz
'alpha_2(r_1)=alpha_2^(2.0)+alpha_2^(2.1) r_1' above 20 AU the pioneer anomaly
is fully accounted for as due to the blue-shift of the background space-time.
For compatibility with orbital motion within the Solar system it is further
considered a branch ansatz for which \alpha_2(r_1)=0 below 20 AU. This
construction reduces the physical acceleration correction above 20 AU down to
~10^(-14) m/s^2 outwards from the Sun such that orbital corrections to Neptune
and Pluto are less notorious than when the full Pioneer acceleration is
considered to be a gravitational acceleration. It is also discussed the
effective mass-energy density distribution above 20 AU due to the background
corrections, the respective equation of state ('-1 < w < -0.726') and the
finite non-null total mass is computed by considering an upper cut-off for the
functional parameter 'alpha'. Such effective extended configuration is
tentatively interpreted as a cold dark matter distribution.
