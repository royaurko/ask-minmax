In this paper non-asymptotic exponential estimates are derived for tail of
maximum martingale distribution by naturally norming in the spirit of the
classical Law of Iterated Logarithm.
  Key words: Martingales, exponential estimations, moment, Banach spaces of
random variables, tail of distribution, conditional expectation.
