The results of characterization of TiAlSiON hard coatings deposited on
ferric-chromium AISI 430 stainless steel by plasma enhanced magnetron
sputtering are presented. The coating with maximum hardness (of 45 GPa) was
obtained at the following optimal values of elemental concentrations: Si ~5
at.%, Al ~15 at.%, and Ti ~27 at.%. The elastic modulus of the coating was 590
GPa. The reading of gaseous mixture (Ar-N2) pressure was 1*10-3 Torr and the
reading of partial pressure of oxygen (O2) was 1*10-5 Torr. The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) measurements showed the presence of Ti(Al)N. High-energy
resolved XPS spectra of core levels revealed the formation of Ti-N, Ti-O-N,
Si-N and Al-O-N bonds. Comparison of XPS valence band spectra with specially
performed density functional theory calculations for two ordered and few
disordered TiN1-xOx (0 =< x <= 1) demonstrates that a Ti(Al)OxNy phase is
formed on the surface of AISI430 steel upon the plasma enhanced magnetron
sputtering, which provides this material with a good combination of high
hardness and improved oxidation resistance.
