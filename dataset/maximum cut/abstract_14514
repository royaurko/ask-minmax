Linear gyro-kinetic stability calculations predict unstable toroidal Ion
Temperature Gradient modes with normalised poloidal wave vectors well above one
($k_\theta \rho_i > 1$) for standard parameters and with adiabatic electrons.
These modes have a maximum amplitude at a poloidal angle $\theta$ that is
shifted away from the low field side ($\theta \ne 0$). The physical mechanism
is clarified through the use of a fluid model. It is shown that the shift of
the mode away from the low field side ($\theta \ne 0$) reduces the effective
drift frequency, and allows for the instability to develop. Numerical tests
using the gyro-kinetic model confirm this physical mechanism. It is furthermore
shown that modes with $\theta \ne 0$ can be important also for $k_\theta \rho_i
< 1$ close to the threshold of the ITG. In fact, modes with $\theta \ne 0$ can
exist for normalised temperature gradient lengths below the threshold of the
ITG obtained for $\theta = 0$.
