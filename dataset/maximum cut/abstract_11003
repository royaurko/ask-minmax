We present kinematical profiles and metallicity for the M31 dwarf spheroidal
(dSph) satellite galaxy Andromeda II (And II) based on Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy
of 531 red giant branch stars. Our kinematical sample is among the largest for
any M31 satellite and extends out to two effective radii (r_eff = 5.3' = 1.1
kpc). We find a mean systemic velocity of -192.4+-0.5 km/s and an average
velocity dispersion of sigma_v = 7.8+-1.1 km/s. While the rotation velocity
along the major axis of And II is nearly zero (<1 km/s), the rotation along the
minor axis is significant with a maximum rotational velocity of v_max=8.6+-1.8
km/s. We find a kinematical major axis, with a maximum rotational velocity of
v_max=10.9+-2.4 km/s, misaligned by 67 degrees to the isophotal major axis. And
II is thus the first dwarf galaxy with evidence for nearly prolate rotation
with a v_max/sigma_v = 1.1, although given its ellipticity of epsilon = 0.10,
this object may be triaxial. We measured metallicities for a subsample of our
data, finding a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.39+- 0.03 dex and an internal
metallicity dispersion of 0.72+-0.03 dex. We find a radial metallicity gradient
with metal-rich stars more centrally concentrated, but do not observe a
significant difference in the dynamics of two metallicity populations. And II
is the only known dwarf galaxy to show minor axis rotation making it a unique
system whose existence offers important clues on the processes responsible for
the formation of dSphs.
