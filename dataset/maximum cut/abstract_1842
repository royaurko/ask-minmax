We have performed detailed NLTE spectral synthesis modeling of 2 types of 1-D
hydro models: the very highly parameterized deflagration model W7, and two
delayed detonation models. We find that overall both models do about equally
well at fitting well observed SNe Ia near to maximum light. However, the Si II
6150 feature of W7 is systematically too fast, whereas for the delayed
detonation models it is also somewhat too fast, but significantly better than
that of W7. We find that a parameterized mixed model does the best job of
reproducing the Si II 6150 line near maximum light and we study the differences
in the models that lead to better fits to normal SNe Ia. We discuss what is
required of a hydro model to fit the spectra of observed SNe Ia near maximum
light.
