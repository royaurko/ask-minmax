In 1994 February-August we observed with the VLA four ejection events of
radio emitting clouds from the high energy source GRS 1915+105. These events
are all consistent with anti-parallel ejections of twin pairs of clouds moving
away from the compact source at $\sim$ 0.92 of the speed of light and angles of
$\sim$ 70$^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight. The flux ratios and time
evolution of the expelled clouds are consistent with actual motions of the
radiating matter rather than with the simple propagation of pulses in a medium
moving at slower velocities. The large kinetic power of the sudden, short, and
rather discontinuous ejections exceeds by more than an order of magnitude the
maximum steady photon luminosity of the source, suggesting that in GRS 1915+105
a radiation acceleration mechanism of the ejecta is unlikely. As in other
galactic and extragalactic radio sources, the decrease in flux density as a
function of angular separation from the central source shows a steepening with
distance. Additional ejection events have been observed in 1995 and 1997 and we
compare them with the 1994 events.
