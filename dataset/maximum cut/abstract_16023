We present first results from our project to examine the internal kinematics
of disk galaxies in 7 rich clusters with 0.3<=z<0.6. Spatially resolved MOS
spectra have been obtained with FORS at the VLT. We concentrate here on the
clusters MS1008.1-1224 at z=0.30 and Cl0413-6559 (F1557.19TC) at z=0.51. Out of
22 cluster members, 12 galaxies exhibit a rotation curve of the universal form
rising in the inner region and passing over into a flat part. The other members
have intrinsically peculiar kinematics. The 12 cluster galaxies for which a
maximum rotation velocity could be derived are distributed in the Tully-Fisher
diagram very similar to field galaxies from the FORS Deep Field with
corresponding redshifts. The same is true for 6 galaxies observed in the
cluster fields that turned out not to be members. In particular, these cluster
spirals do not show any significant luminosity evolution as might be expected
from certain clusterspecific phenomena. Contrary to that, the other half of the
cluster sample with disturbed kinematics also shows a higher degree of
structural assymetries on average indicating ongoing or recent interaction
processes.
