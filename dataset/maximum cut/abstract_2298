Using the heat kernel regularization we show that the Abelian chiral anomaly
in the limit of infinite temperature it is not a well defined quantity,
contrary to what happens at any finite temperature. We show that there is an
ambiguity in the ordering of the limits of infinite temperature and removal of
the cut-off so that changing this ordering we find different results for the
chiral anomaly. We discuss these cases and their possible interpretation.
