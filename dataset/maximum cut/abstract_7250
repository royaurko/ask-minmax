We propose a novel reflection color model consisting of body essence and
(mixed) neuter, and present an effective method for separating dichromatic
reflection components using a single image. Body essence is an entity invariant
to interface reflection, and has two degrees of freedom unlike hue and maximum
chromaticity. As a result, the proposed method is insensitive to noise and
proper for colors around CMY (cyan, magenta, and yellow) as well as RGB (red,
green, and blue), contrary to the maximum chromaticity-based methods. Interface
reflection is separated by using a Gaussian function, which removes a critical
thresholding problem. Furthermore, the method does not require any region
segmentation. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed model and
method.
