Raman scattering on bulk AsxS1-x glasses showes that vibrational modes of
As4S4 monomer first appear near x=0.38, and their concentration increases
precipitously with increasing x, suggesting that the stoichiometric glass
(x=0.40) is intrinsically phase seperated into small As-rich(As4S4) and large
S-righ clusters. Support for the Raman-active vibrational modes of the
orpiment-like and realgar-like nanophases is provided by ab-initio density
functional theory calculations on appropriate clusters. Nanoscale phase
seperation provides a basis for understanding the global maximum in the glass
transition temperature Tg near x=0.40, and the departure from Arrhenius
temperature activation of As2S3 melt viscosities.
