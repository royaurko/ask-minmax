In the search for extra dimension through dilepton events in 7-TeV
proton-proton collision, the ATLAS detector at LHC has set stringent lower
bound on the mass of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) lightest graviton Kaluza-Klein
(KK) mode. Considering that the Randall-Sundrum model undertakes to resolve the
well-known gauge hierarchy/fine tuning problem to restrict the Higgs mass
within the estimated $\sim 126$ GeV against large radiative correction upto the
cut-off of the model, we explore the allowed parameter space within which the
RS model can be trusted. We show that the consistency of the model with ATLAS
results constrains the cut-off of the theory which is atleast two order lower
than the Planck/Quantum gravity scale implying the possible existence of a new
Physics at this lower scale.
