In this paper, we study the concept of edge-group choosability of graphs. We
say that G is edge k-group choosable if its line graph is k-group choosable. An
edge-group choosability version of Vizing conjecture is given. The evidence of
our claim are graphs with maximum degree less than 4, planar graphs with
maximum degree at least 11, planar graphs without small cycles, outerplanar
graphs and near-outerplanar graphs.
