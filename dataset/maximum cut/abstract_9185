The maximum amplitude (Rm) of a solar cycle, in the term of mean sunspot
numbers, is well-known to be positively correlated with the preceding minimum
(Rmin). So far as the long term trend is concerned, a low level of Rmin tends
to be followed by a weak Rm, and vice versa. In this paper, we found that the
evidence is insufficient to infer a very weak Cycle 24 from the very low Rmin
in the preceding cycle. This is concluded by analyzing the correlation in the
temporal variations of parameters for two successive cycles.
