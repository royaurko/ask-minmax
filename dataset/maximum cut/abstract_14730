The energetics and efficiency of a linear molecular motor model proposed by
Mogilner et al. (Phys. Lett. 237, 297 (1998)) is analyzed from an analytical
point of view. The model which is based on protein friction with a track is
described by coupled Langevin equations for the motion in combination with
coupled master equations for the ATP hydrolysis. Here the energetics and
efficiency of the motor is addressed using a many body scheme with focus on the
efficiency at maximum power (EMP). It is found that the EMP is reduced from
about 10 pct in a heuristic description of the motor to about 1 per mille when
incorporating the full motor dynamics, owing to the strong dissipation
associated with the motor action.
