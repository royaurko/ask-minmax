In this study, we present the unpublished flare data collected from 222
flares detected in the B band observations of five stars and the results
derived by statistical analysis and modeling of these data. Six basic
properties have been found with a statistical analysis method applied to all
models and analyses for the flares detected in the B band observation of UV
Ceti type stars. We have also compared the U and B bands with the analysis
results. This comparison allowed us to evaluate the methods used in the
analyses. The analyses provided the following results. (1) The flares were
separated into two types, fast and slow flares. (2) The mean values of the
equivalent durations of the slow and the fast flares differ by a factor of 16.2
\pm 3.7. (3) Regardless of the total flare duration, the maximum flare energy
can reach a different Plateau level for each star. (4) The Plateau values of EV
Lac and EQ Peg are higher than the others. (5) The minimum values of the total
flare duration increase toward the later spectral types. This value is called
the Half-Life value in models. (6) Both the maximum flare rise times and the
total flare duration obtained from the observed flares decrease toward the
later spectral types.
