Three case studies are presented of slepton pair production followed by
two-body or quasi-two-body decays at a muon collider. Precision mass
measurements are possible using a variety of kinematic fitting methods.
Standard Model and supersymmetric backgrounds are easily controlled by
kinematic cuts. In all three cases it appears that detector resolutions, not
backgrounds or statistics, will dominate the final error bars. Polarized beams
are not necessary to control SM backgrounds. However, without polarization it
may be difficult in some cases to disentangle slepton_right from slepton_left
signals.
