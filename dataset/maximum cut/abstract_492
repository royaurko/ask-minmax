The largest fluctuation in the observed CMB temperature field is the dipole,
its origin being usually attributed to the Doppler Effect - the Earth's
velocity with respect to the CMB rest frame. The lowest order boost correction
to temperature multipolar coefficients appears only as a second order
correction in the temperature power spectrum, $C_{\ell}$. Since v/c - 10-3,
this effect can be safely ignored when estimating cosmological parameters
[4-7]. However, by cutting our galaxy from the CMB sky we induce large-angle
anisotropies in the data. In this case, the corrections to the cut-sky
$C_{\ell}$s show up already at first order in the boost parameter. In this
paper we investigate this issue and argue that this effect might turn out to be
important when reconstructing the power spectrum from the cut-sky data.
