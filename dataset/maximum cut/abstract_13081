We present a comparison between space charge calculations and direct
measurements of the transverse phase space for space charge dominated electron
bunches after a high voltage photoemission DC gun followed by an emittance
compensation solenoid magnet. The measurements were performed using a
double-slit setup for a set of parameters such as charge per bunch and the
solenoid current. The data is compared with detailed simulations using 3D space
charge codes GPT and Parmela3D with initial particle distributions created from
the measured transverse and temporal laser profiles. Beam brightness as a
function of beam fraction is calculated for the measured phase space maps and
found to approach the theoretical maximum set by the thermal energy and
accelerating field at the photocathode.
