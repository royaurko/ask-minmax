Maximum nonlinear functions on finite fields are widely used in cryptography
because the coordinate functions have large distance to linear functions. More
precisely, the Hamming distance to the characteristic functions of hyperplanes
is large. One class of maximum nonlinear functions are the Gold power functions
We characterize these functions in terms of the distance of their coordinate
functions to characteristic functions of subspaces of codimension 2.
