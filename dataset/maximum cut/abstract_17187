We report on the characterization of high carbon bearing steel 100Cr6 using
electron microscopy and atom probe tomography in combination with
multi-component diffusion simulations (DICTRA). Scanning electron micrographs
show that around 14 vol.% spheroidized carbides are formed during soft
annealing and only 3 vol.% remain after dissolution into the austenitic matrix
by austenitization at 1123 K (850 {\deg}C) for 300 s. The spheroidized
particles are identified as (Fe, Cr)3C by transmission electron microscopy.
Atom probe analyses reveal the redistribution and partitioning behaviors of
elements, i.e. C, Si, Mn, Cr, Fe in both, the spheroidized carbides and the
bainitic matrix in the sample isothermally heat-treated at 773 K (500 {\deg}C)
after austenitization. A homogeneous distribution of C and gradual gradient of
Cr was detected within the spheroidized carbides. Due to its limited
diffusivity in (Fe, Cr)3C, Cr exhibits a maximum concentration at the surface
of spheroidized carbides (16 at.%) and decreases gradually from surface towards
the core down to a level of about 2 at.%. The atom probe results also indicate
that the partially dissolved spheroidized carbides during austenitization may
serve as nucleation sites for intermediate temperature cementite within
bainite, which results in a relatively softer surface and harder core in
spheroidized particles. This microstructure may contribute to the good wear
resistance and fatigue properties
