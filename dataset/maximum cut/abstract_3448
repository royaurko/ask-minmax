In the previous paper (Part~1), we have verified that the SK assumption on
the direction does not hold in the analysis of neutrino events occurred inside
the SK detector. We have made four possible L/E analyses, L_nu/E_nu, L_nu/E_mu,
L_mu/E_nu and L_mu/E_mu. Among four kinds of L/E analyses, we have shown that
only L_nu/E_nu analysis can give the signature of maximum oscillations clearly,
while the L_mu/E_mu analysis which are really done by Super-Kamiokande
Collaboration cannot give the maximum oscillation at all. It is thus concluded
that Super-Kamiokande type experiment cannot find the maximum oscillation from
L/E analysis. Therefore, we would suggest Super-Kamiokande Collaboration to
re-analyze the zenith angle distribution of the neutrino events which occur
inside the detector carefully.
