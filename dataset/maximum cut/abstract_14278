Recent results from the Pierre Auger Observatory are presented, focusing on a
measurement of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum above 10^18 eV, cosmic-ray
composition, and the anisotropy in the cosmic ray arrival directions.
  The flux of cosmic rays can be well described by a broken power-law, with a
flattening of the spectrum above 4x10^18 eV and a softening of the spectrum
beginning at about 3x10^19 eV. The flux suppression at highest energies is
consistent with the predictions of Greisen, and Zatsepin and Kuzmin.
Longitudinal development of cosmic-ray air showers provides information on the
mass of the primary particle. When compared to model predictions, our
measurements of the mean and spread of the longitudinal position of the shower
maximum are indicating a composition transition from light to heavier with
increasing energy. For highest energies in our data-set we observe evidence for
a correlation between the cosmic-ray arrival directions and the nearby
extragalactic objects.
