We use numerical simulations and an athermal quasi-static shear protocol to
investigate the yielding of a model colloidal gel. Under increasing
deformation, the elastic regime is followed by a significant stiffening before
yielding takes place. A space-resolved analysis of deformations and stresses
unravel how the complex load curve observed is the result of stress
localization and that the yielding can take place by breaking a very small
fraction of the network connections. The stiffening corresponds to the
stretching of the network chains, unbent and aligned along the direction of
maximum extension. It is characterized by a strong localization of tensile
stresses, that triggers the breaking of a few network nodes at around 30% of
strain. Increasing deformation favors further breaking but also shear-induced
bonding, eventually leading to a large-scale reorganization of the gel
structure at the yielding. At low enough shear rates, density and velocity
profiles display significant spatial inhomogeneity during yielding in agreement
with experimental observations.
