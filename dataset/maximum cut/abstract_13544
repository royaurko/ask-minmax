Using our new 3-D relativistic electromagnetic particle (REMP) code
parallelized with MPI, we have investigated long-term particle acceleration
associated with an relativistic electron-positron jet propagating in an
unmagnetized ambient electron-positron plasma. The simulations have been
performed using a much longer simulation system than our previous simulations
in order to investigate the full nonlinear stage of the Weibel instability and
its particle acceleration mechanism. Cold jet electrons are thermalized and
ambient electrons are accelerated in the resulting shocks. The acceleration of
ambient electrons leads to a maximum ambient electron density three times
larger than the original value. Behind the bow shock in the jet shock strong
electromagnetic fields are generated. These fields may lead to the afterglow
emission. We have calculated the time evolution of the spectrum from two
electrons propagating in a uniform parallel magnetic field to verify the
technique.
