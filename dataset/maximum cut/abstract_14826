Let $\,(M,g)\,$ be a $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold and $\,\Omega\,$ be
any compact connected domain in $\,M$. We study the problem of finding the {\em
maxima} of the functional $\, {\mathcal E} (\Omega)\,$ (known as {\em torsional
rigidity} associated to $\Omega$) among all domains of prescribed volume $v$.
Our results show that for a given Riemannian manifold which is strictly
isoperimetric at one of its points the maximum of such functional is realized
by the geodesic ball centered at this point. More generally, we prove estimates
for the functional $\, {\mathcal E} (\Omega)\,$ by comparison with symmetrized
domains. We also investigate on finding sharp upper bounds for the functional
$\, {\mathcal E} (\Omega)\,$, under certain conditions on the geometry of
$\,(M,g)\,$ and of $\Omega$. Finally we find an universal upper bound for $\,
{\mathcal E} (\Omega)\,$ in terms of the isoperimetric Cheeger constant.
