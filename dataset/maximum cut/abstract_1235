The hard X-ray source IGRJ11215-5952 has been discovered with INTEGRAL during
a short outburst in 2005 and proposed as a new member of the class of
supergiant fast X-ray transients. We analysed INTEGRAL public observations of
the source field in order to search for previous outbursts from this transient,
not reported in literature.Our results are based on a systematic re-analysis of
INTEGRAL archival observations, using the latest analysis software and
instrument calibrations. We report the discovery of two previously unnoticed
outbursts, spaced by intervals of ~330 days, that occurred in July 2003 and May
2004. The 5-100keV spectrum is well described by a cut-off power law, with a
photon index of 0.5, and a cut-off energy ~15-20keV, typical of High Mass X-ray
Binaries hosting a neutron star. A 5-100keV luminosity of 3E36 erg/s has been
derived (assuming 6.2kpc, the distance of the likely optical counterpart). The
5-100keV spectral properties, the recurrent nature of the outbursts,together
with the reduced error region containing the blue supergiant star
HD306414,support the hypothesis that IGRJ11215-5952 is a member of the class of
the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients.
