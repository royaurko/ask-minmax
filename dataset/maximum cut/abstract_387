The determination of a dynamic law of cut is complex and often very difficult
to develop. Several formulations were developed, in very complex ways being
given that 3 AD crosses from there, the number of variables is much higher than
out of orthogonal cut. The existence of the plan of displacements and the
correlations with the elastic characteristics of the machining system thus make
it possible to simplify the dynamic model 3D. A dynamic model on the basis of
experimental approach is proposed. Simulation is in concord with the
experimental results.
