Based on the theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, the inherent randomness
and stochasticity of biochemical reaction networks can be accurately described
by discrete-state continuous-time Markov chains. The analysis of such processes
is, however, computationally expensive and sophisticated numerical methods are
required. Here, we propose an analysis framework in which we integrate a number
of moments of the process instead of the state probabilities. This results in a
very efficient simulation of the time evolution of the process. In order to
regain the state probabilities from the moment representation, we combine the
fast moment-based simulation with a maximum entropy approach for the
reconstruction of the underlying probability distribution. We investigate the
usefulness of this combined approach in the setting of stochastic chemical
kinetics and present numerical results for three reaction networks showing its
efficiency and accuracy. Besides a simple dimerization system, we study a
bistable switch system and a multi-attractor network with complex dynamics.
