Previous studies have found that calculations which consider long-range
magnetic dipolar interactions truncated at a finite cut-off distance Rc predict
spurious (unphysical) long-range ordered phases for Ising and Heisenberg
systems on the pyrochlore lattice. In this paper we show that, similar to these
two cases, calculations that use truncated dipolar interactions to model the
Gd3Ga5O12 garnet antiferromagnet also predict unphysical phases with
incommensurate ordering wave vector q_ord that is very sensitive to the dipolar
cut-off distance Rc.
