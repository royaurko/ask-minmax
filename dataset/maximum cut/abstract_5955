Time resolved spectroscopic observations of U Gem during its March 2000
outburst show strong spiral shocks in the accretion disk. During the plateau at
maximum brightness the spiral shocks contribute 14% to the total He II flux.
The two arms of the spiral show a distinctly different evolution during the
outburst and decline, which indicates an asymmetric evolution in the disk.
