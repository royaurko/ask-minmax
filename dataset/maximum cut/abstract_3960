The Virtual Observatory is now mature enough to produce cutting-edge science
results. The exploitation of astronomical data beyond classical identification
limits with interoperable tools for statistical identification of sources has
become a reality. I present the discovery of 68 optically faint, obscured
(i.e., type 2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates in the two GOODS fields
using the Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (AVO) prototype. Thirty-one of
these sources have high estimated X-ray powers (>10^44 erg/s) and therefore
qualify as optically obscured quasars, the so-called QSO 2. The number of these
objects in the GOODS fields is now 40, an improvement of a factor > 4 when
compared to the only 9 such sources previously known. By going ~ 3 magnitudes
fainter than previously known type 2 AGN in the GOODS fields the AVO is
sampling a region of redshift -- power space much harder to reach with
classical methods. I also discuss the AVO move to our next phase, the EURO-VO,
and our short-term plans to continue doing science with the Virtual
Observatory.
