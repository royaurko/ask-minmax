Consider the problem of drawing random variates $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ from a
distribution where the marginal of each $X_i$ is specified, as well as the
correlation between every pair $X_i$ and $X_j$. For given marginals, the
Fr\'echet-Hoeffding bounds put a lower and upper bound on the correlation
between $X_i$ and $X_j$. Hence any achievable correlation can be uniquely
represented by a convexity parameter $\lambda_{ij} \in [0,1]$ where 1 gives the
maximum correlation and 0 the minimum correlation. We show that for a given
convexity parameter matrix, the worst case is when the marginal distribution
are all Bernoulli random variables with parameter 1/2 (fair 0-1 coins). It is
worst case in the sense that given a convexity parameter matrix that is
obtainable when the marginals are all fair 0-1 coins, it is possible to
simulate from any marginals with the same convexity parameter matrix. In
addition, we characterize completely the set of convexity parameter matrices
for symmetric Bernoulli marginals in two, three and four dimensions.
