Within the framework of time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory, we discuss an
effect of the non-magnetic interaction between the normal current and the
supercurrent in the phase-slip regime. The correction due to the
current-current interaction is shown to have a transient character so that it
contributes only as a system evolves. Numerical analyses for thin layers with
no magnetic feedback show that the largest contribution of the current-current
interaction appears near sample edges, where kinematic vortices reach maximum
velocity.
