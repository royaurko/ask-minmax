We consider a rational surface with a relatively minimal fibration. Picard
number of a such fibred surface is bounded in terms of the genus of a general
fibre. When Picard number is the maximum for any given genus, we characterize a
such fibred surface whose Mordell-Weil group is trivial by singular fibres.
Furthermore, we describe the defining equation explicitly.
