We describe scaling limits of recurrent excited random walks (ERWs) on
integers in i.i.d. cookie environments with a bounded number of cookies per
site. We allow both positive and negative excitations. It is known that ERW is
recurrent if and only if the expected total drift per site, delta, belongs to
the interval [-1,1]. We show that if |delta|<1 then the diffusively scaled ERW
under the averaged measure converges to a (delta,-delta)-perturbed Brownian
motion. In the boundary case, |delta|=1, the space scaling has to be adjusted
by an extra logarithmic term, and the weak limit of ERW happens to be a
constant multiple of the running maximum of the standard Brownian motion, a
transient process.
