On 13 December 2012, Chang'e-2 conducted a successful flyby of the near-Earth
asteroid 4179 Toutatis at a closest distance of 770 $\pm$ 120 meters from the
asteroid's surface. The highest-resolution image, with a resolution of better
than 3 meters, reveals new discoveries on the asteroid, e.g., a giant basin at
the big end, a sharply perpendicular silhouette near the neck region, and
direct evidence of boulders and regolith, which suggests that Toutatis may bear
a rubble-pile structure. Toutatis' maximum physical length and width are (4.75
$\times$ 1.95 km) $\pm$10$\%$, respectively, and the direction of the +$z$ axis
is estimated to be (250$\pm$5$^\circ$, 63$\pm$5$^\circ$) with respect to the
J2000 ecliptic coordinate system. The bifurcated configuration is indicative of
a contact binary origin for Toutatis, which is composed of two lobes (head and
body). Chang'e-2 observations have significantly improved our understanding of
the characteristics, formation, and evolution of asteroids in general.
