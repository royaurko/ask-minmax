We investigate the empirical data for the vapor pressure (154$
\leq$$T$$\leq$196 K) and heat capacity (15.52$ \leq$$T$$\leq$189.78 K) of the
solid carbon dioxide. The approach is both theoretical and numerical, using a
computer algebra system (CAS). From the latter point of view, we have adopted a
cubic piecewise polynomial representation for the heat capacity and reached an
excellent agreement between the available empirical data and the evaluated one.
Furthermore, we have obtained values for the vapor pressure and heat of
sublimation at temperatures below 195 right down to 0 K. The key prerequisites
are the: 1) Determination of the heat of sublimation of 26250
J$\cdot$mol\textsuperscript{-1} at vanishing temperature and 2) Elaboration of
a `linearized' vapor pressure equation that includes all the relevant
properties of the gaseous and solid phases. It is shown that: 1) The empirical
vapor pressure equation derived by Giauque & Egan remains valid below the
assumed lower limit of 154 K (similar argument holds for Antoine's equation),
2) The heat of sublimation reaches its maximum value of 27211
J$\cdot$mol\textsuperscript{-1} at 58.829 K and 3) The vapor behaves as a
(polyatomic) ideal gas for temperatures below 150 K.
