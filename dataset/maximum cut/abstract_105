It is proposed that the spectra of so called 'MeV blazars' can be explained
in terms of previously developed models of the external comptonization of
accretion disk radiation provided that the structure of the inner and outer
parts of the accretion disk is different. The electron acceleration is
saturated by the inverse Compton losses in the inner geometrically thick disk
and the outer geometrically thin disk at different maximum energies which
causes the appearance of two spectral components, one strongly peaked in the
MeV energy range and the second one of a power law type extending through the
GeV energy range. The spectra, computed in terms of such a simple geometrical
model, are in a good agreement with observations of the MeV blazar PKS0208-512.
They are consistent with the transient appearance of a strong MeV peak, the
power law spectrum in the EGRET energy range, and a possible cut-off at high
energies.
