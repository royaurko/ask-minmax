We investigate the geometry of lightsheets comprised of null geodesics near a
brane. Null geodesics which begin parallel to a brane a distance d away are
typically gravitationally bound to the brane, so that the maximum distance from
the geodesic to the brane never exceeds d. The geometry of resulting
lightsheets is similar to that of the brane if one coarse grains over distances
of order d. We discuss the implications for the covariant entropy bound applied
to brane worlds.
