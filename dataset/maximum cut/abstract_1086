We prove that for a large class of subvarieties of abelian varieties over
global function fields, the Brauer-Manin condition on adelic points cuts out
exactly the rational points. This result is obtained from more general results
concerning the intersection of the adelic points of a subvariety with the
adelic closure of the group of rational points of the abelian variety.
