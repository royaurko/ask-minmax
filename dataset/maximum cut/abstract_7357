The Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 1210 was found to exhibit a flat hard X-ray
component by ASCA, although ASCA could not distinguish whether it is an
absorbed direct component or a reflected one. We then observed Mrk 1210 with
BeppoSAX, and found that the X-ray spectral properties are quite different from
those of ASCA, as have been confirmed with XMM-Newton; the flux is
significantly higher than that in the ASCA observation, and a clear absorption
cut-off appears below 5 keV. A bright hard X-ray emission is detected up to 100
keV. The reflection component is necessary to describe the BeppoSAX PDS
spectrum, and represents the ASCA hard component very well. Therefore, the hard
component in the ASCA spectrum is a reflected one, whose intensity is almost
constant over 6 years. This indicates that a dramatic spectral variability is
attributed to a large change of the absorption column density by a factor of
>5, rather than the variability of the nuclear emission. The change in the
absorption-column density means that the torus is not homogeneous, but has a
blobby structure with a typical blob size of < 0.001
