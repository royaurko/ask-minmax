As part of a systematic study that we are performing with the aim to increase
the observational evidence of triggered star formation in the surroundings of
HII regions, we analyze the ISM around the HII region G35.673-00.847, a poorly
studied source. Using data from large-scale surveys: Two Micron All Sky Survey,
Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE), MIPSGAL,
Galactic Ring Survey (GRS), VLA Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS), and NRAO VLA Sky
Survey (NVSS) we performed a multiwavelength study of G35.673-00.847 and its
surroundings. The mid IR emission, shows that G35.673-00.847 has an almost
semi-ring like shape with a cut towards the galactic west. The radius of this
semi-ring is about 1.5' (~1.6 pc, at the distance of ~3.7 kpc). The distance
was estimated from an HI absorption study and from the analysis of the
molecular gas. Indeed, we find a molecular shell composed by several clumps
distributed around the HII region, suggesting that its expansion is collecting
the surrounding material. We find several YSO candidates over the molecular
shell. Finally, comparing the HII region dynamical age and the fragmentation
time of the molecular shell, we discard the collect and collapse as the
mechanism responsible for the YSOs formation, suggesting other processes such
as radiative driven implosion and/or small-scale Jeans gravitational
instabilities.
