The influence of nonequilibrium bulk conditions on the properties of the
interfaces exhibited by a kinetic Ising--like model system with nonequilibrium
steady states is studied. The system is maintained out of equilibrium by
perturbing the familiar spin--flip dynamics at temperature T with
completely--random flips; one may interpret these as ideally simulating some
(dynamic) impurities. We find evidence that, in the present case, the
nonequilibrium mechanism adds to the basic thermal one resulting on a
renormalization of microscopic parameters such as the probability of
interfacial broken bonds. On this assumption, we develop theory for the
nonequilibrium "surface tension", which happens to show a non--monotonous
behavior with a maximum at some finite T. It ensues, in full agreement with
Monte Carlo simulations, that interface fluctuations differ qualitatively from
the equilibrium case, e.g., the interface remains rough at zero--T. We discuss
on some consequences of these facts for nucleation theory, and make some
explicit predictions concerning the nonequilibrium droplet structure.
