The MUNU experiment was carried out at the Bugey nuclear power reactor. The
aim was the study of electron antineutrino-electron elastic scattering at low
energy. The recoil electrons were recorded in a gas time projection chamber,
immersed in a tank filled with liquid scintillator serving as veto detector,
suppressing in particular Compton electrons. The measured electron recoil
spectrum is presented. Upper limits on the neutrino magnetic moment were
derived and are discussed.
