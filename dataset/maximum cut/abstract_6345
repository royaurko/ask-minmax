Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is the first dedicated mm-wavelength VLBI Network
in East Asia and will be available from the middle of 2008. KVN consists of
three stations and has the maximum observation frequency of 129 GHz with the
maximum baseline length of 480 km. KVN has unique characteristics in the
multifrequency, simultaneous observing system. By taking advantage of this we
are considering various science topics, including not only maser emitting
regions and young stellar objects in our galaxy, but also extragalactic
objects. Construction of the first site is in progress. We are concurrently
developing components, including receivers, data acquisition systems, and a
correlator, and also arranging the international collaboration.
