Resonance-mediated many body decays of heavy mesons are analyzed. We focus on
some particular processes, in which the available phase space for the decay of
the intermediate resonance is very narrow. It is shown that the mass selection
criteria used in several experimental studies of D and B meson decays could
lead to a significant underestimation of branching ratios.
