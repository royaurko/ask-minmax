Direct simulation of biomolecular dynamics in thermal equilibrium is
challenging due to the metastable nature of conformation dynamics and the
computational cost of molecular dynamics. Biased or enhanced sampling methods
may improve the convergence of expectation values of equilibrium probabilities
and expectation values of stationary quantities significantly. Unfortunately
the convergence of dynamic observables such as correlation functions or
timescales of conformational transitions relies on direct equilibrium
simulations. Markov state models are well suited to describe both, stationary
properties and properties of slow dynamical processes of a molecular system, in
terms of a transition matrix for a jump process on a suitable discretiza- tion
of continuous conformation space. Here, we introduce statistical estimation
methods that allow a priori knowledge of equilibrium probabilities to be
incorporated into the estimation of dynamical observables. Both, maximum
likelihood methods and an improved Monte Carlo sampling method for reversible
transition ma- trices with fixed stationary distribution are given. The
sampling approach is applied to a toy example as well as to simulations of the
MR121-GSGS-W peptide, and is demonstrated to converge much more rapidly than a
previous approach in [F. Noe, J. Chem. Phys. 128, 244103 (2008)]
