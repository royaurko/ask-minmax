Silicon detectors for the Roman Pots of the large hadron collider TOTEM
experiment aim for full sensitivity at the edge where a terminating structure
is required for electrical stability. This work provides an innovative approach
reducing the conventional width of the terminating structure to less than 100
microns, still using standard planar fabrication technology. The objective of
this new development is to decouple the electric behaviour of the surface from
the sensitive volume within tens of microns. The explanation of the basic
principle of this new approach together with the experimental confirmation via
electric measurements and beam test are presented in this paper, demonstrating
that silicon detectors with this new terminating structure are fully
operational and efficient to under 60 microns from the die cut.
