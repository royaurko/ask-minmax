The sextic oscillator is proposed as a two-parameter solvable
$\gamma$-independent potential in the Bohr Hamiltonian. It is shown that closed
analytical expressions can be derived for the energies and wavefunctions of the
first few levels and for the strength of electric quadrupole transitions
between them. Depending on the parameters this potential has a minimum at
$\beta=0$ or at $\beta>0$, and might also have a local maximum before reaching
its minimum. A comparison with the spectral properties of the infinite square
well and the $\beta^4$ potential is presented, together with a brief analysis
of the experimental spectrum and E2 transitions of the $^{134}$Ba nucleus.
