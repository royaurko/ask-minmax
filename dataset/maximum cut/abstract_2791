Let $P$ be a simple polytope of dimension $n$ with $m$ facets and $P_{v}$ be
a polytope obtained from $P$ by cutting off one vertex $v$. Let $Z=Z(P)$ and
$Z_{v}=Z(P_{v})$ be the corresponding moment-angle manifolds. In \cite{[GL]}
S.Gitler and S.L\'{o}pez conjectured that: $Z_{v}$ is diffeomorphic to
$\partial[(Z-int(D^{n+m}))\times D^{2}]\sharp \mathop{\sharp}
\limits_{j=1}^{m-n} \binom{m-n}{j} (S^{j+2}\times S^{m+n-j-1})$, and they have
proved the conjecture in the case $m<3n$. In this paper we prove the conjecture
in general case.
