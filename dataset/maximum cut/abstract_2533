We employ tomographic observations of a small region of plage to study the
propagation of waves from the solar photosphere to the chromosphere using a
Fourier phase-difference analysis. Our results show the expected vertical
propagation for waves with periods of 3 minutes. Waves with 5-minute periods,
i.e., above the acoustic cut-off period, are found to propagate only at the
periphery of the plage, and only in the direction in which the field can be
reasonably expected to expand. We conclude that field inclination is critically
important in the leakage of p-mode oscillations from the photosphere into the
chromosphere.
