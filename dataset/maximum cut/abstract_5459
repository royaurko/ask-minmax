Laser processing of graphene is of great interest for cutting, patterning and
structural engineering purposes. Tunable nanosecond lasers have the advantage
of being relatively widespread (compared to e.g. femtosecond or high-power
continuous wave lasers). Hereby we have conducted an investigation of the
impact of nanosecond laser pulses on CVD graphene. The damage produced by
sufficiently strong single shots (pulse width 5 ns, wavelength 532 or 266 nm)
from tunable optical parametric oscillator was investigated by the methods of
scanning electron microscopy and optical microspectroscopy (Raman and
fluorescence). Threshold of energy density for producing visible damage was
found to be ~200 mJ/cm2. For UV irradiation the threshold could be notably less
depending on the origin of sample. Surprisingly strong fluorescence signal was
recorded from damaged areas and is attributed to the residues of oxidized
graphene.
