The non-perturbatively defined running quark mass introduced by the ALPHA
collaboration is based on the PCAC relation between correlation functions
derived from the Schr\"odinger functional (SF). In order to complete its
definition it remains to specify a number of parameters, including the ratio of
time to spatial extent, $T/L$, and the angle $\theta$ which appears in the
spatial boundary conditions for the quark fields. We investigate the running
mass in perturbation theory and propose a choice of parameters which attains
two desired properties: firstly the two-loop anomalous dimension $\d1SF$ is
reasonably small. This is needed in order to ease matching with the
non-perturbative computations and to achieve a precise determination of the
renormalization group invariant quark mass. Secondly, to one-loop order of
perturbation theory, cut-off effects in the step-scaling function are small in
O($a$) improved lattice QCD.
