This paper is devoted to the estimation of a vector parametrizing an energy
function associated to some "Nearest-Neighbours" Gibbs point process, via the
pseudo-likelihood method. We present some convergence results concerning this
estimator, that is strong consistency and asymptotic normality, when only a
single realization is observed. Sufficient conditions are expressed in terms of
the local energy function and are verified on some examples.
