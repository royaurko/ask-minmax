We have investigated the non-classical response of solid 4He confined in
porous gold set to torsional oscillation. When solid helium is grown rapidly,
nearly 7% of the solid helium appears to be decoupled from the oscillation
below about 200 mK. Dissipation appears at temperatures where the decoupling
shows maximum variation. In contrast, the decoupling is substantially reduced
in slowly grown solid helium. The dynamic response of solid helium was also
studied by imposing a sudden increase in the amplitude of oscillation. Extended
relaxation in the resonant period shift, suggesting the emergence of the
pinning of low energy excitations, was observed below the onset temperature of
the non-classical response. The motion of a dislocation or a glassy solid is
restricted in the entangled narrow pores and is not likely responsible for the
period shift and long relaxation.
