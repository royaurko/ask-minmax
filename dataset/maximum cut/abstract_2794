We give an introduction to logic tailored for algebraists, explaining how
proofs in linear logic can be viewed as algorithms for constructing morphisms
in symmetric closed monoidal categories with additional structure. This is made
explicit by showing how to represent proofs in linear logic as linear maps
between vector spaces. The interesting part of this vector space semantics is
based on the cofree cocommutative coalgebra of Sweedler.
