In present work a new XNOR gate using three transistors has been presented,
which shows power dissipation of 550.7272$\mu$W in 0.35$\mu$m technology with
supply voltage of 3.3V. Minimum level for high output of 2.05V and maximum
level for low output of 0.084V have been obtained. A single bit full adder
using eight transistors has been designed using proposed XNOR cell, which shows
power dissipation of 581.542$\mu$W. Minimum level for high output of 1.97V and
maximum level for low output of 0.24V is obtained for sum output signal. For
carry signal maximum level for low output of 0.32V and minimum level for high
output of 3.2V have been achieved. Simulations have been performed by using
SPICE based on TSMC 0.35$\mu$m CMOS technology. Power consumption of proposed
XNOR gate and full adder has been compared with earlier reported circuits and
proposed circuit's shows better performance in terms of power consumption and
transistor count.
