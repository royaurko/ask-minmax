We study the overdamped dynamics of a Brownian particle in the double-well
potential under the influence of an external periodic (AC) force with zero
mean. We obtain a dependence of the jump rate on the frequency of the external
force. The dependence shows a maximum at a certain driving frequency. We
explain the phenomenon as a switching between different time scales of the
system: interwell relaxation time (the mean residence time) and the intrawell
relaxation time. Dependence of the resonant peak on the system parameters,
namely the amplitude of the driving force A and the noise strength
(temperature) D has been explored. We observe that the effect is well
pronounced when A/D > 1 and if A/D 1 the enhancement of the jump rate can be of
the order of magnitude with respect to the Kramers rate.
