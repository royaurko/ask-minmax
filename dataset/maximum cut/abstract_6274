We report the detection of velocity variations in the pulsating sdB star, PG
1605+072. Oscillations are detected at the same frequencies found from
photometry and have amplitudes of up to 14 km/s for H$\beta$. The strongest
oscillation found in previous photometric observations is not evident in our
spectroscopy or photometry, and may be absent due to beating of closely spaced
modes. Phase differences between spectroscopy and B magnitude photometry imply
that maximum brightness occurs not long after maximum radius. We have also
found evidence of variation in the observed amplitudes of five Balmer lines,
with a decrease in amplitude of the strongest mode blueward from H$\beta$. This
effect is not expected and a longer time-series will be needed to clarify it.
