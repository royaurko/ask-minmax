Without an ultraviolet cut-off, the time evolution of the classical
Yang-Mills equations give rise to a never ending cascading of the modes towards
the ultraviolet, and ergodic measures and dynamical averages, such as the
spectrum of characteristic Lyapunov exponents (measures of temporal chaos) or
spatial correlation functions, are ill defined. A lattice regularization (in
space) provides an ultraviolet cut-off of the classical Yang-Mills theory,
giving a possibility for the existence of ergodic measures and dynamical
averages. We analyze in this investigation in particular the scaling behavior
$\beta = d \log \lambda / d \log E $ of the principal Lyapunov exponent with
the energy of the lattice system. A large body of recent literature claims a
linear scaling relationship ($\beta = 1$) between the principal Lyapunov
exponent and the average energy per lattice plaquette for the continuum limit
of the lattice Yang-Mills equations. We question this result by providing
rigorous upper bounds on the Lyapunov exponent for all energies, hence giving a
non-positive exponent, $\beta \leq 0$, asymptotically for high energies, and we
give plausible arguments for a scaling exponent close to $\beta \sim 1/4$ for
low energies. We argue that the region of low energy is the region which comes
closest to what could be termed a ``continuum limit'' for the classical lattice
system.
