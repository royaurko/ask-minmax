We report the first observations of far-ultraviolet (FUV: 1000 -- 1150 \AA)
diffuse radiation from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using observations from
the {\em Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)}. The strength of FUV
diffuse surface brightness in the SMC ranges from the detection limit of 2000
photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ \AA$^{-1}$ to a maximum of $3 \times
10^{5}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ \AA$^{-1}$ at 1004 \AA. The
contribution of diffuse emission to the total radiation field was found to be
34% at 1004 \AA to 44% at 1117 \AA with a maximum observed uncertainty of 30%.
There is a striking difference between the FUV diffuse fraction from the SMC
and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with the SMC fraction being higher
probable because the higher dust albedo. The FUV diffuse emission correlates
with H$\alpha$ emission in the H {\small II} regions of the SMC.
