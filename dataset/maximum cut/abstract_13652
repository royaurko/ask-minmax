We study the stopping times of gossip algorithms for network coding. We
analyze algebraic gossip (i.e., random linear coding) and consider three gossip
algorithms for information spreading Pull, Push, and Exchange. The stopping
time of algebraic gossip is known to be linear for the complete graph, but the
question of determining a tight upper bound or lower bounds for general graphs
is still open. We take a major step in solving this question, and prove that
algebraic gossip on any graph of size n is O(D*n) where D is the maximum degree
of the graph. This leads to a tight bound of Theta(n) for bounded degree graphs
and an upper bound of O(n^2) for general graphs. We show that the latter bound
is tight by providing an example of a graph with a stopping time of Omega(n^2).
Our proofs use a novel method that relies on Jackson's queuing theorem to
analyze the stopping time of network coding; this technique is likely to become
useful for future research.
