The operations drip and mate considered in (mem)brane computing resemble the
operations cut and recombination well known from DNA computing. We here
consider sets of vesicles with multisets of objects on their outside membrane
interacting by drip and mate in two different setups: in test tube systems, the
vesicles may pass from one tube to another one provided they fulfill specific
constraints; in tissue-like P systems, the vesicles are immediately passed to
specified cells after having undergone a drip or mate operation. In both
variants, computational completeness can be obtained, yet with different
constraints for the drip and mate operations.
