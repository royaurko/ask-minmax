The use of photovoltaic (PV) sources is becoming very popular in smart grid
for their ecological benefits, with higher scalability and utilization for
local generation and delivery. PV can also potentially avoid the energy losses
that are normally associated with long-range grid distribution. The increased
penetration of solar panels, however, has introduced a need for solar energy
models that are capable of producing realistic synthetic data with small error
margins. Such models, for instance, can be used to design the appropriate size
of energy storage devices or to determine the maximum charging rate of a
PV-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging station. In this regard, this paper
proposes a stochastic model for solar generation using a Markov chain approach.
Based on real data, it is first shown that the solar states are
inter-dependent, and thus suitable for modeling using a Markov model. Then, the
probabilities of transition between states are shown to be heterogeneous over
different time segments. A model is proposed that captures the inter temporal
dependency of solar irradiance through segmentation of the Markov chain across
different times of the day. In the studied model, different state transition
matrices are constructed for different time segments, which the proposed
algorithm then uses to generate the solar states for different times of the
day. Numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed
synthetic generator.
