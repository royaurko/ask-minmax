A modeling of the soil structure and surface roughness by means of the
concepts of the fractal growth is presented. Two parameters are used to control
the model: the fragmentation dimension, $D_f$, and the maximum mass of the
deposited aggregates, $M_{max}$. The fragmentation dimension is related to the
particle size distribution through the relation $N(r \ge R) \sim R^{D_f}$,
where $N(r \ge R)$ is the accumulative number of particles with radius greater
than $R$. The size of the deposited aggregates are chose following the power
law above, and the morphology of the aggregate is random selected using a bond
percolation algorithm. The deposition rules are the same used in the model of
solid-on-solid deposition with surface relaxation. A comparison of the model
with real data shows that the Hurst exponent, $H$, measured {\it via}
semivariogram method and detrended fluctuation analysis, agrees in statistical
sense with the simulated profiles.
