We present a new method based on phase analysis for the Galaxy and foreground
component separation from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal. This
method is based on a prevailing assumption that the phases of the underlying
CMB signal should have no or little correlation with those of the foregrounds.
This method takes into consideration all the phases of each multipole mode (l
<= 50, -l <= m <=l) from the whole sky without galactic cut, masks or any
dissection of the whole sky into disjoint regions. We use cross correlation of
the phases to illustrate that significant correlations of the foregrounds
manifest themselves in the phases of the WMAP 5 frequency bands, which are used
for separation of the CMB from the signals. Our final phase-cleaned CMB map has
the angular power spectrum in agreement with both the WMAP result and that from
Tegmark, de Oliveira-Costa and Hamilton (TOH), the phases of our derived CMB
signal, however, are slightly different from those of the WMAP Internal Linear
Combination map and the TOH map.
