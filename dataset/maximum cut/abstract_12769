We compute the ground-state energies of a heavy-light K-Lambda like system as
a function of the relative distance r of the hadrons. The heavy quarks, one in
each hadron, are treated as static. Then, the energies give rise to an
adiabatic potential Va(r) which we use to study the structure of the five-quark
system. The simulation is based on an anisotropic and asymmetric lattice with
Wilson fermions. Energies are extracted from spectral density functions
obtained with the maximum entropy method. Our results are meant to give
qualitative insight: Using the resulting adiabatic potential in a Schroedinger
equation produces bound state wave functions which indicate that the ground
state of the five-quark system resembles a hadronic molecule, whereas the first
excited state, having a very small rms radius, is probably better described as
a five-quark cluster, or a pentaquark. We hypothesize that an all light-quark
pentaquark may not exist, but in the heavy-quark sector it might, albeit only
as an excited state.
