We compute the index of the Dirac operator on spin Riemannian manifolds with
conical singularities, acting from $L^p(\Sigma^+)$ to $L^q(\Sigma^-)$ with
$p,q>1$. When $1+\frac{n}{p}-\frac{n}{q}>0$ we obtain the usual
Atiyah-Patodi-Singer formula, but with a spectral cut at
$\frac{n+1}{2}-\frac{n}{q}$ instead of 0 in the definition of the eta
invariant. In particular we reprove Chou's formula for the $L^2$ index. For
$1+\frac{n}{p}-\frac{n}{q}\leq 0$ the index formula contains an extra term
related to the Calder\'on projector.
