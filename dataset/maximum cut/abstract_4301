An analytic result for the O(alpha_s corrections to the triple differential B
-> X_u l nu decay rate is presented, to leading order in the heavy-quark
expansion. This is relevant for computing partially integrated decay
distributions with arbitrary cuts on kinematic variables. Several double and
single differential distributions are derived, most of which generalize known
results. In particular, an analytic result for the O(alpha_s) corrections to
the hadronic invariant mass spectrum is presented. The effects of Fermi motion,
which are important for the description of decay spectra close to infrared
sensitive regions, are included. The behaviour of perturbation theory in the
region of time-like momenta is also investigated
