We define cut-and-paste, a construction which, given a quadriculated disk
obtains a disjoint union of quadriculated disks of smaller total area. We
provide two examples of the use of this procedure as a recursive step. Tilings
of a disk $\Delta$ receive a parity: we construct a perfect or near-perfect
matching of tilings of opposite parities. Let $B_\Delta$ be the black-to-white
adjacency matrix: we factor $B_\Delta = L\tilde DU$, where $L$ and $U$ are
lower and upper triangular matrices, $\tilde D$ is obtained from a larger
identity matrix by removing rows and columns and all entries of $L$, $\tilde D$
and $U$ are equal to 0, 1 or -1.
