Using a large set of simulated extensive air showers, we investigate
universality features of electron and positron distributions in
very-high-energy cosmic-ray air showers. Most particle distributions depend
only on the depth of the shower maximum and the number of particles in the
cascade at this depth. We provide multi-dimensional parameterizations for the
electron-positron distributions in terms of particle energy, vertical and
horizontal momentum angle, lateral distance, and time distribution of the
shower front. These parameterizations can be used to obtain realistic
electron-positron distributions in extensive air showers for data analysis and
simulations of Cherenkov radiation, fluorescence signal, and radio emission.
