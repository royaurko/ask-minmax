Let X be a K3 surface with an involution g which has non-empty fixed locus
X^g and acts non-trivially on a non-zero holomorphic 2-form. We shall construct
all such pairs (X, g) in a canonical way, from some better known double
coverings of log del Pezzo surfaces of index at most 2 or rational elliptic
surfaces, and construct the only family of each of the three extremal cases
where X^g contains 10 (maximum possible) curves. We also classify rational log
Enriques surfaces of index 2. Our approach is more geometrical rather than
lattice-theoretical (see Nikulin's paper for the latter approach).
