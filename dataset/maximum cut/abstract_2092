Rotating disks with nonzero radial pressure and finite radius are studied.
The models are based in the Taub-NUT metric and constructed using the
well-known ``displace, cut and reflect'' method. We find that the disks are
made of perfect fluids with constant energy density and pressure. The energy
density is negative, but the effective Newotnian density is possitive as the
strong energy condition requires. We also find that the disks are not stable
under radial perturbations and that there are regions of the disks where the
particles move with superluminal velocities.
