In chaotic dynamical systems, an infinitesimal perturbation is exponentially
amplified at a time-rate given by the inverse of the maximum  Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda$. In fully developed turbulence, $\lambda$ grows as a power of the
Reynolds number. This result could seem in contrast with phenomenological
arguments suggesting that, as a consequence of `physical'  perturbations, the
predictability time is  roughly given by the characteristic life-time of the
large  scale structures, and hence independent of the Reynolds number. We show
that such a situation is present in generic systems with many degrees of
freedom,
since  the growth of a non-infinitesimal perturbation is determined by
cumulative
effects of many different characteristic times and is unrelated to the maximum
Lyapunov exponent. Our results are illustrated in a chain of coupled maps and
in a
shell model for the energy cascade in turbulence.
