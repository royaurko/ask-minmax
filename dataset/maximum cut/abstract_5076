The fabrication of metallic single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes
separated by gaps of typically 20nm width by electron-beam-induced oxidation is
studied within an active device configuration. The tube conductance is measured
continuously during the process. The experiment provides a statistical
evaluation of gap sizes as well as the electron dose needed for gap formation.
Also, the ability to precisely cut many carbon nanotubes in parallel is
demonstrated.
