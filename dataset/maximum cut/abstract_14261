The thermodynamic parameters of the superconducting state in Calcium under
the pressure at 200 GPa have been determined. The numerical analysis by using
the Eliashberg equations in the mixed representation has been conducted. It has
been stated, that the critical temperature ($T_{C}$) decreases from 36.15 K to
20.79 K dependently on the assumed value of the Coulomb pseudopotential
($\mu^{*}\in<0.1,0.3>$). Next, the order parameter near the temperature of zero
Kelvin ($\Delta(0)$) has been obtained. It has been proven, that the
dimensionless ratio $2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{C}$ decreases from 4.25 to 3.90
together with the growth of $\mu^{*}$. Finally, the ratio of the electron
effective mass to the electron bare mass ($m^{*}_{e}/m_{e}$) has been
calculated. It has been shown, that $m^{*}_{e}/m_{e}$ takes the high value in
the whole range of the superconducting phase's existence, and its maximum is
equal to 2.23 for T=T_{C}.
