The LISA International Science Team Working Group on Data Analysis
(LIST-WG1B) is sponsoring several rounds of mock data challenges, with the
purposeof fostering the development of LISA data analysis capabilities, and of
demonstrating technical readiness for the maximum science exploitation of the
LISA data. The first round of challenge data sets were released at the Sixth
LISA Symposium. We briefly describe the objectives, structure, and time-line of
this programme.
