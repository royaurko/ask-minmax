Raptor codes are known as precoded rateless codes that achieve the capacity
of BEC. However the maximum degree of Raptor codes needs to be unbounded to
achieve the capacity. In this paper, we prove that spatially-coupled precoded
rateless codes achieve the capacity with bounded degree under BP decoding.
