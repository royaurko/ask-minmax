This paper presents the R package MCS which implements the Model Confidence
Set (MCS) procedure recently developed by Hansen et al. (2011). The Hansen's
procedure consists on a sequence of tests which permits to construct a set of
'superior' models, where the null hypothesis of Equal Predictive Ability (EPA)
is not rejected at a certain confidence level. The EPA statistic tests is
calculated for an arbitrary loss function, meaning that we could test models on
various aspects, for example punctual forecasts. The relevance of the package
is shown using an example which aims at illustrating in details the use of the
functions provided by the package. The example compares the ability of
different models belonging to the ARCH family to predict large financial
losses. We also discuss the implementation of the ARCH--type models and their
maximum likelihood estimation using the popular R package rugarch developed by
Ghalanos (2014).
