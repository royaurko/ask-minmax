We report results from HST-NICMOS imaging of the extremely dense core of the
globular cluster Terzan 5. This highly obscured bulge cluster has been
estimated to have one of the highest collision rates of any galactic globular
cluster, making its core a particularly conducive environment for the
production of interacting binary systems. We have reconstructed high-resolution
images of the central 19"x19" region of Terzan 5 by application of the drizzle
algorithm to dithered NIC2 images in the F110W, F187W, and F187N near-infrared
filters. We have used a DAOPHOT/ALLSTAR analysis of these images to produce the
deepest color-magnitude diagram (CMD) yet obtained for the core of Terzan 5. We
have also analyzed the parallel 11"X11" NIC1 field, centered 30" from the
cluster center and imaged in F110W and F160W, and an additional NIC2 field that
is immediately adjacent to the central field. This imaging results in a clean
detection of the red-giant branch and horizontal branch in the central NIC2
field, and the detection of these plus the main-sequence turnoff and the upper
main sequence in the NIC1 field. We have constructed an H versus J-H CMD for
the NIC1 field. We obtain a new distance estimate of 8.7 kpc, which places
Terzan 5 within less than 1 kpc of the galactic center. We have also determined
a central surface-density profile which results in a maximum likelihood
estimate of 7.9" +/- 0.6" for the cluster core radius. We discuss the
implications of these results for the dynamical state of Terzan 5.
