We propose a scenario that explains many of the Pacific Ocean climate
phenomena that are called El Nino/ La Nina. This scenario requires an event,
which we call a Super-Nino Event. It dominates other phenomena when it occurs.
A template of this event has been constructed giving the time evolution, which
is an alternating sequence of 'El Ninos' and 'La Ninas'. The duration of the
event is about 15 years unless some other event intervenes. Three such events
can explain most of the El Nino/La Nina features that have been observed since
1968. We find that the various El Nino/La Nina features that have been observed
fall into types, associated with the oscillation in the template, which can be
classified by a "Periodic Table". The Earth is presently experiencing one of
these events which started in the mid 1990's and will continue for another 4-5
years. This extrapolation into the future suggests that a minor El Nino will
begin in mid 2001 and will reach a maximum about a year later. The conditions
under which such a Super Nino-Event may occur are discussed.
