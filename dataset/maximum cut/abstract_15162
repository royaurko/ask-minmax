In this paper we investigate the effect of Line-of-Sight (LOS) and
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation on the Area Spectral Efficiency (ASE) and
on the energy efficiency of dense small-cell networks. We show that including
both LOS and NLOS propagation in the path-loss model provides a completely
different picture of the behaviours of ASE and energy efficiency than what
would be observed in case of either LOS or NLOS propagation only. In
particular, with combined LOS/NLOS path-loss, the ASE exhibits superlinear and
sublinear behaviour at low and high cell densities, respectively. In addition,
the energy efficiency as a function of the cell density has a global maximum
and is not a monotonically increasing function like in case of LOS or NLOS
propagation only. Based on our findings, we claim that Line-of-Sight (LOS) and
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagations play an important role in studying the
performance of extremely dense small-cell networks.
