Statistical mechanics relies on the complete though probabilistic description
of a system in terms of all the microscopic variables. Its object is to derive
therefrom static and dynamic properties involving some reduced set of
variables. The elimination of the irrelevant variables is guided by the maximum
entropy criterion, which produces the probability law carrying the least amount
of information compatible with the relevant variables. This defines relevant
entropies which measure the missing information (the disorder) associated with
the sole variables retained in an incomplete description. Relevant entropies
depend not only on the state of the system but also on the coarseness of its
reduced description. Their use sheds light on questions such as the Second Law,
both in equilibrium an in irreversible thermodynamics, the projection method of
statistical mechanics, Boltzmann's \textit{H}-theorem or spin-echo experiment.
