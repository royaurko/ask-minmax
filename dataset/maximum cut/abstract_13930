We report the interplay between charge-density-wave (CDW) and
superconductivity of 1$T$-Fe$_{x}$Ta$_{1-x}$S$_{2}$ ($0\leq x \leq 0.05$)
single crystals. The CDW order is gradually suppressed by Fe-doping,
accompanied by the disappearance of pseudogap/Mott-gap as shown by the density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. The superconducting state develops at low
temperatures within the CDW state for the samples with the moderate doping
levels. The superconductivity strongly depends on $x$ within a narrow range,
and the maximum superconducting transition temperature is 2.8 K as $x=0.02$. We
propose that the induced superconductivity and CDW phases are separated in real
space. For high doping level ($x>0.04$), the Anderson localization (AL) state
appears, resulting in a large increase of resistivity. We present a complete
electronic phase diagram of 1$T$-Fe$_{x}$Ta$_{1-x}$S$_{2}$ system that shows a
dome-like $T_{c}(x)$.
