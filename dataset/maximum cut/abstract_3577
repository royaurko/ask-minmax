A subset $A$ of a given finite abelian group $G$ is called $(k,l)$-sum-free
if the sum of $k$ (not necessarily distinct) elements of $A$ does not equal the
sum of $l$ (not necessarily distinct) elements of $A$. We are interested in
finding the maximum size $\lambda_{k,l}(G)$ of a $(k,l)$-sum-free subset in
$G$.
  A $(2,1)$-sum-free set is simply called a sum-free set. The maximum size of a
sum-free set in the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ was found almost forty years
ago by Diamanda and Yap; the general case for arbitrary finite abelian groups
was recently settled by Green and Ruzsa. Here we find the value of
$\lambda_{3,1}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$. More generally, a recent paper of Hamidoune and
Plagne examines $(k,l)$-sum-free sets in $G$ when $k-l$ and the order of $G$
are relatively prime; we extend their results to see what happens without this
assumption.
