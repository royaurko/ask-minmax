We studied the temperature-pressure phase diagram of EuFe2As2 by measurements
of the electrical resistivity. The antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave
transition at T_0 associated with the FeAs-layers is continuously suppressed
with increasing pressure, while the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of
the Eu 2+ moments seems to be nearly pressure independent up to 2.6 GPa. Above
2 GPa a sharp drop of the resistivity, \rho(T), indicates the onset of
superconductivity at T_c \approx 29.5 K. Surprisingly, on further reducing the
temperature \rho(T) is increasing again and exhibiting a maximum caused by the
ordering of the Eu 2+ moments, a behavior which is reminiscent of re-entrant
superconductivity as it is observed in the ternary Chevrel phases or in the
rare-earth nickel borocarbides.
