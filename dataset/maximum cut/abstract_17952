A magnetic horn system to be operated at a pulsed current of 320 kA and to
survive high-power proton beam operation at 750 kW was developed for the T2K
experiment. The first set of T2K magnetic horns was operated for over 12
million pulses during the four years of operation from 2010 to 2013, under a
maximum beam power of 230 kW, and $6.63\times10^{20}$ protons were exposed to
the production target. No significant damage was observed throughout this
period. This successful operation of the T2K magnetic horns led to the
discovery of the $\nu_{\mu}\rightarrow\nu_e$ oscillation phenomenon in 2013 by
the T2K experiment. In this paper, details of the design, construction, and
operation experience of the T2K magnetic horns are described.
