Star formation by gravitational instabilities, sequential triggering, and
turbulence triggering are briefly reviewed in order to compare the various
mechanisms that are observed in main galaxy disks with those in the inner
kiloparsec regions. Although very little is known about inner galaxy triggering
mechanisms, there appear to be examples that parallel the well-known mechanisms
around us. The balance may shift slightly, however, because of the high
densities in nuclear regions. The sequential triggering mode, in which one
generation of stars triggers another, should be less prominent compared to
gravitational instabilities and turbulence triggering when the ambient density
is so high that the local dynamical time scale is less than the lifetime of an
O-type star. Regardless of this shift in balance, the star formation rate seems
to follow the same column density scaling law as in main disks, probably
because it is everywhere saturated to the maximum possible value allowed by the
fractal structure of the interstellar medium.
