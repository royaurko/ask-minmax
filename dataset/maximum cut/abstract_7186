We present the discovery of a relationship between the maximum ratio of the
flare flux (namely, 0.5-4 Ang to the 1-8 Ang flux) and non-flare background
(namely, the 1-8 Ang background flux), which clearly separates flares into
classes by peak flux level. We established this relationship based on an
analysis of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) X-ray
observations of ~ 50,000 X, M, C, and B flares derived from the NOAA/SWPC
flares catalog. Employing a combination of machine learning techniques
(K-nearest neighbors and nearest-centroid algorithms) we show a separation of
the observed parameters for the different peak flaring energies. This analysis
is validated by successfully predicting the flare classes for 100% of the
X-class flares, 76% of the M-class flares, 80% of the C-class flares and 81% of
the B-class flares for solar cycle 24, based on the training of the parametric
extracts for solar flares in cycles 22-23.
