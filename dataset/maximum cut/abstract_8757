The computations that are suggested by String Theory in the B model requires
the existence of degenerations of CY manifolds with maximum unipotent
monodromy. In String Theory such a point in the moduli space is called a large
radius limit (or large complex structure limit). In this paper we are going to
construct one parameter families of $n$ dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds, which
are complete intersections in toric varieties and which have a monodromy
operator $T$ such that (T$^{N}-id)^{n+1}=0$ but (T$^{N}-id)^{n}\neq0,$ i.e the
monodromy operator is maximal unipotent.
