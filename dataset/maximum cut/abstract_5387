Several angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies reveal a
poorly nested Fermi surface of LiFeAs, far away from a spin density wave
instability, and clear-cut superconducting gap anisotropies. On the other hand
a very different, more nested Fermi surface and dissimilar gap anisotropies
have been obtained from quasiparticle interference (QPI) data, which were
interpreted as arising from intraband scattering within hole-like bands. Here
we show that this ARPES-QPI paradox is completely resolved by interband
scattering between the hole-like bands. The resolution follows from an
excellent agreement between experimental quasiparticle scattering data and
T-matrix QPI calculations (based on experimental band structure data), which
allows disentangling interband and intraband scattering processes.
