We present a novel description of how energetic electrons may be ejected from
the pulsar interior into the atmosphere, based on the collective electrostatic
oscillations of interior electrons confined to move parallel to the magnetic
field. The size of the interior magnetic field influences the interior plasma
frequency, via the associated matter density compression. The plasma
oscillations occur close to the regions of maximum magnetic field curvature,
that is, close to the magnetic poles where the majority of magnetic flux
emerges. Given that these oscillations have a density-dependent maximum
amplitude before wave-breaking occurs, such waves can eject energetic electrons
using only the self-field of the electron population in the interior. Moreover,
photons emitted by electrons in the bulk of the oscillation can escape along
the field lines by virtue of the lower opacity there (and the fact that they
are emitted predominantly in this direction), leading to features in the
spectra of pulsars.
