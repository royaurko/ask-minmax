Discrete scale invariance, which corresponds to a partial breaking of the
scaling symmetry, is reflected in the existence of a hierarchy of
characteristic scales l0, c l0, c^2 l0,... where c is a preferred scaling ratio
and l0 a microscopic cut-off. Signatures of discrete scale invariance have
recently been found in a variety of systems ranging from rupture, earthquakes,
Laplacian growth phenomena, ``animals'' in percolation to financial market
crashes. We believe it to be a quite general, albeit subtle phenomenon. Indeed,
the practical problem in uncovering an underlying discrete scale invariance is
that standard ensemble averaging procedures destroy it as if it was pure noise.
This is due to the fact, that while c only depends on the underlying physics,
l0 on the contrary is realisation-dependent. Here, we adapt and implement a
novel so-called ``canonical'' averaging scheme which re-sets the l0 of
different realizations to approximately the same value. The method is based on
the determination of a realization-dependent effective critical point obtained
from, e.g., a maximum susceptibility criterion. We demonstrate the method on
diffusion limited aggregation and a model of rupture.
