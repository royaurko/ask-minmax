Bloch-vector spaces for $N$-level systems are investigated from the
spherical-coordinate point of view in order to understand their geometrical
aspects. We show that the maximum radius in each direction, which is due to the
construction of the Bloch-vector space, is determined by the minimum eigenvalue
of the corresponding observable (orthogonal generator of SU(N)). From this
fact, we reveal the dual property of the structure of the Bloch-vector space;
if in some direction the space reachs the large sphere (pure state), then in
the opposite direction the space can only get to the small sphere, and vice
versa. Another application is a parameterization with simple ranges of density
operators. We also provide three classes of quantum-state representation based
on actual measurements beyond the Bloch vector and discuss their state-spaces.
