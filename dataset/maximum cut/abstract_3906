We report the first simultaneous measure of the X-ray broadband (0.1--200
keV) continuum and of the iron K-alpha fluorescent line profile in the Seyfert
1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15. Our data confirms the ASCA detection of a skewed and
redshifted line profile (Tanaka et al. 1995). The most straightforward
explanation is that the line photons are emitted in the innermost regions of a
X-ray illuminated relativistic disk. The line Equivalent Width (~200 eV) is
perfectly consistent with the expected value for solar abundances, given the
observed amount of Compton reflection. We report also the discovery of a
cut-off in the nuclear primary emission at the energy of ~160 keV.
