We study the existence of positive and sign-changing multipeak solutions for
the stationary Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation. Here no symmetry on $V$ is
assumed. It is known that this equation has positive multipeak solutions with
all peaks approaching a local maximum of the potential. It is also proved that
solutions alternating positive and negative spikes exist in the case of a
minima. The aim of this paper is to show the existence of both positive and
sign-changing multipeak solutions around a nondegenerate saddle point of the
external potential.
