The kinematic and radiative power of molecular jets is expected to change as
a protostar undergoes permanent or episodal changes in the rate at which it
accretes. We study here the consequences of evolving jet power on the spatial
and velocity structure, as well as the fluxes, of molecular emission from the
bipolar outflow. We consider a jet of rapidly increasing density and a jet in
which the mass input is abruptly cut off. We perform three dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations with atomic and molecular cooling and chemistry. In
this work, highly collimated and sheared jets are assumed. We find that
position-velocity diagrams, velocity-channel maps and the relative H$_2$ and CO
fluxes are potentially the best indicators of the evolutionary stage. In
particular, the velocity width of the CO lines may prove most reliable although
the often-quoted mass-velocity power-law index is probably not. We demonstrate
how the relative H$_2$ 1--0 S(1) and CO J=1--0 fluxes evolve and apply this to
interpret the phase of several outflows.
