We improve a previously known general bound on Waring rank of forms (hence,
on symmetric rank of tensors). The improvement is obtained by changing the base
case in the inductive procedure based on the notion of "open rank". We show
that the maximum open rank for plane quartics is eight. To our knowledge, this
gives the first example of $n,d$, such that the maximum open rank for degree
$d$ forms that essentially depend on $n$ variables is strictly greater than the
maximum rank. In the case of ternary forms, we exhibit a further improvement
for odd $d\ge 5$. Namely, in this case, by a direct argument we get that the
rank is bounded above by $(d^2-1)/2$. Alhough these bounds are likely still far
from the sharp ones, the tools involved in the proofs seem worthy of
consideration, in view of further improvements.
