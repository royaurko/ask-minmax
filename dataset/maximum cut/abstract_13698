We address the persistence of H\"older continuity for weak solutions of the
linear drift-diffusion equation with nonlocal pressure \[ u_t + b \cdot \grad u
- \lap u = \grad p,\qquad \grad\cdot u =0 \] on $[0,\infty) \times \R^{n}$,
with $n \geq 2$. The drift velocity $b$ is assumed to be at the critical
regularity level, with respect to the natural scaling of the equations. The
proof draws on Campanato's characterization of H\"older spaces, and uses a
maximum-principle-type argument by which we control the growth in time of
certain local averages of $u$. We provide an estimate that does not depend on
any local smallness condition on the vector field $b$, but only on scale
invariant quantities.
