Employing the Maximum Entropy Method algorithm, we fit interstellar
extinction measurements which span the wavelength range 0.125-3 micron. We
present a uniform set of MEM model fits, all using the same grain materials,
optical constants and abundance constraints. In addition, we are taking
advantage of improved UV and IR data and better estimates of the gas-to-dust
ratio. The model fits cover the entire range of extinction properties that have
been seen in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. The grain models employed
for this presentation are the simplistic homogeneous spheres models (i.e.,
Mathis, Rumpl, & Nordsieck 1977) with two (graphite, silicate) or three
(graphite, silicate, amorphous carbon) components. Though such usage is only a
first step, the results do provide interesting insight into the use of grain
size as a diagnostic of dust environment. We find that the SMC Bar extinction
curve cannot be fit using carbon grains alone. This is a challenge to the
recent observational result indicating little silicon depletion in the SMC.
