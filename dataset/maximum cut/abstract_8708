We evaluate the on shell form factors of the electron for arbitrary momentum
transfer and finite electron mass, at two loops in QED, by integrating the
corresponding dispersion relations, which involve the imaginary parts known
since a long time. The infrared divergences are parameterized in terms of a
fictitious small photon mass. The result is expressed in terms of Harmonic
Polylogarithms of maximum weight 4. The expansions for small and large momentum
transfer are also given
