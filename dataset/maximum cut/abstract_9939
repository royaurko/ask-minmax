Gravitational lensing can be by a faint star, a trillion stars of a galaxy,
or a cluster of galaxies, and this poses a familiar struggle between particle
method and mean field method. In a bottom-up approach, a puzzle has been laid
on whether a quadruple lens can produce 17 images. The number of images is
governed by the gravitational lens equation, and the equation for $n$-tuple
lenses suggests that the maximum number of images of a point source potentially
increases as $n^2+1$. Indeed, the classes of $n=1, 2, 3$ lenses produce up to
$n^2+1 = 2, 5, 10$ images. We discuss the $n$-point lens system as a
two-dimensional harmonic flow of an inviscid fluid, count the caustics
topologically, recognize the significance of the limit points and discuss the
notion of image domains. We conjecture that the total number of positive images
is bounded by the number of finite limit points $2(n-1): n>1$ (1 limit point at
$\infty$ if $n=1$). A corollary is that the total number of images of a point
source produced by an $n$-tuple lens can not exceed $5(n-1):n>1$. We construct
quadruple lenses with distinct finite limit points that can produce up to 15
images and argue why there can not be more than 15 images. We show that the
maximum number of images is bounded from below by $3(n+1): n \ge 3$. We also
comment on "thick Einstein rings" that can have one or more holes.
