An alternative parametrization of the particle shower longitudinal profile is
presented. The accuracy of the obtained shower profile description is about
2-3% for the 0-1500 g/cm^2 atmosphere slant depths and primary H, He,... Fe
nuclei in the 1 PeV-10 EeV energy range. It is shown that the shape of shower
profile depends only on the nucleon energy, whereas the maximum shower size
also depends on the energy of the parental nucleus. Results are based on the
CORSIKA simulated shower profiles and are presented in comparison with the
Gaisser-Hillas parametrization.
