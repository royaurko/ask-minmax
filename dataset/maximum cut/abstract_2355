A formula expressing free cumulants in terms of the Jacobi parameters of the
corresponding orthogonal polynomials is derived. It combines Flajolet's theory
of continued fractions and Lagrange inversion. For the converse we discuss
Gessel-Viennot theory to express Hankel determinants in terms of various
cumulants.
