We discuss the theoretical event rate of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from the
collapse of massive primordial stars. We construct a theoretical model to
calculate the rate and detectability of these GRBs taking into account all
important feedback and recent results from numerical simulations of pristine
gas. We expect to observe a maximum of N $\lesssim$ 0.2 GRBs per year
integrated over at z > 6 with \textit{Swift} and N $\lesssim$ 10 GRBs per year
integrated over at z > 6 with EXIST.
