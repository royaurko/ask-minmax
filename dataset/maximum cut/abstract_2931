Our aim in this paper is to trace some of the surprising and beautiful
connections which are beginning to emerge between a number of apparently
disparate topics: Knot Theory, Categorical Quantum Mechanics, and Logic and
Computation.
  We shall focus in particular on the following two topics:
  - The Temperley-Lieb algebra has always hitherto been presented as a quotient
of some sort: either algebraically by generators and relations as in Jones'
original presentation, or as a diagram algebra modulo planar isotopy as in
Kauffman's presentation. We shall use tools from Geometry of Interaction, a
dynamical interpretation of proofs under Cut Elimination developed as an
off-shoot of Linear Logic, to give a direct description of the Temperley-Lieb
category -- a "fully abstract presentation", in Computer Science terminology.
This also brings something new to the Geometry of Interaction, since we are led
to develop a planar version of it, and to verify that the interpretation of
Cut-Elimination (the "Execution Formula", or "composition by feedback")
preserves planarity.
  - We shall also show how the Temperley-Lieb algebra provides a natural
setting in which computation can be performed diagrammatically as geometric
simplification -- "yanking lines straight". We shall introduce a "planar
lambda-calculus" for this purpose, and show how it can be interpreted in the
Temperley-Lieb category.
