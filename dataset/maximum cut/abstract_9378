Large pulsar frequency glitches are generally interpreted as sudden transfers
of angular momentum between the neutron superfluid permeating the inner crust
and the rest of the star. Despite the absence of viscous drag, the neutron
superfluid is strongly coupled to the crust due to non-dissipative entrainment
effects. These effects are shown to severely limit the maximum amount of
angular momentum that can possibly be transferred during glitches. In
particular, it is found that the glitches observed in the Vela pulsar require
an additional reservoir of angular momentum.
