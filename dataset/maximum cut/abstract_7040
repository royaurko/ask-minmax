We derive a new method to infer from data the out-of-equilibrium alignment
dynamics of collectively moving animal groups, by considering the maximum
entropy distribution consistent with temporal and spatial correlations of
flight direction. When bird neighborhoods evolve rapidly, this dynamical
inference correctly learns the parameters of the model, while a static one
relying only on the spatial correlations fails. When neighbors change slowly
and detailed balance is satisfied, we recover the static procedure. We
demonstrate the validity of the method on simulated data. The approach is
applicable to other systems of active matter.
