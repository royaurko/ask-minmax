In this work, we explore the production of the newly observed charged
charmoniumlike state $Z_c(3900)^\pm$ by the photoproduction process $\gamma
p\to Z_c(3900)^+n$. Our numerical result indicates that the maximum of the
calculated total cross section of $\gamma p\to Z_c(3900)^+n$ can reach up to
the order of $0.1 \mu b$. Furthermore, the Dalitz plot analysis is performed by
considering the Pomeron exchange as the background contribution. This analysis
shows that the $Z_c(3900)^+$ signal can be distinguished from the background
easily and the best energy window of searching for $Z_c(3900)^+$ is
$\sqrt{s}\simeq7$ GeV, which is important information for further experimental
study of $Z_c(3900)^+$ by meson photoproduction.
