We report on sensitive 1.4-GHz VLBI radio observations of the unusually
luminous supernova remnant SNR 4449-1 in the galaxy NGC 4449, which gave us the
first well-resolved image of this object. The remnant's radio morphology
consists of two approximately parallel bright ridges, suggesting similarities
to the barrel shape seen for many older Galactic supernova remnants or possibly
to SN 1987A. The angular extent of the remnant is 65 x 40 mas, corresponding to
(3.7 x 2.3) x 10^{18} (D/3.8 Mpc) cm. We also present a new, high
signal-to-noise optical spectrum. By comparing the remnant's linear size to the
maximum velocities measured from optical lines, as well as using constraints
from historical images, we conclude that the supernova explosion occurred
between ~1905 and 1961, likely around 1940. The age of the remnant is therefore
likely ~70 yr. We find that SNR 4449-1's shock wave is likely still interacting
with the circumstellar rather than interstellar medium.
