We have investigated the effects of tuning the localized surface plasmon
resonances (LSPRs) of silver nanoparticles on the fluorescence intensity,
lifetime, and Raman signal from nearby fluorophores. The presence of a metallic
structure can alter the optical properties of a molecule by increasing the
excitation field, and by modifying radiative and non-radiative decay
mechanisms. By careful choice of experimental parameters we have been able to
decouple these effects. We observe a four-fold increase in fluorescence
enhancement and an almost 30-fold increase in decay rate from arrays of Ag
nanoparticles, when the LSPR is tuned to the emission wavelength of a locally
situated fluorophore. This is consistent with a greatly increased efficiency
for energy transfer from fluorescence to surface plasmons. Additionally,
surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements show a maximum
enhancement occurs when both the incident laser light and the Raman signal are
near resonance with the plasmon energy. Spatial mapping of the SERS signal from
a nanoparticle array reveals highly localized differences in the excitation
field resulting from small differences in the LSPR energy.
