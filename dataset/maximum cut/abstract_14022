Images obtained from coherent illumination processes are contaminated with
speckle noise, with polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imagery as a
prominent example. With an adequacy widely attested in the literature, the
scaled complex Wishart distribution is an acceptable model for PolSAR data. In
this perspective, we derive analytic expressions for the Shannon, R\'enyi, and
restricted Tsallis entropies under this model. Relationships between the
derived measures and the parameters of the scaled Wishart law (i.e., the
equivalent number of looks and the covariance matrix) are discussed. In
addition, we obtain the asymptotic variances of the Shannon and R\'enyi
entropies when replacing distribution parameters by maximum likelihood
estimators. As a consequence, confidence intervals based on these two entropies
are also derived and proposed as new ways of capturing contrast. New hypothesis
tests are additionally proposed using these results, and their performance is
assessed using simulated and real data. In general terms, the test based on the
Shannon entropy outperforms those based on R\'enyi's.
