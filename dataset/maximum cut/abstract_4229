We study the Higgs condensation $H={\bar t}t$ mechanism in the Top-mode
Standard Model at the next-to-leading order in 1/Nc. The calculation includes
the effects of the Goldstone fields, but not the effects of the transverse
components of the electroweak gauge bosons. The resulting effective theory is
parametrized by means of a finite energy cut-off $\L$ at which the condensation
is supposed to take place. Demanding that the next-to-leading order
contributions not dominate over the leading order ones, we get a rather low
bound for the cut-off: $\L = O(1 TeV)$. QCD effects can change the results
somewhat, but the basic conclusions remain unchanged. The inclusion of the
Goldstone degrees of freedom tends to decrease the bound on $\L$.
