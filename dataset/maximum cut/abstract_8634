The current large uncertainty on the extrapolation of the proton-proton total
cross section at the LHC energy will be resolved by the precise measurement by
the TOTEM experiment. Its accurate studies on the basic properties of
proton-proton collisions at the maximum accelerator energy could provide a
significant contribution to the understanding of cosmic ray physics.
