The head-on collision of identical neutron stars from rest at infinity
requires a numerical simulation in full general relativity for a complete
solution. Undaunted, we provide a relativistic, analytic argument to suggest
that during the collision, sufficient thermal pressure is always generated to
support the hot remnant in quasi-static stable equilibrium against collapse
prior to slow cooling via neutrino emission. Our conclusion is independent of
the total mass of the progenitors and holds even if the remnant greatly exceeds
the maximum mass of a cold neutron star.
