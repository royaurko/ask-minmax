In an essential and quite general setup, based on networks, we identify
Schnakenberg's observables as the constraints that prevent a system from
relaxing to equilibrium, showing that, in the linear regime, steady states
satisfy a minimum entropy production principle. The result is applied to master
equation systems, opening a new path to a well-known version of the principle
regarding invariant states. Moreover, with the aid of a simple example, the
principle is shown to conform to Prigogine's original formulation. Finally, we
discuss analogies and differences with a recently proposed maximum entropy
production principle.
