We consider parametric generation of electrostatic waves in the magnetosphere
of the pulsar PSR0531. It is shown that in the framework of this mechanism it
is possible to convert the pulsar rotational energy into the energy of Langmuir
waves. The maximum growth rate is achieved in the "superluminal" area, where
phase velocity of perturbations is exceeding the speed of light. Therefore
electromagnetic waves do not damp on particles. Instead, they create plasmon
condensate, which is carried out, outside of the pulsar magnetosphere and
reaches the Crab nebula. It is shown, that the transfer of the energy of the
plasmon condensate from the light cylinder to the active region of the nebula
happens practically without losses. Unlike the plasma of the magnetosphere, the
one of nebula contains ions, i.e., it may sustain modulation instability, which
leads to the collapse of the Langmuir condensate. Langmuir wave collapse, in
turn, leads to the acceleration of the distribution function particles.
Furthermore, we consider processes leading to the self-trapping of the
synchrotron radiation, resulting in the growth of the radiation intensity,
which manifests itself observationally as a flare. The condition for the
self-trapping onset is derived, showing that if the phenomena takes place at
$~100 MeV$, then it doesn't happen at lower (or higher) energies. This specific
kind of higher/lower energy cutoff could explain why when we observe the flare
at 100 MeV no enhanced emission is observed at lower/higher energies!
