We calculate the off-forward structure function of the pion within a simple
model where the size of the pion is accounted for using a momentum cut-off.
Twist-two and twist-three generalized parton distributions are extracted.
Relations between twist-three and twist-two contributions are obtained, the
origin of which is not kinematical as they differ from those arising from the
Wandzura-Wilczek approximation.
