Screening of initial parton production due to the presence of on-shell
partons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is discussed. It is shown that the
divergent cross sections in the calculation of parton production can be
regulated self-consistently without an {\it ad hoc} cut-off, and that the
resultant parton production and transverse energy production rate are finite.
Consequences on the energy density estimates are discussed.
