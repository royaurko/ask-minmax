Aims. We present optical spectra of the fast recurrent nova U Sco during its
recent outburst, obtained within 24 hr of maximum light. Methods. We use medium
resolution (R~4000) spectra taken with the with the MagE spectrograph on the
Magellan (Clay) 6.5m telescope of the Las Campanas Observatories. Results. The
spectrum is notable for its lack of a low ionization transient heavy element
absorption system that is visible in the large majority of novae near maximum
light. We suggest that this may be due to the dominance of inner Lagrangian L1
mass transfer and the absence of a circumbinary gas reservoir in this object
