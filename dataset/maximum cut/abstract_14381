Silver nanocrystals made by a chemical reduction of silver salts (AgNO$_3$)
by sodium borohydride (NaBH$_4$) were studied using Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM) and light scattering simulations. For various
AgNO$_3$/NaBH$_4$ molar ratios, the size distributions of the nanocrystals were
found to be approximately log-normal. In addition, a linear relation was found
between the mean nanocrystal size and the molar ratio. In order to relate the
size distribution of Ag nanocrystals of the various molar ratios to the
scattering properties of Ag nanocrystals in solar cell devices, light
scattering simulations of Ag nanocrystals in Si, SiO$_2$, SiN, and Al$_2$O$_3$
matrices were carried out using Mie Plot. These light scattering spectra for
the individual nanocrystal sizes were combined into light scattering spectra
for the fitted size distributions. The evolution of these scattering spectra
with respect to an increasing mean nanocrystal size was then studied. From
these findings, it is possible to find the molar ratio for which the
corresponding nanocrystal size distribution has maximum scattering at a
particular wavelength in the desired matrix.
