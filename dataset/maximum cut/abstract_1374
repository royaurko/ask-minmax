We have carried out a comparative statistical study for the displacement of
the Sun from the Galactic plane (z_\odot) following three different methods.
The study has been done using a sample of 537 young open clusters (YOCs) with
log(Age) < 8.5 lying within a heliocentric distance of 4 kpc and 2030 OB stars
observed up to a distance of 1200 pc, all of them have distance information. We
decompose the Gould Belt's member in a statistical sense before investigating
the variation in the z_\odot estimation with different upper cut-off limits in
the heliocentric distance and distance perpendicular to the Galactic plane. We
found z_\odot varies in a range of ~ 13 - 20 pc from the analys is of YOCs and
~ 6 - 18 pc from the OB stars. A significant scatter in the z_\odot obtained
due to different cut-off values is noticed for the OB stars although no such
deviation is seen for the YOCs. We also determined scale heights of
56.9(+3.8)(-3.4} and 61.4(+2.7)(-2.4) pc for the distribution of YOCs and OB
stars respectively.
