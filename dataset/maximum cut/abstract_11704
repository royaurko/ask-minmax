The dynamics of one dimensional iterative maps in the regime of fully
developed chaos is studied in detail. Motivated by the observation of dynamical
structures around the unstable fixed point we introduce the geometrical concept
of a turning point which represents a local minimum or maximum of the
trajectory. Following we investigate the highly organized and structured
distribution of turning points. The turning point dynamics is discussed and the
corresponding turning point map which possesses an appealing asymptotic scaling
property is investigated. Strong correlations are shown to exist for the
turning point trajectories which contain the information of the fixed points as
well as the stability coefficients of the dynamical system. For the more
specialized case of symmetric maps which possess a symmetric density we derive
universal statistical properties of the corresponding turning point dynamics.
Using the turning point concept we finally develop a method for the analysis of
(one dimensional) time series.
