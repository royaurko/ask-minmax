SGR J1745$-$2900 is a magnetar near the Galactic center. X-ray observations
of this source found a decreasing X-ray luminosity accompanied by an enhanced
spindown rate. This negative correlation between X-ray luminosity and spindown
rate is hard to understand. The wind braking model of magnetars is employed to
explain this puzzling spindown behavior. During the release of magnetic energy
of magnetars, a system of particles may be generated. Some of these particles
remain trapped in the magnetosphere and may contribute to the X-ray luminosity.
The rest of the particles can flow out and take away the rotational energy of
the central neutron star. A smaller polar cap angle will cause the decrease of
X-ray luminosity and enhanced spindown rate of SGR J1745$-$2900. This magnetar
is expected to have a maximum spindown rate shortly.
