Differential rates in the decay B^0_s --> Jpsi phi, with phi --> K^+K^- and
Jpsi --> mu^+ mu^- are sensitive to the CP-violation phase beta_s, predicted to
be very small in the standard model. The analysis of B^0_s --> Jpsi phi decays
is also suitable for measuring the B^0_s lifetime, the decay width difference
DeltaGamma_s between the B^0_s mass eigenstates, and the B^0_s oscillation
frequency Delta m even if appreciable CP violation does not occur. In this
paper we present normalized probability densities useful in maximum likelihood
fits, extended to allow for S-wave contributions on one hand and for the
effects of direct CP violation on the other. Our treatment of the S-wave
contributions includes the strong variation of the S-wave/P-wave amplitude
ratio with m(K^+K^-) across the phi resonance, which was not considered in
previous work. We include a scheme for re-normalizing the probability densities
after detector sculpting of the angular distributions of the final state
particles, and conclude with an examination of the symmetries of the rate
formulae, with and without an S-wave contribution. All results are obtained
with the use of a new compact formalism describing the differential decay rate
of B^0_s mesons into Jpsi phi final states.
