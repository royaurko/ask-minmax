Based on archive photographic photometry and recent CCD photometric data for
red novae V4332 Sgr and V838 Mon, we established their stellar composition,
exploded components, and the nature of explosions. Low temperature in the
outburst maximum is due to quasi-adiabatic expansion of a massive stellar
envelope after the central energy surge preceded the outburst.
