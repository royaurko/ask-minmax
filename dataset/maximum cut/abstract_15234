The processes of storage and dissipation of electromagnetic energy in
nanostructures depend on both the material properties and the geometry. In this
paper, the distributions of local energy density and power dissipation in
nanogratings are investigated using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis. It is
demonstrated that the enhancement of absorption is accompanied by the
enhancement of energy storage both for material at the resonance of its
dielectric function described by the classical Lorentz oscillator and for
nanostructures at the resonance induced by its geometric arrangement. The
appearance of strong local electric field in nanogratings at the
geometry-induced resonance is directly related to the maximum electric energy
storage. Analysis of the local energy storage and dissipation can also help
gain a better understanding of the global energy storage and dissipation in
nanostructures for photovoltaic and heat transfer applications.
