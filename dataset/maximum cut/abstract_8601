Some approaches to quantization of the horizon area of black holes are
discussed. The maximum entropy of a quantized surface is demonstrated to be
proportional to the surface area in the classical limit. This result is valid
for a rather general class of approaches to surface quantization. In the case
of rotating black holes no satisfactory solution for the quantization problem
has been found up to now.
