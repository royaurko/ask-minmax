Sanov's Theorem and the Conditional Limit Theorem (CoLT) are established for
a multicolor Polya Eggenberger urn sampling scheme, giving the Polya divergence
and the Polya extension to the Maximum Relative Entropy (MaxEnt) method. Polya
MaxEnt includes the standard MaxEnt as a special case. The universality of
standard MaxEnt - advocated by an axiomatic approach to inference for inverse
problems - is challenged, in favor of a probabilistic approach based on CoLT
and the Maximum Probability principle.
