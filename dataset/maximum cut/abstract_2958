We investigate a mono-Z process as a potential dark matter search strategy at
the LHC. In this channel a single Z boson recoils against missing transverse
momentum, attributed to dark matter particles, $\chi$, which escape the
detector. This search strategy is related, and complementary to, monojet and
monophoton searches. For illustrative purposes we consider the process
$q\bar{q} -> \chi\chi Z$ in a toy dark matter model, where the Z boson is
emitted from either the initial state quarks, or from the internal propagator.
Among the signatures of this process will be a pair of muons with high pT that
reconstruct to the invariant mass of the Z, and large amounts of missing
transverse energy. Being a purely electroweak signal, QCD and other Standard
Model backgrounds are relatively easily removed with modest selection cuts. We
compare the signal to Standard Model backgrounds and demonstrate that, even for
conservative cuts, there exist regions of parameter space where the signal may
be clearly visible above background in future LHC data, allowing either new
discovery potential or the possibility of supplementing information about the
dark sector beyond that available from other observable channels.
