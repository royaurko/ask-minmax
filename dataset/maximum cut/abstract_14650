Moriond 2013 ALTAS data at 125 GeV state appears to exhibit a substantial
excess in the di-photon final state and in the ZZ decaying to four lepton
channel, whereas which are more or less SM-like rate observed by CMS MVA
analysis. We examine the maximum Higgs signal enhancements that can be achieved
in the 2HDM when either a single Higgs or more than one Higgs have mass(es)
near 125 GeV. In general, the constraints of vacuum stability, unitarity and
perturbativity play the key role in restricting possibilities of signal
enhancement. The Type II model allows for an enhancement in the di-photon rate
(relative to the SM) of the order of 2-3 but associated with an even larger ZZ
or too large \tau\tau signal. In contrast, the maximal value of the di-photon
signal in the Type I model can reach the order of 1.3 for which the ZZ signal
is of order 1.
