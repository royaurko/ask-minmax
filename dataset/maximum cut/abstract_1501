We study nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) scattering by applying the $N/D$ method in
chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-next-to-leading (NNLO) order in the
calculation of the imaginary part of the $NN$ partial-wave amplitudes along the
left-hand-cut, which is the dynamical input for this approach. A quite good
reproduction of the Nijmegen partial-wave analysis phase shifts and mixing
angles is obtained, which implies a steady improvement in the accurateness
achieved by increasing the chiral order in the calculation of the dynamical
input. A power counting for the subtraction constants is established, which is
appropriate for those subtractions attached to both the left- and right-hand
cuts. We discuss that it is not necessary to modify the $NN$ chiral potential
at NNLO to agree with data, but instead one should perform the iteration of
two-nucleon intermediate states to finally achieve analytic and unitarity $NN$
partial-wave amplitudes in a well-defined way. We also confirm at NNLO the
long-range correlations between the $NN$ $S$-wave effective ranges and
scattering lengths, when employing only once-subtracted dispersion relations,
that holds up to around 10% when compared with experimental values.
