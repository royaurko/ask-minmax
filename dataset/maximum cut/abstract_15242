We illustrate the role of repulsive interactions in a hadron-resonance gas at
freeze-out and in a gas of quark-gluon bags. Taking into account non-zero size
of particles in hadron gas leads to a significant decrease and shift of the
net-baryon density maximum. The transition point from baryon to meson dominated
matter depends on the difference between baryon and meson radii. We also show
that depending on the properties of the quark-gluon bags one may obtain any
type of the phase transition from hadron gas to quark-gluon plasma: the first
or second order, as well as four types of the crossover.
