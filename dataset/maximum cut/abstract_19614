We report on the detection of very-high energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) gamma-ray
emission from NGC 1275, the central radio galaxy of the Perseus cluster of
galaxies. The source has been detected by the MAGIC telescopes with a
statistical significance of 6.6 sigma above 100 GeV in 46 hr of stereo
observations carried out between August 2010 and February 2011. The measured
differential energy spectrum between 70 GeV and 500 GeV can be described by a
power law with a steep spectral index of \Gamma=-4.1+/-0.7stat+/-0.3syst, and
the average flux above 100 GeV is F_{gamma}=(1.3+/-0.2stat+/-0.3syst) x 10^-11
cm^-2 s^-1. These results, combined with the power-law spectrum measured in the
first two years of observations by the Fermi-LAT above 100 MeV, with a spectral
index of Gamma ~ -2.1, strongly suggest the presence of a break or cut-off
around tens of GeV in the NGC 1275 spectrum. The light curve of the source
above 100 GeV does not show hints of variability on a month time scale.
Finally, we report on the nondetection in the present data of the radio galaxy
IC 310, previously discovered by the Fermi-LAT and MAGIC. The derived flux
upper limit F^{U.L.}_{gamma} (>300 GeV)=1.2 x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1 is a factor ~ 3
lower than the mean flux measured by MAGIC between October 2009 and February
2010, thus confirming the year time-scale variability of the source at VHE.
