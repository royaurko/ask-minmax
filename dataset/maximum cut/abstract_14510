Maxwell-Stefan systems describing the dynamics of the molar concentrations of
a gas mixture with an arbitrary number of components are analyzed in a bounded
domain under isobaric, isothermal conditions. The systems consist of mass
balance equations and equations for the chemical potentials, depending on the
relative velocities, supplemented with initial and homogeneous Neumann boundary
conditions. Global-in-time existence of bounded weak solutions to the
quasilinear parabolic system and their exponential decay to the homogeneous
steady state are proved. The mathematical difficulties are due to the singular
Maxwell-Stefan diffusion matrix, the cross-diffusion coupling, and the lack of
standard maximum principles. Key ideas of the proofs are the Perron-Frobenius
theory for quasi-positive matrices, entropy-dissipation methods, and a new
entropy variable formulation allowing for the proof of nonnegative lower and
upper bounds for the concentrations.
