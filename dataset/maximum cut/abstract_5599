We derive an analytical formula for the covariance $\mathrm{Cov}(A,B)$ of two
smooth linear statistics $A=\sum_i a(\lambda_i)$ and $B=\sum_i b(\lambda_i)$ to
leading order for $N\to\infty$, where $\{\lambda_i\}$ are the $N$ real
eigenvalues of a general one-cut random-matrix model with Dyson index $\beta$.
The formula, carrying the universal $1/\beta$ prefactor, depends on the
random-matrix ensemble only through the edge points $[\lambda_-,\lambda_+]$ of
the limiting spectral density. For $A=B$, we recover in some special cases the
classical variance formulas by Beenakker and Dyson-Mehta, clarifying the
respective ranges of applicability. Some choices of $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ lead to a
striking \emph{decorrelation} of the corresponding linear statistics. We
provide two applications - the joint statistics of conductance and shot noise
in ideal chaotic cavities, and some new fluctuation relations for traces of
powers of random matrices.
