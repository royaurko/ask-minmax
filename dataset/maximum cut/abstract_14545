This is a summary of the talks I gave at Korean Physical Society meeting
(April 26, 2012, Daejeon, Korea) and the 4th Asian Triangle Heavy Ion
Conference (ATHIC) (November 14, 2012, Pusan, Korea). They are based on the
series of work done at Hanyang University in the World Class University III
Program under the theme of "From Dense Matter to Compact Stars." The program
was conceived and executed to understand highly compressed baryonic matter in
anticipation of the forthcoming RIB machine "RAON" which is in construction in
the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Korea. The problems treated ranged
from the origin of the proton mass, topological structure of barynic matter,
chiral symmetry and conformal symmetry to the EoS of nuclear matter and dense
neutron-rich matter and to the maximum mass of neutron stars. The results
obtained are new and intriguing and could have an impact on the novel structure
of dense matter to be probed in the accelerators "RAON," FAIR etc. and in
compact stars.
