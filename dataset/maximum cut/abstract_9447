The observed shift of the core of the relativistic AGN jets as a function of
frequency allows us to evaluate the number density of outflowing plasma and,
hence, the magnetization parameter. New analysis of more than 20 sources shows
that for most of jets the magnetization parameter ~ 10 - 100. Since the
magnetization parameter is the maximum possible bulk Lorentz-factor of the
relativistic flow, this estimate is consistent with the observed superluminal
motion.
