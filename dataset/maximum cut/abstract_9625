A Z-source inverter based grid-interface for a variable-speed wind turbine
connected to a permanent magnet synchronous generator is proposed. A control
system is designed to harvest maximum wind energy under varied wind conditions
with the use of a permanent magnet synchronous generator, a diode-rectifier and
a Z-source inverter. Control systems for speed regulation of the generator and
for DC- and AC- sides of the Z-source inverter are implemented. Laboratory
experiments are used to verify the efficacy of the proposed approach.
