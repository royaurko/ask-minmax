Given data sampled from a number of variables, one is often interested in the
underlying causal relationships in the form of a directed acyclic graph. In the
general case, without interventions on some of the variables it is only
possible to identify the graph up to its Markov equivalence class. However, in
some situations one can find the true causal graph just from observational
data, for example in structural equation models with additive noise and
nonlinear edge functions. Most current methods for achieving this rely on
nonparametric independence tests. One of the problems there is that the null
hypothesis is independence, which is what one would like to get evidence for.
We take a different approach in our work by using a penalized likelihood as a
score for model selection. This is practically feasible in many settings and
has the advantage of yielding a natural ranking of the candidate models. When
making smoothness assumptions on the probability density space, we prove
consistency of the penalized maximum likelihood estimator. We also present
empirical results for simulated scenarios and real two-dimensional data sets
(cause-effect pairs) where we obtain similar results as other state-of-the-art
methods.
