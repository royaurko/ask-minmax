Slow Long Duration Events (SLDEs) are flares characterized by long duration
of rising phase. In many such cases impulsive phase is weak with lack of
typical short-lasting pulses. Instead of that smooth, long-lasting Hard X-ray
(HXR) emission is observed. We analysed hard X-ray emission and morphology of
six selected SLDEs. In our analysis we utilized data from RHESSI and GOES
satellites. Physical parameters of HXR sources were obtained from imaging
spectroscopy and were used for the energy balance analysis. Characteristic time
of heating rate decrease, after reaching its maximum value, is very long, which
explains long rising phase of these flares.
