The pentagram map, introduced by R. Schwartz, is defined by the following
construction: given a polygon as input, draw all of its "shortest" diagonals,
and output the smaller polygon which they cut out. We employ the machinery of
cluster algebras to obtain explicit formulas for the iterates of the pentagram
map.
