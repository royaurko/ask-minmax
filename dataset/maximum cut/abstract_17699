To obtain an electron-density map from a macromolecular crystal the
phase-problem needs to be solved, which often involves the use of heavy-atom
derivative crystals and concomitantly the determination of the heavy atom
substructure. This is customarily done by direct methods or Patterson-based
approaches, which however may fail when only poorly diffracting derivative
crystals are available, as often the case for e.g. membrane proteins. Here we
present an approach for heavy atom site identification based on a Molecular
Replacement Parameter Matrix (MRPM) search. It involves an n-dimensional search
to test a wide spectrum of molecular replacement parameters, such as clusters
of different conformations. The result is scored by the ability to identify
heavy-atom positions, from anomalous difference Fourier maps, that allow
meaningful phases to be determined. The strategy was successfully applied in
the determination of a membrane protein structure, the CopA Cu+-ATPase, when
other methods had failed to resolve the heavy atom substructure. MRPM is
particularly suited for proteins undergoing large conformational changes where
multiple search models should be generated, and it enables the identification
of weak but correct molecular replacement solutions with maximum contrast to
prime experimental phasing efforts.
