We study the latent heat of the liquid-gas phase transition in symmetric
nuclear matter using self-consistent mean-field calculations with a few Skyrme
forces. The temperature dependence of the latent heat is rather independent of
the mean-field parametrization and can be characterized by a few parameters. At
low temperatures, the latent heat tends to the saturation energy. Near the
critical point, the latent heat goes to zero with a well-determined mean-field
critical exponent. A maximum value of the latent heat in the range l ~ 25-30
MeV is found at intermediate temperatures, which might have experimental
relevance. All these features can be explained from very basic principles.
