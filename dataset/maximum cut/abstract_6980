Due to its heavy-tailed and fully parametric form, the multivariate
generalized Gaussian distribution (MGGD) has been receiving much attention for
modeling extreme events in signal and image processing applications.
Considering the estimation issue of the MGGD parameters, the main contribution
of this paper is to prove that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the
scatter matrix exists and is unique up to a scalar factor, for a given shape
parameter \beta\in(0,1). Moreover, an estimation algorithm based on a
Newton-Raphson recursion is proposed for computing the MLE of MGGD parameters.
Various experiments conducted on synthetic and real data are presented to
illustrate the theoretical derivations in terms of number of iterations and
number of samples for different values of the shape parameter. The main
conclusion of this work is that the parameters of MGGDs can be estimated using
the maximum likelihood principle with good performance.
