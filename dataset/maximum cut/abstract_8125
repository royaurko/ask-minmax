We report on the analysis of the data collected by Swift, INTEGRAL and RXTE
of the Black Hole Candidate (BHC) 4U 1630-47 during 3 consecutive outbursts
occurred in 2006, 2008 and 2010, respectively. We show that, although a similar
spectral and temporal behaviour in the energy range between 2-10 keV, these 3
outbursts present pronounced differences above 20 keV. In fact, the 2010
outburst extends at high energies without any detectable cut-off until 150-200
keV, while the other two previous outbursts, occurred on 2006 and 2008, are not
detected at all above 20 keV. Moreover, the 2008 outburst does not show any
detectable hard state in its final phases and even during the 2010 outburst,
the final hard state shows some peculiarities rarely observed in other BHC. We
also investigate on the peculiar huge variation of 4U 1630-47 hydrogen column
density (N$_{H}$) reported in the literature using the Swift/XRT data. In fact
this instrument is one of the most suitable for this purpose thanks to its
lower energy coverage.
