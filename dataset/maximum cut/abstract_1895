We consider the effect of radiative corrections on the maximum velocity of
propagation of neutral scalar fields in a uniform electromagnetic field. The
propagator of neutral scalar fields interacting with charged fields depends on
the electromagnetic field through charged particle loops. The kinetic terms of
the scalar fields are corrected and the maximum velocity of the scalar particle
becomes greater or less than unity. We show that the maximum velocity becomes
greater than unity in a simple example, a neutral scalar field coupled with two
charged Dirac fields by Yukawa interaction. The maximum velocity depends on the
frame of reference and causality is not violated. We discuss the possibility of
this superluminal propagation in the Standard Model.
