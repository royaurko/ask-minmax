Compact astrophysical objects are a window for the study of strongly
interacting nuclear matter given the conditions in their interiors, which are
not reproduced in a laboratory environment. Much has been debated about their
composition with possibilities ranging from a simple mixture of mostly protons
and neutrons to deconfined quark matter. Recent observations on the mass of two
pulsars, PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348+0432, have posed a great restriction on
their composition, since the equation of state must be hard enough to support
masses of about at least two solar masses. The onset of quarks tends to soften
the equation of state, but it can get substantially stiffer since in the
high-dense medium a repulsive vector interaction channel is opened.
Nevertheless, we show that once gluon effects are considered, the equation of
state of quark matter in the color-flavor-locked phase of color
superconductivity becomes softer decreasing the maximum stellar mass that can
be reached when not considering their influence. This may indicate that stars
made entirely of color superconducting matter can only be favored to describe
compact stars if the repulsive vector constant is high enough.
