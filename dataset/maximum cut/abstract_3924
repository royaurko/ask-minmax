We present the results from both the timing and spectroscopic analysis of the
transient X-ray pulsar GS 1843+00 observed by the BeppoSAX satellite on 1997
April 4, when the source was at a luminosity of ~10^{37} erg s^{-1}. GS 1843+00
shows a very hard spectrum that is well fitted by an absorbed power law (N_H
\~2.3 10^{22} cm^{-2}) modified by a high energy cut-off above 6 keV. The
source shows a small pulse amplitude in the whole energy band. The pulse
profile evolves with energy from a double-peaked to single-peaked shape. The
barycentric pulse period is 29.477+/-0.001 s.
