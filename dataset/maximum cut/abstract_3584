We establish Maximum Principles which apply to vectorial approximate
minimizers of the general integral functional of Calculus of Variations. Our
main result is a version of the Convex Hull Property.
  The primary advance compared to results already existing in the literature is
that we have dropped the quasiconvexity assumption of the integrand in the
gradient term. The lack of weak Lower Semicontinuity is compensated by
introducing a nonlinear convergence technique, based on the approximation of
the projection onto a convex set by reflections and on the invariance of the
integrand in the gradient term under the Orthogonal Group.
  Maximum Principles are implied for the relaxed solution in the case of
non-existence of minimizers and for minimizing solutions of the Euler-Lagrange
system of PDE.
