We investigate experimentally and theoretically the third harmonic generated
by a double-layer fishnet metamaterial. To unambiguously disclose most notably
the influence of the magnetic resonance, the generated third harmonic was
measured as a function of the angle of incidence. It is shown experimentally
and numerically that when the magnetic resonance is excited by pump beam, the
angular dependence of the third harmonic signal has a local maximum at an
incidence angle of {\theta} \simeq 20{\deg}. This maximum is shown to be a
fingerprint of the antisymmetric distribution of currents in the gold layers.
An analytical model based on the nonlinear dynamics of the electrons inside the
gold shows excellent agreement with experimental and numerical results. This
clearly indicates the difference in the third harmonic angular pattern at
electric and magnetic resonances of the metamaterial.
