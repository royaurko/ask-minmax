In this paper, we focus on statistical region-based active contour models
where image features (e.g. intensity) are random variables whose distribution
belongs to some parametric family (e.g. exponential) rather than confining
ourselves to the special Gaussian case. Using shape derivation tools, our
effort focuses on constructing a general expression for the derivative of the
energy (with respect to a domain) and derive the corresponding evolution speed.
A general result is stated within the framework of multi-parameter exponential
family. More particularly, when using Maximum Likelihood estimators, the
evolution speed has a closed-form expression that depends simply on the
probability density function, while complicating additive terms appear when
using other estimators, e.g. moments method. Experimental results on both
synthesized and real images demonstrate the applicability of our approach.
