We have performed several high pressure electrical resistance experiments on
Bi1.98Sr2.06Y0.68Cu2O8, an insulating parent compound of the high-Tc Bi2212
family of copper oxide superconductors. We find a resistive anomaly, a downturn
at low temperature, that onsets with applied pressure in the 20-40 kbar range.
Through both resistance and magnetoresistance measurements, we identify this
anomaly as a signature of induced superconductivity. Resistance to higher
pressures decreases Tc, giving a maximum of 10 K. The higher pressure
measurements exhibit a strong sensitivity to the hydrostaticity of the pressure
environment. We make comparisons to the pressure induced superconductivity now
ubiquitous in the iron arsenides.
