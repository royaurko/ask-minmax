The {\em rainbow vertex-connection number}, $rvc(G)$, of a connected graph
$G$ is the minimum number of colors needed to color its vertices such that
every pair of vertices is connected by at least one path whose internal
vertices have distinct colors. In this paper we first determine the rainbow
vertex-connection number of cycle $C_n$ of order $n\geq 3$, and then, based on
it, prove that for any 2-connected graph $G$, $rvc(G)\leq rvc(C_n)$, giving a
tight upper bound for the rainbow vertex-connection. As a consequence, we show
that for a connected graph $G$ with a block decomposition $B_1, B_2, ..., B_k$
and $t$ cut vertices, $rvc(G)\leq rvc(B_1)+rvc(B_2)+ ... +rvc(B_k)+t$.
