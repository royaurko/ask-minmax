With an increasing number of vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control
(ACC), the impact of such vehicles on the collective dynamics of traffic flow
becomes relevant. By means of simulation, we investigate the influence of
variable percentages of ACC vehicles on traffic flow characteristics. For
simulating the ACC vehicles, we propose a new car-following model that also
serves as basis of an ACC implementation in real cars. The model is based on
the Intelligent Driver Model [Treiber et al., Physical Review E 62, 1805
(2000)] and inherits its intuitive behavioural parameters: desired velocity,
acceleration, comfortable deceleration, and desired minimum time headway. It
eliminates, however, the sometimes unrealistic behaviour of the Intelligent
Driver Model in cut-in situations with ensuing small gaps that regularly are
caused by lane changes of other vehicles in dense or congested traffic. We
simulate the influence of different ACC strategies on the maximum capacity
before breakdown, and the (dynamic) bottleneck capacity after breakdown. With a
suitable strategy, we find sensitivities of the order of 0.3, i.e., 1% more ACC
vehicles will lead to an increase of the capacities by about 0.3%. This
sensitivity multiplies when considering travel times at actual breakdowns.
