Global fits for precision determinations of parton distributions, together
with the highly correlated strong coupling $\alpha_s$, are presented up to
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) of QCD utilizing most world data (charm
and jet production data are used where theoretically possible), except TeVatron
gauge boson production data and LHC data which are left for genuine
predictions. This is done within the `dynamical' (valencelike input at
$Q_0^2=0.8$ GeV$^2$) and `standard' (input at $Q_0^2=2$ GeV$^2$) approach. The
stability and reliability of the results are ensured by including
nonperturbative higher-twist terms, nuclear corrections as well as target mass
corrections, and by applying various ($Q^2,W^2$) cuts on available data. In
addition, the $Q_0^2$ dependence of the results is studied in detail.
Predictions are given, in particular for LHC, on gauge and Higgs boson as well
as for top-quark pair production. At NNLO the dynamical approach results in
$\alpha_s(M_Z^2)=0.1136\pm0.0004$, whereas the somewhat less constrained
standard fit gives $\alpha_s(M_Z^2)=0.1162\pm0.0006$.
