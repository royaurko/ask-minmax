Max stable laws are limit laws of linearly normalized partial maxima of
independent identically distributed random variables. Saeb (2014) proves that
the Renyi entropy of order b (b > 1) of linear normalized maximum of iid random
variables with continuous differentiable density is convergent to the Renyi
entropy of order b of the max stable laws. In this paper, we study the rate of
convergence result for Renyi entropy for linearly normalized partial maxima.
