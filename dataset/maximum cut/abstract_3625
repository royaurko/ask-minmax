We simulate the central reactions of nearly symmetric, and asymmetric
systems, for the energies at which the maximum production of IMFs occurs
(E$_{c.m.}^{peak}$).This study is carried out by using hard EOS along with
cugnon cross section and employing MSTB method for clusterization. The mass
dependence of various quantities (such as average and maximum central density,
collision dynamics as well as the time zone for hot and dense nuclear matter)
is also presented. In all cases (i.e., average and maximum central density,
collision dynamics as well as the time zone for hot and dense nuclear matter) a
power law dependence is obtained.
