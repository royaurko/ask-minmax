We analyzed the results of non-linear resistive magnetohydrodynamical (MHD)
simulations of jet formation to study the acceleration mechanism of
axisymmetric, resistive MHD jets. The initial state is a constant angular
momentum, polytropic torus threaded by weak uniform vertical magnetic fields.
The time evolution of the torus is simulated by applying the CIP-MOCCT scheme
extended for resistive MHD equations. We carried out simulations up to 50
rotation period at the innermost radius of the disk created by accretion from
the torus. The acceleration forces and the characteristics of resistive jets
were studied by computing forces acting on Lagrangian test particles. Since the
angle between the rotation axis of the disk and magnetic field lines is smaller
in resistive models than in ideal MHD models, magnetocentrifugal acceleration
is smaller. The effective potential along a magnetic field line has maximum
around $z \sim 0.5r_0$ in resistive models, where $r_0$ is the radius where the
density of the initial torus is maximum. Jets are launched after the disk
material is lifted to this height by pressure gradient force. Even in this
case, the main acceleration force around the slow magnetosonic point is the
magnetocentrifugal force. The power of the resistive MHD jet is comparable to
the mechanical energy liberated in the disk by mass accretion. Joule heating is
not essential for the formation of jets.
