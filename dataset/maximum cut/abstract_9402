In this paper, we study the existence and uniqueness of traveling wave
solution for the accelerated Frenkel-Kontorova model. This model consists in a
system of ODE that describes the motion particles in interaction. The most
important applications we have in mind is the motion of crystal defects called
dislocations. For this model, we prove the existence of traveling wave
solutions under very weak assumptions. The uniqueness of the velocity is also
studied as well as the uniqueness of the profile which used different types of
strong maximum principle. As far as we know, this is the first result
concerning traveling waves for accelerated, spatially discrete system.
