A sample of 70 magnetically active stars toward the Taurus-Auriga
star-forming region has been investigated. The positions of the sample stars on
the Rossby diagram have been analyzed. All stars are shown to be in the regime
of a saturated dynamo, where the X-ray luminosity reaches its maximum and does
not depend on the Rossby number. A correlation has been found between the
lithium line equivalent width and the age of a solar-mass (from 0.7 to 1.2
Msun) pre-main-sequence star. The older the age, the smaller the Li line
equivalent width. Analysis of the long-term photometric variability of these
stars has shown that the photometric activity of the youngest stars is
appreciably higher than that of the older objects from the sample. This result
can be an indirect confirmation of the evolution of the magnetic field in
pre-main-sequence stars from predominantly dipole and axisymmetric to multipole
and nonaxisymmetric.
