We present a new fast method for simulating pencil-beam type light-cones,
using the MLAPM-code (Multi Level Adaptive Particle Mesh) with light-cone
additions. We show that by a careful choice of the light-cone orientation, it
is possible to avoid extra periodicities in the light-cone. As an example, we
apply the method to simulate a 6 Gpc deep light-cone, create the dark matter
halo catalogue for the light-cone and study the evolution of haloes from $z=6$
up to the present time. We determine the spatial density of the haloes, their
large-scale correlation function, and study the evolution of the mass function.
We find a surprisingly simple relation for the dependence of halo maximum mass
on redshift, and apply it to derive redshift limits for bright quasars.
