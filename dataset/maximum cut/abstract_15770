In 1993-1994 a series of observations of the X-ray pulsar GX 301-2 by HEXE
onboard Mir-Kvant was made. A period of pulsations was measured (it varied
between 675 and 678 s) and pulse profiles in different energy bands were
produced. The measured luminosity in the 20-100 keV energy range changed
substantially between 8x10^34 and 7x10^35 d^2 erg/s (d is the distance to the
source in kpc). The obtained spectrum is quite satisfactory described by the
canonical model for X-ray pulsars with gamma=1.3, E_c~23 keV, E_f~9 keV. It
changed weakly between the observations, but was softest at brightness maximum.
Significant variations of the spectral hardness over the pulse phase were
detected, but the accumulated data are insufficient to quantify variations in
spectral parameters. No significant traces of cyclotron lines were found. An
interpretation of the pulse profiles as superposition of emissions from two
flat polar caps (with inclusion of gravitational lensing) leads to an estimate
of the angle between the magnetic axis and axis of rotation of 40-70 deg and an
angle between the direction to the observer and the rotation axis of 75-85 deg.
