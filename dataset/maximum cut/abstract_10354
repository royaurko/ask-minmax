Models without an explicit time dependence, called singular models, are
widely used for fitting the distribution of temperatures at which water
droplets freeze. In 1950 Levine developed the original singular model. His key
assumption was that each droplet contained many nucleation sites, and that
freezing occurred due to the nucleation site with the highest freezing
temperature. The fact that freezing occurs due to the maximum value out of
large number of nucleation temperatures, means that we can apply the results of
what is called extreme-value statistics. This is the statistics of the extreme,
i.e., maximum or minimum, value of a large number of random variables. Here we
use the results of extreme-value statistics to show that we can generalise
Levine's model to produce the most general singular model possible. We show
that when a singular model is a good approximation, the distribution of
freezing temperatures should always be given by what is called the generalised
extreme-value distribution. In addition, we also show that the distribution of
freezing temperatures for droplets of onesize, can be used to make predictions
for the scaling of the median nucleation temperature with droplet size, and
vice versa.
