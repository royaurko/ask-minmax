Current-voltage characteristics of top seeded melt-textured YBa2Cu3O7-d are
presented. The samples were cut out of centimetric monoliths. Films
characteristics were also measured on microbridges patterned on thin films
grown by dc sputtering. For both types of samples, a quasi-discontinuity or
quenching was observed for a current density J* several times the critical
current density Jc. Though films and bulks much differ in their magnitude of
both Jc and J*, a proposal is made as to a common intrinsic origin of the
quenching phenomenon. The unique temperature dependence observed for the ratio
J*/Jc, as well as the explanation of the pre-quenching regime in terms of a
single dissipation model lend support to our proposal.
