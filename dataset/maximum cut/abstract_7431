We look at the high-lying eigenstates (from the 10,001st to the 13,000th) in
the Robnik billiard (defined as a quadratic conformal map of the unit disk)
with the shape parameter $\lambda=0.15$. All the 3,000 eigenstates have been
numerically calculated and examined in the configuration space and in the phase
space which - in comparison with the classical phase space - enabled a clear
cut classification of energy levels into regular and irregular. This is the
first successful separation of energy levels based on purely dynamical rather
than special geometrical symmetry properties. We calculate the fractional
measure of regular levels as $\rho_1=0.365\pm 0.01$ which is in remarkable
agreement with the classical estimate $\rho_1=0.360\pm 0.001$. This finding
confirms the Percival's (1973) classification scheme, the assumption in
Berry-Robnik (1984) theory and the rigorous result by Lazutkin (1981,1991). The
regular levels obey the Poissonian statistics quite well whereas the irregular
sequence exhibits the fractional power law level repulsion and globally
Brody-like statistics with $\beta = 0.286\pm0.001$. This is due to the strong
localization of irregular eigenstates in the classically chaotic regions.
Therefore in the entire spectrum we see that the Berry-Robnik regime is not yet
fully established so that the level spacing distribution is correctly captured
by the Berry-Robnik-Brody distribution (Prosen and Robnik 1994).
