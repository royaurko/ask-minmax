Recently Elkin and Solomon gave a construction of spanners for doubling
metrics that has constant maximum degree, hop-diameter O(log n) and lightness
O(log n) (i.e., weight O(log n)w(MST). This resolves a long standing conjecture
proposed by Arya et al. in a seminal STOC 1995 paper.
  However, Elkin and Solomon's spanner construction is extremely complicated;
we offer a simple alternative construction that is very intuitive and is based
on the standard technique of net tree with cross edges. Indeed, our approach
can be readily applied to our previous construction of k-fault tolerant
spanners (ICALP 2012) to achieve k-fault tolerance, maximum degree O(k^2),
hop-diameter O(log n) and lightness O(k^3 log n).
