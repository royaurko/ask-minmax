At present paper we performed a detailed numerical analysis of four charged
leptons photoproduction in frame of standard theory of electroweak interaction.
Total and differential cross sections are obtained by using of the Monte-Carlo
method of numerical integration. Different energies of initial photons (60-2000
GeV in c.m.s.), definite and averaged spin states of interacting particles and
fixed kinematical cuts are considered.
