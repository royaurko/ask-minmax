The coordinate Bethe ansatz solutions of the XXZ model for a one-dimensional
spin-1/2 chain are analyzed with focus on the statistical properties of the
constituent quasiparticles. Emphasis is given to the special cases known as XX,
XXX, and Ising models, where considerable simplifications occur. The XXZ
spectrum can be generated from separate pseudovacua as configurations of sets
of quasiparticles with different exclusion statistics. These sets are
complementary in the sense that the pseudovacuum of one set contains the
maximum number of particles from the other set. The Bethe ansatz string
solutions of the XXX model evolve differently in the planar and axial regimes.
In the Ising limit they become ferromagnetic domains with integer-valued
exclusion statistics. In the XX limit they brake apart into hard-core bosons
with (effectively) fermionic statistics. Two sets of quasiparticles with spin
1/2 and fractional statistics are distinguished, where one set (spinons)
generates the XXZ spectrum from the unique, critical ground state realized in
the planar regime, and the other set (solitons) generates the same spectrum
from the twofold, antiferromagnetically ordered ground state realized in the
axial regime. In the Ising limit, the solitons become antiferromagnetic domain
walls.
