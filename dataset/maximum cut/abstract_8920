We propose a simple scheme, in which only one atom couples to a cavity field,
to entangle two two-level atoms. We connect two atoms with dipole-dipole
interaction since one of them can move around the cavity. The results show that
the peak entanglment does not depend on dipole-dipole interaction strength but
on field density at a certain controlling time. So the field density can act as
a switch for maximum entanglement (ME) generation.
