We report the results from a deep Suzaku observation of 4C 50.55 (IGR J
21247+5058), the brightest broad-line radio galaxy in the hard X-ray (> 10 keV)
sky. The simultaneous broad band spectra over 1-60 keV can be represented by a
cut-off power law with two layers of absorption and a significant reflection
component from cold matter with a solid angle of \Omega/2\pi \approx 0.2. A
rapid flux rise by ~ 20% over 2 \times 10^4 sec is detected in the 2-10 keV
band. The spectral energy distribution suggests that there is little
contribution to the total X-ray emission from jets. Applying a thermal
Comptonization model, we find that corona is optically thick (\tau_e \approx 3)
and has a relatively low temperature (kT_e \approx 30 keV). The narrow iron-K
emission line is consistent with a picture where the standard disk is truncated
and/or its inner part is covered by optically thick Comptonizing corona
smearing out relativistic broad line features. The inferred disk structure may
be a common feature of accretion flows onto black holes that produce powerful
jets.
