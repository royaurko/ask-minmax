Through a careful modeling of interactions, collisions, and the catalytic
behavior, one can obtain important information about the initial stage of
growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), where a state-of-the-art
semi-empirical Hamiltonian [Phys. Rev. B, 74, 155408 (2006)] is used to model
the interaction between carbon atoms. The metal catalyst forming a
supersaturated metal-alloy droplet is represented by a jellium, and the effect
of collisions between the carbon atoms and the catalyst is captured by charge
transfers between the jellium and the carbon. Starting from carbon clusters in
different initial configurations (e.g., random structures, cage structures,
bulk-cut spherical clusters, etc.), we anneal them to different temperatures.
These simulations are performed with clusters placed in the jellium as well as
in vacuum. We find that, in the presence of jellium, and for an optimal charge
transfer of ~ 0.1 e-0.2 e, open cage structures (and some elongated cage
structures) are formed, which may be viewed as precursors to the growth of
SWCNTs. We will also discuss the implications of a spherical boundary on the
nucleation of a SWCNT.
