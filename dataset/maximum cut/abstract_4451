We study the implications of the index theorem and chiral Jacobian in lattice
gauge theory, which have been formulated by Hasenfratz, Laliena and Niedermayer
and by L\"{u}scher, on the continuum formulation of the chiral Jacobian and
anomaly. We take a continuum limit of the lattice Jacobian factor without
referring to perturbative expansion and recover the result of continuum theory
by using only the general properties of the lattice Dirac operator. This
procedure is based on a set of well-defined rules and thus provides an
alternative approach to the conventional analysis of the chiral Jacobian and
related anomaly in continuum theory. By using an explicit form of the lattice
Dirac operator introduced by Neuberger, which satisfies the Ginsparg-Wilson
relation, we illustrate our calculation in some detail. We also briefly comment
on the index theorem with a finite cut-off from the present viewpoint.
