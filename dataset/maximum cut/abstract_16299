We have measured the temperature dependence of the in-plane London
penetration depth lambda(T) and the maximum Josephson current Ic(T) using
bicrystal grain boundary Josephson junctions of the electron-doped cuprate
superconductor Nd(1.85)Ce(0.15)CuO(4-y). Both quantities reveal an anomalous
temperature dependence below about 4 K. In contrast to the usual monotonous
decrease (increase) of lambda(T) (Ic(T)) with decreasing temperature, lambda(T)
and Ic(T) are found to increase and decrease, respectively, with decreasing
temperature below 4 K resulting in a non-monotonous overall temperature
dependence. This anomalous behavior was found to be absent in analogous
measurements performed on Pr(1.85)Ce(0.15)CuO(4-y). From this we conclude that
the anomalous behavior of Nd(1.85)Ce(0.15)CuO(4-y) is caused by the presence of
the Nd3+ paramagnetic moments. Correcting the measured lambda(T) dependence of
Nd(1.85)Ce(0.15)CuO(4-y) for the temperature dependent susceptibility due to
the Nd moments, an exponential dependence is obtained indicating isotropic
s-wave pairing. This result is fully consistent with the lambda(T) dependence
measured for Pr(1.85)Ce(0.15)CuO(4-y).
