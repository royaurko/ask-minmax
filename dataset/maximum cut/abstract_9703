We investigate canonical factorizations of ordered functors of ordered
groupoids through star-surjective functors. Our main construction is a quotient
ordered groupoid, depending on an ordered version of the notion of normal
subgroupoid, that results is the factorization of an ordered functor as a
star-surjective functor followed by a star-injective functor. Any
star-injective functor possesses a universal factorization through a covering,
by Ehresmann's Maximum Enlargement Theorem. We also show that any ordered
functor has a canonical factorization through a functor with the ordered
homotopy lifting property.
