A new design is proposed for large (up to 6-m) liquid mirror containers. The
design uses Kevlar, foam and aluminum, as in previous designs, but with a
different configuration that makes the container lighter, stronger and more
rigid. The results of finite element analysis are presented, consisting in the
deformations due to temperature changes and to weight, and in the security
factor for each material when maximum constraints are applied. Tilt rigidity is
also analyzed. They show that the composite material construction technique
gives a good performance up to 6 meter diameters. The figures and tables
contained in this paper can be used as recipes to build containers having
diameters between 2 and 6 meters.
