We introduce a search technique that is sensitive to a broad class of signals
with large final state multiplicities. Events are clustered into large radius
jets and jet substructure techniques are used to count the number of subjets
within each jet. The search consists of a cut on the total number of subjets in
the event as well as the summed jet mass and missing energy. Two different
techniques for counting subjets are described and expected sensitivities are
presented for eight benchmark signals. These signals exhibit diverse
phenomenology, including 2-step cascade decays, direct three body decays, and
multi-top final states. We find improved sensitivity to these signals as
compared to previous high multiplicity searches as well as a reduced reliance
on missing energy requirements. One benefit of this approach is that it allows
for natural data driven estimates of the QCD background.
