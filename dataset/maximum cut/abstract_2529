A numerical algorithm is used to solve the bare and the effective potential
for the scalar $\phi^4$ model in the local potential approximation. An
approximate dynamical Maxwell-cut is found which reveals itself in the
degeneracy of the action for modes at some scale. This result indicates that
the potential develop singular field dependence as far as one can see it by an
lgorithm of limited numerical accuracy
