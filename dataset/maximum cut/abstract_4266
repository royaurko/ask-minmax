We investigate the contribution of technicolor mechanisms to the production
of single top quarks at hadron colliders. Technipions with mass larger than the
top mass will decay predominantly to a top quark plus a bottom antiquark. We
investigate two promising sub-processes: technipion plus W-boson via
gluon-gluon fusion and technipion plus quark production via quark gluon
interaction. The decay chain of technipion to top plus bottom quarks and then
top to W plus bottom yields final states for the two subprocesses with,
respectively, two W's and two bottom quarks and one W, two bottom quarks and a
light quark. We calculate the total cross sections and the $p_{T}$
distributions for these technipion production mechanisms at Tevatron and LHC
energies for a range of technipion masses, starting at 200 GeV. We study the
backgrounds to our processes and the kinematic cuts that enhance the signal to
background ratio and we report event rate estimates for the upgraded Tevatron
and the LHC. Only the LHC has the potential to observe these processes.
