The distribution of bar strengths in disk galaxies is a fundamental property
of the galaxy population that has only begun to be explored. We have applied
the bar/spiral separation method of Buta, Block, and Knapen to derive the
distribution of maximum relative gravitational bar torques, Q_b, for 147 spiral
galaxies in the statistically well-defined Ohio State University Bright Galaxy
Survey (OSUBGS) sample. Our goal is to examine the properties of bars as
independently as possible of their associated spirals. We find that the
distribution of bar strength declines smoothly with increasing Q_b, with more
than 40% of the sample having Q_b <= 0.1. In the context of recurrent bar
formation, this suggests that strongly-barred states are relatively short-lived
compared to weakly-barred or non-barred states. We do not find compelling
evidence for a bimodal distribution of bar strengths. Instead, the distribution
is fairly smooth in the range 0.0 <= Q_b < 0.8. Our analysis also provides a
first look at spiral strengths Q_s in the OSU sample, based on the same torque
indicator. We are able to verify a possible weak correlation between Q_s and
Q_b, in the sense that galaxies with the strongest bars tend also to have
strong spirals.
