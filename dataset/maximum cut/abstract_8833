We perform molecular dynamics simulations to assess the screening effects by
bound target electrons in low energy nuclear reactions in laboratories. Quantum
effects corresponding to the Pauli and Heisenberg principle are enforced by
constraints. We show that the enhancement of the average cross section and of
its variance is due to the perturbations induced by the electrons.This gives a
correlation between the maximum amplitudes of the inter-nuclear oscillational
motion and the enhancement factor. It suggests that the chaotic behavior of the
electronic motion affects the magnitude of the enhancement factor.
