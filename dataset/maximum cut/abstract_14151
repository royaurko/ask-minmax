Area of classifying satellite imagery has become a challenging task in
current era where there is tremendous growth in settlement i.e. construction of
buildings, roads, bridges, dam etc. This paper suggests an improvised k-means
and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier for land-cover mapping of
Eastern Himalayan state Sikkim. The improvised k-means algorithm shows
satisfactory results compared to existing methods that includes k-Nearest
Neighbor and maximum likelihood classifier. The strength of the Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) classifier lies in the fact that they are fast and have
good recognition rate and it's capability of self-learning compared to other
classification algorithms has made it widely accepted. Classifier based on ANN
shows satisfactory and accurate result in comparison with the classical method.
