A very complex vision system is developed to detect luminosity variations
connected with the discovery of new planets in the Universe. The traditional
imaging system can not manage a so large load. A private net is implemented to
perform an automatic vision and decision architecture. It lets to carry out an
on-line discrimination of interesting events by using two levels of triggers.
This system can even manage many Tbytes of data per day. The architecture
avails itself of a distributed parallel network system based on a maximum of
256 standard workstations with Microsoft Window as OS.
