The star HD 51844 was observed in CoRoT LRa02 as a Seismo target which turned
out to be an SB2 system. The 117 days long light curve revealed delta Scuti
pulsation in the range of 6 to 15 d^{-1} where four frequencies have amplitudes
larger than 1.4 mmag and a rich frequency spectrum with amplitudes lower than
0.6 mmag. Additionally, the light curve exhibits a brightening event recurring
every 33.5 days with a maximum of 3 mmag and a duration of about 5 days. Thus,
this star can be considered as a heartbeat candidate. The radial velocities
from spectroscopy confirmed an eccentric binary system with nearly identical
masses and physical parameters. The brightening event of the light curve
coincides with the maximum radial velocity separation showing that the
brightening is in fact caused by tidal distortion and/or reflected light. One
component displays large line profile variations, while the other does not show
significant variation. The frequency analysis revealed a quintuplet structure
of the four highest-amplitude frequencies, which is due to the orbital motion
of the pulsating star.
