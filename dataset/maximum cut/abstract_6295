Within an electric circuit description of extragalactic jets temporal
variations of the electric currents are associated with finite collisionless
conductivities and consequently magnetic-field aligned electric fields
$E_\parallel$. The maximum field strengths depend on the efficiency of the jet
MHD generator $E_\perp$ and the local conversion to the $E_\parallel$
component. The hadronic jet constituents can efficiently be accelerated in such
fields all along the jets. To estimate the maximum energy the accelerated jet
hadrons can achieve we consider energy loss processes as photon-pion and pair
production as well as synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation. It turns out
that for the strongest $E_\parallel$ possible the Centaurus A jet is a most
promising candidate for the source of the highest energy component of cosmic
rays.
