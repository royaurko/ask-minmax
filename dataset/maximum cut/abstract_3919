Simultaneous X-ray (BeppoSAX, 0.1-300 keV) and radio (Ryle Telescope, 15 GHz)
observations of the superluminal galactic source GRS 1915+105 in high flux
state were carried out starting October 1996. Here we present the simultaneous
radio/X-ray light curves of the flare event and the spectral and timing
analysis of the relevant BeppoSAX data. We obtain evidence for a temporary
disappearance and subsequent restoring of the inner portion of the accretion
disk during the flare from the spectral analysis of the X-ray data. We find a
variable power law photon index positively correlated to the variability of the
exponential cut-off energy. In addition, frequency and intensity variations of
a $\sim$4-5~Hz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) are detected during the same
time interval. The centroid frequency of the QPO is found to be correlated to
the spectral power law photon index, and to the X-ray flux from the disk and
the high energy flux from the power law. These observational results are
discussed in the framework of the disk-instability model proposed for this
source.
