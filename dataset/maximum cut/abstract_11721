A high-temperature YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-x} bulk ceramic superconductor with
composite structure has revealed weak shielding properties against
gravitational force while in a levitating state at temperatures below 70 K. A
toroidal disk was prepared using conventional ceramic technology in combination
with melt-texture growth. Two solenoids were placed around the disk in order to
initiate the current inside it and to rotate the disk about its central axis.
Samples placed over the rotating disk initially demonstrated a weight loss of
0.3-0.5%. When the rotation speed was slowly reduced by changing the current in
the solenoids, the shielding effect became considerably higher and reached
1.9-2.1% at maximum.
