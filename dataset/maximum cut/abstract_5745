The production of forward jets separated by a large rapidity gap at LHC, the
so-called Mueller-Navelet jets, is a fundamental testfield for perturbative QCD
in the high-energy limit. Several analyses have already provided with evidence
about the compatibility of theoretical predictions, based on collinear
factorization and BFKL resummation of energy logarithms in the next-to-leading
approximation, with the CMS experimental data at 7 TeV of center-of-mass
energy. However, the question if the same data can be described also by
fixed-order perturbative approaches has not been yet fully answered. In this
paper we provide numerical evidence that the mere use of partially asymmetric
cuts in the transverse momenta of the detected jets allows a clear separation
between BFKL-resummed and fixed-order predictions in some observables related
with the Mueller-Navelet jet production process.
