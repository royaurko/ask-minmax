The maximum entropy technique (MENT) is used to determine the distribution
functions of physical values. MENT naturally combines required maximum entropy,
the properties of a system and connection conditions in the form of
restrictions imposed on the system. It can, therefore, be employed to
statistically describe closed and open systems. Examples in which MENT is used
to describe equilibrium and non-equilibrium states, as well as steady states
that are far from being in thermodynamic equilibrium, are discussed.
