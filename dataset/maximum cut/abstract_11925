We describe experiments where 2D atomic hydrogen gas is compressed thermally
at a small "cold spot" on the surface of superfluid helium and detected
directly with electron-spin resonance. We reach surface densities up to 5e12
1/cm^2 at temperatures of approximately 100 mK corresponding to the maximum 2D
phase-space density of about 1.5. By independent measurements of the surface
density and its decay rate we make the first direct determination of the
three-body recombination rate constant and get the value of 2e-25 cm^4/s for
its upper bound, which is an order of magnitude smaller than previously
reported experimental results.
