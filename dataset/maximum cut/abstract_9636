We discuss the error analysis of linear interpolation on triangular elements.
We claim that the circumradius condition is more essential then the well-known
maximum angle condition for convergence of the finite element method. Numerical
experiments show that this condition is the best possible.
  We also point out that the circumradius condition is closely related to the
definition of surface area.
