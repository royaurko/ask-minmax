This paper introduces a reconstruction approach for the input signal of an
oversampled filter bank (OFB) when the sub-bands generated at its output are
quantized and transmitted over a noisy channel. This approach exploits the
redundancy introduced by the OFB and the fact that the quantization noise is
bounded. A maximum-likelihood estimate of the input signal is evaluated, which
only considers the vectors of quantization indexes corresponding to subband
signals that could have been generated by the OFB and that are compliant with
the quantization errors. When considering an OFB with an oversampling ratio of
3/2 and a transmission of quantized subbands on an AWGN channel, compared to a
classical decoder, the performance gains are up to 9 dB in terms of SNR for the
reconstructed signal, and 3 dB in terms of channel SNR.
