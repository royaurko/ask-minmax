We report that Bi doping drives Pr$_x$Bi$_{2-x}$Ru$_2$O$_7$ from an
antiferromagnetic insulator ($x=2$) to a metallic paramagnet ($x\approx 1$)
with a broad low $T$ maximum in $C/T$. Neutron scattering reveals local low
energy spin excitations ($\hbar\omega\approx 1$ meV) with a spectrum that is
unaffected by heating to $k_BT>>\hbar\omega$. We show that a continuous
distribution of splittings of the non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ ground state doublet
such as might result from various types of lattice strain can account for all
the data.
