Bowditch showed that a one-ended hyperbolic group which is not a triangle
group splits over a two-ended group if and only if its boundary has a local cut
point. As a corollary one obtains that splittings of hyperbolic groups over
two-ended groups are preserved under quasi-isometries. In this note we give a
more direct proof of this corollary.
