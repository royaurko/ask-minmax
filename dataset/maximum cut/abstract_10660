We present a comprehensive spectral analysis of the high mass X-ray binary
(HMXB) pulsar Centaurus X-3 with the Suzaku observatory covering nearly one
orbital period. The light curve shows the presence of extended dips which are
rarely seen in HMXBs. These dips are seen up to as high as ~40 keV. The pulsar
spectra during the eclipse, out-of-eclipse, and dips are found to be well
described by a partial covering power-law model with high energy cut-off and
three Gaussian functions for 6.4 keV, 6.7 keV, and 6.97 keV iron emission
lines. The dips in the light curve can be explained by the presence of an
additional absorption component with high column density and covering fraction,
the values of which are not significant during the rest of the orbital phases.
The iron line parameters during the dips and eclipse are significantly
different compared to those during the rest of the observation. During the
dips, the iron line intensities are found to be lesser by a factor of 2--3 with
significant increase in the line equivalent widths. However, the continuum flux
at the corresponding orbital phase is estimated to be lesser by more than an
order of magnitude. Similarities in the changes in the iron line flux and
equivalent widths during the dips and eclipse segments suggests the dipping
activity in Cen X-3 is caused by obscuration of the neutron star by dense
matter, probably structures in the outer region of the accretion disk, as in
case of dipping low mass X-ray binaries.
