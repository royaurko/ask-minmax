A primary reference on computer implementation of coset enumeration
procedures is a 1973 paper of Cannon, Dimino, Havas and Watson. Programs and
techniques described there are updated in this paper. Improved coset definition
strategies, space saving techniques and advice for obtaining improved
performance are included. New coset definition strategies for Felsch-type
methods give substantial reductions in total cosets defined for some
pathological enumerations. Significant time savings are achieved for coset
enumeration procedures in general. Statistics on performance are presented,
both in terms of time and in terms of maximum and total cosets defined for
selected enumerations.
