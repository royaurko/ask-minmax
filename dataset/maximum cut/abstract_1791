We study the probability distribution of the maximum $M_S $ of a smooth
stationary Gaussian field defined on a fractal subset $S$ of $\R^n$. Our main
result is the equivalent of the asymptotic behavior of the tail of the
distribution $\P(M_S>u)$ as $u\rightarrow +\infty.$ The basic tool is Rice
formula for the moments of the number of local maxima of a random field.
