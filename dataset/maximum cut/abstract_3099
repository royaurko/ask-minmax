The aim of this note is to connect a reversed form of the Gross logarithmic
Sobolev inequality with the Gaussian maximum of Shannon's entropy power. There
is thus a complete parallel with the well-known link between logarithmic
Sobolev inequalities and their information theoretic counterparts. We moreover
provide an elementary proof of the reversed Gross inequality via a two-point
inequality and the Central Limit Theorem.
