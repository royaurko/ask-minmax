We have investigated the pressure effect on the newly discovered samarium
doped La1-xSmxO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors by resistivity (~1.96 GPa) and
magnetization (0.8 GPa) measurements. Enhancement in Tc upto a maximum of 10.3
K with external pressure (at ~1.74 GPa, (4.08 K/GPa)) has been observed for the
20 % Sm doped composition. Beyond which Tc starts decreasing monotonously with
a rate of -2.09 K/GPa. A similar positive rate of pressure coefficient is
observed from the magnetization measurements (3.78 K/GPa). The 80% Sm sample
does not exhibit an enhancement in Tc with application of pressure up to 1.76
GPa. The observed normal resistivity exhibited semiconducting behavior from the
thermal activation energy equation it is found that the energy gap is
significantly reduced with pressure. The observation of fourfold increase in Tc
accompanied with improved normal state conduction under hydrostatic pressure on
La1-xSmxO0.5F0.5BiS2 (x = 0.2, 0.8) superconductors calls for the attention of
others working in this area.
