In most heavy ion collision simulations involving relativistic hydrodynamics,
the Cooper-Frye formula is applied to transform the hydrodynamical fields to
particles. In this article the so-called negative contributions in the
Cooper-Frye formula are studied using a coarse-grained transport approach. The
magnitude of negative contributions is investigated as a function of hadron
mass, collision energy in the range of $E_{\rm lab} = 5$--$160A$ GeV, collision
centrality and the energy density transition criterion defining the
hypersurface. The microscopic results are compared to negative contributions
expected from hydrodynamical treatment assuming local thermal equilibrium.
  The main conclusion is that the number of actual microscopic particles flying
inward is smaller than the negative contribution one would expect in an
equilibrated scenario. The largest impact of negative contributions is found to
be on the pion rapidity distribution at midrapidity in central collisions. For
this case negative contributions in equilibrium constitute 8--13\% of positive
contributions depending on collision energy, but only 0.5--4\% in cascade
calculation. The dependence on the collision energy itself is found to be
non-monotonous with a maximum at 10-20$A$ GeV.
