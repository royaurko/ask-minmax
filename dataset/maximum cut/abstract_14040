We consider the problem of universal decoding for arbitrary unknown channels
in the random coding regime. For a given random coding distribution and a given
class of metric decoders, we propose a generic universal decoder whose average
error probability is, within a sub-exponential multiplicative factor, no larger
than that of the best decoder within this class of decoders. Since the optimum,
maximum likelihood (ML) decoder of the underlying channel is not necessarily
assumed to belong to the given class of decoders, this setting suggests a
common generalized framework for: (i) mismatched decoding, (ii) universal
decoding for a given family of channels, and (iii) universal coding and
decoding for deterministic channels using the individual-sequence approach. The
proof of our universality result is fairly simple, and it is demonstrated how
some earlier results on universal decoding are obtained as special cases. We
also demonstrate how our method extends to more complicated scenarios, like
incorporation of noiseless feedback, and the multiple access channel.
