We present a detailed analysis of the dependence of the critical current I_c
on the magnetic field B of 0, Pi, and 0-Pi
superconductor-insulator-ferromagnet-superconductor Josephson junctions. I_c(B)
of the 0 and Pi junction closely follows a Fraunhofer pattern, indicating a
homogeneous critical current density j_c(x). The maximum of I_c(B) is slightly
shifted along the field axis, pointing to a small remanent in-plane
magnetization of the F-layer along the field axis. I_c(B) of the 0-Pi junction
exhibits the characteristic central minimum. I_c however has a finite value
here, due to an asymmetry of j_c in the 0 and Pi part. In addition, this I_c(B)
exhibits asymmetric maxima and bumped minima. To explain these features in
detail, flux penetration being different in the 0 part and the Pi part needs to
be taken into account. We discuss this asymmetry in relation to the magnetic
properties of the F-layer and the fabrication technique used to produce the
0-Pi junctions.
