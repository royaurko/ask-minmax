Theoretical results for the ab-plane tunneling conductance in the d-wave
model for high Tc superconductors are presented. The d-wave model predicts
surface bound states below the maximum gap. A sub-dominant order parameter,
stabilized by the surface, leads to a splitting of the zero-bias conductance
peak (ZBCP) in zero external field and to spontaneous surface currents. In a
magnetic field screening currents shift the quasiparticle bound state spectrum
and lead to a voltage splitting of the ZBCP that is linear in H at low fields,
and saturates at a pairbreaking critical field of order 3 Tesla. Comparisons
with recent experimental results on Cu/YBCO junctions are presented.
