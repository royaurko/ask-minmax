Results are presented of the observations of the soft gamma repeater SGR
1900+14 made on the Wind spacecraft during the source reactivation period from
May 1998 to January 1999. Individual characteristics of recurrent bursts, such
as their time histories, energy spectra, and maximum and integrated energy
fluxes, are considered. Some statistical distributions and relationships are
also presented. The close similarity of these events to the recurrent bursts
observed from other SGRs argues for a common emission mechanism.
