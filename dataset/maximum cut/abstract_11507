SN 2003dh, one of the most luminous supernovae ever recorded, and the one
with the highest measured velocities, accompanied gamma-ray burst 030329. Its
rapid rise to maximum and equally rapid decline pose problems for any
spherically symmetric model. We model the supernova here as a very energetic,
polar explosion that left the equatorial portions of the star almost intact.
The total progenitor mass was much greater than the mass of high-velocity
ejecta, and the total mass of 56-Ni synthesized was about 0.5 solar masses.
Such asymmetries and nickel masses are expected in the collapsar model. A
``composite two-dimensional'' model is calculated that agrees well with the
characteristics of the observed light curve. The mass of 56-Ni required for
this light curve is 0.55 solar masses and the total explosion energy, 26 x
10**51 erg.
