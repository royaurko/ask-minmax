Using the d-p model, we demonstrate that the pseudogap, which is induced by
the superconducting fluctuation, plays key roles in the determination of the
phase diagram observed in high-Tc superconducting materials. We take the
pairing interaction mediated by the spin fluctuation and calculate the
superconducting transition temperature Tc, the NMR relaxation rate 1/T1 and the
single-particle spectrum by treating both the superconducting fluctuation and
spin fluctuation in a consistent fashion. As temperature decreases, 1/T1T
increases at high temperatures, and it reaches a maximum followed by a sharp
drop in the underdoped region, due to the evolution of the pseudogap in the
single-particle spectrum. The evolution is also consistent with those of ARPES
experiments.
