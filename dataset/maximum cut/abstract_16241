We present new radio observations at frequencies ranging from 240 to 4860 MHz
of the well-known, double-double radio galaxy (DDRG), J1453+3308, using both
the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Very Large Array (VLA).
These observations enable us to determine the spectra of the inner and outer
lobes over a large frequency range and demonstrate that while the spectrum of
the outer lobes exhibits significant curvature, that of the inner lobes appears
practically straight. The break frequency, and hence the inferred synchrotron
age of the outer structure, determined from 16$-$arcsec strips transverse to
the source axis, increases with distance from the heads of the lobes. The
maximum spectral ages for the northern and southern lobes are $\sim$47 and 58
Myr respectively. Because of the difference in the lengths of the lobes these
ages imply a mean separation velocity of the heads of the lobes from the
emitting plasma of 0.036c for both the northern and southern lobes. The
synchrotron age of the inner double is about 2 Myr which implies an advance
velocity of $\sim$0.1c, but these values have large uncertainties because the
spectrum is practically straight.
