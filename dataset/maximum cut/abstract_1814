We consider a family of centered Gaussian fields on the d-dimensional unit
box, whose covariance decreases logarithmically in the distance between points.
We prove tightness of the recentered maximum of the Gaussian fields and provide
exponentially decaying bounds on the right and left tails. We then apply this
result to a version of the two-dimensional continuous Gaussian free field.
