We report on the use of $^{69,71}$Ga nuclear magnetic resonance to probe spin
dynamics in the rare-earth kagom\'{e} system Pr$_3$Ga$_5$SiO$_{14}$. We find
that the spin-lattice relaxation rate $^{69}1/T_1$ exhibits a maximum around 30
K, below which the Pr$^{3+}$ spin correlation time $\tau$ shows novel
field-dependent behavior consistent with a field-dependent gap in the
excitation spectrum. The spin-spin relaxation rate $^{69}1/T_{2}$ exhibits a
peak at a lower temperature (10 K) below which field-dependent power-law
behavior close to $T^{2}$ is observed. These results point to field-induced
formation of nanoscale magnetic clusters consistent with recent neutron
scattering measurements.
