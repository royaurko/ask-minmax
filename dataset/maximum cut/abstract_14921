Opening a sizable band gap in the zero-gap germanene without heavy loss of
carrier mobility is a key issue for its application in nanoelectronic devices
such as high-performance field effect transistors (FETs) operating at room
temperature. Using the first-principles calculations, we find a band gap is
opened at the Dirac point in germanene by single-side adsorption of alkali
metal (AM) atoms. This band gap is tunable by varying the coverage and the
species of AM atoms, ranging from 0.02 to 0.31 eV, and the maximum global band
gap is 0.26 eV. Since the effective masses of electrons and holes in germanene
near the Dirac point after surface adsorption (ranging from 0.005 to 0.106 me)
are small, the carrier mobility is expected not to degrade much. Therefore
germanene is a potential candidate of effective FET channel operating at room
temperature upon surface adsorption.
