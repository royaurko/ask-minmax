We compare the predictions of hybrid inflationary models that produce both
adiabatic fluctuations and topological defects to first year WMAP results. We
use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the contribution of cosmic
strings and textures to the CMB angular power spectrum. Marginalizing this
contribution over the cosmological parameters of a power law flat LCDM model,
we place a 95% upper limit of 23% on the topological defects contribution to
density fluctuations, the maximum likelihood being of order 4%. This
corresponds to an upper limit on the string scale of G\mu \leq 3.2 \times
10^{-7}. We also explore the degeneracies between the defects contribution and
other cosmological parameters.
