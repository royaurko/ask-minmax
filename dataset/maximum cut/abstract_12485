Let I be a compact d-dimensional manifold, let X:I\to R be a Gaussian process
with regular paths and let F_I(u), u\in R, be the probability distribution
function of sup_{t\in I}X(t). We prove that under certain regularity and
nondegeneracy conditions, F_I is a C^1-function and satisfies a certain
implicit equation that permits to give bounds for its values and to compute its
asymptotic behavior as u\to +\infty. This is a partial extension of previous
results by the contributors in the case d=1. Our methods use strongly the so-called
Rice formulae for the moments of the number of roots of an equation of the form
Z(t)=x, where Z:I\to R^d is a random field and x is a fixed point in R^d. We
also give proofs for this kind of formulae, which have their own interest
beyond the present application.
