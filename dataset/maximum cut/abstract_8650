Analyzing correlation functions of charmonia at finite temperature ($T$) on
$32^3\times(32-96)$ anisotropic lattices by the maximum entropy method (MEM),
we find that $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ survive as distinct resonances in the plasma
even up to $T \simeq 1.6 T_c$ and that they eventually dissociate between $1.6
T_c$ and $1.9 T_c$ ($T_c$ is the critical temperature of deconfinement). This
suggests that the deconfined plasma is non-perturbative enough to hold
heavy-quark bound states. The importance of having sufficient number of
temporal data points in the MEM analysis is also emphasized.
