In this note we wish to complement some recent work in the cosmological
literature concerning the Weyl conformal curvature tensor and its parts. In
particular, we shall give a clear-cut definition of the Newtonian limits of
electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor. We also discuss that only a
subset of the relativistic equations is needed to obtain a closed system of
equations in the Newtonian limit.
