This paper is concerned about maximum principles and radial symmetry for
viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear partial differential equations. We
obtain the radial symmetry and monotonicity properties for nonnegative
viscosity solutions of begin{equation}F (D^2 u)+u^p=0 \quad \quad \mbox{in}\
\mathbb R^n \label{abs}\end{equation} under the asymptotic decay rate
$u=o(|x|^{-\frac{2}{p-1}})$ at infinity, where $p>1$ (Theorem 1, Corollary 1).
As a consequence of our symmetry results, we obtain the nonexistence of any
nontrivial and nonnegative solution when $F$ is the Pucci extremal operators
(Corollary 2). Our symmetry and monotonicity results also apply to
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman or Isaccs equations. A new maximum principle for
viscosity solutions to fully nonlinear elliptic equations is established
(Theorem 2). As a result, different forms of maximum principles on bounded and
unbounded domains are obtained. Radial symmetry, monotonicity and the
corresponding maximum principle for fully nonlinear elliptic equations in a
punctured ball are shown (Theorem 3). We also investigate the radial symmetry
for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear parabolic partial differential
equations (Theorem 4).
