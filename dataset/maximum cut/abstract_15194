We present direct evidence of above room temperature magneto-electricity in
single-phase Li0.05Ti0.02Ni0.93O with above-ambient antiferromagnetic ordering.
Temperature-hysteresis in warming/cooling heat-flow thermograms establishes a
discontinuous/first-order nature of the cubic-to-rhombohedral structural change
concurring the AFM transition. At TN = 488K, magnetization features a sharp
slope-&-curvature discontinuity and dielectric constant shows a peak-anomaly.
Room temperature P-E loop measures a large polarization traceable to the N\`eel
domain walls. We find positive room-temperature magneto-capacitance up to 9T,
linear at low-fields (MC ~ Hlow); the prefactor slope (dln{\epsilon}'/dHlow)
featuring a positive frequency-coefficient rises from O(10-3/T) at 0.1MHz to
O(10-1/T) at 4MHz, with maximum d{\epsilon}'/dH ~ 120/T.
