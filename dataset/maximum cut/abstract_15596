We present a third-order nonlinear model for the statistics of unexpected
waves drawing on the work of Gemmrich & Garrett (2008). The model is verified
by way of Monte Carlo simulations of Gaussian seas and comparisons to oceanic
measurements. In particular, the analysis of oceanic data suggests that both
skewness and kurtosis effects must be accounted for to obtain accurate
predictions. As a specific application, the unexpectedness of the Andrea and
WACSIS rogue wave events is examined in detail. Observations indicate that the
crests of these waves have nearly the same amplitude ratio $h/H_s\sim1.6$,
where $H_s$ is the significant wave height. Both waves appeared without warning
and they were nearly two-times larger than the surrounding $O(10)$ waves, and
thus unexpected. The model developed here predicts that the two rogue waves are
stochastically similar as they occur on average once every $10^{4}$ waves.
Further, the maximum crest height actually observed is nearly the same as the
threshold $h_{10^{6}}\sim1.62H_{s}$ exceeded by the $1/10^{6}$ fraction of
largest crests. These results imply that rogue waves are likely occurrences of
unexpected events in weakly nonlinear random seas.
