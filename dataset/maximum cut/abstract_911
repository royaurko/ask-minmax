We have shown in previous work that statistical inference for cooperative
sequential adsorption model can be based on maximum likelihood estimation. In
this paper we continue this research and establish asymptotic normality of the
maximum likelihood estimator in thermodynamic limit. We also perform and
discuss some numerical simulations of the model.
