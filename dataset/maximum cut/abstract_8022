Triple gauge boson production at the LHC can be used to test the robustness
of the Standard Model and provide useful information for VBF di-boson
scattering measurement. Especially, any derivations from SM prediction will
indicate possible new physics. In this paper we present a detailed Monte Carlo
study on measuring WWW production in pure leptonic and semileptonic decays, and
probing anomalous quartic gauge WWWW couplings at the CERN LHC and future
hadron collider, with parton shower and detector simulation effects taken into
account. Apart from cut-based method, multivariate boosted decision tree method
has been exploited for possible improvement. For the leptonic decay channel,
our results show that at the sqrt{s}=8(14)[100] TeV pp collider with integrated
luminosity of 20(100)[3000] fb-1, one can reach a significance of
0.4(1.2)[10]sigma to observe the SM WWW production. For the semileptonic decay
channel, one can have 0.5(2)[14]sigma to observe the SM WWW production. We also
give constraints on relevant Dim-8 anomalous WWWW coupling parameters.
