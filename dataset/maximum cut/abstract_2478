We review recent progress on computing scattering amplitudes of planar N=4
super Yang-Mills at strong coupling by using the AdS/CFT duality. We do
explicit computations by using both, dimensional regularization and a cut-off
in the radial direction. Up to an additive constant independent on the
kinematics, the finite piece of the amplitude is the same in both
regularizations. The later scheme is particularly appropriate for understanding
the conformal properties of the amplitudes.
