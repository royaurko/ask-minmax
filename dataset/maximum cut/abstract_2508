We investigate the statistics of Iso-height lines of (2+1)-dimensional
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang model at different level sets around the mean height in the
saturation regime. We find that the exponent describing the distribution of the
height-cluster size behaves differently for level cuts above and below the mean
height, while the fractal dimensions of the height-clusters and their
perimeters remain unchanged. The winding angle statistics also confirms again
the conformal invariance of these contour lines in the same universality class
of self-avoiding random walks (SAWs).
