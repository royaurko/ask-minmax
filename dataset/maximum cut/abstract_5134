We derive a geometrical approach to produce the mass of particles that could
be suitably tested at LHC. Starting from a 5D unification scheme, we show that
all the known interactions could be suitably deduced as an induced symmetry
breaking of the non-unitary GL(4)-group of diffeomorphisms. The deformations
inducing such a breaking act as vector bosons that, depending on the
gravitational mass states, can assume the role of interaction bosons like
gluons, electroweak bosons or photon. The further gravitational degrees of
freedom, emerging from the reduction mechanism in 4D, eliminate the hierarchy
problem since generate a cut-off comparable with electroweak one at TeV scales.
In this "economic" scheme, gravity should induce the other interactions in a
non-perturbative way.
