We present a new census of the stellar and substellar members of the young
cluster IC 348. We have obtained images at I and Z for a 42'x28' field
encompassing the cluster and have combined these measurements with previous
optical and near-infrared photometry. From spectroscopy of candidate cluster
members appearing in these data, we have identified 122 new members, 15 of
which have spectral types of M6.5-M9, corresponding to masses of 0.08-0.015
M_sun by recent evolutionary models. The latest census for IC 348 now contains
a total of 288 members, 23 of which are later than M6 and thus are likely to be
brown dwarfs. From an extinction-limited sample of members (A_V<=4) for a
16'x14' field centered on the cluster, we construct an IMF that is unbiased in
mass and nearly complete for M/M_sun>=0.03 (<=M8). In logarithmic units where
the Salpeter slope is 1.35, the mass function for IC 348 rises from high masses
down to a solar mass, rises more slowly down to a maximum at 0.1-0.2 M_sun, and
then declines into the substellar regime. In comparison, the similarly-derived
IMF for Taurus from Briceno et al. and Luhman et al. rises quickly to a peak
near 0.8 M_sun and steadily declines to lower masses. The distinctive shapes of
the IMFs in IC 348 and Taurus are reflected in the distributions of spectral
types, which peak at M5 and K7, respectively. These data provide compelling,
model-independent evidence for a significant variation of the IMF with
star-forming conditions.
