The Ultra Luminous X-ray (ULX) source HLX-1 in the galaxy ESO 243-49 has an
observed maximum unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of 1.3e42 erg/s (0.2-10.0 keV).
From the conservative assumption that this value exceeds the Eddington limit by
at most a factor of 10, the minimum mass is then 500 solar masses. The X-ray
luminosity varies by a factor of 40 with an apparent recurrence timescale of
approximately one year. This X-ray variability is associated with spectral
state transitions similar to those seen in black hole X-ray binaries. Here we
discuss our recent modelling of all the X-ray data for HLX-1 and show that it
supports the idea that this ULX is powered by sub- and near Eddington accretion
onto an intermediate mass black hole. We also present evidence for transient
radio emission which is consistent with a discrete jet ejection event as well
as comment on the nature of the environment around HLX-1 in light of recent
Hubble Space Telescope photometry.
