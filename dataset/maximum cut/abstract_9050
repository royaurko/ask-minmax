Multiple hypothesis testing often involves composite nulls, i.e., nulls that
are associated with two or more distributions. In many cases, it is reasonable
to assume that there is a prior distribution on the distributions despite it is
unknown. When the number of distributions under true nulls is finite, we show
that under the above assumption, the false discover rate (FDR) can be
controlled using $p$-values computed under constraints imposed by the empirical
distribution of the observations. Comparing to FDR control using $p$-values
defined as maximum significance level over all null distributions, the proposed
FDR control can have substantially more power.
