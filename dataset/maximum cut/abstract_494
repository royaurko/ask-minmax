In this article, we study in detail the modified topological recursion of the
one matrix model for arbitrary $\beta$ in the one cut case. We show that for
polynomial potentials, the recursion can be computed as a sum of residues.
However the main difference with the hermitian matrix model is that the
residues cannot be set at the branchpoints of the spectral curve but require
the knowledge of the whole curve. In order to establish non-ambiguous formulas,
we place ourselves in the context of the globalizing parametrization which is
specific to the one cut case (also known as Zhukovsky parametrization). This
situation is particularly interesting for applications since in most cases the
potentials of the matrix models only have one cut in string theory. Finally,
the article exhibits some numeric simulations of histograms of limiting density
of eigenvalues for different values of the parameter $\beta$.
