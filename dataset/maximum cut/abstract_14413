Dynamics in biological networks are in general robust against several
perturbations. We investigate a coupled map network as a model motivated by
gene regulatory networks and design systems which are robust against phenotypic
perturbations (perturbations in dynamics), as well as systems which are robust
against mutation (perturbations in network structure). To achieve such a
design, we apply a multicanonical Monte Carlo method. Analysis based on the
maximum Lyapunov exponent and parameter sensitivity shows that systems with
marginal stability, which are regarded as systems at the edge of chaos, emerge
when robustness against network perturbations is required. This emergence of
the edge of chaos is a self-organization phenomenon and does not need a fine
tuning of parameters.
