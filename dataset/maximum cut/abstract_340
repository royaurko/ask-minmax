The acoustic cut-off frequency -the highest frequency for acoustic solar
eigenmodes- is an important parameter of the solar atmosphere as it determines
the upper boundary of the p-mode resonant cavities. At frequencies beyond this
value, acoustic disturbances are no longer trapped but traveling waves.
Interference amongst them give rise to higher-frequency peaks -the pseudomodes-
in the solar acoustic spectrum. The pseudomodes are shifted slightly in
frequency with respect to p modes making possible the use of pseudomodes to
determine the acoustic cut-off frequency. Using data from GOLF and VIRGO
instruments on board the SOHO spacecraft, we calculate the acoustic cut-off
frequency using the coherence function between both the velocity and intensity
sets of data. By using data gathered by these instruments during the entire
lifetime of the mission (1996 till the present), a variation in the acoustic
cut-off frequency with the solar magnetic activity cycle is found.
