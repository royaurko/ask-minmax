We study the maximal ranks of a free and a free abelian quotients of a
finitely generated group, called co-rank (inner rank, cut number) and the Betti
number, respectively. We show that any combination of these values within
obvious constraints is realized for some finitely presented group, which is
important for manifold and foliation topology.
