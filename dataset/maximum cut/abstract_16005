We present high resolution spectroscopic observations of the massive X-ray
binary system LS I+65 010=2S 0114+650 in the optical wavelength region. A
correlation between equivalent width and radial velocity of photospheric
absorption lines is found. The systemic velocity, inferred from the weaker
lines is v_helio = -31 +/- 5 km s^-1, which, if attributed solely to the
Galactic rotation curve, implies that LS I+65 010 lies within 3 kpc from the
Sun. The ISM Na I D lines display 2 resolved high velocity components at
v_helio = -70, -48 km s^-1, possibly associated with gas surrounding the binary
system, in addition to the -24, -8 km s^-1 ISM features due to the Orion and
the Perseus arm regions. Strong photospheric line profile variability is
present on a night to night timescale, with He I 5875 A displaying an
additional blue-shifted absorption in some of the spectra, similar to what is
observed in the optical counterpart of Vela X-1. A connection between the
extended blue wing and X-ray maximum is suggested. Short timescale variations
in line profiles are detected on only two nights, but the evidence that these
variations occur on the 2.78 hour X-ray flaring period is marginal.
