We study analytically the ground-state stability of a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) confined in an harmonic trap with repulsive or attractive
zero-range interaction by minimizing the energy functional of the system. In
the case of repulsive interaction the BEC mean radius grows by increasing the
number of bosons, instead in the case of attractive interaction the BEC mean
radius decreases by increasing the number of bosons: to zero if the system is
one-dimensional and to a minimum radius, with a maximum number of bosons, if
the system is three-dimensional.
