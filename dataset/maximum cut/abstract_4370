We present a novel analysis of diffractive DIS data, in which the input
parton distributions of the Pomeron are parameterised using perturbative QCD
expressions. In addition to the usual two-gluon model for the perturbative
Pomeron, we allow for the possibility that it may be made from two sea quarks.
In particular, we treat individually the components of the Pomeron of different
size. This property allows the absorptive corrections to the inclusive DIS
structure function F_2 to be calculated using the AGK cutting rules. The
absorptive effects are found to enhance the size of the gluon distribution of
the proton at small x.
