We consider distributions of ordered random vectors with given
one-dimensional marginal distributions. We give an elementary necessary and
sufficient condition for the existence of such a distribution with finite
entropy. In this case, we give explicitly the density of the unique
distribution which achieves the maximal entropy and compute the value of its
entropy. This density is the unique one which has a product form on its support
and the given one-dimensional marginals. The proof relies on the study of
copulas with given one-dimensional marginal distributions for its order
statistics.
