We investigate the hadronic production of the doubly heavy baryon $\Xi_{bc}$
at the large hadron collider (LHC), where contributions from the four
$(bc)$-diquark states $(bc)_{\bf\bar{3},6}[^1S_0]$ and
$(bc)_{\bf\bar{3},6}[^3S_1]$ have been taken into consideration. Numerical
results show that under the condition of $p_T>4$ GeV and $|y|<1.5$, sizable
$\Xi_{bc}$ events about $ 1.7\times 10^7$ and $3.5\times10^9$ per year can be
produced for the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{S}=7$ TeV and $\sqrt{S}=14$ TeV
respectively. For experimental usage, the total and the interested differential
cross-sections are estimated under some typical $p_T$- and $y$- cuts for the
LHC detectors CMS, ATLAS and LHCb. Main uncertainties are discussed and a
comparative study on the hadronic production of $\Xi_{cc}$, $\Xi_{bc}$ and
$\Xi_{bb}$ at LHC are also presented.
