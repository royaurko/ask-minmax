Two recent luminosity function (LF) for galaxies are reviewed and the
parameters which characterize the near infrared are fixed. A first LF is a
modified Schechter LF with four parameters. The second LF is derived from the
generalized gamma and has four parameters. The formulas which give the number
of galaxies as function of the redshift are reviewed and a special attention is
given to the position of the photometric maximum which is expressed as function
of a critical parameter or the flux of radiation or the apparent magnitude. A
simulation of the 2MASS Redshift Survey is given in the framework of the non
Poissonian Voronoi Tessellation.
