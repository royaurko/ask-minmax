The recent discovery of a new class of superconducting oxypnictides with high
transition temperatures may have profound implications for understanding
unconventional high-temperature superconductivity. Like the cuprates, the
oxypnictides seem to manifest an interleaving of charge donor and
superconducting layers emerging upon doping of an antiferromagnetic parent
semi-metal. Here we report magneto-transport measurements of three rare earth
(Re = La, Nd, Sm) oxypnicide compounds with the transition temperatures near
the maximum reported to date, in very high DC and pulsed magnetic fields up to
45 and 54 T, respectively. Our resistivity, Hall coefficient and critical
magnetic fields data suggest that these oxypnictide superconductors bridge the
gap between MgB$_2$ and YBaCu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ as far as electromagnetic and vortex
properties are concerned.
