Next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the associated production of vector
boson (Z/W) with the the Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton in large extra
dimensional model at the LHC, are presented. We have obtained various kinematic
distributions using a Monte Carlo code which is based on the two cut off phase
space slicing method that handles soft and collinear singularities appearing at
NLO level. We estimate the impact of the QCD corrections on various observables
and find that they are significant. We also show the reduction in factorization
scale uncertainty when QCD corrections are included.
