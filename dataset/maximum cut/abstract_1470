By selecting astrometric and photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS), the L{\'e}pine & Shara Proper Motion North Catalog (LSPM-North),
the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and the USNO-B1.0 catalog, we use a
succession of methods to isolate white dwarf candidates for follow-up
spectroscopy. Our methods include: reduced proper motion diagram cuts, color
cuts, and atmospheric model adherence. We present spectroscopy of 26 white
dwarfs obtained from the CTIO 4m and APO 3.5m telescopes. Additionally, we
confirm 28 white dwarfs with spectra available in the SDSS DR7 database but
unpublished elsewhere, presenting a total of 54 WDs. We label one of these as a
recovered WD while the remaining 53 are new discoveries. We determine physical
parameters and estimate distances based on atmospheric model analyses. Three
new white dwarfs are modeled to lie within 25 pc. Two additional white dwarfs
are confirmed to be metal-polluted (DAZ). Follow-up time series photometry
confirms another object to be a pulsating ZZ Ceti white dwarf.
