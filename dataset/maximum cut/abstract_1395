We study the pair production of scalar top quarks in e+e- collisions with the
subsequent decay of the top squarks into b-quarks and charginos. We simulate
this process using PYTHIA6.4 for beam energies 2E_beam = 350, 400, 500, 800,
1000 GeV. Proposing a set of criteria we obtain a good separation of the signal
stop events from top quark pair production which is the main background. The
number of stop production events obtained with the proposed cuts for different
energies is calculated for an integrated luminosity of 1000 1/fb. We propose a
method to reconstruct the mass of the top squark, provided the mass of the
lightest neutralino is known, and estimate the error of the mass determination
for the case sqrt{s} = 500 GeV.
