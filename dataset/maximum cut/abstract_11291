The recent Cherenkov telescope observations and detections of the BL Lac
objects Mkn 421, Mkn 501, 1ES 2344+514, PKS 2155--304 and possibly 1ES 1959+658
have shown that there exists a subclass of BL Lac objects emitting a
substantial fraction of their power between the GeV and the TeV bands. These
are the sources whose synchrotron spectrum peaks, in a $\nu$--$\nu F_{\nu}$
representation, in the EUV or X-ray band. Here I suggest that even more extreme
BL Lacs can exist, whose synchrotron spectrum peaks in the MeV band. These
sources should emit a substantial fraction of their power in the TeV band by
the inverse Compton process. Limits to the maximum possible emitted frequencies
are discussed.
