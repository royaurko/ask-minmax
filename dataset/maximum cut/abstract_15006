A method for fabrication of polarization degenerate oxide apertured
micropillar cavities is demon- strated. Micropillars are etched such that the
size and shape of the oxide front is controlled. The polarization splitting in
the circular micropillar cavities due to the native and strain induced bire-
fringence can be compensated by elongating the oxide front in the [110]
direction, thereby reducing stress in this direction. By using this technique
we fabricate a polarization degenerate cavity with a quality factor of
1.7*?10^4 and a mode volume of 2.7 u?m3, enabling a calculated maximum Purcell
factor of 11.
