This paper deals with the evolution equation of a curve obtained as the sharp
interface limit of a non-linear system of two reaction-diffusion PDEs. This
system was introduced as a phase-field model of (crawling) motion of eukaryotic
cells on a substrate. The key issue is the evolution of the cell membrane
(interface curve) which involves shape change and net motion. This issue can be
addressed both qualitatively and quantitatively by studying the evolution
equation of the sharp interface limit for this system. However, this equation
is non-linear and non-local and existence of solutions presents a significant
analytical challenge. We establish existence of solutions for a wide class of
initial data in the so-called subcritical regime. Existence is proved in a two
step procedure. First, for smooth ($H^2$) initial data we use a regularization
technique. Second, we consider non-smooth initial data that are more relevant
from the application point of view. Here, uniform estimates on the time when
solution exists rely on a maximum principle type argument.
