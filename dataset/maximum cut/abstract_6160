A modification of the accepted relativistic energy momentum relation is
suggested. The new relation allows massive particles to have a maximum velocity
c(m) greater than the velocity of light c. The effect of the modification
suggested here would be most apparent for objects with masses nearly equal to
the Planck mass.
