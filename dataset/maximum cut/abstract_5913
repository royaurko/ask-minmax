We employ a game theoretic approach to formulate communication between two
nodes over a wireless link in the presence of an adversary. We define a
constrained, two-player, zero-sum game between a transmitter/receiver pair with
adaptive transmission parameters and an adversary with average and maximum
power constraints. In this model, the transmitter's goal is to maximize the
achievable expected performance of the communication link, defined by a utility
function, while the jammer's goal is to minimize the same utility function.
Inspired by capacity/rate as a performance measure, we define a general utility
function and a payoff matrix which may be applied to a variety of jamming
problems. We show the existence of a threshold such that if the jammer's
average power exceeds this threshold, the expected payoff of the transmitter at
Nash Equilibrium (NE) is the same as the case when the jammer uses its maximum
allowable power all the time. We provide analytical and numerical results for
transmitter and jammer optimal strategies and a closed form expression for the
expected value of the game at the NE. As a special case, we investigate the
maximum achievable transmission rate of a rate-adaptive, packetized, wireless
AWGN communication link under different jamming scenarios and show that
randomization can significantly assist a smart jammer with limited average
power.
