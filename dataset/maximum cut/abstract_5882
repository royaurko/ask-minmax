We say that a family ${x_i|i\in[m]}$ of vectors in a Banach space $X$
satisfies the $k$-collapsing condition if $|\sum_{i\in I}x_i|\leq 1$ for all
$k$-element subsets $I\subseteq{1,2,...,m}$. Let $C(k,d)$ denote the maximum
cardinality of a $k$-collapsing family of unit vectors in a $d$\dimensional
Banach space, where the maximum is taken over all spaces of dimension $d$.
Similarly, let $CB(k,d)$ denote the maximum cardinality if we require in
addition that $\sum_{i=1}^m x_i=o$. The case $k=2$ was considered by F\"uredi,
Lagarias and Morgan (1991). These conditions originate in a theorem of Lawlor
and Morgan (1994) on geometric shortest networks in smooth finite-dimensional
Banach spaces. We show that $CB(k,d)=\max{k+1,2d}$ for all $k,d\geq 2$. The
behaviour of $C(k,d)$ is not as simple, and we derive various upper and lower
bounds for various ranges of $k$ and $d$. These include the exact values
$C(k,d)=\max{k+1,2d}$ in certain cases.
  We use a variety of tools from graph theory, convexity and linear algebra in
the proofs: in particular the Hajnal-Szemer\'edi Theorem, the Brunn-Minkowski
inequality, and lower bounds for the rank of a perturbation of the identity
matrix.
