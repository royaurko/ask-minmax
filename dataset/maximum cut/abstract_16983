We investigate quantization and feedback of channel state information in a
multiuser (MU) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. Each user may
receive multiple data streams. Our design minimizes the sum mean squared error
(SMSE) while accounting for the imperfections in channel state information
(CSI) at the transmitter. This paper makes three contributions: first, we
provide an end-to-end SMSE transceiver design that incorporates receiver
combining, feedback policy and transmit precoder design with channel
uncertainty. This enables the proposed transceiver to outperform the previously
derived limited feedback MU linear transceivers. Second, we remove
dimensionality constraints on the MIMO system, for the scenario with multiple
data streams per user, using a combination of maximum expected signal combining
(MESC) and minimum MSE receiver. This makes the feedback of each user
independent of the others and the resulting feedback overhead scales linearly
with the number of data streams instead of the number of receiving antennas.
Finally, we analyze SMSE of the proposed algorithm at high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and large number of transmit antennas. As an aside, we show
analytically why the bit error rate, in the high SNR regime, increases if
quantization error is ignored.
