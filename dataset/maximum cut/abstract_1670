Ordinary, macroscopic systems, naturally tend to a state of maximum entropy
compatible with their constraints. However, this might not hold for
gravity-dominated systems since their entropy may increase without bound unless
this is precluded by the formation of a black hole. In this short note we
suggest, based on the Hubble expansion history, that our Universe likely
behaves as an ordinary system, i.e., that its entropy seems to tend to some
maximum value.
