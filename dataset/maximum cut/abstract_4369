We investigated the lepton flavor violation processes $p\bar{p} \to e\mu+X$
induced by R-parity violating interactions at the Tevatron hadron collider. The
theoretical calculation and Monte Carlo simulation demonstrate that with a set
of suitable cuts on experimental observables, one might be capable to reduce
the standard model physical background to a controllable level so that the
signals of R-parity violating interactions could be detected distinctively.
Furthermore, clear sneutrino information could be abstracted from the purified
event sample where other SUSY scalar quark 'pollution' is heavy suppressed. We
conclude that with a reasonable assumption of $10fb^{-1}$ integrated
luminosity, the Experiments at the Tevatron machine would have potential to
discover sneutrino in the region of $m_{\tilde{\nu}}\le400GeV$ via lepton
flavor violation $e\mu$ production channels, or extend the mass scale
constraint up to $m_{\tilde{\nu}}\ge 550 GeV$ at 95% CL.
