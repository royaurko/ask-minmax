Magnetic, transport and thermal properties of AFe4Sb12 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) are
reported. All three compounds show a maximum in both the magnetic
susceptibility and thermopower at 50 K, and a large electronic specific heat
coefficient of 100 mJ/mol K2. These properties are the characteristics of a
nearly ferromagnetic metal. Furthermore, a remanent moment of the order of
10-3muB/Fe was observed below 54, 48, and 40 K for A = Ca, Sr, and Ba,
respectively. The volume fraction of the ferromagnetic component was estimated
to be 10-20% by zero-field muSR measurements.
