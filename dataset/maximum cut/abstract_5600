Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is a popular approach that cuts down
on the classical planning search space by relying on a given hierarchical
library of domain control knowledge. This provides an intuitive methodology for
specifying high-level instructions on how robots and agents should perform
tasks, while also giving the planner enough flexibility to choose the
lower-level steps and their ordering. In this paper we present the HATP
(Hierarchical Agent-based Task Planner) planning framework which extends the
traditional HTN planning domain representation and semantics by making them
more suitable for roboticists, and treating agents as "first class" entities in
the language. The former is achieved by allowing "social rules" to be defined
which specify what behaviour is acceptable/unacceptable by the agents/robots in
the domain, and interleaving planning with geometric reasoning in order to
validate online -with respect to a detailed geometric 3D world- the human/robot
actions currently being pursued by HATP.
