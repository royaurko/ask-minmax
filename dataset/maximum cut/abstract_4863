We present results on the mass of the baryon octet and decuplet using two
flavors of light dynamical twisted mass fermions. The strange quark mass is
fixed to its physical value from the kaon sector in a partially quenched set
up. Calculations are performed for light quark masses corresponding to a pion
mass in the range 270-500 MeV and lattice sizes of 2.1 fm and 2.7 fm. We check
for cut-off effects and isospin breaking by evaluating the baryon masses at two
different lattice spacings. We carry out a chiral extrapolation for the octet
baryons and discuss results for the Omega.
