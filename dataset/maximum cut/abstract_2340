We use Supersymmetric Ward Identities and quadruple cuts to generate n-pt
NMHV amplitudes involving gluinos and adjoint scalars from purely gluonic
amplitudes. We present a set of factors that can be used to generate one-loop
NMHV amplitudes involving gluinos or adjoint scalars in N=4 Super Yang-Mills
from the corresponding purely gluonic amplitude.
