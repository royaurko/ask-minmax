In synthetic biology, gene regulatory circuits are often constructed by
combining smaller circuit components. Connections between components are
achieved by transcription factors acting on promoters. If the individual
components behave as true modules and certain module interface conditions are
satisfied, the function of the composite circuits can in principle be
predicted. In this paper, we investigate one of the interface conditions:
fan-out. We quantify the fan-out, a concept widely used in electric
engineering, to indicate the maximum number of the downstream inputs that an
upstream output transcription factor can regulate. We show that the fan-out is
closely related to retroactivity studied by Del Vecchio, et al. We propose an
efficient operational method for measuring the fan-out that can be applied to
various types of module interfaces. We also show that the fan-out can be
enhanced by self-inhibitory regulation on the output. We discuss the potential
role of the inhibitory regulations found in gene regulatory networks and
protein signal pathways. The proposed estimation method for fanout not only
provides an experimentally efficient way for quantifying the level of
modularity in gene regulatory circuits but also helps characterize and design
module interfaces, enabling the modular construction of gene circuits.
