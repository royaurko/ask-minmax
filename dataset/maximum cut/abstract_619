The relation between symmetry breaking in non-commutative cut-off field
theories and transitions to inhomogeneous phases in condensed matter and in
finite density QCD is discussed. The non-commutative dynamics, with its
peculiar infrared-ultraviolet mixing, can be regarded as an effective
description of the mechanisms which lead to inhomogeneous phase transitions and
a roton-like excitation spectrum.
