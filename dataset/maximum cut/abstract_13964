The measurement of the mass 1.97 +/- 0.04 M_sun for PSR J1614-2230 provides a
new constraint on the equation of state and composition of matter at high
densities. In this contribution we investigate the possibility that the dense
cores of neutron stars could contain strange quarks either in a confined state
(hyperonic matter) or in a deconfined one (strange quark matter) while
fulfilling a set of constraints including the new maximum mass constraint. We
account for the possible appearance of hyperons within an extended version of
the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model, including the phi-meson
interaction channel. Deconfined quark matter is described by the color
superconducting three-flavor NJL model.
