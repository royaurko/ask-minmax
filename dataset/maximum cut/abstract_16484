We study the question of finding the maximal determinant of matrices of odd
order with entries {-1,1}. The most general upper bound on the maximal
determinant, due to Barba, can only be achieved when the order is the sum of
two consecutive squares. It is conjectured that the bound is always attained in
such cases. Apart from these, only in orders 3, 7, 9, 11, 17 and 21 has the
maximal value been established. In this paper we confirm the results for these
orders, and add order 15 to the list. We follow previous contributors in
exhaustively searching for candidate Gram matrices having determinant greater
than or equal to the square of a known lower bound on the maximum. We then
attempt to decompose each candidate as the product of a {-1,1}-matrix and its
transpose. For order 15 we find four candidates, all of Ehlich block form, two
having determinant (105*3^5*2^14)^2 and the others determinant
(108*3^5*2^14)^2. One of the former decomposes (in an essentially unique way)
while the remaining three do not. This result proves a conjecture made
independently by W. D. Smith and J. H. E. Cohn. We also use our method to
compute improved upper bounds on the maximal determinant in orders 29, 33, and
37, and to establish the range of the determinant function of {-1,1}-matrices
in orders 9 and 11.
