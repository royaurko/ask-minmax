In Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, the parameters of the Schwarzschild - de Sitter
solution as well as the whole interior solutions of compact objects are
expected to change when compared to general relativity. We solve the Palatini
field equations numerically in the case of the models $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$
and $f(R) = R - \mu^4/R$, and using the equation of state of Fermi gas. We show
how the density profiles and the prediction for the maximum masses of white
dwarfs (the Chandrasekhar limit) and neutron stars (the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit) are altered, and thereby conclude that
observations on compact stars may be used to exclude alternative gravity
models.
