Some BL Lacertae objects show a periodic behaviour in their light curves that
is often attributed to the orbital motion of a central binary black hole
system. On this basis, and assuming a circular orbit, Rieger and Mannheim have
recently proposed a method to determine the orbital parameters of the binary
system from the observed quantities, {\it i.e.} the signal periodicity, the
flux ratio between maximum and minimum signal and the power law spectral index
of the photon flux. However, since these binary black holes are expected to
originate from galactic mergers, they could well be on eccentric orbits, which
might not circularize for a substantial time. We therefore generalize the
treatment proposed by Rieger and Mannheim by taking into account the effect of
the orbital eccentricity of the binary system. We apply the model to three
well-observed Markarian objects: MKN 501, MKN 421 and MKN 766 that most likely
host a binary system in their centers. Some astrophysical implications of this
model are also investigated with particular emphasis to the gravitational
radiation emission from the binary black holes. Under particular conditions
(e.g. for some values of the orbital separation, eccentricity and Lorentz
factor) one can obtain signals above the sensitivity threshold of the LISA
detector.
