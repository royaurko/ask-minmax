We give a (computer assisted) proof that the edges of every graph with
maximum degree 3 and girth at least 17 may be 5-colored (possibly improperly)
so that the complement of each color class is bipartite. Equivalently, every
such graph admits a homomorphism to the Clebsch graph.
  Hopkins and Staton and Bondy and Locke proved that every (sub)cubic graph of
girth at least 4 has an edge-cut containing at least 4/5 of the edges. The
existence of such an edge-cut follows immediately from the existence of a
5-edge-coloring as described above, so our theorem may be viewed as a coloring
extension of their result (under a stronger girth assumption).
  Every graph which has a homomorphism to a cycle of length five has an
above-described 5-edge-coloring; hence our theorem may also be viewed as a weak
version of Nesetril's Pentagon Problem (which asks whether every cubic graph of
sufficiently high girth is homomorphic to C_5).
