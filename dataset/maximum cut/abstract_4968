We introduce a curvature function for planar graphs to study the connection
between the curvature and the geometric and spectral properties of the graph.
We show that non-positive curvature implies that the graph is infinite and
locally similar to a tessellation. We use this to extend several results known
for tessellations to general planar graphs. For non-positive curvature, we show
that the graph admits no cut locus and we give a description of the boundary
structure of distance balls. For negative curvature, we prove that the
interiors of minimal bigons are empty and derive explicit bounds for the growth
of distance balls and Cheeger's constant. The latter are used to obtain lower
bounds for the bottom of the spectrum of the discrete Laplace operator.
Moreover, we give a characterization for triviality of essential spectrum by
uniform decrease of the curvature. Finally, we show that non-positive curvature
implies absence of finitely supported eigenfunctions for nearest neighbor
operators.
