We discuss the shape and decomposition of rotation curves (RCs) of galaxies
formed within growing cold dark matter halos. The outer RC shape correlates
mainly with the surface brightness (SB), the luminous mass fraction, fd, and
the bulge fraction. In order the shapes of RC depend significantly on
luminosity, fd should be a strong function of mass (feedback). For the
preferred values of fd (\lesssim 0.03), the high SB models can be maximum disks
only when the halos have a shallow core. The low SB models are sub-maximum
disks. The residuals of the baryonic Tully-Fisher (TF) and disk mass-radius
relations show a clear anti-correlation among them, but when one passes to the
TF and luminosity-radius relations, the anti-correlation almost disappears.
Therefore, the observed lack of correlation among the residuals of the last two
relations should not be interpreted as an evidence of sub-maximal disks.
