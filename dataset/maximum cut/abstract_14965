Forecasting can estimate the statement of events according to the historical
data and it is considerably important in many disciplines. At present, time
series models have been utilized to solve forecasting problems in various
domains. In general, researchers use curve fitting and parameter estimation
methods (moment estimation, maximum likelihood estimation and least square
method) to forecast. In this paper, a new sight is given to the forecasting and
a completely different method is proposed to forecast time series. Inspired by
the visibility graph and link prediction, this letter converts time series into
network and then finds the nodes which are mostly likelihood to link with the
predicted node. Finally, the predicted value will be obtained according to the
state of the link. The TAIEX data set is used in the case study to illustrate
that the proposed method is effectiveness. Compared with ARIMA model, the
proposed shows a good forecasting performance when there is a small amount of
data.
