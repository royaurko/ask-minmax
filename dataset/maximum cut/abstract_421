We show that a resummation of infrared logarithms is needed to obtain a
sensible theoretical description of dijet rates when symmetric cuts are applied
to the transverse energies of both jets. We also present the next-to-leading
logarithmic (NLL) resummation we carried out for DIS production of two jets
selected with the cone algorithm.
