We discuss the allowed parameter regime in the coupling-mass plane implied by
the existing LEP2 data on e+ e- -> hadrons at 172.3 GeV for the leptoquark
interpretation of the anomalous DESY positron-jet events for four different
models of the leptoquark charges and chiral couplings to quarks, for both a
loose cut on s'/s and a tight cut on s'/s. We find that this interpretation of
the DESY phenomenon is still consistent with the LEP2 data although, for vector
leptoquarks, a significant regime of the relevant parameter space is already
excluded.
