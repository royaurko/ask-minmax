We study the effects of anisotropic pressure on the properties of spherically
symmetric, gravitationally bound objects. We consider the full general
relativistic treatment of this problem and obtain exact solutions for various
form of equations of state connecting the radial and tangential pressures. It
is shown that pressure anisotropy can have significant effects on the structure
and properties of stellar objects. In particular, the maximum value of 2M/R can
approach unity (2M/R < 8/9 for isotropic objects) and the surface redshift can
be arbitrarily large.
