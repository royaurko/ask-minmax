In computer algebra there are different ways of approaching the mathematical
concept of functions, one of which is by defining them as solutions of
differential equations. We compare different such approaches and discuss the
occurring problems. The main focus is on the question of determining possible
branch cuts. We explore the extent to which the treatment of branch cuts can be
rendered (more) algorithmic, by adapting Kahan's rules to the differential
equation setting.
