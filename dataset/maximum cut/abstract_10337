Following Malheiro et al. (2012) we describe the so-called low magnetic field
magnetars, SGR 0418+5729, Swift J1822.3--1606, as well as the AXP prototype 1E
2259+586 as massive fast rotating highly magnetized white dwarfs. We give
bounds for the mass, radius, moment of inertia, and magnetic field for these
sources by requesting the stability of realistic general relativistic uniformly
rotating configurations. Based on these parameters, we improve the theoretical
prediction of the lower limit of the spindown rate of SGR 0418+5729; for a
white dwarf close to its maximum stable we obtain the very stringent interval
for the spindown rate of 4.1E-16< dP/dt < 6E-15, where the upper value is the
known observational limit. A lower limit has been also set for Swift
J1822.3-1606 for which a fully observationally accepted spin-down rate is still
lacking. The white dwarf model provides for this source dP/dt> 2.13E-15, if the
star is close to its maximum stable mass. We also present the theoretical
expectation of the infrared, optical and ultraviolet emission of these objects
and show their consistency with the current available observational data. We
give in addition the frequencies at which absorption features could be present
in the spectrum of these sources as the result of the scattering of photons
with the quantized electrons by the surface magnetic field.
