A graph G is (d_1,..,d_l)-colorable if the vertex set of G can be partitioned
into subsets V_1,..,V_l such that the graph G[V_i] induced by the vertices of
V_i has maximum degree at most d_i for all 1 <= i <= l. In this paper, we focus
on complexity aspects of such colorings when l=2,3. More precisely, we prove
that, for any fixed integers k,j,g with (k,j) distinct form (0,0) and g >= 3,
either every planar graph with girth at least g is (k,j)-colorable or it is
NP-complete to determine whether a planar graph with girth at least g is
(k,j)-colorable. Also, for any fixed integer k, it is NP-complete to determine
whether a planar graph that is either (0,0,0)-colorable or
non-(k,k,1)-colorable is (0,0,0)-colorable. Additionally, we exhibit
non-(3,1)-colorable planar graphs with girth 5 and non-(2,0)-colorable planar
graphs with girth 7.
