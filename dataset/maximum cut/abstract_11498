We present the results of monitoring the radio emission from the Type IIb
supernova SN 2001gd between 2002 February 8 and 2002 October 28. Most of the
data were obtained using the Very Large Array at the five wavelengths of
$\lambda \lambda$1.3 cm (22.4 GHz), 2.0 cm (14.9 GHz), 3.6 cm (8.44 GHz), 6.2
cm (4.86 GHz), and 21 cm (1.4 GHz). Observations were also made with Giant
Meterwave Radio Telescope at $\lambda$21 cm (1.4 GHz). The object was
discovered optically well after maximum light, making any determination of the
early radio evolution difficult. However, subsequent observations indicate that
the radio emission has evolved regularly in both time and frequency and is well
described by the SN shock/circumstellar medium interaction model.
