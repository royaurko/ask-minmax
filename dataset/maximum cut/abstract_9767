Strong nonmagnetic impurities on the surface of three-dimensional topological
insulators (TIs) generate localized resonance peaks close to the Dirac point.
We show that this results in a strongly reduced critical Coulomb interaction
strength to reach a magnetic surface state, following a Stoner-like criterion.
Thus even weakly interacting TIs host a finite (local) magnetization around
strong nonmagnetic impurities. The local magnetization gives rise to a global
energy gap, linearly dependent on the maximum value of the magnetization but
decreasing with reduced impurity concentration.
