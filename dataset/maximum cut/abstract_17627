We study the dynamics of flexible, semiflexible, and self-avoiding polymer
chains moving under a Kramers metastable potential. Due to thermal noise, the
polymers, initially placed in the metastable well, can cross the potential
barrier, but these events are extremely rare if the barrier is much larger than
thermal energy. To speed up the slow rate processes in computer simulations, we
extend the recently proposed path integral hyperdynamics method to the cases of
polymers. We consider the cases where the polymers' radii of gyration are
comparable to the distance between the well bottom and the barrier top. We find
that, for a flexible polymer, the crossing rate ($\mathcal{R}$) monotonically
decreases with chain contour length ($L$), but with the magnitude much larger
than the Kramers rate in the globular limit. For a semiflexible polymer, the
crossing rate decreases with $L$ but becomes nearly constant for large $L$. For
a fixed $L$, the crossing rate becomes maximum at an intermediate bending
stiffness. For a self-avoiding chain, the rate is a nonmonotonic function of
$L$, first decreasing with $L$, and then, above certain length, increasing with
$L$. These findings can be instrumental for efficient separation of
biopolymers.
