We measured the 12C(e,e'p) cross section as a function of missing energy in
parallel kinematics for (q,w) = (970 MeV/c, 330 MeV) and (990 MeV/c, 475 MeV).
At w=475 MeV, at the maximum of the quasielastic peak, there is a large
continuum (E_m > 50 MeV) cross section extending out to the deepest missing
energy measured, amounting to almost 50% of the measured cross section. The
ratio of data to DWIA calculation is 0.4 for both the p- and s-shells. At w=330
MeV, well below the maximum of the quasielastic peak, the continuum cross
section is much smaller and the ratio of data to DWIA calculation is 0.85 for
the p-shell and 1.0 for the s-shell. We infer that one or more mechanisms that
increase with $\omega$ transform some of the single-nucleon-knockout into
multinucleon knockout, decreasing the valence knockout cross section and
increasing the continuum cross section.
