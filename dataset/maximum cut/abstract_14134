We report measurements of the irreversible magnetization M_i of a large
number of YBa_2Cu_3O_7 single crystals with columnar defects (CD). Some of them
exhibit a maximum in M_i when the density of vortices equals the density of
tracks, at temperatures above 40K. We show that the observation of these
matching field effects is constrained to those crystals where the orientational
and pinning energy dispersion of the CD system lies below a certain threshold.
The amount of such dispersion is determined by the mass and energy of the
irradiation ions, and by the crystal thickness. Time relaxation measurements
show that the matching effects are associated with a reduction of the creep
rate, and occur deep into the collective pinning regime.
