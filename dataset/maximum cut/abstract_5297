ALICE measured transverse momentum spectra of pi0 and eta mesons via the two
photon decay in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV and Pb-Pb
collisions at sqrt(sNN)=2.76 TeV. NLO pQCD calculations agree with p-p
measurements at 0.9 TeV, but overestimate the data at 2.76 and 7 TeV. The
nuclear modification factor for neutral pions shows a strong suppression of
high-pt particle production in central Pb-Pb collisions. Raw spectra of charged
particle jets have been measured in Pb-Pb collisions. Detailed studies of
background fluctuations have been performed and will allow us to unfold the
spectra even for low momentum cut offs, giving access to soft fragmentation
products in quenched jets.
