In a continuous search for energy-efficient electronic switches, a great
attention is focused on tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) demonstrating
an abrupt dependence of the source-drain current on the gate voltage. Among all
TFETs, those based on one-dimensional (1D) semiconductors exhibit the steepest
current switching due to the singular density of states near band edges, though
the current in 1D structures is pretty low. In this paper, we propose a TFET
based on 2D graphene bilayer which demonstrates a record steep subthreshold
slope enabled by van Hove singularities in the density of states near the edges
of conduction and valence bands. Our simulations show the accessibility of ~
$10^5$ ON/OFF current ratio with 150 mV gate voltage swing, and a maximum
subthreshold slope of (20 {\mu}V/dec)$^{-1}$ just above the threshold. The high
ON-state current of ~ 1 mA/{\mu}m is enabled by a narrow (< 0.4 eV) extrinsic
band gap, while the smallness of the leakage current is due to the blocking of
thermally injected minority carriers by the electric field of auxiliary gates
at source and drain.
