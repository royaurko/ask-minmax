We estimate the two- and three-dimensional power spectra, P_2(K) and P_3(k),
of the galaxy distribution by applying a maximum likelihood estimator to pixel
maps of the APM Galaxy Survey. The analysis provides optimal estimates of the
power spectra and of their covariance matrices if the fluctuations are assumed
to be Gaussian. Our estimates of P_2(K) and P_3(k) are in good agreement with
previous work but we find that the errors at low wavenumbers have been
underestimated in some earlier studies. If the galaxy power spectrum is assumed
to have the same shape as the mass power spectrum, then the APM maximum
likelihood P_3(k) estimates at k < 0.19 h Mpc^-1 constrain the amplitude and
shape parameter of a scale-invariant CDM model to lie within the 2 sigma ranges
0.78 < sigma_8_g < 1.18 and 0.05 < Gamma < 0.38. Using the Galactic extinction
estimates of Schlegel, Finkbeiner and Davis, we show that Galactic obscuration
has a negligible effect on galaxy clustering over most of the area of the APM
Galaxy Survey.
