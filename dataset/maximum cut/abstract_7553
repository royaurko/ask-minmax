We present a likelihood analysis of the parameter space of the constrained
minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (CMSSM), in which the
input scalar masses m_0 and fermion masses m_{1/2} are each assumed to be
universal. We include the full experimental likelihood function from the LEP
Higgs search as well as the likelihood from a global precision electroweak fit.
We also include the likelihoods for b to s gamma decay and (optionally) g_mu -
2. For each of these inputs, both the experimental and theoretical errors are
treated. We include the systematic errors stemming from the uncertainties in
m_t and m_b, which are important for delineating the allowed CMSSM parameter
space as well as calculating the relic density of supersymmetric particles. We
assume that these dominate the cold dark matter density, with a density in the
range favoured by WMAP. We display the global likelihood function along cuts in
the (m_{1/2}, m_0) planes for tan beta = 10 and both signs of mu, tan beta =
35, mu < 0 and tan beta = 50, mu > 0, which illustrate the relevance of g_mu -
2 and the uncertainty in m_t. We also display likelihood contours in the
(m_{1/2}, m_0) planes for these values of tan beta. The likelihood function is
generally larger for mu > 0 than for mu < 0, and smaller in the focus-point
region than in the bulk and coannihilation regions, but none of these
possibilities can yet be excluded.
