Random-effects models are frequently used to synthetize information from
different studies in meta-analysis. While likelihood-based inference is
attractive both in terms of limiting properties and in terms of implementation,
its application in random-effects meta-analysis may result in misleading
conclusions, especially when the number of studies is small to moderate. The
current paper shows that methodology designed to reduce the asymptotic bias of
the maximum likelihood estimator of the variance component can also yield
substantial improvement on inference about the mean effect size. The results
are derived for the more general framework of random-effects meta-regression,
which allows the mean effect size to vary with study-specific covariates.
