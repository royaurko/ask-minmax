We present a study of single top and single antitop quark production in the
t-channel mode at the LHC pp collider at 7 TeV, 10 TeV and 14 TeV, including
next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the production and decay of the top
quark. We discuss the effects of different O(alpha_s) contributions on the
inclusive cross section and important kinematic distributions, after imposing
the relevant cuts to select t-channel single top quark events.
