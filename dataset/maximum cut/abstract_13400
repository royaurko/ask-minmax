Two populations of minor bodies in the outer Solar System remain particularly
elusive: Scattered Disk objects and Sedna-like objects. These populations are
important dynamical tracers, and understanding the details of their spatial-
and size-distributions will enhance our understanding of the formation and
on-going evolution of the Solar System. By using newly-derived limits on the
maximum heliocentric distances that recent pencil-beam surveys for
Trans-Neptunian Objects were sensitive to, we determine new upper limits on the
total numbers of distant SDOs and Sedna-like objects. While generally
consistent with populations estimated from wide-area surveys, we show that for
magnitude-distribution slopes of {\alpha} > 0.7-1.0, these pencil-beam surveys
provide stronger upper limits than current estimates in literature.
