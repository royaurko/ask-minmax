The Casimir energy of a dilute homogeneous nonmagnetic dielectric ball at
zero temperature is derived analytically within a microscopic realistic model
of dielectrics for an arbitrary physically possible frequency dispersion of
dielectric permittivity. Divergences are absent in calculations, a minimum
interatomic distance is a physical cut-off. Casimir surface force is proved to
be attractive. A physical definition of the Casimir energy is discussed.
