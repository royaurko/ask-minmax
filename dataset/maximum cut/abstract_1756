CCD BVRI photometry is presented for two type Ia supernovae 2000E and 2001V,
for SN Ib 2001B and SN II-P 2001X. The parameters of light curves and absolute
magnitudes at maximum light are estimated. It is shown that all four supernovae
are typical for their classes considering the shape of their light curves and
maximum luminosity.
