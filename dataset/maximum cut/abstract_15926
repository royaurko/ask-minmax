The supernova remnant G347.3--0.5 emits a featureless power-law in X-rays,
thought to indicate shock-acceleration of electrons to high energies. We here
produce a broad-band spectrum of the bright NW limb of this source by combining
radio observations from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), X-ray
observations from the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA),
and TeV gamma-ray observations from the CANGAROO imaging Cerenkov telescope. We
assume this emission is produced by an electron population generated by
diffusive shock acceleration at the remnant forward shock. The nonlinear
aspects of the particle acceleration force a connection between the widely
different wavelength bands and between the electrons and the unseen ions,
presumably accelerated simultaneously with the electrons. This allows us to
infer the relativistic proton spectrum and estimate ambient parameters such as
the supernova explosion energy, magnetic field, matter density in the emission
region, and efficiency of the shock acceleration process. We find convincing
evidence that the shock acceleration is efficient, placing >25% of the shock
kinetic energy flux into relativistic ions. Despite this high efficiency, the
maximum electron and proton energies, while depending somewhat on assumptions
for the compression of the magnetic field in the shock, are well below the
observed `knee' at about 10^{15} eV in the Galactic cosmic-ray spectrum.
