We report an experimental and theoretical investigation of the electron-boson
interaction in KFe2As2 by point-contact (PC) spectroscopy, model, and ab-initio
LDA-based calculations for the standard electron-phonon Eliashberg function.
The PC spectrum viz. the second derivative of the I - V characteristic of
representative PC exhibits a pronounced maximum at about 20meV and surprisingly
a featureless behavior at lower and higher energies. We discuss phonon and
non-phonon (excitonic) mechanisms for the origin of this peak. Analysis of the
underlying source of this peak may be important for the understanding of
serious puzzles of superconductivity in this type of compounds.
