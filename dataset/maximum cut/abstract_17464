We present a Bayesian method for the identification and classification of
objects from sets of astronomical catalogs, given a predefined classification
scheme. Identification refers here to the association of entries in different
catalogs to a single object, and classification refers to the matching of the
associated data set to a model selected from a set of parametrized models of
different complexity. By the virtue of Bayes' theorem, we can combine both
tasks in an efficient way, which allows a largely automated and still reliable
way to generate classified astronomical catalogs. A problem to the Bayesian
approach is hereby the handling of exceptions, for which no likelihoods can be
specified. We present and discuss a simple and practical solution to this
problem, emphasizing the role of the "evidence" term in Bayes' theorem for the
identification of exceptions. Comparing the practice and logic of Bayesian
classification to Bayesian inference, we finally note some interesting links to
concepts of the philosophy of science.
