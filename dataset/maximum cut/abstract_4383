The weak radiative corrections to the Drell-Yan process above the Z-peak have
been studied. The compact asymptotic expression for the two heavy boson
exchange - one of the significant contributions to the investigated process -
has been obtained, the results expand in the powers of the Sudakov electroweak
logarithms. At the quark level we compare the weak radiative corrections to the
total cross section and forward-backward asymmetry with the existing results
and achieve a rather good coincidence at \sqrt{s}>= 0.5 TeV. The numerical
analysis has been performed in the high energy region corresponding to the
future experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). To simulate the
detector acceptance we used the standard CMS detector cuts. It was shown that
double Sudakov logarithms of the WW boxes are the dominant contributions in
hadronic cross section. The considered radiative corrections are significant at
high dilepton mass M and change the dilepton mass distribution up to ~+3(-12)%
at the LHC energies and M=1(5) TeV.
