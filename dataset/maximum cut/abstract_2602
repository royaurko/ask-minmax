We explore the effect of a (non) magnetic impurity on the thermal transport
of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain model. This unique system allows to probe
Kondo-type phenomena in a prototype strongly correlated system. Using numerical
diagonalization techniques we study the scaling of the frequency dependent
thermal conductivity with system size and host-impurity coupling strength as
well as the dependence on temperature. We focus in particular on the analysis
of cutting-healing of weak links or a magnetic impurity by the host chain via
Kondo-like screening as the temperature is lowered.
