We study the accretion process in the thin disk around a squashed
Kaluza-Klein black hole and probe the effects of the extra dimensional scale
$\rho_0$ on the physical properties of the disk. Our results show that with the
increase of the parameter $\rho_0$, the energy flux, the conversion efficiency,
the radiation temperature, the spectra luminosity and the spectra cut-off
frequency of the thin accretion disk decrease, but the inner border of the disk
increases. This implies that the extra dimension scale imprints in the mass
accretion process in the disk.
