Aging is a well known property of spin glass materials and has been
investigated extensively in recent years. This aging effect is commonly
observed by thermal remnant magnetization (TRM) experiments in which the
relaxation of the magnetization is found to be dependent on the time, tw, spent
at constant temperature before a field cut. The TRM curves scale with tw^\mu,
where \mu is less than 1, which is known as a "subaging" effect. The question
of whether this subaging effect is intrinsic, or due to experimental artifacts,
remains as yet unanswered. One possible experimental origin of subaging arises
from the cooling of the sample to the measuring temperature and it has been
proposed that with fast enough cooling \mu would go to 1 . Here we investigate
this possibility by studying the effect of cooling protocol on aging for 3 well
characterized spin glasses, CdCr1.7In0.3S4, Au:Fe8% and Fe0.5Mn0.5TiO3. We find
no strong influence of the cooling rate on \mu and no evidence that \mu would
go to 1 for very short cooling times. We propose additionally an argument which
shows that small (+/-150 mK) variations in the temperature of the sample during
the first tens of seconds of the TRM can significantly influence the behavior
of the relaxation of a spin glass which in turn may result in a misleading
interpretation of \mu values.
