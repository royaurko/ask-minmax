We show that the evaluation of scattering amplitudes can be formulated as a
problem of multivariate polynomial division, with the components of the
integration-momenta as indeterminates. We present a recurrence relation which,
independently of the number of loops, leads to the multi-particle pole
decomposition of the integrands of the scattering amplitudes. The recursive
algorithm is based on the Weak Nullstellensatz Theorem and on the division
modulo the Groebner basis associated to all possible multi-particle cuts. We
apply it to dimensionally regulated one-loop amplitudes, recovering the
well-known integrand-decomposition formula. Finally, we focus on the
maximum-cut, defined as a system of on-shell conditions constraining the
components of all the integration-momenta. By means of the Finiteness Theorem
and of the Shape Lemma, we prove that the residue at the maximum-cut is
parametrised by a number of coefficients equal to the number of solutions of
the cut itself.
