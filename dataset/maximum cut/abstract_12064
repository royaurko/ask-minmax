We present the measurement of superconductor / ferromagnetic Josephson
junctions, based on an epitaxial Nb bottom electrode and epitaxial Fe20Ni80
barrier. Uniform junctions have been fabricated with a barrier thicknesses in
the range 2-12 nm. The maximum critical current density ~ 2.4 \pm 0.2 * 10^9
Am^-2 was found for a devices with a 3 nm thick barrier at 4.2 K, corresponding
to an average characteristic voltage I_C R_N ~ 16 \muV. The I_C R_N showed a
non-monotonic behavior with Fe20Ni80 thickness. The variation of the resistance
of a unit area AR_N, of the junctions with barrier thickness gave a Nb/Py
specific interface resistance of 6.0 \pm 0.5 f\Omega m^2 and Fe20Ni80
resistivity of 174 \pm 50 n\Omega m, consistent with other studies in
polycrystalline samples.
