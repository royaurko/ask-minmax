Basing on new regularization-renormalization method, the $\lambda\phi^4$
model used in standard model is studied both perturbatively and
nonperturbatively (by Gaussian effective potential). The invariant property of
two mass scales is stressed and the existence of a (Landau) pole is emphasized.
Then after coupling with the SU(2)$\times$U(1) gauge fields, the Higgs mass in
standard model (SM) can be calculated as $m_H\approx$138GeV. The critical
temperature ($T_c$) for restoration of symmetry of Higgs field, the critical
energy scale ($\mu_c$, the maximum energy scale under which the lower
excitation sector of the GEP is valid) and the maximum energy scale
($\mu_{max}$, at which the symmetry of the Higgs field is restored) in the
standard model are $T_c\approx$476 GeV, $\mu_c\approx 0.547\times 10^{15}$GeV
and $\mu_{\max}\approx 0.873 \times 10^{15}$ GeVv respectively.
