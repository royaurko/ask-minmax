We present measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion in the inner 1
arcmin radius (1.3 disk scale-lengths) of the irregular galaxy NGC 4449
determined from long-slit absorption-line spectra. The average observed
dispersion is 29 +/-2 km/s, the same as predicted from NGC 4449's luminosity.
No significant rotation in the stars is detected. If we assume a maximum
rotation speed of the stars from the model determined from the gas kinematics
of Hunter et al. (2002), the ratio V_max/sigma_z measured globally is 3. This
ratio is comparable to values measured in spiral galaxies, and implies that the
stellar disk in NGC 4449 is kinematically relatively cold. The intrinsic
minor-to-major axis ratio (b/a)_0 is predicted to be in the range 0.3-0.6,
similar to values derived from the distribution of observed b/a of Im galaxies.
However, V/sigma_z measured locally is 0.5-1.1, and so the circular velocity of
NGC 4449 is comparable or less than the velocity of the stars within the
central 1.3 disk scale-lengths of the galaxy.
