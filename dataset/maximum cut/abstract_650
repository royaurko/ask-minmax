In the context of constructing one-loop amplitudes using a unitarity
bootstrap approach we discuss a general systematic procedure for obtaining the
coefficients of the scalar bubble and triangle integral functions of one-loop
amplitudes. Coefficients are extracted after examining the behaviour of the cut
integrand as the unconstrained parameters of a specifically chosen
parametersiation of the cut loop momentum approach infinity.
