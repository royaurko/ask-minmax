I analyze unpublished or partially published archival ROSAT data of the rho
Ophiuchi dark cloud. This set of seven overlapping ROSAT HRI pointings,
composed of eight ~one-hour exposures, detects mainly the X-ray brightest T
Tauri stars of this star-forming region. Only two HRI sources are new X-ray
sources, and their optical counterparts are proposed as new Weak T Tauri star
candidates. Meanwhile the ROSAT HRI caught during just one exposure a weak
X-ray source (maximum likelihood=10; SNR=4.1\sigma for Gaussian statistics)
among a group of three embedded young stellar objects including two Class I
protostars. Previous ROSAT PSPC, ASCA GIS observations, and as I argue here one
Einstein IPC observation, have already detected an X-ray source in this area,
but this higher angular resolution data show clearly that X-rays are emitted by
the Class I protostar YLW16A. This is the second Class I protostar detected by
the ROSAT HRI in this dark cloud. The determination of the intrinsic X-ray
luminosity of this event, L_X[0.1-2.4 keV]=(9.4-450)*1E30 erg/s, critically
depends on the source absorption estimate. Improvements will be obtained only
by the direct determination of this parameter from fitting of Chandra and
XMM-Newton spectra.
