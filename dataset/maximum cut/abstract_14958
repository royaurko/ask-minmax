We report in this paper, measurements of the nonlinear susceptibility
\chi_sub3(T) in the metamagnetic heavy fermion (HF) compound UPt3. At high
temperatures, \chi_sub3(T) < 0 and small. It turns positive for T less than
35K, forms a peak at T = 10K and then decreases to zero with further decreasing
temperature. The peak in \chi_sub3 occurs at a temperature T3 roughly half of
T1, the temperature of the maximum in the linear susceptibility. We present
results on URu2Si2 and UPd2Al3 to show that this feature is common to other HF
materials. A two level model to describe the metamagnetic transition, with
separation between the levels being the only energy scale, captures all
experimentally observed features.
