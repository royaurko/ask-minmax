We consider a stochastic partial differential equation with reflection at 0
and with the constraint of conservation of the space average. The equation is
driven by the derivative in space of a space--time white noise and contains a
double Laplacian in the drift. Due to the lack of the maximum principle for the
double Laplacian, the standard techniques based on the penalization method do
not yield existence of a solution. We propose a method based on infinite
dimensional integration by parts formulae, obtaining existence and uniqueness
of a strong solution for all continuous nonnegative initial conditions and
detailed information on the associated invariant measure and Dirichlet form.
