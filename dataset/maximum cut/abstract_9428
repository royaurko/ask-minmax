This article describes a moving-windowed autocorrelation technique which,
when applied to an asteroseismic Fourier power spectrum, can be used to
automatically detect the frequency of maximum p-mode power, large and small
separations, mean p-mode linewidth, and constrain the stellar inclination angle
and rotational splitting. The technique is illustrated using data from the
CoRoT and Kepler space telescopes and tested using artificial data.
