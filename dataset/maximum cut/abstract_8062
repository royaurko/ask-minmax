The effect of surface termination on the inverse Goos-H\"anchen (GH) shift of
two-dimensional (2D) negatively refractive photonic crystal (NRPhC) containing
air holes arranged in hexagonal lattice in a dielectric background is
investigated. Results show that the magnitude of the inverse GH shift of
2D-NRPhC strongly depends on surface termination even for an incident beam with
a fixed frequency and incidence angle, whereas the effective index of 2D-NRPhC
remains constant. TM-polarized light is characterized by an inverse GH shift of
more than twenties of lattices, whereas TE-polarized light exhibits
infinitesimal inverse GH shift when the surface is terminated with the
outermost row of air holes complete. However, an inverse condition occurs when
the outermost row of air holes is cut in quarter or so. In addition, the
coupling coefficient of incident field into backward surface field of 2D-NRPhC
is determined as a function of surface termination. Result shows that inverse
GH shift is closely related to coupling coefficient, the larger coupling
coefficient the larger inverse GH shift. This paper provides technical
information regarding the combination of various functional photonic elements
in the design of integrated optical circuits.
