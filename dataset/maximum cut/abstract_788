Finite cut-off effects strongly influence the thermodynamics of lattice
regularized QCD at high temperature in the standard Wilson formulation. We
analyze the reduction of finite cut-off effects in formulations of the
thermodynamics of $SU(N)$ gauge theories with three different $O(a^2)$ and
$O(a^4)$ improved actions. We calculate the energy density and pressure on
finite lattices in leading order weak coupling perturbation theory
($T\rightarrow \infty$) and perform Monte Carlo simulations with improved
$SU(3)$ actions at non-zero $g^2$. Already on lattices with temporal extent
$N_\tau=4$ we find a strong reduction of finite cut-off effects in the high
temperature limit, which persists also down to temperatures a few times the
deconfinement transition temperature.
