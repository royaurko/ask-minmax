Surface enhanced Raman spectra of Phenylalanine (Phe) in Ag colloidal
solution have been recorded for Phe solutions of different pH. Spectral
line-shape analyses of the enhanced modes, at 1005, 1380 and 1582 cm-1, between
pH 4.5 and 10.5, have been carried out. The variation of spectral line-width
with pH reveals two possible mechanisms in solution: (i) the fluctuation of pH
in microscopic volume in an overall uniform pH solution and/or (ii) the
motional narrowing caused by the intermolecular ionic interaction. We suggest
that different charge states of the reference molecule are responsible for the
observed bond softening with decrease in pH. The observed Raman shift and the
Raman activity of the vibrational modes with maximum enhancement have been
explained by carrying out DFT calculations.
