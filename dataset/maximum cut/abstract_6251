The complete set of data from the Tenerife 10 GHz (8 degree FWHM) twin-horn,
drift scan experiment is described. These data are affected by both long-term
atmospheric baseline drifts and short term noise. A new maximum entropy
procedure, utilising the time invariance and spatial continuity of the
astronomical signal, is used to achieve a clean separation of these effects
from the astronomical signal, and to deconvolve the effects of the
beam-switching. We use a fully positive/negative algorithm to produce
two-dimensional maps of the intrinsic sky fluctuations. Known discrete sources
and Galactic features are identified in the deconvolved map. The data from the
10 GHz experiment, after baseline subtraction with MEM, is then analysed using
conventional techniques and new constraints on Galactic emission are made.
