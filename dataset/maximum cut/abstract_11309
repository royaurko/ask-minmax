We present high-resolution central-to-outer rotation curves for Sb, SBb, Sc,
and SBc galaxies. We discuss their general characteristics, particularly their
central behavior, as well as dependencies on morphological types, activity, and
peculiarity. The rotation curves generally show a steep nuclear rise, and
high-velocity central rotation, followed by a broad maximum in the disk and
then by a flat rotation due to the massive halo. Since the central high
velocity and steep rise are common to all massive galaxies, it cannot be due to
non-circular motions. Disk rotation curves of barred galaxies show larger
dispersion than those of normal galaxies which is probably due to non-circular
motions. Interacting galaxies show often perturbed outer rotation curves, while
their central rotation shows no particular peculiarity. Also, central
activities, such as starbursts and AGN, appear to show no particular
correlation with the property of rotation curves. This would suggest that the
central activities are triggered by a more local effect than the global
dynamical property.
