For the first time a proper comparison of the average depth of shower maximum
($X_{\rm max}$) published by the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Observatories
is presented. The $X_{\rm max}$ distributions measured by the Pierre Auger
Observatory were fit using simulated events initiated by four primaries
(proton, helium, nitrogen and iron). The primary abundances which best describe
the Auger data were simulated through the Telescope Array (TA) Middle Drum (MD)
fluorescence and surface detector array. The simulated events were analyzed by
the TA Collaboration using the same procedure as applied to their data. The
result is a simulated version of the Auger data as it would be observed by TA.
This analysis allows a direct comparison of the evolution of $\langle X_{\rm
max} \rangle$ with energy of both data sets. The $\langle X_{\rm max} \rangle$
measured by TA-MD is consistent with a preliminary simulation of the Auger data
through the TA detector and the average difference between the two data sets
was found to be $(2.9 \pm 2.7\;(\text{stat.}) \pm
18\;(\text{syst.}))~\text{g/cm}^2$.
