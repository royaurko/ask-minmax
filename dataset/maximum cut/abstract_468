We introduce the notion of the cutting strip of an outside decomposition of a
skew shape, and show that cutting strips are in one-to-one correspondence with
outside decompositions for a given skew shape. Outside decompositions are
introduced by Hamel and Goulden and are used to give an identity for the skew
Schur function that unifies the determinantal expressions for the skew Schur
functions including the Jacobi-Trudi determinant, its dual, the Giambelli
determinant and the rim ribbon determinant due to Lascoux and Pragacz. Using
cutting strips, one obtains a formula for the number of outside decompositions
of a given skew shape. Moreover, one can define the basic transformations which
we call the twist transformation among cutting strips, and derive a
transformation theorem for the determinantal formula of Hamel and Goulden. The
special case of the transformation theorem for the Giambelli identity and the
rim ribbon identity was obtained by Lascoux and Pragacz. Our transformation
theorem also applies to the supersymmetric skew Schur function.
