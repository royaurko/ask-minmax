We study spherically symmetric regular and black hole solutions in the
Einstein-Skyrme theory with a negative cosmological constant. The Skyrme field
configuration depends on the value of the cosmological constant in a similar
manner to effectively varying the gravitational constant. We find the maximum
value of the cosmological constant above which there exists no solution. The
properties of the solutions are discussed in comparison with the asymptotically
flat solutions. The stability is investigated in detail by solving the linearly
perturbed equation numerically. We show that there exists a critical value of
the cosmological constant above which the solution in the branch representing
unstable configuration in the asymptotically flat spacetime turns to be
linearly stable.
