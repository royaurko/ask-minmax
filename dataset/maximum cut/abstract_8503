Al1-xCrxN thin films with 0.02?x?0.1 were deposited by reactive co-sputtering
onto c-plane (001) sapphire. Room-temperature ferromagnetism with a coercive
field of 85 Oe was observed in samples with chromium contents as low as x =
0.027 (2.7%). With increasing Cr content the mean magnetic moment is strongly
suppressed, with a maximum saturation moment of 0.62 and 0.71 ?B per Cr atom at
300 and 50 K respectively. We show that the Curie temperature of Al1-xCrxN for
x = 0.027 is greater than 900 K.
