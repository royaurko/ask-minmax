We present and study the results for the standard model process $e^+e^-\to
\nu\bar{\nu}b\bar{b}$ at c.m energies 150$\leq \sqrt{s} (GeV) \leq $ 240 and
for Higgs boson masses $80 GeV \leq m_H \leq 120 GeV$, obtained from all
tree-level diagrams and including the most important radiative corrections. The
$\sqrt{s}$ dependence and the interference properties of the Higgs boson
contribution and of various coherent background contributions to the total
cross section are examined. The effect of the QED initial state radiative
corrections is estimated. The important differential distributions for the
Higgs boson and the background components are studied, providing information
usefull for choosing cuts in Higgs searches. We also examine the effect of a
minimal set of cuts and evaluate the importance of the WW fusion for detecting
a higher mass Higgs boson at LEPII.
