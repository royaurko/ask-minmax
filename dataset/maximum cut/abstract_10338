Present study deals with the model calculations of CO Cameron band and CO2+
ultraviolet doublet emissions in the dayglow of Venus. The overhead and limb
intensities of CO Cameron band and CO2+ UV doublet emissions are calculated for
low, moderate, and high solar activity conditions. Using updated cross
sections, the impact of dierent e-CO cross section for Cameron band production
is estimated. The electron impact on CO is the major source mechanism of
Cameron band, followed by electron and photon impact dissociation of CO2. The
overhead intensities of CO Cameron band and CO2+ UV doublet emissions are about
a factor of 2 higher in solar maximum than those in solar minimum condition.
The effect of solar EUV flux models on the emission intensity is ~30-40% in
solar minimum condition and ~2-10% in solar maximum condition. At the altitude
of emission peak (135 km), the model predicted limb intensity of CO Cameron
band and CO2+ UV doublet emissions in moderate (F10.7 = 130) solar activity
condition is about 2400 and 300 kR, respectively, which is in agreement with
the very recently published SPICAV/Venus Express observation. The model limb
intensity profiles of CO Cameron band and CO2+ UV doublet are compared with
SPICAV observation. We also calculated intensities of N2 Vegard-Kaplan UV bands
and OI 2972 {\AA} emissions during moderate and high solar activity conditions.
