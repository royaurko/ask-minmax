Many problems in evolutionary theory are cast in dyadic terms, such as the
polar oppositions of organism and environment. We argue that a triadic
conceptual structure offers an alternative perspective under which the
information generating role of evolution as a physical process can be analyzed,
and propose a new diagrammatic approach. Peirce's natural philosophy was deeply
influenced by his reception of both Darwin's theory and thermodynamics. Thus,
we elaborate on a new synthesis which puts together his theory of signs and
modern Maximum Entropy approaches to evolution. Following recent contributions
to the naturalization of Peircean semiosis, we show that triadic structures
involve the conjunction of three different kinds of causality, efficient,
formal and final. We apply this on Ulanowicz's analysis of autocatalytic cycles
as primordial patterns of life. This paves the way for a semiotic view of
thermodynamics which is built on the idea that Peircean interpretants are
systems of physical inference devices evolving under natural selection. In this
view, the principles of Maximum Entropy, Maximum Power, and Maximum Entropy
Production work together to drive the emergence of information carrying
structures, which at the same time maximize information capacity as well as the
gradients of energy flows, such that ultimately, contrary to Schroedinger's
seminal contribution, the evolutionary process is seen to be a physical
expression of the Second Law.
