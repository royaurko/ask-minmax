We consider QCD radiative corrections to WW pair production in hadron
collisions. We perform a calculation that consistently combines next-to-leading
order predictions with soft-gluon resummation valid at small transverse momenta
ptWW of the WW pair. We present results for the ptWW distribution at the LHC up
to (almost) next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, and study the effect
of resummation on the charged-lepton distributions. Soft-gluon effects are
typically mild, but they can be strongly enhanced when hard cuts are applied.
The relevant distributions are generally well described by the MC@NLO event
generator.
