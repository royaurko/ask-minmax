We address the electronic structure and magnetic properties of vacancies and
voids both in graphene and graphene ribbons. Using a mean field Hubbard model,
we study the appearance of magnetic textures associated to removing a single
atom (vacancy) and multiple adjacent atoms (voids) as well as the magnetic
interactions between them. A simple set of rules, based upon Lieb theorem, link
the atomic structure and the spatial arrangement of the defects to the emerging
magnetic order. The total spin $S$ of a given defect depends on its sublattice
imbalance, but some defects with S=0 can still have local magnetic moments. The
sublattice imbalance also determines whether the defects interact
ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically with one another and the range of
these magnetic interactions is studied in some simple cases. We find that in
semiconducting armchair ribbons and two-dimensional graphene without global
sublattice imbalance there is maximum defect density above which local
magnetization disappears. Interestingly, the electronic properties of
semiconducting graphene ribbons with uncoupled local moments are very similar
to those of diluted magnetic semiconductors, presenting giant Zeeman splitting.
