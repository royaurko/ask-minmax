In this paper we obtain new results concerning maximum modulus of the polar
derivative of a polynomial with restricted zeros. Our results generalize and
refine upon the results of Aziz and Shah [An integral mean estimate for
polynomial, Indian J. Pure Appl. Math. 28 (1997) 1413--1419] and Gardner, Govil
and Weems [Some result concerning rate of growth of polynomials, East J.
Apporox. 10(2004) 301--312].
