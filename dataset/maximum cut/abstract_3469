We present nine near-infrared (NIR) spectra of supernova (SN) 2005cf at
epochs from -10 d to +42 d with respect to B-band maximum, complementing the
existing excellent data sets available for this prototypical Type Ia SN at
other wavelengths. The spectra show a time evolution and spectral features
characteristic of normal Type Ia SNe, as illustrated by a comparison with SNe
1999ee, 2002bo and 2003du. The broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) of
SN 2005cf is studied in combined ultraviolet (UV), optical and NIR spectra at
five epochs between ~ 8 d before and ~ 10 d after maximum light. We also
present synthetic spectra of the hydrodynamic explosion model W7, which
reproduce the key properties of SN 2005cf not only at UV-optical as previously
reported, but also at NIR wavelengths. From the radiative-transfer calculations
we infer that fluorescence is the driving mechanism that shapes the SED of SNe
Ia. In particular, the NIR part of the spectrum is almost devoid of absorption
features, and instead dominated by fluorescent emission of both iron-group
material and intermediate-mass elements at pre-maximum epochs, and pure
iron-group material after maximum light. A single P-Cygni feature of Mg II at
early epochs and a series of relatively unblended Co II lines at late phases
allow us to constrain the regions of the ejecta in which the respective
elements are abundant.
