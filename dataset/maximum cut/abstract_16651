We report on recent studies of the spin-half Heisenberg and the Hubbard model
on the sawtooth chain. For both models we construct a class of exact
eigenstates which are localized due to the frustrating geometry of the lattice
for a certain relation of the exchange (hopping) integrals. Although these
eigenstates differ in details for the two models because of the different
statistics, they share some characteristic features. The localized eigenstates
are highly degenerate and become ground states in high magnetic fields
(Heisenberg model) or at certain electron fillings (Hubbard model),
respectively. They may dominate the low-temperature thermodynamics and lead to
an extra low-temperature maximum in the specific heat. The ground-state
degeneracy can be calculated exactly by a mapping of the manifold of localized
ground states onto a classical hard-dimer problem, and explicit expressions for
thermodynamic quantities can be derived which are valid at low temperatures
near the saturation field for the Heisenberg model or around a certain value of
the chemical potential for the Hubbard model, respectively.
