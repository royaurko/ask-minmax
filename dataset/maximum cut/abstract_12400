We consider the Z Q Qbar vertex to second order in the QCD coupling for an
on-shell massive quark-antiquark pair and for arbitrary momentum transfer of
the Z boson. We present closed analytic expressions for the two
parity-violating form factors of that vertex at the two-loop level in QCD,
excluding the contributions from triangle diagrams. These form factors are
expressed in terms of 1-dimensional harmonic polylogarithms of maximum weight
4.
