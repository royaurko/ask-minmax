Exact calculations of innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around rotating
strange stars are performed within the framework of general relativity.
Equations of state (EOS) of strange quark matter based on the MIT Bag Model
with massive strange quarks and lowest order QCD interactions, are used. The
presence of a solid crust of normal matter on rotating, mass accreting strange
stars in LMXBs is taken into account. It is found that, contrary to neutron
stars, above some minimum mass a gap always separates the ISCO and stellar
surface, independently of the strange star rotation rate. For a given baryon
mass of strange star, we calculate the ISCO frequency as function of stellar
rotation frequency, from static to Keplerian configuration. For masses close to
the maximum mass of static configurations the ISCO frequencies for static and
Keplerian configurations are similar. However, for masses significantly lower
than the maximum mass of static configurations, the minimum value of the ISCO
frequency is reached in the Keplerian limit. Presence of a solid crust
increases the ISCO frequency for the Keplerian configuration by about ten
percent compared to that for a bare strange star of the same mass.
