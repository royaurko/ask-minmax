In this note we prove the dual representation formula of the divergence
between two distributions in a parametric model. Resulting estimators for the
divergence as for the parameter are derived. These estimators do not make use
of any grouping nor smoothing. It is proved that all differentiable divergences
induce the same estimator of the parameter on any regular exponential family,
which is nothing else but the MLE.
