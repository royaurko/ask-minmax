In this paper, we study the large time behavior of solutions of a class of
parabolic fully nonlinear integro-differential equations in a periodic setting.
In order to do so, we first solve the ergodic problem}(or cell problem), i.e.
we construct solutions of the form $\lambda t + v(x)$. We then prove that
solutions of the Cauchy problem look like those specific solutions as time goes
to infinity. We face two key difficulties to carry out this classical program:
(i) the fact that we handle the case of "mixed operators" for which the
required ellipticity comes from a combination of the properties of the local
and nonlocal terms and (ii) the treatment of the superlinear case (in the
gradient variable). Lipschitz estimates previously proved by the contributors (2012)
and Strong Maximum principles proved by the third contributor (2012) play a crucial
role in the analysis.
