In this paper we investigate the equilibrium self-gravitating radiation in
higher dimensional, plane symmetric anti-de Sitter space. We find that there
exist essential differences from the spherically symmetric case: In each
dimension ($d\geq 4$), there are maximal mass (density), maximal entropy
(density) and maximal temperature configurations, they do not appear at the
same central energy density; the oscillation behavior appearing in the
spherically symmetric case, does not happen in this case; and the mass
(density), as a function of the central energy density, increases first and
reaches its maximum at a certain central energy density and then decreases
monotonically in $ 4\le d \le 7$, while in $d \geq 8$, besides the maximum, the
mass (density) of the equilibrium configuration has a minimum: the mass
(density) first increases and reaches its maximum, then decreases to its
minimum and then increases to its asymptotic value monotonically. The reason
causing the difference is discussed.
