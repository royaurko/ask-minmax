We calculate the triton binding energy with a non-local NN potential that
fits the world NN data below 350 MeV with the almost perfect $\chi^2$/datum of
1.03. The non-locality is derived from relativistic meson field theory. The
result obtained in a 34-channel, charge-dependent Faddeev calculation is 8.00
MeV, which is 0.4 MeV above the predictions by local NN potentials. The
increase in binding energy can be clearly attributed to the off-shell behavior
of the non-local potential. Our result cuts in half the discrepancy between
theory and experiment established from local NN potentials. Implications for
other areas of microscopic nuclear structure, in which underbinding is a
traditional problem, are discussed.
