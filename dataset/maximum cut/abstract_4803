We review selected results from a recent in-depth study of jet shapes and jet
cross sections in ultra-relativistic reactions with heavy nuclei at the LHC
arXiv:0810.2807 [hep-ph]. We demonstrate that at the highest collider energies
these observables become feasible as a new, differential and accurate test of
the underlying QCD theory. Our approach allows for detailed simulations of the
experimental acceptance/cuts that help isolate jets emerging from a dense QGP.
We show for the first time that the pattern of stimulated gluon emission can be
correlated with a variable quenching of the jet rates and provide an
approximately model-independent approach to determining the characteristics of
the medium-induced bremsstrahlung spectrum. The connection between such cross
section attenuation and the in-medium jet shapes is elucidated.
