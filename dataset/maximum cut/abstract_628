In this note we derive some consequences from the Mari\~no-Vafa formula and
the cut-and-join equation, these include unified simple proofs of the
$\lambda_g$ conjecture and some other Hodge integral identities. We also
describe a proof of the ELSV formula relating Hurwitz numbers and Hodge
integrals by using the cut-and-join equation, following our proof of the
Mari\~no-Vafa formula.
