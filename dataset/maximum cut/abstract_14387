The modeling and analysis of lifetimes is an important aspect of statistical
work in a wide variety of scientific and technological fields. For the first
time, the called Kumaraswamy Pareto distribution is introduced and studied. The
new distribution can have a decreasing and upside-down bathtub failure rate
function depending on the values of its parameters. It includes as special
sub-models the Pareto and exponentiated Pareto (Gupta et al. [12])
distributions. Some structural properties of the proposed distribution are
studied including explicit expressions for the moments and generating function.
We provide the density function of the order statistics and obtain their
moments. The method of maximum likelihood is used for estimating the model
parameters and the observed information matrix is derived. A real data set is
used to compare the new model with widely known distributions.
