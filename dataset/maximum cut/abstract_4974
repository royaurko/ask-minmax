We compute transplanckian parton scattering in flat extra-dimensional
theories at the LHC and at the recently discussed high-energy upgrade (HE LHC).
We report new leading-order calculations of the QCD background. We apply
appropriate cuts to satisfy the necessary conditions for the eikonal
approximation to be valid while at the same time maximising the signal to
background ratio at LHC energies. We study the computability of the eikonal
signal and consider the effect of a possible 33 TeV high-energy upgrade to the
LHC, which serves to extend the calculable region and to enhance the signal to
background ratio.
