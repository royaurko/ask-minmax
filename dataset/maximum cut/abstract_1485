In this paper, we discuss the connected sum K_1#^Z K_2 of simplicial
complexes K_1 and K_2, as well as define the notion of a strong connected sum.
Geometrically, the connected sum is motivated by Lerman's symplectic cut
applied to a toric orbifold, and algebraically, it is motivated by the
connected sum of rings introduced by Ananthnarayan-Avramov-Moore.
  We show that the Stanley-Reisner ring of a connected sum K_1#^Z K_2 is the
connected sum of the Stanley-Reisner rings of K_1 and K_2 along the
Stanley-Reisner ring of the intersection of K_1 and K_2. The strong connected
sum K_1 #^Z K_2 is defined in such a way that when K_1 and K_2 are Gorenstein,
and Z is a suitable subset of the intersection of K_1 and K_2, then the
Stanley-Reisner ring of the connected sum is Gorenstein, by the work of
Ananthnarayan-Avramov-Moore. These algebraic computations can be interpreted in
terms of the equivariant cohomology of moment angle complexes and we also
describe the symplectic cut of a toric orbifold in terms of moment angle
complexes.
