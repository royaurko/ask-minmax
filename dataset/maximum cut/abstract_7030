A topological graph is $k$-quasi-planar if it does not contain $k$ pairwise
crossing edges. An old conjecture states that for every fixed $k$, the maximum
number of edges in a $k$-quasi-planar graph on $n$ vertices is $O(n)$. Fox and
Pach showed that every $k$-quasi-planar graph with $n$ vertices and no pair of
edges intersecting in more than $O(1)$ points has at most $n(\frac{\log n}{\log
k})^{O(\log k)}$ edges. We improve this upper bound to $2^{\alpha(n)^c}n\log
n$, where $\alpha(n)$ denotes the inverse Ackermann function, and $c$ depends
only on $k$. We also show that every $k$-quasi-planar graph with $n$ vertices
and every two edges have at most one point in common has at most $O(n\log n)$
edges. This improves the previously known upper bound of $2^{\alpha(n)^c}n\log
n$ obtained by Fox, Pach, and Suk.
