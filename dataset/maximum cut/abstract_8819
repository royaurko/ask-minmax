A new transient regime in the relaxation towards absolute equilibrium of the
conservative and time-reversible 3-D Euler equation with high-wavenumber
spectral truncation is characterized. Large-scale dissipative effects, caused
by the thermalized modes that spontaneously appear between a transition
wavenumber and the maximum wavenumber, are calculated using fluctuation
dissipation relations. The large-scale dynamics is found to be similar to that
of high-Reynolds number Navier-Stokes equations and thus to obey (at least
approximately) Kolmogorov scaling.
