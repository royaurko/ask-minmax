The IceCube collaboration has built an in-ice neutrino telescope and a
surface detector array, IceTop, at the South Pole. Over 5000 digital optical
modules have been deployed in a cubic kilometer of ice between 1450 and 2450 m
below the surface. The novel observatory provides a new window to explore the
universe. The combination of cutting-edge discovery science and the exotic
Antarctic environment is an ideal vehicle to excite and engage a wide audience.
Examples of how the international IceCube Collaboration has brought the
Universe to a broader audience via the South Pole are described.
