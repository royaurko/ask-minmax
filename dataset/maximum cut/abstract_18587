An updated analysis of all available neutrino oscillation evidence in Solar
experiments including the latest $SNO$ data is presented. Predictions for total
rates and day-night asymmetry in Borexino are calculated. Our analysis features
the use of exhaustive computation of the neutrino oscillation probabilities and
the use of an improved statistical $\chi^2$ minimization.
  In the framework of two neutrino oscillations we conclude that the best fit
to the data is obtained in the LMA region with parameters $(\Delta m^2,
\tan^2\theta) = (5.2 \times 10^{-5} \eV^2, 0.47)$, ($\chi^2_{min}/n=0.82$,
$n=38$ degrees of freedom). Although less favored, solutions in the LOW and VAC
regions are still possible with a reasonable statistical significance. The best
possible solution in the SMA region gets as maximum a statistical significance
as low as $\sim 3%$.
  We study the implications of these results for the prospects of Borexino and
the possibility of discriminating between the different solutions. The expected
normalized Borexino signal is 0.62 at the best fit LMA solution while the DN
asymmetry is negligible (approximately $10^{-5}$). In the LOW region the signal
is in the range $\sim 0.6-0.7$ at 90% confidence level while the asymmetry is
$\simeq 1-20%$. As a consequence, the combined Borexino measurements of the
total event rate with a error below $\pm 5-10%$ and day-night total rate
asymmetry with a precision comparable to the one of SuperKamiokande, will have
a strong chance of distinguishing or at least strongly favoring one of the
Solar neutrino solutions provided by present data.
