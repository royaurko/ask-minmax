The "effective exponent theory", developed by Wang, Millis and Das Sarma in
[Phys. Rev. B 69, 167101 (2004), Phys. Rev. B 64, 193307 (2001)], fails to
calculate correctly the dynamic correlators of Coulomb Luttinger liquid. Main
drawbacks are (i) cutting off the Coulomb potential by killing its long-range
component, (ii) the absence of non-contradictory procedure to determine the
'scaling cutoff' and correlation functions for true Coulomb interaction.
