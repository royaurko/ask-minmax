The Bogoliubov-Dirac-Fock (BDF) model allows to describe relativistic
electrons interacting with the Dirac sea. It can be seen as a mean-field
approximation of Quantum Electro-dynamics (QED) where photons are neglected.
This paper treats the case of an electron together with the Dirac sea in the
absence of any external field. Such a system is described by its one-body
density matrix, an infinite rank, self-adjoint operator which is a compact
pertubation of the negative spectral projector of the free Dirac operator. The
parameters of the model are the coupling constant $\alpha>0$ and the
ultraviolet cut-off $\Lambda>0$: we consider the subspace of squared integrable
functions made of the functions whose Fourier transform vanishes outside the
ball $B(0,\La)$. We prove the existence of minimizers of the BDF-energy under
the charge constraint of one electron and no external field provided that
$\alpha,\La^{-1}$ and $\alpha\llo$ are sufficiently small. The interpretation
is the following: in this regime the electron creates a polarization in the
Dirac vacuum which allows it to bind. We then study the non-relativistic limit
of such a system in which the speed of light tends to infinity (or equivalently
$\alpha$ tends to zero) with $\alpha\llo$ fixed: after rescaling the electronic
solution tends to the Choquard-Pekar ground state.
