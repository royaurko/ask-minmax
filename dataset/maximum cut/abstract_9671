Let $G$ be a finite group of order $n$, and let $C_n$ be the cyclic group of
order $n$. We show that $\sum_{g \in C_n} \phi(\mathrm{o}(g))\geq \sum_{g \in
G} \phi(\mathrm{o}(g))$, with equality if and only if $G$ is isomorphic to
$C_n$. As an application, we show that among all finite groups of a given
order, the cyclic group of that order has the maximum number of undirected
edges in its directed power graph.
