The loop level lepton flavor violating signals $\gamma \gamma \to \ell \ell'
  (\ell=e,\mu,\tau, \ell \neq \ell^\prime)$ are studied in a scenario of
low-energy, R-parity conserving, supersymmetric seesaw mechanism within the
context of a high energy photon collider. Lepton flavor violation is due to off
diagonal elements in the left s-lepton mass matrix induced by renormalization
group equations. The average slepton masses ${\widetilde{m}}$ and the off
diagonal matrix elements $\Delta m$ are treated as model independent free
phenomenological parameters in order to discover regions in the parameter space
where the signal cross section may be observable. At the energies of the
$\gamma \gamma$ option of the future high-energy linear collider the signal has
a potentially large standard model background, and therefore particular
attention is paid to the study of kinematical cuts in order to reduce the
latter at an acceptable level. We find, for the ($e\tau$) channel,
non-negligible fractions of the parameter space ($\delta_{LL}=\Delta
m^2/\widetilde{m}^2 \gtrsim 10^{-1}$) where the statistical significance ($SS$)
is $SS \gtrsim 3$.
