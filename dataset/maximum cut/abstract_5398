Previous studies of the semilinear wave equation in Minkowski space have
shown a type of critical behavior in which large initial data collapse to
singularity formation due to nonlinearities while small initial data does not.
Numerical solutions in spherically symmetric Anti-de Sitter (AdS) are presented
here which suggest that, in contrast, even small initial data collapse
eventually. Such behavior appears analogous to the recent result of Ref. [1]
that found that even weak, scalar initial data collapse gravitationally to
black hole formation via a weakly turbulent instability. Furthermore, the
imposition of a reflecting boundary condition in the bulk introduces a cut-off,
below which initial data fails to collapse. This threshold appears to arise
because of the dispersion introduced by the boundary condition.
