In this work we study the electric charge effect on the cross section
production of charged mini black holes (MBH) in accelerators. We analyze the
charged MBH solution using the {\it fat brane} approximation in the context of
the ADD model. The maximum charge-mass ratio condition for the existence of a
horizon radius is discussed. We show that the electric charge causes a decrease
in this radius and, consequently, in the cross section. This reduction is
negligible for protons and light ions but can be important for heavy ions.
