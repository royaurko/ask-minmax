We present results of searching for the possible typical scales in the
spatial distribution of QSOs. Our method is based on the second derivative of
the two-point correlation function. This statistic is sensitive to the scale of
the maximum in the spectrum $P(k)$ of the density perturbation in the universe.
This maximum or bend scale can be detected as the wavelengths of the periodic
component in the second derivative of the integral correlation function. For
various QSO samples compiled from surveys of pencil-beam and bright QSOs, a
typical scale of about 93 $\pm$ 10 h$^{-1}$Mpc for $q_0=0.5$ has been detected.
This typical scale is in good agreement with that found in the spatial
distributions of galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and CIV absorption systems of
QSOs if $q_0$ is taken to be $\sim 0.2$. Therefore, it is likely a common or
universal scale in the large scale structure traced by these objects. This
result is consistent with the assumption that the typical scale comes from a
characteristic scale in the spectrum of the density perturbation in the
universe.
