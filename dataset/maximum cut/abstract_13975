A linear coloring of a graph is a proper coloring of the vertices of the
graph so that each pair of color classes induce a union of disjoint paths. In
this paper, we prove that for every connected graph with maximum degree at most
three and every assignment of lists of size four to the vertices of the graph,
there exists a linear coloring such that the color of each vertex belongs to
the list assigned to that vertex and the neighbors of every degree-two vertex
receive different colors, unless the graph is $C_5$ or $K_{3,3}$. This confirms
a conjecture raised by Esperet, Montassier, and Raspaud. Our proof is
constructive and yields a linear-time algorithm to find such a coloring.
