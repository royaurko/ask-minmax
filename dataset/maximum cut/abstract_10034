It is shown that the large effect of heavy ion-irradiation on the
thermodynamical properties of the anisotropic superconductor
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ extends well into the superconducting
fluctuation regime. The presence of the induced amorphous columnar defects
shifts the specific heat maximum at the normal-to-superconducting transition.
This effect is similar to that recently put into evidence in cubic
K$_{x}$Ba$_{1-x}$BiO$_{3}$ ($x \simeq 0.35$). In both compounds, vortex pinning
manifests itself as a sharp angular dependence of the \em equilibrium \rm
torque. In YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$, pinning by the defects appears at
the temperature $T_{C_{p}}^{max}$ of the specific heat maximum, well above the
magnetic irreversibility line $T_{irr}(H)$. In isotropic
K$_{x}$Ba$_{1-x}$BiO$_{3}$, the onset of the pinning-related torque anomaly
tracks the onset of the specific heat anomaly and the irreversibility line. In
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$, fluctuations of the amplitude of the order
parameter (and not vortex line wandering) are ultimately responsible for the
vanishing of pinning. In K$_{x}$Ba$_{1-x}$BiO$_{3}$, vortex pinning disappears
only at the superconducting-to-normal transition. The results indicate that in
both compounds, the pinning energy at the ``Bose glass'' transition is large
with respect to the total free energy gain in the superconducting state. By
implication, the mechanism of this latter transition should be reconsidered.
