The regions of hole concentrations $0 \leq x \alt 0.3$ and temperatures
$0.005|t| \leq T \leq 0.02|t|$ are studied in the t-J model of Cu-O planes of
perovskite high-$T_c$ superconductors. For this purpose self-energy equations
for hole and spin Green's functions are derived using Mori's projection
operator technique and these equations are self-consistently solved. The
calculated hole band transforms radically at $x\approx 0.08$. A narrow
low-concentration band with minima near $(\pm\frac{\pi}{2},\pm\frac{\pi}{2})$
is converted to a band resembling the case of weak electron correlations, with
the minimum at $(\pi,\pi)$ or $(0,0)$. The hole Fermi surface is respectively
changed from small ellipses at $(\pm\frac{\pi}{2},\pm\frac{\pi}{2})$ to a large
rhombus centered at $(\pi,\pi)$ or $(0,0)$. The decrease of the magnetic
susceptibility at the antiferromagnetic wave vector and spin correlations with
doping is determined by the growth of the frequency of spin excitations at this
momentum. The shape of the frequency dependence of the susceptibility depends
heavily on the hole damping and varies from a broad feature similar to that
observed in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ to a pronounced maximum which resembles the
normal-state resonance peak in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-y}$.
