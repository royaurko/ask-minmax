We investigate the behaviour of a new general class of rotating regular black
holes based on a non-Gaussian smeared mass distribution. It is shown that the
existence of a fundamental minimal length and thus the smeared mass
consideration cures the well known problems in the terminal phase of black hole
evaporation. We find that there is a finite maximum temperature that the black
hole reaches before cooling down to absolute zero, so that the evaporation ends
up in a zero temperature extremal black hole which mass and size depends on the
value of the fundamental length and on the rotation parameter of the black
hole.
