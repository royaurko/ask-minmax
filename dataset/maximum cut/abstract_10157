In this paper we describe a new methodology to calculate analytically the
error for a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for physical parameters from
Gravitational wave signals. All the existing litterature focuses on the usage
of the Cramer Rao Lower bounds (CRLB) as a mean to approximate the errors for
large signal to noise ratios. We show here how the variance and the bias of a
MLE estimate can be expressed instead in inverse powers of the signal to noise
ratios where the first order in the variance expansion is the CRLB. As an
application we compute the second order of the variance and bias for MLE of
physical parameters from the inspiral phase of binary mergers and for noises of
gravitational wave interferometers . We also compare the improved error
estimate with existing numerical estimates. The value of the second order of
the variance expansions allows to get error predictions closer to what is
observed in numerical simulations. It also predicts correctly the necessary SNR
to approximate the error with the CRLB and provides new insight on the
relationship between waveform properties SNR and estimation errors. For example
the timing match filtering becomes optimal only if the SNR is larger than the
kurtosis of the gravitational wave spectrum.
