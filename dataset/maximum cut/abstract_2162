We study the production and decay of heavy selectrons in the electron-photon
mode of a linear collider of the next generation. The standard model
backgrounds can be substantially reduced by appropriate kinematical cuts. As a
consequence, selectrons far heavier than the kinematical threshold for pair
production are shown to be easily discoverable for large portions of the
supersymmetry parameter space. We also describe a model-independent kinematical
measurement of the mass of the lightest neutralino.
