Combined first order reversal curve (FORC) analyses of the magnetization
(M-FORC) and magnetoresistance (MR-FORC) have been employed to provide a
comprehensive study of the M-MR correlation in two canonical systems: a
NiFe/Cu/FePt pseudo spin-valve (PSV) and a [Co/Cu]8 multilayer. In the PSV, due
to the large difference in switching fields and minimal interactions between
the NiFe and FePt layers, the M and MR show a simple one-to-one relationship
during reversal. In the [Co/Cu]8 multilayer, the correlation between the
magnetization reversal and MR evolution is more complex. This is primarily due
to the similar switching fields of, and interactions between, the constituent
Co layers. The FORC protocol accesses states with much higher spin disorders
and larger MR than those found along the conventional major loop field-cycle.
Unlike the M-FORC measurements, which only probe changes in the macroscopic
magnetization, the MR-FORCs are more sensitive to the microscopic domain
configurations, as those are most important in determining the resultant MR
effect size. This approach is generally applicable to spintronic systems to
realize the maximum spin-disorder and the largest MR.
