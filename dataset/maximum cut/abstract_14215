We consider the quintic one dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with
forcing and both linear and nonlinear dissipation. Quintic nonlinearity results
in multiple collapse events randomly distributed in space and time forming
forced turbulence. Without dissipation each of these collapses produces finite
time singularity but dissipative terms prevents actual formation of
singularity. In statistical steady state of the developed turbulence the
spatial correlation function has a universal form with the correlation length
determined by the modulational instability scale. The amplitude fluctuations at
that scale are nearly-Gaussian while the large amplitude tail of probability
density function (PDF) is strongly non-Gaussian with power-like behavior. The
small amplitude nearly-Gaussian fluctuations seed formation of large collapse
events. The universal spatio-temporal form of these events together with the
PDF for their maximum amplitudes define the power-like tail of PDF for large
amplitude fluctuations, i.e., the intermittency of strong turbulence.
