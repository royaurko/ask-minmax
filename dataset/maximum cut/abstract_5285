We report on the results of a theoretical study of the central exclusive
production of scalar $\chi_{c}(0^{+})$ meson via $\chi_{c0} \to \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$
decay in high-energy hadron collisions at the RHIC, Tevatron and LHC. The
corresponding amplitude for exclusive double-diffractive $\chi_{c0}$ meson
production was obtained within the $k_{t}$-factorization approach including
virtualities of active gluons and the cross section is calculated with
unintegrated gluon distribution functions (UGDFs) known from the literature.
The four-body $p p \to p p \pi^+ \pi^-$ reaction constitutes an irreducible
background to the exclusive $\chi_{c0}$ meson production. We include the
absorption effects due to proton-proton interaction and pion-pion rescattering.
Several differential distributions for $pp(\bar{p}) \to pp(\bar{p})\chi_{c0}$
process, including the absorptive corrections, were calculated. The influence
of kinematical cuts on the signal-to-background ratio is investigated.
