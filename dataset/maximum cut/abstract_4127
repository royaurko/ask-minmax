A scheme, in which gravitons are super-strong interacting, is described. The
graviton background with the Planckian spectrum and a small effective
temperature is considered as a reservoir of gravitons. A cross-section of
interaction of a graviton with any particle is assumed to be a bilinear
function of its energies. Any pair of bodies are attracting not due to an
exchange with its own gravitons, but due to a pressure of external gravitons of
this background. A graviton pairing is necessary to obtain classical gravity.
Any divergencies are not possible in such the model because of natural smooth
cut-offs of the graviton spectrum from both sides. Some cosmological
consequences of this scheme are discussed, too. Also it is shown here that the
main conjecture of this approach may be verified at present on the Earth.
