We present results of surface photometry for eleven edge-on galaxies observed
with the 6-m telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian
Academy of Sciences. The photometric scale length, the scale height, and the
central surface brightness of the stellar disks for the galaxies were found
using photometric cuts made parallel to the major and the minor axes for each
galaxy. We show that four galaxies in our sample that were visually classified
as objects of lowest surface brightness in the Revised Flat Galaxies Catalog
have LSB (low surface brightness) disks. Stellar disks of our LSB galaxies are
thinner than HSB (high surface brightness) ones. There is a good correlation
between the central surface brightness of the stellar disk and its ratio of
vertical to radial scales. The ratio of the disk photometric scales enables us
to estimate the mass of the spherical galactic subsystem using results from
numerical modeling. Combining our results with published rotation curves we
determined the mass of dark halos for the galaxies in our sample. The LSB
galaxies tend to harbor relatively more massive spherical subsystems than those
of HSB's. Indeed, we found no systematic difference between our LSB and HSB
objects in dark halo masses considering it separately from the bulge. At the
same time, the inferred mass/luminosity ratio for the LSB disks appears to be
systematically higher, when compared to the ratio for HSB ones.
