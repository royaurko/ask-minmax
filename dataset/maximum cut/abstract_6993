We assess the ability of future neutron beta decay measurements of up to
O(10^{-4}) precision to falsify the standard model, particularly the V-A law,
and to identify the dynamics beyond it. To do this, we employ a maximum
likelihood statistical framework which incorporates both experimental and
theoretical uncertainties. Using illustrative combined global fits to Monte
Carlo pseudodata, we also quantify the importance of experimental measurements
of the energy dependence of the angular correlation coefficients as input to
such efforts, and we determine the precision to which ill-known "second-class"
hadronic matrix elements must be determined in order to exact such tests.
