Solar Cycle 24 is having a historically long and weak start. Observations of
the Fe XIV corona from the Sacramento Peak site of the National Solar
Observatory show an abnormal pattern of emission compared to observations of
Cycles 21, 22, and 23 from the same instrument. The previous three cycles have
shown a strong, rapid "Rush to the Poles" (previously observed in polar crown
prominences and earlier coronal observations) in the parameter N(t,l,dt)
(average number of Fe XIV emission features per day over dt days at time t and
latitude l). Cycle 24 displays a weak, intermittent, and slow "Rush" that is
apparent only in the northern hemisphere. If the northern Rush persists at its
current rate, evidence from the Rushes in previous cycles indicates that solar
maximum will occur in early 2013 or late 2012, at least in the northern
hemisphere. At lower latitudes, solar maximum previously occurred when the time
maximum of N(t,l,365) reached approximately 20{\deg} latitude. Currently, this
parameter is at or below 30{\deg}and decreasing in latitude. Unfortunately, it
is difficult at this time to calculate the rate of decrease in N(t,l,365).
However, the southern hemisphere could reach 20{\deg} in 2011. Nonetheless,
considering the levels of activity so far, there is a possibility that the
maximum could be indiscernible
