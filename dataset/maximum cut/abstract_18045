We investigate the dependence of the order parameter profile, local and total
susceptibilities on both the temperature and external magnetic field within the
mean-filed Ginzburg-Landau Ising type model. We study the case of a film
geometry when the boundaries of the film exhibit strong adsorption to one of
the phases (components) of the system. We do that using general scaling
arguments and deriving exact analytical results for the corresponding scaling
functions of these quantities. In addition, we examine their behavior in the
capillary condensation regime. Based on the derived exact analytical
expressions we obtained an unexpected result -- the existence of a region in
the phase transitions line where the system jumps below its bulk critical
temperature from a less dense gas to a more dense gas before switching on
continuously into the usual jump from gas to liquid state in the middle of the
system. It is also demonstrated that on the capillary condensation line one of
the coexisting local susceptibility profiles is with one maximum, whereas the
other one is with two local maxima centered, approximately, around the two
gas-liquid interfaces in the system.
