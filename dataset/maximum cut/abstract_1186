A proper vertex coloring of a simple graph is $k$-forested if the graph
induced by the vertices of any two color classes is a forest with maximum
degree less than $k$. A graph is $k$-forested $q$-choosable if for a given list
of $q$ colors associated with each vertex $v$, there exists a $k$-forested
coloring of $G$ such that each vertex receives a color from its own list. In
this paper, we prove that the $k$-forested choosability of a graph with maximum
degree $\Delta\geq k\geq 4$ is at most $\lceil\frac{\Delta}{k-1}\rceil+1$,
$\lceil\frac{\Delta}{k-1}\rceil+2$ or $\lceil\frac{\Delta}{k-1}\rceil+3$ if its
maximum average degree is less than 12/5, $8/3 or 3, respectively.
