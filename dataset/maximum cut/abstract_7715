In the conventional type-(I+II) seesaw model, the effective mass matrix of
three known light neutrinos is given by M_nu = M_L - M_D M^{-1}_R M^T_D in the
leading-order approximation. We propose an intriguing scenario, in which the
structural cancellation condition M_D M^{-1}_R M^T_D = 0 is guaranteed by the
A_4 x Z_2 flavor symmetry. As a consequence, neutrino masses are mainly
generated by the Higgs triplet M_nu = M_L, while the neutrino mixing matrix is
non-unitary and takes on the nearly tri-bimaximal pattern. A discriminating
feature of this scenario from the pure type-II seesaw model is that the
lepton-number-violating signatures induced by the heavy Majorana neutrinos can
be discovered at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We calculate the total cross
section of the same-sign dilepton events pp to l^+(-)_alpha N_i to l^+(-)_alpha
l^+(-)_beta jj (for i=1, 2 and alpha, beta = e, mu, tau), and emphasize the
significant interference of the contributions from two different heavy Majorana
neutrinos. The background from the standard model and the kinematic cuts used
to reduce it have been considered. The possible way to distinguish between the
signals from heavy Majorana neutrinos and those from doubly-charged Higgs
bosons is briefly discussed.
