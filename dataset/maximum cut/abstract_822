We consider single gluon production in the dipole model and reproduce the
result of Kovchegov and Tuchin for the adjoint (gluonic) dipole structure of
the inclusive cross section. We show the validity of the adjoint dipole
structure to any order of evolution deriving and solving the non-linear
evolution for the non-diagonal cross section of a dipole scattering off the
target. The form of the solution to this equation restores the dipole
interpretation for non-diagonal cross sections, that appear in gluon
production. Using this formalism, we analyse the single inclusive production
cross section in terms of the contributions of different multiplicities, and we
derive the Abramovskii-Gribov-Kancheli(AGK) cutting rules for two Pomeron
exchange. The cutting rules, which were found in this formalism, fully
reproduce the original AGK rules for the total cross section. However, for the
case of gluon production, the AGK rules are violated already for one gluon
emission from the vertex.
