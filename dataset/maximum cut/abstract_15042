Constraints are set on the Higgs boson decay width, Gamma_H, using off-shell
production and decay to ZZ in the four-lepton (4l), or two-lepton-two-neutrino
(2l2nu) final states. The analysis is based on the data collected in 2012 by
the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity L =
19.7 fb^{-1} at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. A maximum-likelihood fit of invariant mass and
kinematic discriminant distributions in the 4l case and of transverse mass or
missing energy distributions in the 2l2nu case is performed. The result of it,
combined with the 4l measurement near the resonance peak, leads to an upper
limit on the Higgs boson width of Gamma_H < 4.2 x Gamma_H^SM at the 95%
confidence level, assuming Gamma_H^SM = 4.15 MeV.
