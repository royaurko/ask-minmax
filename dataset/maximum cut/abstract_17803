We present the results of an analysis of measurements of the beta-decay rates
of Ag108, Ba133, Eu152, Eu154, Kr85, Ra226, and Sr90 acquired at the
Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt from 1990 through 1995. Although the
decay rates vary over a range of 165 to 1 and the measured detector current
varies over a range of 19 to 1, the detrended and normalized current
measurements exhibit a sinusoidal annual variation with amplitude in the small
range 0.068% to 0.088% (mean 0.081%, standard deviation 0.0072%, an 11{\sigma}
rejection of the zero-amplitude hypothesis) and phase-of-maximum in the small
range 0.062 to 0.083 (January 23 to January 30). In comparing these results
with those of other related experiments that yield different results, it may be
significant that this experiment, at a standards laboratory, seems to be unique
in using a 4{\pi} detector. These results are compatible with a solar
influence, and appear not to be compatible with an experimental or
environmental influence. It is possible that Ba133 measurements are subject
also to a non-solar (possibly cosmic) influence.
