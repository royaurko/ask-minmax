The generalized list $T$-coloring is a common generalization of many graph
coloring models, including classical coloring, $L(p,q)$-labeling, channel
assignment and $T$-coloring. Every vertex from the input graph has a list of
permitted labels. Moreover, every edge has a set of forbidden differences. We
ask for such a labeling of vertices of the input graph with natural numbers, in
which every vertex gets a label from its list of permitted labels and the
difference of labels of the endpoints of each edge does not belong to the set
of forbidden differences of this edge. In this paper we present an exact
algorithm solving this problem, running in time $\mathcal{O}^*((\tau+2)^n)$,
where $\tau$ is the maximum forbidden difference over all edges of the input
graph and $n$ is the number of its vertices. Moreover, we show how to improve
this bound if the input graph has some special structure, e.g. a bounded
maximum degree, no big induced stars or a perfect matching.
