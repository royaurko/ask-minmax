Using angle resolved photoemission we have investigated annealing-induced
changes in Ga(1-x)Mn(x)As with x = 0.05. We find that the position of the Fermi
energy is a function of annealing time and temperature. It is also established
that the Curie temperature is strongly correlated to the separation between the
Fermi level and the valence band maximum. Valence band photoemission shows that
the Mn3d spectrum is modified by the annealing treatments
