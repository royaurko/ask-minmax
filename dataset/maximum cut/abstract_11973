We review and refine the finite size scaling analysis of specific heat and
London penetration depths data of cuprate superconductors and compare it to the
analysis of specific heat measurements near the superfluid transition of 4He
confined to 1mum^3 cylindrical boxes. This system crosses from 3D to 0D
behavior near the transition. This has a marked effect on the specific heat as
seen by a pronounced rounding of the maximum and a shift to a temperature lower
than the transition temperature of the bulk system. The region in between the
3D to 0D crossover uncovers the contributions from the surface and the edges of
the cylindrical boxes. Our finite size scaling analysis of the specific heat
and London penetration depth of high quality Y-123 and Bi-2212 single crystals
uncover essentially the same crossover phenomena, including evidence for
surface and edge contributions. These uncovers granular superconductivity in
the samples considered here.
