This is the second in a series of papers studying the variable stars in Large
Magellanic Cloud globular clusters. The primary goal of this series is to study
how RR Lyrae stars in Oosterhoff-intermediate systems compare to their
counterparts in Oosterhoff I/II systems. In this paper, we present the results
of our new time-series BV photometeric study of the globular cluster NGC 1786.
A total of 65 variable stars were identified in our field of view. These
variables include 53 RR Lyraes (27 RRab, 18 RRc, and 8 RRd), 3 classical
Cepheids, 1 Type II Cepheid, 1 Anomalous Cepheid, 2 eclipsing binaries, 3 Delta
Scuti/SX Phoenicis variables, and 2 variables of undetermined type.
Photometeric parameters for these variables are presented. We present physical
properties for some of the RR Lyrae stars, derived from Fourier analysis of
their light curves. We discuss several different indicators of Oosterhoff type
which indicate that the Oosterhoff classification of NGC 1786 is not as clear
cut as what is scene in most globular clusters.
