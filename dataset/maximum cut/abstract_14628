We construct the gravitational dual, in the Unruh state, of the "jammed"
phase of a CFT at strong coupling and infinite N on a fixed five-dimensional
rotating Myers-Perry black hole with equal angular momenta. When the angular
momenta are all zero, the solution corresponds to the five-dimensional
generalization of the solution first studied by Figueras, Lucietti, and
Wiseman. In the extremal limit, when the angular momenta of the Myers-Perry
black hole are maximum, the Unruh, Boulware and Hartle-Hawking states
degenerate. We give a detailed analysis of the corresponding holographic stress
energy tensor for all values of the angular momenta, finding it to be regular
at the horizon in all cases. We compare our results with existent literature on
thermal states of free field theories on black hole backgrounds.
