We study the entanglement emergence in a dipolar-coupled nuclear spin-1/2
system cooled using the adiabatic demagnetization technique. The unexpected
behavior of entanglement for the next- and next-next-neighbor spins is
revealed: entangled states of a spin system appear in two distinct temperature
and magnetic field regions separated by a zero-concurrence area. The magnetic
field dependence of the concurrence can have two maximums which positions are
determined by the initial conditions and number of spins in a chain.
