The purpose of this study is to investigate observational features of
Brans-Dicke wormholes in a case if they exist in our Universe. The energy flux
from accretion onto a Brans-Dicke wormhole and the so-called "maximum impact
parameter" are studied (the last one might allow to observe light sources
through a wormhole throat). The computed values were compared with the
corresponding ones for GR-wormholes and Schwarzschild black holes. We shown
that Brans-Dicke wormholes are quasi-Schwarzschild objects and should differ
from GR wormholes by about one order of magnitude in the accretion energy flux.
