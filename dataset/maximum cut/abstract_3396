We present optical and infrared photometry of the unusual Type Ia supernova
2000cx. With the data of Li et al. (2001) and Jha (2002), this comprises the
largest dataset ever assembled for a Type Ia SN, more than 600 points in
UBVRIJHK. We confirm the finding of Li et al. regarding the unusually blue B-V
colors as SN 2000cx entered the nebular phase. Its I-band secondary hump was
extremely weak given its B-band decline rate. The V minus near infrared colors
likewise do not match loci based on other slowly declining Type Ia SNe, though
V-K is the least ``abnormal''. In several ways SN 2000cx resembles other slow
decliners, given its B-band decline rate (Delta m_15(B) = 0.93), the appearance
of Fe III lines and weakness of Si II in its pre-maximum spectrum, the V-K
colors and post-maximum V-H colors. If the distance modulus derived from
Surface Brightness Fluctuations of the host galaxy is correct, we find that the
rate of light increase prior to maximum, the characteristics of the bolometric
light curve, and the implied absolute magnitude at maximum are all consistent
with a sub-luminous object with Delta m_15(B) ~ 1.6-1.7 having a higher than
normal kinetic energy.
