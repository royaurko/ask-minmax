Rotation information for spiral galaxies can be obtained through the
observation of different spectral lines. While the Halpha(6563 A) line is often
used for galaxies with low to moderate redshifts, it is redshifted into the
near-infrared at z>0.4. This is why most high redshift surveys rely on the
[OII](3727 A) line. Using a sample of 32 spiral galaxies at 0.155 < z < 0.25
observed simultaneously in both Halpha and [OII] with the Hale 200 inch
telescope, the relation between velocity widths extracted from these two
spectral lines is investigated, and we conclude that Halpha derived velocities
can be reliably compared to high z [OII] measurements. The sample of galaxies
is then used along with VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey observations to perform the
angular diameter - redshift test to find constraints on cosmological
parameters. The test makes it possible to discriminate between various
cosmological models, given the upper limit of disc size evolution at the
maximum redshift of the data set, no matter what the evolutionary scenario is.
