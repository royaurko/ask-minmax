We study the droplet that results from conditioning the subcritical
Fortuin-Kasteleyn planar random cluster model on the presence of an open
circuit Gamma_0 encircling the origin and enclosing an area of at least (or
exactly) n^2. In this paper, we prove that the resulting circuit is highly
regular: we define a notion of a regeneration site in such a way that, for any
such element v of Gamma_0, the circuit Gamma_0 cuts through the radial line
segment through v only at v. We show that, provided that the conditioned
circuit is centred at the origin in a natural sense, the set of regeneration
sites reaches into all parts of the circuit, with maximal distance from one
such site to the next being at most logarithmic in n with high probability. The
result provides a flexible control on the conditioned circuit that permits the
use of surgical techniques to bound its fluctuations, and, as such, it plays a
crucial role in the derivation of bounds on the local fluctuation of the
circuit carried out in arXiv:1001.1527 and arXiv:1001.1528.
