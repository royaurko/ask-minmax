In Type Ia Supernovae (\sneia), the relative abundances of chemical elements
are affected by the neutron excess in the composition of the progenitor white
dwarf. Since these products leave signatures in the spectra near maximum light,
spectral features may be used to constrain the composition of the progenitor.
We calculate the nucleosynthetic yields for three \snia simulations for a wide
range of progenitor metallicities, and calculate synthetic light curves and
spectra to explore correlations between progenitor metallicity and the strength
of spectral features. We use two 2D simulations of the
deflagration-detonation-transition scenario with different $^{56}$Ni yields and
the W7 simulation to control for differences between explosion models and total
yields. While the overall yields of intermediate mass elements (16 $<$ A $\leq$
40) differ between the three cases, trends in the yields are similar. With
increasing metallicity, $^{28}$Si yields remain nearly constant, $^{40}$Ca
yields decline, and Ti and $^{54}$Fe yields increase. In the synthetic spectra,
we identify two features at 30 days post explosion that appear to deepen with
progenitor metallicity: a Ti feature around 4200\,\AA\ and a Fe feature around
5200\,\AA\@. In all three simulations, their pseudo equivalent widths show a
systematic trend with progenitor metallicity. This suggests that these two
features may allow differentiation among progenitor metallicities of observed
\sneia and potentially help reduce the intrinsic Hubble scatter.
