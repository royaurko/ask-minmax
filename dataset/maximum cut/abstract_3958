We use a simple parameterization of the mid-IR spectra of a wide range of
galaxy types in order to predict their distribution in the Infrared Array
Camera (IRAC) 3.6um, 4.5um, 5.8um, and 8.0um and Multiband Photometer for
Spitzer (MIPS) 24um color-color diagrams. We distinguish three basic spectral
types by the energetically dominant component in the 3--12 micron regime:
stellar-dominated; PAH-dominated; and continuum-dominated. We have used a
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to arrive at a more systematic and
robust representation of the mid-IR spectra of galaxies than more traditional
approaches. We find that IRAC color-color plots are well suited to
distinguishing the above spectral types, while the addition of 24 micron data
allows us to suggest practical 3-color cuts which preferentially select higher
redshift sources of specific type. We compare our simulations with the
color-color plot obtained by the Spitzer First Look Survey (FLS) and find
reasonable agreement. Lastly, we discuss other applications as well as future
directions for this work.
