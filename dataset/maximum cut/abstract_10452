In this paper, we consider accessibility percolation on hypercubes, i.e., we
place i.i.d.\ uniform random variables on vertices of a hypercube, and study
whether there is a path (possibly with back steps) connecting two vertices such
that the values of these random variables increase along the path. We establish
a sharp phase transition depending on the difference of the values at the two
endpoints, and determine the critical window of the phase transition. Our
result completely resolves a conjecture of Berestycki, Brunet, and Shi (2014).
  Our work on accessibility percolation is motivated by the NK fitness model in
biological evolution. Indeed, placing i.i.d.\ random variables on the hypercube
amounts to the special case for NK fitness model for $N = K$. A second result
of our work concerns the global maximum for NK fitness model, and proves that
in the case whe fitness variables are Gaussian it is asymptotically equivalent
to the maximum of i.i.d.\ variables if and only if $K\to \infty$ as $N\to
\infty$.
