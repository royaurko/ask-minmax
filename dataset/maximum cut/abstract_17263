We analyze doping dependence of the spin resonance of an s+- superconductor
and its sensitivity to the ellipticity of electron pockets, to magnetic and
non-magnetic impurities, and to the angle dependence of the superconducting gap
along electron Fermi surfaces. We show that the maximum intensity of the
resonance shifts from commensurate to incommensurate momentum above some
critical doping which decreases with increasing ellipticity. Angle dependence
of the gap and particularly the presence of accidental nodes lowers the overall
intensity of the resonance peak and shifts its position towards the onset of
the particle-hole continuum. Still, however, the resonance remains a true
\delta-function in the clean limit. When non-magnetic or magnetic impurities
are present, the resonance broadens and its position shifts. The shift depends
on the type of impurities and on the ratio of intraband and interband
scattering components. The ratio Omega_{res}/T_c increases almost linearly with
the strength of the interband impurity scattering, in agreement with the
experimental data. We also compare spin response of s+- and s++
superconductors. We show that there is no resonance for s++ gap, even when
there is a finite mismatch between electron and hole Fermi surfaces shifted by
the antiferromagnetic momentum.
