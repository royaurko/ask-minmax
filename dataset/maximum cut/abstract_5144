Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) at GZK cut off energy (E \geq 55 EeV
eV) may keep sharp or diffused directionality wherever their composition is
made by nucleon or light nuclei. AUGER UHECR (2007-2010) did show a mild
clustering mainly around Cen A. Two over three of the recent discovered AUGER
multiplet (a dozen of events each) tail clustering at twenty EeV are pointing
to primary sources very near the same UHECR crowded Cen A region. The Tens EeV
tail is aligned with the same UHECR events. We foresaw such possibility as
fragment tails of lightest UHECR nuclei. We discuss the relevance of this
correlation within a model where UHECR are mostly lightest He like nuclei.
UHECR fragment multiplet clustering aligned along higher Cen A events (at 55
EeV energy) probe and reinforce our interpretation with an a priori probability
near 3 part over a hundred thousand.
