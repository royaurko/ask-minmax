A novel idea is presented for removing mag- netic flux from the galactic disc
in order to satisfy the boundary conditions of the alpha- omega dynamo. The
idea involves making use of superbubbles that break out of the galactic disc.
When this happens, their shells break up into many fragments, and from these
fragments, spikes can arise that can move small pieces of the galactic flux
lines in the superbubble shell and move them so high enough into the halo that
they do not return. As a result the flux lines remaining in the disc are
effectively cut into short pieces of finite length that, although weakly
connected to the halo, have no tensile strength at their ends. They are thus
free to randomly rotate until no net flux is left. In the first section, the
boundary condition problem is discussed and then this solution is discussed..
In the second section the proper- ties of the superbubble that are necessary
for the model are laid out. It is shown by a rough numerical estimate, that
enough lines can be cut to resolve the dynamo problem. Lastly, conditions under
which the spike instability exists are discussed.
