We combined the results of UBVR photometry of CI Cam taken at Sternberg
Astronomical Institute in 1998--2001, and moderate resolution spectroscopy
taken at Special Astrophysical Observatory during the same time period.
Photometry as well as fluxes of Balmer emissions and of some Fe II emission
lines of CI Cam in quiet state reveal a cyclic variation with the period of
$1100\pm50^d$. The variation like this may be due to an orbital motion in a
wide pair with a giant star companion that exhibits the reflection effect on
its side faced to a compact companion.
  The V-band photometry also confirms the pre-outburst 11.7 day period found by
Miroshnichenko earlier, but with a lower amplitude of 3 per cent. The
possibility of identity of this photometric period with the period of jet's
rotation in the VLA radio map of the object CI Cam was investigated. The radio
map modelling reveals the inclination of the jet rotation axis to the line of
sight, $i = 35-40^o$, the angle between the rotation axis and the direction of
ejection of the jet, $\theta = 7-10^o$, and jet's spatial velocity of
0.23--0.26c.
  Equivalent widths and fluxes of various spectral lines show different
amplitudes of changes during the outburst, and essentially distinct behaviour
in quiescence. Five types of such behaviour were revealed, that indicates the
strong stratification of a gas and dust envelope round the system . The time
lag of strengthening of 50--250$^d$ in the forbidden line of nitrogen [N II]
was found relatively to the X-ray outburst maximum.
