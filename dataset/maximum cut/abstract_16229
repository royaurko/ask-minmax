We report a statistical study of flares observed with the Soft X-ray
Telescope (SXT) onboard Yohkoh in the year of 2000. We measure physical
parameters of 77 flares, such as the temporal scale, the size, and the magnetic
flux density and find that the sizes of flares tend to be distributed more
broadly as the GOES class becomes weaker and that there is a lower limit of
magnetic flux density that depends on the GOES class. We also examine the
relationship between these parameters and find weak correlation between
temporal and spatial scales of flares. We estimate reconnection inflow
velocity, coronal Alfven velocity, and reconnection rate using above observed
values. The inflow velocities are distributed from a few km/s to several tens
km/s and the Alfven velocities in the corona are in the range from 10^3 to 10^4
km/s. Hence the reconnection rate is 10^-3 - 10^-2. We find that the
reconnection rate in a flare tends to decrease as the GOES class of the flare
increases. This value is within one order of magnitude from the theoretical
maximum value predicted by the Petschek model, although the dependence of the
reconnection rate on the magnetic Reynolds number tends to be stronger than
that in the Petschek model.
