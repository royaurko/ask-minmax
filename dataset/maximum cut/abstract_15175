A recently introduced numerical scheme for calculating self-diffusion
coefficients of solid objects embedded in lipid bilayer membranes is extended
to enable calculation of hydrodynamic interactions between multiple objects.
The method is used to validate recent analytical predictions by Oppenheimer and
Diamant [Biophys. J., 96, 3041, 2009] related to the coupled diffusion of
membrane embedded proteins and is shown to converge to known near-field
lubrication results as objects closely approach one another, however the
present methodology also applies outside of the limiting regimes where
analytical results are available. Multiple different examples involving pairs
of disk-like objects with various constraints imposed on their relative motions
demonstrate the importance of hydrodynamic interactions in the dynamics of
proteins and lipid domains on membrane surfaces. It is demonstrated that the
relative change in self-diffusion of a membrane embedded object upon
perturbation by a similar proximal solid object displays a maximum for object
sizes comparable to the Saffman-Delbr\"uck length of the membrane.
