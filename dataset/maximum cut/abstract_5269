The quadratically divergent scalar mass is subtractively renormalized unlike
other divergences which are multiplicatively renormalized. We re-examine some
technical aspects of the subtractive renormalization, in particular, the mass
independent renormalization of massive $\lambda\phi^{4}$ theory with higher
derivative regularization. We then discuss an unconventional scheme to
introduce the notion of renormalization point $\mu$ to the subtractive
renormalization in a theory defined by a large fixed cut-off $M$. The resulting
renormalization group equation generally becomes inhomogeneous but it is
transformed to be homogeneous. The renormalized scalar mass consists of two
components in this scheme, one with the ordinary anomalous dimension and the
other which is proportional to the renormalization scale $\mu$. This scheme
interpolates between the theory defined by dimensional regularization and the
theory with un-subtracted quadratic divergences.
