We establish the equivalence of the analytic and probabilistic notions of
subharmonicity in the framework of general symmetric Hunt processes on locally
compact separable metric spaces, extending an earlier work of the first named
contributor on the equivalence of the analytic and probabilistic notions of
harmonicity. As a corollary, we prove a strong maximum principle for locally
bounded finely continuous subharmonic functions in the space of functions
locally in the domain of the Dirichlet form under some natural conditions.
