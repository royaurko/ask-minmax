We present near infra-red light curves of supernova (SN) 2011fe in M101,
including 34 epochs in H band starting fourteen days before maximum brightness
in the B-band. The light curve data were obtained with the WIYN High-Resolution
Infrared Camera (WHIRC). When the data are calibrated using templates of other
Type Ia SNe, we derive an apparent H-band magnitude at the epoch of B-band
maximum of 10.85 \pm 0.04. This implies a distance modulus for M101 that ranges
from 28.86 to 29.17 mag, depending on which absolute calibration for Type Ia
SNe is used.
