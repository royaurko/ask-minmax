The possibility of reconciliation between canonical probability distributions
obtained from the $q$-maximum entropy principle with predictions from the law
of large numbers when empirical samples are held to the same constraints, is
investigated into. Canonical probability distributions are constrained by both:
$(i)$ the additive duality of generalized statistics and $(ii)$ normal averages
expectations. Necessary conditions to establish such a reconciliation are
derived by appealing to a result concerning large deviation properties of
conditional measures. The (dual) $q^*$-maximum entropy principle is shown {\bf
not} to adhere to the large deviation theory. However, the necessary conditions
are proven to constitute an invertible mapping between: $(i)$ a canonical
ensemble satisfying the $q^*$-maximum entropy principle for energy-eigenvalues
$\varepsilon_i^*$, and, $(ii)$ a canonical ensemble satisfying the
Shannon-Jaynes maximum entropy theory for energy-eigenvalues $\varepsilon_i$.
Such an invertible mapping is demonstrated to facilitate an \emph{implicit}
reconciliation between the $q^*$-maximum entropy principle and the large
deviation theory. Numerical examples for exemplary cases are provided.
