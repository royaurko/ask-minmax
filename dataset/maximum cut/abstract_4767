Inspired by the obvious discrepancies between experiment and non-relativistic
QCD (NRQCD) studies of $e^+ e^-\to J/\psi+\eta_c$ at $\sqrt{s}\simeq 10.6$ GeV,
we investigate contributions from intermediate meson loops as long-range
interaction transitions to this process. The intermediate meson loops include
$D\bar D(\bar D^\ast)$, $D\bar D^\ast(D {or} D^\ast)$, $D^\ast \bar D^\ast(D)$
and corresponding $D_s$ intermediate mesons. With the constraints from
experimental data on the vertex couplings, we find that the intermediate meson
loops account for $2.7\sim 6.7 fb$ of the cross sections within a reasonable
range of cut-off energies of the factor parameter. We also investigate
contributions from the absorptive part and find that it accounts for
approximately $0.58\sim 1.38 fb$. These results imply that contributions from
long-range interaction transitions may still play a role in such an energy
region.
