The SHALON Cherenkov telescope has recorded over 2x10^6 extensive air showers
during the past 17 years. The analysis of the signal at different zenith angles
(\theta) has included observations from the sub-horizontal direction
\theta=97^o. This inclination defines an Earth skimming trajectory with 7 km of
air and around 1000 km of rock in front of the telescope. During a period of
324 hours of observation, after a cut of shower-like events that may be caused
by chaotic sky flashes or reflections on the snow of vertical showers, we have
detected 5 air showers of TeV energies. We argue that these events may be
caused by the decay of a long-lived penetrating particle entering the
atmosphere from the ground and decaying in front of the telescope. We show that
this particle can not be a muon or a tau lepton. As a possible explanation, we
discuss two scenarios with an unstable neutrino of mass m\approx 0.5 GeV and
c\tau\approx 30 m. Remarkably, one of these models has been recently proposed
to explain an excess of electron-like neutrino events at MiniBooNE.
