We combine the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to
lepton-pair production through the Drell-Yan mechanism with the next-to-leading
order (NLO) electroweak corrections within the framework of the FEWZ simulation
code. Control over both sources of higher-order contributions is necessary for
measurements where percent-level theoretical predictions are crucial, and in
phase-space regions where the NLO electroweak corrections grow large. The
inclusion of both corrections in a single simulation code eliminates the need
to separately incorporate such effects as final-state radiation and electroweak
Sudakov logarithms when comparing many experimental results to theory. We
recalculate the NLO electroweak corrections in the complex-mass scheme for both
massless and massive final-state leptons, and modify the QCD corrections in the
original FEWZ code to maintain consistency with the complex-mass scheme to the
lowest order. We present phenomenological results for LHC studies that include
both NNLO QCD and NLO electroweak corrections. In addition, we study several
interesting kinematics features induced by experimental cuts in the
distribution of photon radiation at the LHC.
