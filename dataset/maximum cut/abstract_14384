We consider the translocation of a one-dimensional polymer through a pore
channel helped by a motor driven by a dichotomous noise with time exponential
correlation. We are interested in the study of the translocation time, mean
velocity and stall force of the system as a function of the mean driving
frequency. We find a monotonous translocation time, in contrast with the mean
velocity which shows a pronounced maximum at a given frequency. Interestingly,
the stall force shows a nonmonotonic behavior with the presence of a minimum.
The influence of the spring elastic constant to the mean translocation times
and velocities is also presented.
