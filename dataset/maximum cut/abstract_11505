The North Eastern shell of SN 1006 is the most probable acceleration site of
high energy electrons (up to about 100 TeV) with the Fermi acceleration
mechanism at the shock front. We resolved non-thermal filaments from thermal
emission in the shell with the excellent spatial resolution of Chandra. The
non-thermal filaments seem thin sheets with the scales of about 1 arcsec (0.01
pc) and about 20 arcsec (0.19 pc) upstream and downstream of the shock,
respectively. In a simple diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) model with the
magnetic field parallel to the shock normal, the downstream region should have
a highly disordered magnetic field of 30-40 micro G. The width at the upstream
side is extremely small, comparable to the gyro-radius of the maximum energy
electrons. This result might imply that the possible scenario is not the
conventional diffusive shock acceleration with a parallel magnetic field but
that with a nearly perpendicular field or electron shock surfing acceleration.
