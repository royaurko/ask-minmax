We have conducted pencil-beam searches for outer solar system objects to a
limiting magnitude of R ~ 26. Five new trans-neptunian objects were detected in
these searches. Our combined data set provides an estimate of ~90
trans-neptunian objects per square degree brighter than ~ 25.9. This estimate
is a factor of 3 above the expected number of objects based on an extrapolation
of previous surveys with brighter limits, and appears consistent with the
hypothesis of a single power-law luminosity function for the entire
trans-neptunian region. Maximum likelihood fits to all self-consistent
published surveys with published efficiency functions predicts a cumulative sky
density Sigma(<R) obeying log10(Sigma) = 0.76(R-23.4) objects per square degree
brighter than a given magnitude R.
