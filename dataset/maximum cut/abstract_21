The behavior of the proton magnetic form factor is studied within the
modified hard scattering picture, which takes into account gluonic radiative
corrections in terms of transverse separations. We parallel the analysis given
previously by Li and make apparent a number of serious objections. The
appropriate cut-off needed to render the form-factor calculation finite is both
detailed and analyzed by considering different cut-off prescriptions. The use
of the maximum interquark separation as a common infrared cut-off in the
Sudakov suppression factor is proposed, since it avoids difficulties with the
$\alpha _{s}$-singularities and yields a proton form factor insensitive to the
inclusion of the soft region which therefore can be confidently attributed to
perturbative QCD. Results are presented for a variety of proton wave functions
including also their intrinsic transverse momentum. It turns out that the
perturbative contribution, although theoretically self-consistent for $Q^{2}$
larger than about $6$~GeV${}^{2}$ to $10$~GeV${}^{2}$, is too small compared to
the data.
