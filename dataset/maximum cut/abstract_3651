We simulate the central reactions of nearly symmetric, and asymmetric
systems, for the energies at which the maximum production of IMFs occurs
(E$_{c.m.}^{peak}$).This study is carried out by using hard EOS along with
cugnon cross section and employing MSTB method for clusterization. We study the
various properties of fragments. The stability of fragments is checked through
persistence coefficient and gain term. The information about the thermalization
and stopping in heavy-ion collisions is obtained via relative momentum,
anisotropy ratio, and rapidity distribution. We find that for a complete
stopping of incoming nuclei very heavy systems are required. The mass
dependence of various quantities (such as average and maximum central density,
collision dynamics as well as the time zone for hot and dense nuclear matter)
is also presented. In all cases (i.e., average and maximum central density,
collision dynamics as well as the time zone for hot and dense nuclear matter) a
power law dependence is obtained.
