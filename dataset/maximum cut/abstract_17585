A model based on Lamb's theory of gas lasers is applied to a He-Ne ring laser
gyroscope in order to estimate and remove the laser dynamics contribution from
the rotation measurements. The intensities of the counter-propagating laser
beams exiting one cavity mirror are continuously observed together with a
monitor of the laser population inversion. These observables, once properly
calibrated with a dedicated procedure, allow us to estimate cold cavity and
active medium parameters driving the main part of the nonlinearities of the
system. The parameters identification and noise subtraction procedure has been
verified by means of a Monte Carlo study of the system, and experimentally
tested on the G-Pisa ring laser oriented with the normal to the ring plane
almost parallel to the Earth rotation axis. In this configuration the Earth
rotation-rate provides the maximum Sagnac effect while the contribution of the
orientation error is reduced at minimum. After the subtraction of laser
dynamics by a Kalman filter, the relative systematic errors of G-PISA reduce
from 50 to 5 part in 10^3 and can be attributed to the residual uncertainties
on geometrical scale factor and orientation of the ring.
