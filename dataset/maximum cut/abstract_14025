In this paper we consider Bayesian estimation for the parameters of inverse
Gaussian distribution. Our emphasis is on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We
provide complete implementation of the Gibbs sampler algorithm. Assuming an
informative prior, Bayes estimates are computed using the output of the Gibbs
sampler and also from Lindley's approximation method. Maximum Likelihood and
Uniformly Minimum Variance Unbiased estimates are obtained as well. We also
compute Highest Posterior Density credible intervals, exact confidence
intervals as well as "percentile" and "percentile-t" bootstrap approximations
to the exact intervals. A simulation study was conducted to compare the
long-run performance of the various point and interval estimation methods
considered. One real data illustration has been provided which brings out some
salient features of sampling-based approach to inference.
