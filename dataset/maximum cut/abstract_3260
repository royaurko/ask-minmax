The performance of a modulation classifier is highly sensitive to channel
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we focus on amplitude-phase
modulations and propose a modulation classification framework based on
centralized data fusion using multiple radios and the hybrid maximum likelihood
(ML) approach. In order to alleviate the computational complexity associated
with ML estimation, we adopt the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Due
to SNR diversity, the proposed multi-radio framework provides robustness to
channel SNR. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed approach
with respect to single radio approaches as well as to modulation classifiers
using moments based estimators.
