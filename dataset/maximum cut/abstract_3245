The gravitino dark matter with neutralino NLSP hypothesis is investigated in
the framework of NMSSM. We have considered both the thermal and non-thermal
gravitino production mechanisms, and we have taken into account all the
collider and cosmological constraints. The maximum allowed reheating
temperature after inflation, as well as the maximum allowed gravitino mass are
determined.
