This paper is concerned with bounds on the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding
error probability of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes over additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channels. To resolve the difficulty caused by the dependence of the
Euclidean distance spectrum on the way of signal mapping, we propose to use
random mapping, resulting in an ensemble of RS-coded modulation (RS-CM)
systems. For this ensemble of RS-CM systems, analytic bounds are derived, which
can be evaluated from the known (symbol-level) Hamming distance spectrum. Also
presented in this paper are simulation-based bounds, which are applicable to
any specific RS-CM system and can be evaluated by the aid of a list decoding
(in the Euclidean space) algorithm. The simulation-based bounds do not need
distance spectrum and are numerically tight for short RS codes in the regime
where the word error rate (WER) is not too low. Numerical comparison results
are relevant in at least three aspects. First, in the short code length regime,
RS-CM using BPSK modulation with random mapping has a better performance than
binary random linear codes. Second, RS-CM with random mapping (time varying)
can have a better performance than with specific mapping. Third, numerical
results show that the recently proposed Chase-type decoding algorithm is
essentially the ML decoding algorithm for short RS codes.
