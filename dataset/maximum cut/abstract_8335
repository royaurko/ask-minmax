Our current understanding of the absorption and emission properties of
interstellar grains are reviewed. The constraints placed by the Kramers-Kronig
relation on the wavelength-dependence and the maximum allowable quantity of the
dust absorption are discussed. Comparisons of the opacities (mass absorption
coefficients) derived from interstellar dust models with those directly
estimated from observations are presented.
