It is argued that $W/Z$ boson production in ultra-relativistic $pp$
collisions in the fragmentation region, subject to a kinematic cut on the boson
transverse momentum $Q_\perp>Q_{\perp\min}$, with 1 GeV/c$\ll Q_{\perp\min}\ll
M_{W/Z}$, must be dominated by the Compton mechanism $qg\to q'W/Z$. We propose
applications for boson hadroproduction in this kinematics and formulate the
factorization theorem. The analysis of QCD enhancements indicates that Regge
behavior should manifest itself not only in the $s$ but also in
$Q_\perp$-dependence of the boson production differential cross-section.
