We present high cadence (1-10 hr^-1) time-series photometry of the eruptive
young variable star V1647 Orionis during its 2003-2004 and 2008-2009 outbursts.
The 2003 light curve was obtained mid-outburst at the phase of steepest
luminosity increase of the system, during which time the accretion rate of the
system was presumably continuing to increase toward its maximum rate. The 2009
light curve was obtained after the system luminosity had plateaued, presumably
when the rate of accretion had also plateaued. We detect a 'flicker noise'
signature in the power spectrum of the lightcurves, which may suggest that the
stellar magnetosphere continued to interact with the accretion disk during each
outburst event. Only the 2003 power spectrum, however, evinces a significant
signal with a period of 0.13 d. While the 0.13 d period cannot be attributed to
the stellar rotation period, we show that it may plausibly be due to
short-lived radial oscillations of the star, possibly caused by the surge in
the accretion rate.
