Starting with the partition function $Z$ for systems with $M$-statistics, as
proposed in \cite{WND}, we calculate from the metric
$g_{\alpha\eta}=\frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial\beta^{\alpha}\beta^{\eta}}$ the
scalar curvature $R$ in two and three dimensions. Our results exhibit the
details of the anyonic behavior as a function of the fugacity $z$ and the
identical particle maximum occupancy number $M$. We also compare the stability
of systems for $M>1$with the fermionic (M=1), and bosonic ($M\rightarrow
\infty$), cases.
