The pattern of variations in the intensity of magnetodipole losses is studied
with the relativistic effect of magnetic-field dissipation during collapse into
a black hole taken into account.
  A burst-type solution can be obtained both for a direct collapse and for the
formation of a rapidly-rotating, self-gravitating object - a spinar - using a
simple model. Analytical dependences on radius describing an electromagnetic
burst are derived. The time dependence of the burst shape for an infinitely
distant observer and the maximum energy of relativistic particles accelerated
by an electric field are numerically calculated.
  The objects under consideration are of particular interest because particles
in their vicinity can be accelerated up to the Planck energies. Possible
astrophysical applications to the theory of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and
QSOs are briefly discussed. It is shown for the first time that a spinar can be
produced by a merger of neutron stars; this possibility is considered in and
without connection with the formation of gamma-ray bursts.
