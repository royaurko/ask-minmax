We present a 40GHz (7.5 mm) raster scan image of a 3.6x2 degree region
centered on the low redshift (z=0.055) cluster of galaxies Abell 3667. The
cluster was observed during the Antarctic winter of 1999 using the Corona
instrument (15.7' FWHM beam) on the Viper Telescope at the South Pole. The
Corona image of A3667 is one of the first direct (i.e. rather than
interferometer) thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect images of a low redshift
cluster. The brightness temperature decrement at the X-ray centroid (20h 12m
28.9s, -56 49 51 J2000) was measured to be $\Delta T_{\rm CMB}=-154\mu K$. We
have used the 40GHz map of A3667 in conjunction with a deep ROSAT PSPC (X-ray)
image of the cluster, to make a measurement of the Hubble Constant. We find
$H_0 = 64^{+96}_{-30}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (68% confidence interval). Our
$H_0$ calculation assumes that the cluster can be described using an
isothermal, tri-axial ellipsoidal, $\beta$-model and includes several new
analysis techniques including an automated method to remove point sources from
X-ray images with variable point spread functions, and an efficient method for
determining the errors in multi-parameter maximum likelihood analyzes. The
large errors on the $H_0$ measurement are primarily due to the statistical
noise in the Corona image. We plan to increase the precision of our measurement
by including additional clusters in our analysis and by increasing the
sensitivity of the Viper SZE maps.
