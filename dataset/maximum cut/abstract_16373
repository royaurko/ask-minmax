Strong short ranged positional correlations involving counterions can induce
a net attractive force between negatively charged strands of DNA, and lead to
the formation of ion pairs in dilute ionic solutions. But the long range of the
Coulomb interactions impedes the development of a simple local picture. We
address this general problem by mapping the properties of a nonuniform system
with Coulomb interactions onto those of a simpler system with short ranged
intermolecular interactions in an effective external field that accounts for
the averaged effects of appropriately chosen long ranged and slowly varying
components of the Coulomb interactions. The remaining short ranged components
combine with the other molecular core interactions and strongly affect pair
correlations in dense or strongly coupled systems. We show that pair
correlation functions in the effective short ranged system closely resemble
those in the uniform primitive model of ionic solutions, and illustrate the
formation of ion pairs and clusters at low densities. The theory accurately
describes detailed features of the effective attraction between two equally
charged walls at strong coupling and intermediate separations of the walls. New
analytical results for the minimal coupling strength needed to get any
attraction and for the separation where the attractive force is a maximum are
presented.
