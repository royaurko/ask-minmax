A scheme is developed for estimating state-dependent drift and diffusion
coefficients in a stochastic differential equation from time-series data. The
scheme does not require to specify parametric forms for the drift and diffusion
coefficients in advance. In order to perform the nonparametric estimation, a
maximum likelihood method is combined with a concept based on a kernel density
estimation. In order to deal with discrete observation or sparsity of the
time-series data, a local linearization method is employed, which enables a
fast estimation.
