We propose that the massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) observed in the
recent microlensing experiments with an apparent best fit mass of about $0.5
M_{\odot}$ are objects made out of ``mirror'' baryonic matter rather than
familiar baryons. Such a possibility arises naturally within the framework of
mirror matter models proposed recently to accomodate the sterile neutrinos that
seem necessary to solve all the neutrino puzzles simultaneusly. We show that
for mirror matter parameters that fit the neutrino observations, the maximum
mass of mirror stars are of order $0.5 M_{\odot}$ and their main sequence
lifetime is much less than the age of the universe. They are therefore likely
to be black holes. Mirror matter machos have the advantage that they do not
suffer from the problems encountered in the conventional red, brown or white
dwarf interpretation. The calculations also apply to the question of how the
world of familiar matter would be different if all fundamental mass parameters
were.
