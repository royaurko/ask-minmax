Scattering of light at a distribution of scatterers is an intrinsically
cooperative process, which means that the scattering rate and the angular
distribution of the scattered light are essentially governed by bulk properties
of the distribution, such as its size, shape, and density, although local
disorder and density fluctuations may have an important impact on the
cooperativity. Via measurements of the radiation pressure exerted by a
far-detuned laser beam on a very small and dense cloud of ultracold atoms, we
are able to identify the respective roles of superradiant acceleration of the
scattering rate and of Mie scattering in the cooperative process. They lead
respectively to a suppression or an enhancement of the radiation pressure. We
observe a maximum in the radiation pressure as a function of the induced phase
shift, marking the borderline of the validity of the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans
approximation from a regime, where Mie scattering is more complex. Our
observations thus help to clarify the intricate relationship between Rayleigh
scattering of light at a coarse-grained ensemble of individual scatterers and
Mie scattering at the bulk density distribution.
