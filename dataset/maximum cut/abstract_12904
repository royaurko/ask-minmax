We present detailed numerical and analytical investigations of the
nonequilibrium dynamics of spin-polarized ultracold Fermi gases following a
sudden switching-on of the atom-atom pairing coupling strength. Within a
time-dependent mean-field approach we show that on increasing the imbalance it
takes longer for pairing to develop, the period of the nonlinear oscillations
lengthens, and the maximum value of the pairing amplitude decreases. As
expected, dynamical pairing is suppressed by the increase of the imbalance.
Eventually, for a critical value of the imbalance the nonlinear oscillations do
not even develop. Finally, we point out an interesting temperature-reentrant
behavior of the exponent characterizing the initial instability.
