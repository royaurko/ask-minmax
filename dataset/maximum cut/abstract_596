It is shown that an instanton induced interaction between quarks produces a
very deeply bound H-dibaryon with mass below 2M_N, M_H=1718 MeV. Therefore the
H-dibaryon is predicted to be a stable particle. The reaction of
photodisintegration of H-dibaryon to $2\Lambda$ in during of its penetration
into cosmic microwave background will result in a new possible cut-off in the
cosmic-ray spectrum. This provides an explanation of ultra-high energy cosmic
ray events observed above the GZK cut-off as a result of the strong interaction
of high energy H-dibaryons from cosmic rays with nuclei in Earth's atmosphere.
