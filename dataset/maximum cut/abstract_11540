Infrared and optical spectra of SN 1998bu at an age of one year after
explosion are presented. The data show evidence for the radioactive decay of
56Co to 56Fe, long assumed to be the powering source for the supernova light
curve past maximum light. The spectra provide direct evidence for at least 0.4
solar masses of iron being present in the ejecta of the supernova. The fits to
the data also show that the widths of the emission lines increase with time.
Photometric measurements in the H-band show that the supernova is not fading
during the observation period. This is consistent with theoretical
expectations.
