In this paper we report the discovery of a new class of active galactic
nucleus in which although the nucleus is viewed directly, no broad emission
lines are present. The results are based on a survey for AGN in which a sample
of about 800 quasars and emission line galaxies were monitored yearly for 25
years. Among the emission line galaxies was the expected population of Seyfert
2 galaxies with only narrow forbidden lines in emission, and no broad lines.
However, from the long term monitoring programme it was clear that some 10% of
these were strongly variable with strong continuum emission. It is argued that
these objects can only be Seyfert 1 galaxies in which the nucleus is viewed
directly, but in which broad emission lines are completely absent. We compare
these observations with other cases from the literature where the broad line
region is reported to be weak or variable, and investigate the possibility that
the absence of the broad line component is due to reddening. We conclude that
this does not account for the observations, and that in these AGN the broad
line region is absent. We also tentatively identify more luminous quasars from
our sample where the broad emission lines also appear to be absent. The
consequences of this for AGN models are discussed, and a case is made that we
are seeing AGN in a transition stage between the fuel supply from a surrounding
star cluster being cut off, and the nucleus becoming dormant.
