In an in-band full-duplex system, radios transmit and receive simultaneously
in the same frequency band at the same time, providing a radical improvement in
spectral efficiency over a half-duplex system. However, in order to design such
a system, it is necessary to mitigate the self-interference due to simultaneous
transmission and reception, which seriously limits the maximum transmit power
of the full-duplex device. Especially, large differences in power levels in the
receiver front-end sets stringent requirements for the linearity of the
transceiver electronics. We present an advanced architecture for a compact
full-duplex multiantenna transceiver combining antenna design with analog and
digital cancellation, including both linear and nonlinear signal processing.
