For miscible viscous fingering (VF) in a Hele-Shaw cell or in two dimensional
homogeneous porous media, the transient growth of disturbances is investigated
by non-modal linear stability analysis (NMA). Due to the non-autonomous nature
of the linearized perturbed equations, the linear stability theory prohibits
using the normal mode analysis. The linearized perturbed equations for Darcy's
law coupled with a convection-diffusion equation is discretized using finite
difference method. The resultant matrix valued initial value problem is then
solved by fourth order Runge-Kutta method, followed by a singular value
decomposition (SVD) of the propagator matrix. We demonstrate the dominant
perturbation that experiences the maximum amplification within the linear
regime which lead to the transient growth. This feature was previously
unattained in the existing linear stability methods for miscible VF. To explore
the relevance of the optimal perturbation obtained from non-modal analysis of
the physical system, we performed direct numerical simulations (DNS) using a
highly accurate pseudo-spectral method. From DNS results it is observed that at
early time the amplification of the perturbation decays before it starts
growing, and this completely agrees with the NMA results. It is also shown that
the onset of instability in the linear regime obtained by the non-modal theory
is meticulously agreed with that of the DNS results, as compared to other
existing linear stability analyses.
