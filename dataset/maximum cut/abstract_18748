We present an analysis of the 101 ks, 2007 Suzaku spectrum of the LINER
galaxy NGC 1052. The 0.5-10 keV continuum is well-modeled by a power-law
modified by Galactic and intrinsic absorption, and it exhibits a soft, thermal
emission component below 1 keV. Both a narrow core and a broader component of
Fe K emission centered at 6.4 keV are robustly detected. While the narrow line
is consistent with an origin in material distant from the black hole, the broad
line is best fit empirically by a model that describes fluorescent emission
from the inner accretion disk around a rapidly rotating black hole. We find no
evidence in this observation for Comptonized reflection of the hard X-ray
source by the disk above 10 keV, however, which casts doubt on the hypothesis
that the broad iron line originates in the inner regions of a standard
accretion disk. We explore other possible scenarios for producing this spectral
feature and conclude that the high equivalent width (EW ~ 185 keV) and
full-width-half-maximum velocity of the broad iron line (v ~ 0.37c) necessitate
an origin within d ~ 8 gravitational radii of the hard X-ray source. Based on
the confirmed presence of a strong radio jet in this galaxy nucleus, the broad
iron line may be produced in dense plasma near the base of the jet, implying
that emission mechanisms in the centralmost portions of active galactic nuclei
are more complex than previously thought.
