We construct numerically the minimal surface in AdS spacetime surrounded by
the light-like segments, which are dual to the 4, 6 and 8-point gluon
scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. We evaluate the area of
the minimal surface in the radial cut-off regularization and compare these
areas with the formula conjectured by Bern, Dixon and Smirnov (BDS), which is
modified by the remainder function of cross-ratios of external momenta for
n(\geq 6)-point amplitudes. In our momentum configuration cross-ratios are
constant. We calculate the difference of areas with different conformal boost
parameters, which is independent of the remainder function, and find that its
dependence on the boost parameter is numerically consistent with the BDS
formula.
