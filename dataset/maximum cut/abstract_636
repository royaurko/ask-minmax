The role of cut-off and dimensional regularizations is discussed in the
context of obtaining a renormalized nucleon-nucleon potential from the chiral
Lagrangian formulation of the effective field theory due to Weinberg. Both
types of renormalizations are performed for the sum of an attractive delta
function and its derivatives. The equivalence between the two forms of
regularizations can be established with the use of energy-dependent bare
couplings and the explicit forms of these couplings are determined.
