As the era of high precision cosmology approaches, the empirically determined
power spectrum of the microwave background anisotropy $C_l$ will provide a
crucial test for cosmological theories. We present an exact semi-analytic
framework for the study of the ampling statistics of the $C_l$ resulting from
observations with partial sky coverage and anisotropic noise distributions.
This includes space-borne, air-borne and ground-based experiments. We apply
this theory to demonstrate its power for constructing fast but unbiased
approximate methods for the joint estimation of cosmological parameters.
Further applications, such as a test for possible non-Gaussianity of the
underlying theory and a ``poor man's power spectrum estimator'' are suggested.
An appendix derives recursion relations for the efficient computation of the
couplings between spherical harmonics on the cut sky.
