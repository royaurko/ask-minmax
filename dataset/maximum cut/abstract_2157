We investigate the possibility of observing strong interactions of
longitudinally polarized weak vector bosons in the process $\gamma \gamma \to
ZZ$ at a photon linear collider. We make use of polarization of the photon
beams and cuts on the decay products of the $Z$ bosons to enhance the signal
relative to the background of transversely polarized $ZZ$ pairs. We find that
the background overwhelms the signal unless there are strong resonant effects,
as for instance from a technicolor analogue of the hadronic $f_2(1270)$ meson.
