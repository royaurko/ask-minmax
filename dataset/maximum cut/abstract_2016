We show that laboratory experiments cannot measure the absolute value of dark
energy. All known experiments rely on electromagnetic interactions. They are
thus insensitive to particles and fields that interact only weakly with
ordinary matter. In addition, Josephson junction experiments only measure
differences in vacuum energy similar to Casimir force measurements. Gravity,
however, couples to the absolute value. Finally we note that Casimir force
measurements have tested zero point fluctuations up to energies of ~10 eV, well
above the dark energy scale of ~0.01 eV. Hence, the proposed cut-off in the
fluctuation spectrum is ruled out experimentally.
