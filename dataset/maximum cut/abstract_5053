Let C be a non-hyperelliptic algebraic curve of genus at least 3. Enriques
and Babbage proved that its canonical image is the intersection of the quadrics
that contain it, except when C is trigonal (that is, it has a linear system of
degree 3 and dimension 1) or C is isomorphic to a plane quintic (genus 6). We
present a method to decide whether a given algebraic curve is trigonal, and in
the affirmative case to compute a map from C to the projective line whose
fibers cut out the linear system. It is based on the Lie algebra method
presented in Schicho (2006). Our algorithm is part of a larger effort to
determine whether a given algebraic curve admits a radical parametrization.
