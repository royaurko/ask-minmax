Freeze out of particles across a space-time hypersurface is discussed in
kinetic models. The calculation of final momentum distribution of emitted
particles is described for freeze out surfaces, with spacelike normals. The
resulting non-equilibrium distribution does not resemble, the previously
proposed, cut Juttner distribution, and shows non-exponential p_t-spectra
similar to the ones observed in experiments.
