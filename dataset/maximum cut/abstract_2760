Renling Jin proved that if A and B are two subsets of the natural numbers
with positive Banach density, then A+B is piecewise syndetic. In this paper, we
prove that, under various assumptions on positive lower or upper densities of A
and B, there is a high density set of witnesses to the piecewise syndeticity of
A+B. Most of the result are shown to hold more generally for subsets of Z^d.
The key technical tool is a Lebesgue density theorem for measure spaces induced
by cuts in the nonstandard integers.
