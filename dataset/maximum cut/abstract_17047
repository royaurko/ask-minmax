Polarization is an important indicator of stellar evolution, especially for
stars evolving from red-giant stage to planetary nebulae. However, not much is
known about the polarimetric properties of the carbon-enhanced metal-poor
(CEMP) stars, although they have been well studied in terms of photometric as
well as low- and high-resolution spectroscopy. We report here first-ever
estimates of V-band polarimetry of a group of CEMP stars. V-band polarimetry
was planned as the V-band is known to show maximum polarization among BVRI
polarimetry for any scattering of light caused due to dust. Based on these
estimates the program stars show a distinct classification into two: one with
p% < 0.4 and the other with p% > 1. Stars with circumstellar material exhibit a
certain amount of polarization that may be caused by scattering of starlight
due to circumstellar dust distribution into non-spherically symmetric
envelopes. The degree of polarization increases with asymmetries present in the
geometry of the circumstellar dust distribution. Our results reflect upon these
properties. While the sample size is relatively small, the polarimetric
separation of the two groups (p% < 0.4 and p% > 1) is very distinct; this
finding, therefore, opens up an avenue of exploration with regard to CEMP
stars.
