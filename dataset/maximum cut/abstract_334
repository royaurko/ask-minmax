We clarify the relation between the improvement of dispersion relations in
the fermion sector of lattice regularized QCD and the improvement of bulk
thermodynamic observables. We show that in the infinite temperature limit the
cut-off dependence in dispersion relations can be eliminated up to O(a^n)
corrections, if the quark propagator is chosen to be rotationally invariant up
to this order. In bulk thermodynamic observables this eliminates cut-off
effects up to the same order at vanishing as well as non-vanishing chemical
potential. We furthermore show, that in the infinite temperature, ideal gas
limit the dependence of finite cut-off corrections on the chemical potential is
given by Bernoulli polynomials which are universal as they do not depend on a
particular discretization scheme. We explicitly calculate leading and
next-to-leading order cut-off corrections for some staggered and Wilson fermion
type actions and compare these with exact evaluations of the free fermion
partition functions. This also includes the chirally invariant overlap and
domain wall fermion formulations.
