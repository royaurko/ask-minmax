For neutron stars with hyperon-mixed core, neutrino emissivity is studied
under the equation of state, obtained by introducing repulsive three-body force
universal for all baryons so as to assure the maximum mass compatible with the
observation. By paying attention to the density-dependence of critical
temperatures of baryon superfluids, which reflect the nature of baryon-baryon
interaction and control neutron star cooling, we show what neutrino emission
processes are efficient in the regions with and without hyperon mixing and
remark its implications related to neutron star cooling.
