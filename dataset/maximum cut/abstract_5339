The high-spin rotational bands in 168Hf and the triaxial bands in Lu nuclei
are analyzed using the configuration-constrained Cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky
(CNS) model. Special attention is given to the up-sloping extruder orbitals.
The relative alignment between the bands which appear to correspond to triaxial
shape is also considered, including the yrast ultra-high spin band in 158Er.
This comparison suggests that the latter band is formed from rotation around
the intermediate axis. In addition, the standard approximations of the CNS
approach are investigated, indicating that the errors which are introduced by
the neglect of off-shell matrix elements and the cut-off at 9 oscillator shells
(N_{max}=8) are essentially negligible compared to other uncertainties. On the
other hand, the full inclusion of the hexadecapole degree of freedom is more
significant; for example it leads to a decrease of the total energy of ~ 500
keV in the TSD region of 168Hf.
