Let Lambda be a set of three integers and let C_Lambda be the space of
2pi-periodic functions with spectrum in Lambda endowed with the maximum modulus
norm. We isolate the maximum modulus points x of trigonometric trinomials T in
C_Lambda and prove that x is unique unless |T| has an axis of symmetry. This
permits to compute the exposed and the extreme points of the unit ball of
C_Lambda, to describe how the maximum modulus of T varies with respect to the
arguments of its Fourier coefficients and to compute the norm of unimodular
relative Fourier multipliers on C_Lambda. We obtain in particular the Sidon
constant of Lambda.
