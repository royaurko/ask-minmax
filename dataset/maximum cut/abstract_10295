The bottomonium spectral functions at finite temperature are analyzed by
employing QCD sum rules with the maximum entropy method. This approach enables
us to extract the spectral functions without any phenomenological
parametrization, and thus to visualize deformation of the spectral functions
due to temperature effects estimated from quenched lattice QCD data. As a
result, it is found that \Upsilon and \eta_b survive in hot matter of
temperature up to at least 2.3T_c and 2.1T_c, respectively, while \chi_{b0} and
\chi_{b1} will disappear at T<2.5T_c. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the
vector channel shows that the spectral function in the region of the lowest
peak at T=0 contains contributions from the excited states, \Upsilon(2S) and
\Upsilon(3S), as well as the ground states \Upsilon (1S). Our results at finite
T are consistent with the picture that the excited states of bottomonia
dissociate at lower temperature than that of the ground state. Assuming this
picture, we find that \Upsilon(2S) and \Upsilon(3S) disappear at T=1.5-2.0T_c.
