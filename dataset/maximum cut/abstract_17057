We consider the problem of estimating the graph associated with a binary
Ising Markov random field. We describe a method based on $\ell_1$-regularized
logistic regression, in which the neighborhood of any given node is estimated
by performing logistic regression subject to an $\ell_1$-constraint. The method
is analyzed under high-dimensional scaling in which both the number of nodes
$p$ and maximum neighborhood size $d$ are allowed to grow as a function of the
number of observations $n$. Our main results provide sufficient conditions on
the triple $(n,p,d)$ and the model parameters for the method to succeed in
consistently estimating the neighborhood of every node in the graph
simultaneously. With coherence conditions imposed on the population Fisher
information matrix, we prove that consistent neighborhood selection can be
obtained for sample sizes $n=\Omega(d^3\log p)$ with exponentially decaying
error. When these same conditions are imposed directly on the sample matrices,
we show that a reduced sample size of $n=\Omega(d^2\log p)$ suffices for the
method to estimate neighborhoods consistently. Although this paper focuses on
the binary graphical models, we indicate how a generalization of the method of
the paper would apply to general discrete Markov random fields.
