We compute the differential B -> X_s gamma decay width in the Standard Model
as a function of the photon energy using Dressed Gluon Exponentiation (DGE).
The resummed spectrum is matched with the fixed-order expansion, making use of
the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) results for the matrix element of the
magnetic dipole interaction O_7 and NLO ones for other operators in the
effective Weak Hamiltonian. We develop a new technique to implement constraints
on the analytic structure of the Sudakov factor in moment space. This improves
the behavior of the resummed spectrum away from the Sudakov region. We also
derive an analytic expression for the Borel transform of the perturbative
series for the O_7 spectrum in the large-beta_0 limit. Using this example we
demonstrate that exponentiation in moment space is necessary for the
calculation of the spectrum for E_gamma > 2 GeV. Finally, we investigate
numerically the relation between renormalons, power corrections and support
properties. We present predictions for the branching fraction and the first few
spectral moments as a function of a cut E_gamma>E_0 and estimate the
theoretical uncertainty.
