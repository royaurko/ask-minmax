We use unitarity techniques to compute the two-loop non-planar corrections to
the Sudakov form factor and the four-point amplitude in ABJM theory. We start
by reconstructing non-planar integrals from two-particle cuts in three
dimensions. This causes ambiguities, due to the one-loop four-point amplitude
being subleading in dimensional regularization. We provide a prescription to
circumvent them and show that it leads to the correct results, as checked
against the recent Feynman diagram computation. For the amplitude we point out
an alternative basis of integrals, including a non-planar double-box with a
numerator inspired by color-kinematics duality. We reproduce the result using a
combination thereof with the coefficients fixed by generalized unitarity. For
BLG theory we propose that this gives the form of the amplitude satisfying
color-kinematics duality. Finally, we compute the complete two-loop amplitude
of three-dimensional N = 8 SYM, and the corresponding four-point amplitude in N
= 16 supergravity as a double copy.
