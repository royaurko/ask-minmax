The detemination of the primary cosmic ray mass composition from the
longitudinal development of atmospheric cascades is still an open problem. In
this work we propose a new method of the multiparametric topological analysis
and show that if both X$_{max}$ - the depth of shower maximum and N$_{max}$ -
the number of charged particles in the shower maximum are used, reliable
results can be obtained.
