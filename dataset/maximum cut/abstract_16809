The spectrum of cosmic rays (CRs) is affected by their escape from an
acceleration site. This may have been observed not only in the gamma-ray
spectrum of young supernova remnants (SNRs) such as RX J1713.7-3946, but also
in the spectrum of CRs showering on the Earth. The escape-limited model of
cosmic-ray acceleration is studied in general. We discuss the spectrum of CRs
running away from the acceleration site. The model may also constrain the
spectral index at the acceleration site and the ansatz with respect to the
unknown injection process into the particle acceleration. We apply our model to
CR acceleration in SNRs and in active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are
plausible candidates of Galactic and extragalactic CRs, respectively. In
particular, for young SNRs, we take account of the shock evolution with cooling
of escaping CRs in the Sedov phase. The spectrum of escaping CRs generally
depends on the physical quantities at the acceleration site, such as the
spectral index, the evolution of the maximum energy of CRs and the evolution of
the number of CRs. It is found that the spectrum of run-away particles can be
both softer and harder than that of the acceleration site. The model could
explain spectral indices of both Galactic and extragalactic CRs produced by
SNRs and AGNs, respectively, suggesting the unified picture of CR acceleration.
