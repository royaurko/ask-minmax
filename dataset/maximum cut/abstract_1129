We consider the phenomenon of regge cut splitting, corresponding to the BFKL
pomeron into an infinite sequence of regge-poles, which happens when one takes
into account the running of QCD coupling with scale. The first members of this
sequence, after adjusting their parameters, can effectively include the
nonperturbative part of pomeron, and by this way all pomeron components - soft
and hard can be treated in a unique way.
