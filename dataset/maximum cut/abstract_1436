After new publications of H1 data for the diffractive photoproduction of
dijets, which overlap with the earlier published H1 data and the recently
published data of the ZEUS collaboration, have appeared, we have recalculated
the cross sections for this process in next-to-leading order (NLO) of
perturbative QCD to see whether they can be interpreted consistently. The
results of these calculations are compared to the data of both collaborations.
We find that the NLO cross sections disagree with the data, showing that
factorization breaking occurs at that order. If direct and resolved
contributions are both suppressed by the same amount, the global suppression
factor depends on the transverse-energy cut. However, by suppressing only the
resolved contribution, also reasonably good agreement with all the data is
found with a suppression factor independent of the transverse-energy cut.
