We have redetermined kinematic parameters of the Gould Belt using currently
available data on the motion of nearby young (log t < 7.91) open clusters, OB
associations, and moving stellar groups. Our modeling shows that the residual
velocities reach their maximum values of -4 km/s for rotation (in the direction
of Galactic rotation) and +4 km/s for expansion at a distance from the
kinematic center of about 300 pc. We have taken the following parameters of the
Gould Belt center: Ro=150 pc and lo=128 degrees. The whole structure is shown
to move relative to the local standard of rest at a velocity of 10.7+-0.7 km/s
in the direction l=274+-4degrees and b=-1+-3 degrees. Using the derived
rotation velocity, we have estimated the virial mass of the Gould Belt to be
1.5E6 Solar mass.
