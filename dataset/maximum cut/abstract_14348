We consider pair production and decay of fundamental unstable particles in
the framework of a modified perturbation theory (MPT), which treats resonant
contributions of unstable particles in the sense of distributions. The
cross-sections for the top-quark pair production and for the $W$-boson pair
production in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation are calculated within the NNLO in
models that admit exact solutions. In both cases an excellent convergence of
the MPT is detected at the energies close to and above the maximum of the cross
section. In the case of $W$-boson pair production a precision of the
description at the ILC energies is ensured at the level of one per-mille or
higher.
