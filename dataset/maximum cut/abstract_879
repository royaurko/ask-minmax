The cut-off of the Alfven wave, caused by plasma collisions with neutrals in
multi-component partially ionized plasmas, is discussed.
  Full multi-component theory is used, and similarities and differences
regarding the classic magnetohydrodynamic theory are presented.
  It is shown that the cut-off in partially ionized plasma in principle may
remain the same as predicted in classic magnetohydrodynamic works, although
multi-component theory also yields some essential differences. Due to electric
field, the ion motion is intrinsically two-dimensional and this results in
additional forced oscillations of neutrals. One new small parameter, containing
the ion inertial length, appears in the multi-component theory. This new small
parameter is missing in the magnetohydrodynamic description, and it turns out
that for some parameters it may be greater than the ions-to-neutrals density
ratio which is the only small parameter in the magnetohydrodynamic description.
Due to this the Alfven wave behavior can become much different as compared to
classic magnetohydrodynamic results. It is shown also that in plasmas with
unmagnetized ions, Alfv}n waves cannot be excited. This by all means applies to
the solar photosphere where the ion collision frequency may be far above the
ion gyro-frequency.
