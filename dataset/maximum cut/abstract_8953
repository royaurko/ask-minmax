We report the high strength of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling of trilayered
composites prepared by electro-deposition. The ME coupling of Ni-lead zirconate
titanate (PZT)-Ni trilayered structure was measured ranged from1 kHz to 120
kHz. The trilayered composites exhibit high magnetoelectric voltage coefficient
because of good bonding between piezoelectric and magnetostrictive layers. The
maximum magnetoelectric voltage coefficient can be up to 33 V/cm Oe at the
electromechanical resonance frequency. This magnetoelectric effect shows
promising application in transducers for magnetoelectric energy conversion.
