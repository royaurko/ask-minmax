A next generation atmospheric Cherenkov observatory is described based on the
Whipple Observatory $\gamma$-ray telescope. A total of nine such imaging
telescopes will be deployed in an array that will permit the maximum
versatility and give high sensitivity in the 50 GeV - 50 TeV band (with maximum
sensitivity from 100 GeV to 10 TeV).
