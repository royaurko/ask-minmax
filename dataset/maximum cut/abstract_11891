We discuss the implementation of quasiparticle calculations for point defects
on semiconductor surfaces and, as a specific example, present an ab initio
study of the electronic structure of the As vacancy in the +1 charge state on
the GaAs(110) surface. The structural properties are calculated with the
plane-wave pseudopotential method, and the quasiparticle energies are obtained
from Hedin's GW approximation. Our calculations show that the 1a" vacancy state
in the band gap is shifted from 0.06 to 0.65 eV above the valence-band maximum
after the self-energy correction to the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues. The GW result is
in close agreement with a recent surface photovoltage imaging measurement.
