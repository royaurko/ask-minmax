We simulate time-dependent particle acceleration in the blast wave of a young
supernova remnant (SNR), using a Monte Carlo approach for the diffusion and
acceleration of the particles, coupled to an MHD code. We calculate the
distribution function of the cosmic rays concurrently with the hydrodynamic
evolution of the SNR, and compare the results with those obtained using simple
steady-state models. The surrounding medium into which the supernova remnant
evolves turns out to be of great influence on the maximum energy to which
particles are accelerated. In particular, a shock going through a $\rho \propto
r^{-2}$ density profile causes acceleration to typically much higher energies
than a shock going through a medium with a homogeneous density profile. We find
systematic differences between steady-state analytical models and our
time-dependent calculation in terms of spectral slope, maximum energy, and the
shape of the cut-off of the particle spectrum at the highest energies. We also
find that, provided that the magnetic field at the reverse shock is
sufficiently strong to confine particles, cosmic rays can be easily
re-accelerated at the reverse shock.
