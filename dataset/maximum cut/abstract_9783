The functional It\^o formula, firstly introduced by Bruno Dupire for
continuous semimartingales, might be extended in two directions: different
dynamics for the underlying process and/or weaker assumptions on the regularity
of the functional. In this paper, we pursue the former type by proving the
functional version of the Meyer-Tanaka Formula for the class of convex
functionals. Following the idea of the proof of the classical Meyer-Tanaka
formula, we study the mollification of functionals and its convergence
properties. As an example, we apply the theory to the running maximum
functional.
