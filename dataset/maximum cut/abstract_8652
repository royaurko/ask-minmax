We present results from an analytic calculation of thermal meson spectral
functions in the infinite temperature (free field) limit. We compare spectral
functions for various lattice fermion formulations used at present in studies
of in-medium properties of hadrons based on the maximum entropy method (MEM).
In particular, we will present a new calculation of spectral functions
performed with extended quark sources.
