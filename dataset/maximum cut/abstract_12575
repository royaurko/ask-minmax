We present charged particle densities as a function of pseudorapidity and
collision centrality for the 197Au+197Au reaction at Sqrt{s_NN}=200 GeV. For
the 5% most central events we obtain dN_ch/deta(eta=0) = 625 +/- 55 and
N_ch(-4.7<= eta <= 4.7) = 4630+-370, i.e. 14% and 21% increases, respectively,
relative to Sqrt{s_NN}=130 GeV collisions. Charged-particle production per pair
of participant nucleons is found to increase from peripheral to central
collisions around mid-rapidity. These results constrain current models of
particle production at the highest RHIC energy.
