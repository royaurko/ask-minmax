We present K-band photometry and low-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy
from 1.44 to 2.45 micron of isolated planetary-mass candidate members in the
sigma Orionis cluster found by Zapatero Osorio et al. The new data have been
obtained with NIRC at the Keck I telescope. All of our targets, except for one,
are confirmed as likely cluster members. Hence, we also confirm that the
planetary-mass domain in the cluster is well populated. Using our deep K-band
images we searched for companions to the targets in the separation range 0.3"
to 10" up to a maximum faint limit of K=19.5 mag. One suspected companion seems
to be an extremely red galaxy. The near-infrared colors of the sigma Orionis
substellar members indicate that dust grains condense and settle in their
atmospheres. We estimate that the surface temperatures range from 2500 K down
to 1500 K. The spectroscopic sequence covers the full range of L subclasses,
and the faintest object is tentatively classified as T0. These targets provide
a sequence of substellar objects of known age, distance and metallicity, which
can be used as benchmark for understanding the spectral properties of ultracool
dwarfs.
