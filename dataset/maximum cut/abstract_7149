Given a set $V$ of points in $\mathbb R^d$, two points $p$, $q$ from $V$ form
a double-normal pair, if the set $V$ lies between two parallel hyperplanes that
pass through $p$ and $q$ respectively and that are orthogonal to the segment
$pq$. In this paper we study the maximum number $N_d(n)$ of double-normal pairs
in a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb R^d$. It is not difficult to get from the
famous Erd\H os-Stone theorem that $N_d(n) = \frac 12(1-1/k)n^2+o(n^2)$ for a
suitable integer $k = k(d)$ and it was shown in the paper by J. Pach and K.
Swanepoel that $\lceil d/2\rceil\le k(d)\le d-1$ and that asymptotically
$k(d)\gtrsim d-O(\log d)$.
  In this paper we sharpen the upper bound on $k(d)$, which, in particular,
gives $k(4)=2$ and $k(5)=3$ in addition to the equality $k(3)=2$ established by
J. Pach and K. Swanepoel. Asymptotically we get $k(d)+\log_2k(d) \le d$ and
show that this problem is connected with the problem of determining the maximum
number of points in $\mathbb R^d$ that form pairwise acute (or non-obtuse)
angles. We refine the lower bound on $k'(d)$ as well.
