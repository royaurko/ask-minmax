In this paper we present a locally one-dimensional (LOD) splitting method to
solve numerically the two-dimensional Black-Scholes equation, arising in the
Hull & White model for pricing European options with stochastic volatility,
characterized by the presence of a mixed derivative term. The parabolic
equation degenerates on the boundary x = 0 and we apply a fitted finite-volume
difference scheme, proposed in [23], in order to resolve the degeneration.
Discrete maximum principle is proved and therefore our method preserves the
non-negativity. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of our
difference scheme.
