The origin of the strong magnetic fields observed in chemically peculiar Ap
and Bp stars stars has long been debated. The recent discovery of magnetic
fields in the intermediate mass pre-main sequence Herbig Ae and Be stars links
them to Ap and Bp stars, providing vital clues about Ap and Bp stars and the
origin and evolution of magnetic fields in intermediate and high mass stars. A
detailed study of one young magnetic B star, HD 72106A, is presented. This star
appears to be in a binary system with an apparently normal Herbig Ae star. A
maximum longitudinal magnetic field strength of +391 +/- 65 G is found in HD
72106A, as are strong chemical peculiarities, with photospheric abundances of
some elements ranging up to 100x above solar.
