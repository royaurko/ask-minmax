Mean field Master equations for the norm game are investigated. The
strategies are: to obey the norm or not and to punish those who break it or
not. The punishment, the temptation, the punishment cost and the relaxation of
vengeance are modeled by four parameters; for the fixed points, only two ratios
of these parameters are relevant. The analysis reveals two phases; in one of
them, nobody obeys the norm and nobody punishes. This phase is stable if the
punishment is small enough. In the other phase, the proportion of defectors
depends on the parameters and in some cases it can be arbitrarily small. A
transcritical bifurcation appears between the two phases. Numerical
calculations show that the relaxation time shows a sharp maximum at the
bifurcation point. The model is adapted also for the case of two mutually
punishing groups. A difference between the solutions for two groups appears if
the punishment of one group by the other is weaker, than the opposite.
