The nondipole parameters that characterize the angular disribution of the
photoelectrons from the 3d subshell of Cs are found to be altered qualitatively
by the inclusion of correlation in the form of interchannel coupling between
the $3d_{3/2}$ and $3d_{5/2}$ photoionization channels. A prominent
characteristic maximum is predicted only in the parameters for $3d_{5/2}$
photoionization, while the effect for $3d_{3/2}$ is rather weak. The results
are obtained within the framework of the Generalized Random Phase Approximation
with Exchange (GRPAE), which in addition to the RPAE effects takes into account
the rearrangement of all atomic electrons due to the creation of a 3d vacancy.
