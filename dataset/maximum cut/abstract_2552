We study a noninteracting supersymmetric model in de Sitter spacetime.
Supersymmetry breaking induces a nonzero vacuum energy density. A short
distance cut-off of the order of Planck length provides a matching between the
vacuum energy density and the cosmological constant related to the de Sitter
expansion parameter.
