Angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopic measurements have been performed
on an insulating cuprate Ca_2CuO_2Cl_2. High resolution data taken along the
\Gamma to (pi,pi) cut show an additional dispersive feature that merges with
the known dispersion of the lowest binding energy feature, which follows the
usual strongly renormalized dispersion of ~0.35 eV. This higher energy part
reveals a dispersion that is very close to the unrenormalized band predicted by
band theory. A transfer of spectral weight from the low energy feature to the
high energy feature is observed as the \Gamma point is approached. By comparing
with theoretical calculations the high energy feature observed here
demonstrates that the incoherent portion of the spectral function has
significant structure in momentum space due to the presence of various energy
scales.
