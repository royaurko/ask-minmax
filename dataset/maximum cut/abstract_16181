We have observed the emission-line kinematics and photometry of a southern
triplet of galaxies. The triplet contains a giant spiral galaxy AM 1934-563
which optical structure resembles a polar-ring galaxy: distorted spiral disk,
seen almost edge-on, and a faint large-scale (45 kpc in diameter) warped
structure, inclined by 60^o-70^o with respect to the disk major axis. The
triplet shows relatively small velocity dispersion (69 km/s) and a large
crossing time (0.17 in units of the Hubble time). The disk of AM 1934-563
demonstrates optical colors typical for an early-type spirals, strong radial
color gradient, and almost exponential surface brightness distribution with an
exponential scale-length value of 3.1 kpc (R passband). The galaxy shows a
maximum rotation velocity of about 200 km/s and it lies close to the
Tully-Fisher relation for spiral galaxies. The suspected polar ring is faint
(\mu(B) > 24) and strongly warped. Its total luminosity comprises (10-15)% of
the total luminosity of AM 1934-563. We then try to model this system using
numerical simulations, and study its possible formation mechanisms. We find
that the most robust model, that reproduces the observed characteristics of the
ring and the host galaxy, is the tidal transfer of mass from a massive gas-rich
donor galaxy to the polar ring. The physical properties of the triplet of
galaxies are in agreement with this scenario.
