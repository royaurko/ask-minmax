We numerically show that the zero-energy Majorana surface states are
suppressed around a vortex in the three-dimensional topological superconductors
such as Cu$_{x}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and Sn$_{1-x}$In$_{x}$Te. On the other hand,
the zero-energy Majorana bound states along the vortex line are robust against
cut by the surface. The suppression of the surface bound states is similar to
that with a magnetic impurity on the surface of the topological insulator. The
suppression of the surface-bound states around a vortex can be observed as the
unconventional energy dependence of imaging of the scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy.
