The purpose of the present paper is to study the neutrino oscillations as
they may appear in the low energy neutrinos emitted in triton decay, with
maximum neutrino energy of 18.6 KeV. Such low energy neutrino oscillations can
only be detected via neutrino electron scattering. The novel feature is the
fact that the cross section is sensitive to both charged and neutral currents.
Thus one can simultaneously probe the electron neutrino disappearance as well
as the appearance of the other two flavors. By folding the differential cross
section with the neutrino spectrum one can study the dependence of the
oscillation parameters as a function of the electron energy. The technical
challenges to this end can be summarized as building a very large TPC capable
of detecting low energy recoils, down to a few 100 eV, within the required low
background constraints have been previously described \cite{NOSTOS1}. We only
mention here that the oscillation involving the small angle theta_13, directly
measured in this experiment, is fully contained inside the detector. A
sensitivity of a few percent for the measurement of the above angle will be
achieved.
