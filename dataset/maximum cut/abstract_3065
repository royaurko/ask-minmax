By minimizing the coupled mean-field energy functionals, we investigate the
ground-state properties of a rotating atomic boson-fermion mixture in a
two-dimensional parabolic trap. At high angular frequencies in the
mean-field-lowest-Landau-level regime, quantized vortices enter the bosonic
condensate, and a finite number of degenerate fermions form the
maximum-density-droplet state. As the boson-fermion coupling constant
increases, the maximum density droplet develops into a lower-density state
associated with the phase separation, revealing characteristics of a
Landau-level structure.
