We introduce an upper semi-continuous function that stratifies the highest
multiplicity locus of a hypersurface in arbitrary characteristic (over a
perfect field). The blow-up along the maximum stratum defined by this function
leads to a form of simplification of the singularities, also known as a
reduction to the monomial case.
