The theory of characteristic functions for row contractions is used to
determine the group $Aut(B(H)^n_1)$ of all free holomorphic automorphisms of
the unit ball of $B(H)^n$. We show that the noncommutative Poisson transform
commutes with the action of the automorphism group $Aut(B(H)^n_1)$. This leads
to a characterization of the unitarily implemented automorphisms of the
Cuntz-Toeplitz algebra $C^*(S_1,..., S_n)$, which leave invariant the
noncommutative disc algebra $\cA_n$. This result provides new insight into
Voiculescu's group of automorphisms of the Cuntz-Toeplitz algebra and reveals
new connections with noncommutative multivariable operator theory, especially,
the theory of characteristic functions for row contractions and the
noncommutative Poisson transforms. We study the isometric dilations and the
characteristic functions of row contractions under the action of the
automorphism group $Aut(B(H)^n_1)$. This enables us to obtain some results
concerning the behavior of the curvature and the Euler characteristic of a row
contraction under $Aut(B(H)^n_1)$. We prove a maximum principle for free
holomorphic functions on the noncommutative ball $[B(H)^n]_1$ and provide some
extensions of the classical Schwarz lemma to our noncommutative setting.
