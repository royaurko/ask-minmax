The model Tip4p/{\epsilon} for water is tested for the presence of
thermodynamic and dy- namic anomalies. Molecular dynamic simulations for this
model were performed and we show that for this system the density versus
temperature at constant pressure ex- hibits a maximum. In addition we also show
that the diffusion coefficient versus density at constant temperature has a
maximum and a minimum. The anomalous behavior of the density and of the
diffusion coefficient obey the water hierachy. The results for the Tip4p- are
consistent with experiments and when compared with the Tip4p-2005 model show
similar results a variety of physical properties and better performance for the
dielectric constant.
