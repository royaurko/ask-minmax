The shear dynamics in Bianchi I cosmological model on the brane with a
perfect fluid (the equation of state is $p=(\gamma-1) \mu$) is studied. It is
shown that for $1 < \gamma < 2$ the shear parameter has maximum at some moment
during a transition period from nonstandard to standard cosmology. An exact
formula for the matter density $\mu$ in the epoch of maximum shear parameter as
a function of the equation of state is obtained.
