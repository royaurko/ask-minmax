We study the maximum smoothed likelihood estimator (MSLE) for interval
censoring, case 2, in the so-called separated case. Characterizations in terms
of convex duality conditions are given and strong consistency is proved.
Moreover, we show that, under smoothness conditions on the underlying
distributions and using the usual bandwidth choice in density estimation, the
local convergence rate is $n^{-2/5}$ and the limit distribution is normal, in
contrast with the rate $n^{-1/3}$ of the ordinary maximum likelihood estimator.
