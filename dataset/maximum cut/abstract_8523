Based on the $\kappa$-deformed functions ($\kappa$-exponential and
$\kappa$-logarithm) and associated multiplication operation ($\kappa$-product)
introduced by Kaniadakis (Phys. Rev. E \textbf{66} (2002) 056125), we present
another one-parameter generalization of Gauss' law of error. The likelihood
function in Gauss' law of error is generalized by means of the
$\kappa$-product. This $\kappa$-generalized maximum likelihood principle leads
to the {\it so-called} $\kappa$-Gaussian distributions.
