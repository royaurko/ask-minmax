The Ultra High Energy (UHE) neutrino scattering onto relic cosmic neutrinos
in galactic and local halos offers an unique way to overcome GZK cut-off. The
UHE nu secondary of UHE photo-pion decays may escape the GZK cut-off and travel
on cosmic distances hitting local light relic neutrinos clustered in dark
halos. The Z resonant production and the competitive W^+W^-, ZZ pair production
define a characteristic imprint on hadronic consequent UHECR spectra. This
imprint keeps memory both of the primary UHE nu spectra as well as of the
possible relic neutrino masses values, energy spectra and relic densities. Such
an hadronic showering imprint should reflect into spectra morphology of cosmic
rays near and above GZK 10^{19}-10^{21}eV cut-off energies. A possible neutrino
degenerate masses at eVs or a more complex and significant neutrino mass split
below or near Super-Kamiokande \triangle m_{\nu_{SK}}= 0.1 eV masses might be
reflected after each corresponding Z peak showering, into new twin unexpected
UHECR flux modulation behind GZK energies: E_{p} sim 3(frac{triangle
m_{\nu_{SK}}}/m_{\nu}10^{21}),eV.
  Other shadowsof lightest, nearly massless, neutrinos m_{nu_{2K} simeq 0.001eV
simeq kT_{\nu}, their lowest relic temperatures, energies and densities might
be also reflected at even higher energies edges near Grand Unification: E_{p}
\sim 2.2(m_{\nu_{2K}/E_{\nu}})10^{23}, eV .
