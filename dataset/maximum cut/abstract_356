The consequences for Berezin's quantization on symmetric spaces of the
identity of the set of coherent vectors orthogonal to a fixed one with the cut
locus are stated precisely. It is shown that functions expressing the coherent
states, the covariant symbols of operators, the diastasis function, the
characteristic and two-point functions are defined when one variable does not
belong to the cut locus of the other one.
