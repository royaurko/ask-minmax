We propose a Bayesian image super-resolution (SR) method with a causal
Gaussian Markov random field (MRF) prior. SR is a technique to estimate a
spatially high-resolution image from given multiple low-resolution images. An
MRF model with the line process supplies a preferable prior for natural images
with edges. We improve the existing image transformation model, the compound
MRF model, and its hyperparameter prior model. We also derive the optimal
estimator -- not the joint maximum a posteriori (MAP) or marginalized maximum
likelihood (ML), but the posterior mean (PM) -- from the objective function of
the L2-norm (mean square error) -based peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Point
estimates such as MAP and ML are generally not stable in ill-posed
high-dimensional problems because of overfitting, while PM is a stable
estimator because all the parameters in the model are evaluated as
distributions. The estimator is numerically determined by using variational
Bayes. Variational Bayes is a widely used method that approximately determines
a complicated posterior distribution, but it is generally hard to use because
it needs the conjugate prior. We solve this problem with simple Taylor
approximations. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method is
more accurate or comparable to existing methods.
