Blazars have been regarded as one of the most powerful sources of the highest
energy cosmic rays and also their byproducts, neutrinos. Provided that a
magnetized filamentary system is established in a blazar jet as well, we could
apply the mechanism of multi-stage diffusive shock acceleration to a feasible
TeV emitter, Mrk 501 to evaluate the achievable maximum energy of protons.
Taking conceivable energy restriction into account systematically, it seems
adequate to say that EeV-protons are produced at this site by our present
model. We also estimate neutrino fluxes generated by these accelerated protons
and discuss the detectability based on an updated kilometre-scale telescope
such as IceCube.
