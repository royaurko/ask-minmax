We study theoretically the responsivity of optical modulators. For the case
of linear response we find using perturbation theory an upper bound imposed
upon the responsivity. For the case of two mode modulator we find a lower bound
imposed upon the optical path required for achieving full modulation when the
maximum birefringence strength is given.
