This letter presents a comprehensive framework analyzing the asymptotic error
performance of a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system
employing spatial modulation (SM) with maximum likelihood detection and perfect
channel state information. Generic analytical expressions for the diversity and
coding gains are deduced that reveal fundamental properties of MIMO SM systems.
The presented analysis can be used to obtain closed-form upper bounds for the
average bit error probability (ABEP) of MIMO SM systems under generalized
fading which become asymptotically tight in the high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) region.
