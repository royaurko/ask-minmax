We revisit the analytical properties of the static quasi-photon
polarizability function for an electron gas at finite temperature, in
connection with the existence of Friedel oscillations in the potential created
by an impurity. In contrast with the zero temperature case, where the
polarizability is an analytical function, except for the two branch cuts which
are responsible for Friedel oscillations, at finite temperature the
corresponding function is not analytical, in spite of becoming continuous
everywhere on the complex plane. This effect produces, as a result, the
survival of the oscillatory behavior of the potential. We calculate the
potential at large distances, and relate the calculation to the non-analytical
properties of the polarizability.
