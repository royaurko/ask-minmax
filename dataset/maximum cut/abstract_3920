From the spectral analysis of a broadband (0.1-200 keV) BeppoSAX observation
of the Seyfert 1 galaxy IC 4329A, the main results obtained are: a) the amount
of reflection, together with the intensity of the iron K line, indicate a
geometry with a solid angle substantially less than 2pi; b) the power law is
affected by a cut off with e-folding energy about 270 keV, the fourth
individual object so far where this property has been firmly detected; c) two
absorption features at about 0.7 and 1 keV are found, the first corresponding
to a blend of O vi and O vii, the other to a combination of FeL and NeK edges.
Compared to an earlier ASCA observation, when the source was 30% fainter, the
values of both the relative amount of reflection and the warm absorber
ionization degree are significantly lower: the comparison is suggestive of
sizeable delay effects in this object, due to geometrical factors in the
reflection, and to relaxation to equilibrium states in the ionization of the
absorber.
