Being one of the most important factors of economic growth of the country,
innovations became one of the key vectors in Russian economic policy. In this
field technology parks are one of the most effective instruments which can
provide growth of innovative activity in sectors, regions and economies. In
this paper, we made a model that allows us to evaluate the effect of technology
parks in the economy of the country and its potential for small and medium
enterprises. The model is based on a system of coupled equations, whose
parameters are estimated on the statistical data that reflect the activity of
the economic entity, in an environment of this entity the technology parks are
acting. Typically, there are regression equations linking a number of economic
factors with some output indicators. We analyzed the property of increasing the
share of surviving small and medium enterprises for Russian conditions as one
of the effect of technology parks and built a working model for estimating the
maximum (limit) values of the effect.
