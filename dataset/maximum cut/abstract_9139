The economy globalization measure problem is discussed. Four macroeconomic
indices of twenty among the "richest" countries are examined. Four types of
"distances" are calculated.Two types of networks are next constructed for each
distance measure definition. It is shown that the globalization process can be
best characterised by an entropy measure, based on entropy Manhattan distance.
It is observed that a globalization maximum was reached in the interval
1970-2000. More recently a deglobalization process is observed.
