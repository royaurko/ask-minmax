Using calibrated simulations, we report a detailed study of the doping-less
tunnel field effect transistor (TFET) on a thin intrinsic silicon film using
charge plasma concept. Without the need for any doping, the source and drain
regions are formed using the charge plasma concept by choosing appropriate work
functions for the source and drain metal electrodes. Our results show that the
performance of the doping-less TFET is similar to that of a corresponding doped
TFET. The doping-less TFET is expected to be free from problems associated with
random dopant fluctuations. Further, fabrication of doping-less TFET does not
require high-temperature doping/annealing processes and therefore, cuts down
the thermal budget opening up the possibilities for fabricating TFETs on single
crystal silicon-on-glass substrates formed by wafer scale epitaxial transfer.
