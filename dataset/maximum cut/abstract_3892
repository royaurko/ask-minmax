We review the pulsating stars contained in the top 24 fields of the MACHO
bulge database, with special emphasis on the red semiregular stars. Based on
period, amplitude and color cuts, we have selected a sample of 2000 semiregular
variables with $15<P<100$ days. Their color-magnitude diagram is presented, and
period-luminosity relation is studied, as well as their spatial distribution.
We find that they follow the bar, unlike the RR Lyrae in these fields.
