It has been well accepted that the RNA secondary structures of most
functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are closely related to their functions and
are conserved during evolution. Hence, prediction of conserved secondary
structures from evolutionarily related sequences is one important task in RNA
bioinformatics; the methods are useful not only to further functional analyses
of ncRNAs but also to improve the accuracy of secondary structure predictions
and to find novel functional RNAs from the genome. In this review, I focus on
common secondary structure prediction from a given aligned RNA sequence, in
which one secondary structure whose length is equal to that of the input
alignment is predicted. I systematically review and classify existing tools and
algorithms for the problem, by utilizing the information employed in the tools
and by adopting a unified viewpoint based on maximum expected gain (MEG)
estimators. I believe that this classification will allow a deeper
understanding of each tool and provide users with useful information for
selecting tools for common secondary structure predictions.
