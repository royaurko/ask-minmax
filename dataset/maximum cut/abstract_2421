Reciprocal space methods for solving Poisson's equation for finite charge
distributions are investigated. Improvements to previous proposals are
presented, and their performance is compared in the context of a real-space
density functional theory code. Two basic methodologies are followed:
calculation of correction terms, and imposition of a cut-off to the Coulomb
potential. We conclude that these methods can be safely applied to finite or
aperiodic systems with a reasonable control of speed and accuracy.
