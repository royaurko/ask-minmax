We find the characterization of maximum dimensional proper-biharmonic
integral $\mathcal{C}$-parallel submanifolds of a Sasakian space form and then
classify such submanifolds in a 7-dimensional Sasakian space form. Working in
the sphere $\mathbb{S}^7$ we explicitly find all 3-dimensional
proper-biharmonic integral $C$-parallel submanifolds. We also determine the
proper-biharmonic parallel Lagrangian submanifolds of $\mathbb{C}P^3$.
