The phenomenology of a radiating Schwarzschild black hole is analyzed in a
noncommutative spacetime. It is shown that noncommutativity does not depend on
the intensity of the curvature. Thus we legitimately introduce noncommutativity
in the weak field limit by a coordinate coherent state approach. The new
interesting results are the following: i) the existence of a minimal non-zero
mass to which black hole can shrink; ii) a finite maximum temperature that the
black hole can reach before cooling down to absolute zero; iii) the absence of
any curvature singularity. The proposed scenario offers a possible solution to
conventional difficulties when describing terminal phase of black hole
evaporation.
