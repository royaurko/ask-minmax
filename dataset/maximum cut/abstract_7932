We propose the concept, synthesis, analysis, and design of graphene-based
plasmonic tunable low-pass filters operating in the THz band. The proposed
structure is composed of a graphene strip transferred onto a dielectric and a
set of polysilicon DC gating pads located beneath it. This structure implements
a stepped impedance low-pass filter for the propagating surface plasmons by
adequately controlling the guiding properties of each strip section through
graphene's field effect. A synthesis procedure is presented to design filters
with desired specifications in terms of cut-off frequency, in-band performance,
and rejection characteristics. The electromagnetic modeling of the structure is
efficiently performed by combining an electrostatic scaling law to compute the
guiding features of each strip section with a transmission line and
transfer-matrix framework, approach further validated via full wave
simulations. The performance of the proposed filters is evaluated in practical
scenarios, taking into account the presence of the gating bias and the
influence of graphene's losses. These results, together with the high
miniaturization associated with plasmonic propagation, are very promising for
the future use and integration of the proposed filters with other graphene and
silicon-based elements in innovative THz communication systems.
