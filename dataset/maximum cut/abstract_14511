The composition dependence of the structural, magnetic, and transport
properties of epitaxially grown Mn-Co-Ga films were investigated. The crystal
structure was observed to change from tetragonal to cubic as the Co content was
increased. In terms of the dependence of saturation magnetization on the Co
content, relatively small value was obtained for the
Mn$_{2.3}$Co$_{0.4}$Ga$_{1.3}$ film at a large {\it K}$_\textrm u$ value of 9.2
Merg/cm$^3$. Electrical resistivity of Mn-Co-Ga films was larger than that of
pure Mn-Ga film. The maximum value of the resistivity was 490 $\mu\Omega$cm for
Mn$_{2.2}$Co$_{0.6}$Ga$_{1.2}$ film. The high resistivity of Mn-Co-Ga might be
due to the presence of localized electron states in the films due to chemical
disordering caused by the Co substitution.
