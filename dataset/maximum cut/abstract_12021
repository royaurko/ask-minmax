Within the kinetic energy driven superconducting mechanism, the interplay
between the single particle coherence and superconducting instability in doped
cuprates is studied. The superconducting transition temperature increases with
increasing doping in the underdoped regime, and reaches a maximum in the
optimal doping, then decreases in the overdoped regime, however, the values of
this superconducting transition temperature in the whole superconducting range
are suppressed to low temperature due to the single particle coherence. Within
this superconducting mechanism, we calculate the dynamical spin structure
factor of cuprate superconductors, and reproduce all main features of inelastic
neutron scattering experiments in the superconducting-state.
