Electrically-excited electroelastic extensional vibrations of an arbitrarily
cut three-dimensional piezocrystal resonator are analyzed variationally. A set
of trigonometric trial functions applicable to a waveguide behavior of the
resonator partly covered by metal electrodes is proposed. The dependence of the
content of the vibration modes sustained by the resonator on the electrode
configuration is found. The frequency spectra taken in 128-Y-rotated lithium
niobate rectangular plates exhibit a good correspondence with the computed
resonator eigenfrequencies.
