We examine the exclusive signature $pp \to WH \to \ell \nu\;b \bar b$ at the
LHC. Although the backgrounds, principally arising from top production and
$Wjj$, are quite severe, it is shown that judicious application of phase-space
cuts and the use of $b$-tagging can in fact greatly enhance the detectability
of this channel. (Presented at the Eighth Meeting of the Division of Particles
