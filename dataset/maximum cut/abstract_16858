We present CCD photometric observations of the W UMa type contact binary EK
Comae Berenices using the 2 metre telescope of $IUCAA$ Girawali Observatory,
India. The star was classified as a W UMa type binary of subtype-W by
\citet{sam1996}. The new V band photometric observations of the star reveal
that shape of the light curve has changed significantly from the one observed
by \citet{sam1996}. A detailed analysis of the light curve obtained from the
high-precision CCD photometric observations of the star indicates that EK Comae
Berenices is not a W-type but an A-type totally eclipsing W UMa contact binary.
The photometric mass ratio is determined to be 0.349 $\pm$ 0.005. A temperature
difference of $\Delta T = 141 \pm 10 $ K between the components and an orbital
inclination of $i [^{o}] = 89.800 \pm 0.075$ were obtained for the binary
system. Absolute values of masses, radii and luminosities are estimated by
means of the standard mass-luminosity relation for zero age main-sequence
stars. The star shows O'Connell effect, asymmetries in the light curve shape
around the primary and secondary maximum. The observed O'Connell effect is
explained by the presence of a hot spot on the primary component.
