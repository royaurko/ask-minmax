The overall properties of the Herbig-Haro objects such as centerline
velocity, transversal profile of velocity, flow of mass and energy are
explained adopting two models for the turbulent jet. The complex shapes of the
Herbig-Haro objects, such as the arc in HH34 can be explained introducing the
combination of different kinematic effects such as velocity behavior along the
main direction of the jet and the velocity of the star in the interstellar
medium. The behavior of the intensity or brightness of the line of emission is
explored in three different cases : transversal 1D cut, longitudinal 1D cut and
2D map. An analytical explanation for the enhancement in intensity or
brightness such as usually modeled by the bow shock is given by a careful
analysis of the geometrical properties of the torus.
