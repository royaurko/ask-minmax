We extend certain basic and general concepts of thermodynamics to discrete
Markov systems exchanging work and heat with reservoirs. In this framework we
show that the celebrated Clausius inequality can be generalized and becomes an
equality, significantly extending several recent results. We further show that
achieving zero dissipation in a system implies that detailed balance obtains,
and as a consequence there is zero power production. We obtain inequalities for
power production under more general circumstances and show that near
equilibrium obtaining maximum power production requires dissipation to be of
the same order of magnitude.
