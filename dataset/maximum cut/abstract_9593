A non-equilibrium phase (Sr1-xLax)Fe2As2 was formed by epitaxial film-growth.
The resulting films emerged superconductivity along with suppression of the
resistivity anomaly that is associated with magnetic and structural phase
transitions. The maximum critical temperature was 20.8 K, which is almost the
same as that of directly electron-doped Sr(Fe1-xCox)2As2. Its electronic phase
diagram is much similar to that of Sr(Fe1-xCox)2As2, indicating that the
difference in the electron doping sites does not influence the superconducting
properties of 122-type SrFe2As2.
