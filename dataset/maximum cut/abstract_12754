Aspects of coherence and decoherence are analyzed within the optical Bloch
equations. By rewriting the analytic solution in an alternate form, we are able
to emphasize a number of unusual features: (a) despite the Markovian nature of
the bath, coherence at long times can be retained; (b) the long-time asymptotic
degree of coherence in the system is intertwined with the asymptotic difference
in level populations; (c) the traditional population-relaxation and decoherence
times, $T_1$ and $T_2$, lose their meaning when the system is in the presence
of an external field, and are replaced by more general overall timescales; (d)
increasing the field strength, quantified by the Rabi frequency, $\Omega$,
increases the rate of decoherence rather than reducing it, as one might expect;
and (e) maximum asymptotic coherence is reached when the system parameters
satisfy $\Omega^2 = 1/(T_1 T_2)$.
