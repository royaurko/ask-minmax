Two maxima in transverse relaxation rate of Cu(2) nuclei in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-y}$ are observed, at T = 35 K and T = 47 K. Comparison of
the $^{63}$Cu(2) and $^{65}$Cu(2) rates at T = 47 K indicates the magnetic
character of relaxation. The enhancement at T = 47 K of fluctuating local
magnetic fields perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes is connected with the
critical fluctuations of orbital currents. Maximum at T = 35 K is connected
with the appearance of inhomogeneous supeconducting phase. Together with data
published to date, our experimental results allow to suggest a qualitatively
new phase diagram of the superconducting phase.
