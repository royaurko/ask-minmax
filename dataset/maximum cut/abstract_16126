We have compared the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropy
maps made from one-year time ordered data (TOD) streams that simulated
observations of the originally planned 100 GHz Planck Low Frequency Instrument
(LFI). The maps were made with three different codes. Two of these, ROMA and
MapCUMBA, were implementations of maximum-likelihood (ML) map-making, whereas
the third was an implementation of the destriping algorithm. The purpose of
this paper is to compare these two methods, ML and destriping, in terms of the
maps they produce and the angular power spectrum estimates derived from these
maps. The difference in the maps produced by the two ML codes was found to be
negligible. As expected, ML was found to produce maps with lower residual noise
than destriping. In addition to residual noise, the maps also contain an error
which is due to the effect of subpixel structure in the signal on the
map-making method. This error is larger for ML than for destriping. If this
error is not corrected a bias will be introduced in the power spectrum
estimates. This study is related to Planck activities.
