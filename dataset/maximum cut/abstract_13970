Interference alignment (IA) is a revolutionary wireless transmission strategy
that reduces the impact of interference. The idea of interference alignment is
to coordinate multiple transmitters so that their mutual interference aligns at
the receivers, facilitating simple interference cancellation techniques. Since
IA's inception, researchers have investigated its performance and proposed
improvements, verifying IA's ability to achieve the maximum degrees of freedom
(an approximation of sum capacity) in a variety of settings, developing
algorithms for determining alignment solutions, and generalizing transmission
strategies that relax the need for perfect alignment but yield better
performance. This article provides an overview of the concept of interference
alignment as well as an assessment of practical issues including performance in
realistic propagation environments, the role of channel state information at
the transmitter, and the practicality of interference alignment in large
networks.
