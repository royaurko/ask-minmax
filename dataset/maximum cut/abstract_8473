The behaviour of the Hall ratio $R_{H}(T)$ as a function of temperature is
one of the most intriguing normal state properties of cuprate superconductors.
One feature of all the data is a maximum of $R_{H}(T)$ in the normal state that
broadens and shifts to temperatures well above $T_c$ with decreasing doping. We
show that a model of preformed pairs-bipolarons provides a selfconsistent
quantitative description of $R_{H}(T)$ together with in-plane resistivity and
uniform magnetic susceptibility for a wide range of doping.
