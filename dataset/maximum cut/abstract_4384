The "jet-quenching" interpretation of suppressed high-pT hadron production at
RHIC implies that jet multiplicity distributions and jet-like particle
correlations in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC differ strongly from those
seen at e+e- or pp colliders. Here, we present an approach for describing the
changes induced by the medium, which implements jet quenching as a
probabilistic medium-modified parton shower, treating leading and subleading
parton splittings on an equal footing. We show that the strong suppression of
single inclusive hadron spectra measured in Au-Au collisions at RHIC implies a
characteristic distortion of the single inclusive distribution of soft partons
inside the jet. We determine, as a function of jet energy, to what extent the
soft jet fragments can be measured above some momentum cut.
