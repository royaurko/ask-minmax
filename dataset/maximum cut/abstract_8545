The global phase behavior of the lattice restricted primitive model with
nearest neighbor exclusion has been studied by grand canonical Monte Carlo
simulations. The phase diagram is dominated by a fluid (or charge-disordered
solid) to charge-ordered solid transition that terminates at the maximum
density, $\rho^*_{max}=\sqrt2$ and reduced temperature $T^*\approx0.29$. At
that point, there is a first-order phase transition between two phases of the
same density, one charge-ordered and the other charge-disordered. The
liquid-vapor transition for the model is metastable, lying entirely within the
fluid-solid phase envelope.
