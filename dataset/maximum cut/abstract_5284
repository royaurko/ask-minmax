In this letter, we demonstrate the first BN/Graphene/BN field effect
transistor for RF applications. The BN/Graphene/BN structure can preserve the
high mobility of graphene, even when it is sandwiched between a substrate and a
gate dielectric. Field effect transistors (FETs) using a bilayer graphene
channel have been fabricated with a gate length LG=450 nm. A current density in
excess of 1 A/mm and DC transconductance close to 250 mS/mm are achieved for
both electron and hole conductions. RF characterization is performed for the
first time on this device structure, giving a current-gain cut-off frequency
fT=33 GHz and an fT.LG product of 15 GHz.um. The improved performance obtained
by the BN/Graphene/BN structure is very promising to enable the next generation
of high frequency graphene RF electronics.
