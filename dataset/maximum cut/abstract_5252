The AGT relation identifies the Nekrasov functions for various N=2 SUSY gauge
theories with the 2d conformal blocks, which possess explicit Dotsenko-Fateev
matrix model (beta-ensemble) representations the latter being polylinear
combinations of Selberg integrals. The "pure gauge" limit of these matrix
models is, however, a non-trivial multiscaling large-N limit, which requires a
separate investigation. We show that in this pure gauge limit the Selberg
integrals turn into averages in a Brezin-Gross-Witten (BGW) model. Thus, the
Nekrasov function for pure SU(2) theory acquires a form very much reminiscent
of the AMM decomposition formula for some model X into a pair of the BGW
models. At the same time, X, which still has to be found, is the pure gauge
limit of the elliptic Selberg integral. Presumably, it is again a BGW model,
only in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa double cut phase.
