Unbalanced data arises in many learning tasks such as clustering of
multi-class data, hierarchical divisive clustering and semisupervised learning.
Graph-based approaches are popular tools for these problems. Graph construction
is an important aspect of graph-based learning. We show that graph-based
algorithms can fail for unbalanced data for many popular graphs such as k-NN,
\epsilon-neighborhood and full-RBF graphs. We propose a novel graph
construction technique that encodes global statistical information into node
degrees through a ranking scheme. The rank of a data sample is an estimate of
its p-value and is proportional to the total number of data samples with
smaller density. This ranking scheme serves as a surrogate for density; can be
reliably estimated; and indicates whether a data sample is close to
valleys/modes. This rank-modulated degree(RMD) scheme is able to significantly
sparsify the graph near valleys and provides an adaptive way to cope with
unbalanced data. We then theoretically justify our method through limit cut
analysis. Unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real
data sets demonstrate the superiority of our method.
