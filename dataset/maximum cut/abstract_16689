Spatially explicit models have been widely used in today's mathematical
ecology and epidemiology to study persistence and extinction of populations as
well as their spatial patterns. Here we extend the earlier work--static
dispersal between neighbouring individuals to mobility of individuals as well
as multi-patches environment. As is commonly found, the basic reproductive
ratio is maximized for the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) on diseases'
persistence in mean-field theory. This has important implications, as it
implies that for a wide range of parameters that infection rate will tend
maximum. This is opposite with present results obtained in spatial explicit
models that infection rate is limited by upper bound. We observe the emergence
of trade-offs of extinction and persistence on the parameters of the infection
period and infection rate and show the extinction time having a linear
relationship with respect to system size. We further find that the higher
mobility can pronouncedly promote the persistence of spread of epidemics, i.e.,
the phase transition occurs from extinction domain to persistence domain, and
the spirals' wavelength increases as the mobility increasing and ultimately, it
will saturate at a certain value. Furthermore, for multi-patches case, we find
that the lower coupling strength leads to anti-phase oscillation of infected
fraction, while higher coupling strength corresponds to in-phase oscillation.
