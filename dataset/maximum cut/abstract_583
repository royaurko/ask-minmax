The cross section for photoproduction of a prompt photon in association with
a jet is studied in Next-to-Leading Order at the DESY $ep$ collider HERA. The
effect of various cuts imposed on the cross section by the ZEUS collaboration
including isolation cuts on the photon is examined. Comparisons with the ZEUS
preliminary data using various parametrizations of the photon structure
function is made, and good agreement is found. The preliminary data is not yet
precise enough to make a distinction between various models for the photon
structure function.
