Periodicity and relaxation are investigated for the trajectories of the
states in cylindrical linear cellular automata. The time evolutions are
described with matrices. The eigenvalue analysis is applied to obtain the
maximum values of period and relaxation. The translational invariance
suppresses the maximum period and relaxation.
