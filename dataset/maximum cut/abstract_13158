It is proposed that the presence of a tilted and anisotropic Dirac cone can
be verified using the interlayer magnetoresistance in the layered Dirac fermion
system, which is realized in quasi-two-dimensional organic compound
\alpha-(BEDT-TTF)_2 I_3. Theoretical formula is derived using the analytic
Landau level wave functions and assuming local tunneling of electrons. It is
shown that the resistivity takes the maximum in the direction of the tilt if
anisotropy of the Fermi velocity of the Dirac cone is small. The procedure is
described to determine the parameters of the tilt and anisotropy.
