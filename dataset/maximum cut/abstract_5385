We study the pair production of scalar top-quark partners decaying to a
top-quark pair plus large missing energy at the LHC, a signature which appears
in numerous models that address outstanding problems at the TeV-scale. The
severe experimental search cuts require a description which combines
higher-order corrections to both production and decay dynamics for a realistic
final state. We do this at next-to-leading order in QCD for the first time. We
find large, kinematic-dependent QCD corrections that differ dramatically
depending upon the observable under consideration, potentially impacting the
search for and interpretation of these states.
