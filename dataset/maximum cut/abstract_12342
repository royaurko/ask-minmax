The working group discussed several aspects of triple gauge coupling analysis
viewed in the light of experiences with the first high energy data recorded at
energies above the W pair threshold. Some analysis methods were reviewed
briefly, and consideration given to better ways of characterising the data. The
measurement of CP violating parameters was discussed. Results were prepared to
further quantify the precision attainable on anaomalous couplings in the
four-quark channel using jet-charge methods, and finally the trade off between
maximum LEP energy-vs-luminosity was quantified.
