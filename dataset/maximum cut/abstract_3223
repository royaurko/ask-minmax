We study the distribution of the maximum of a set of random fitnesses with
fixed number of mutations in a model of biological evolution. The fitness
variables are not independent and the correlations can be varied via a
parameter $\ell=1,...,L$. We present analytical calculations for the following
three solvable cases: (i) one-step mutants with arbitrary $\ell$ (ii) weakly
correlated fitnesses with $\ell=L/2$ (iii) strongly correlated fitnesses with
$\ell=2$. In all these cases, we find that the limit distribution for the
maximum fitness is not of the standard Gumbel form.
