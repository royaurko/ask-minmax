To predict the heat diffusion in a given region over time, it is often
necessary to find the numerical solution for heat equation. With the techniques
of discrete differential calculus, we propose two unconditional stable
numerical schemes for simulation heat equation on space manifold and time. The
analysis of their stability and error is accomplished by the use of maximum
principle.
