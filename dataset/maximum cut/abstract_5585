We present a fully-differential calculation of the NNLO QCD corrections to
the t-channel mechanism for producing single top quarks at the LHC. We work in
the structure function approximation, computing QCD corrections to the light-
and heavy-quark lines separately and neglecting the dynamical cross-talk
between the two. The neglected contribution, which appears at NNLO for the
first time, is color-suppressed and is expected to be sub-dominant. Within this
approximation, we find that, for the total cross section, NNLO QCD corrections
are in the few percent range and, therefore, are comparable to NLO QCD
corrections. We also find that the scale independence of the theoretical
prediction for single-top production improves significantly once NNLO QCD
corrections are included. Furthermore, we show how these results change if a
cut on the transverse momentum of the top quark is applied and derive the NNLO
QCD prediction for the ratio of single top and single anti-top production cross
sections at the 8 TeV LHC.
