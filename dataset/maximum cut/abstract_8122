We present an analysis of the 3-79 keV NuSTAR spectrum of the low-luminosity
active galactic nucleus NGC 7213. In agreement with past observations, we find
a lower limit to the high-energy cut-off of Ec > 140 keV, no evidence for a
Compton-reflected continuum, and the presence of an iron Kalpha complex,
possibly produced in the broad-line region. From the application of the MYTorus
model, we find that the line-emitting material is consistent with the absence
of a significant Compton reflection if arising from a Compton-thin torus of gas
with a column density of 5.0(+2.0,-1.6) cm^-2. We report variability of the
equivalent width of the iron lines on the time-scale of years using archival
observations from XMM-Newton, Chandra and Suzaku. This analysis suggests a
possible contribution from dusty gas. A fit with a Comptonization model
indicates the presence of a hot corona with a temperature kTe > 40 keV and an
optical depth tau < 1, assuming a spherical geometry.
