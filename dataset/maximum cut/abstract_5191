The recent development of a relatively inexpensive 16-Gbps data-recording
system based on commercial off-the-shelf technology and open-source software,
along with parallel development in broadband Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI) techniques, is enabling dramatically improved sensitivity for both
astronomical and geodetic VLBI. The system is described, including the results
of a demonstration VLBI experiment that illustrates a number of cutting-edge
technologies that can be deployed in the near future to significantly enhance
the power of the VLBI technique.
