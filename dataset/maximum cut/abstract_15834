The observation by the CANGAROO experiment of TeV emission from SN 1006, in
conjunction with several instances of non-thermal X-ray emission from supernova
remnants, has led to inferences of super-TeV electrons in these extended
sources. While this is sufficient to propel the theoretical community in their
modelling of particle acceleration and associated radiation, the anticipated
emergence in the next decade of a number of new experiments probing the TeV and
sub-TeV bands provides further substantial motivation for modellers. In
particular, the quest for obtaining unambiguous gamma-ray signatures of cosmic
ray ion acceleration defines a ``Holy Grail'' for observers and theorists
alike. This review summarizes theoretical developments in the prediction of
MeV-TeV gamma-rays from supernova remnants over the last five years, focusing
on how global properties of models can impact, and be impacted by, hard
gamma-ray observational programs, thereby probing the supernova remnant
environment. Properties of central consideration include the maximum energy of
accelerated particles, the density of the unshocked interstellar medium, the
ambient magnetic field, and the relativistic electron-to-proton ratio. Criteria
for determining good candidate remnants for observability in the TeV band are
identified.
