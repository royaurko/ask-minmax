We study a model for freeway traffic which includes strong noise taking into
account the fluctuations of individual driving behavior. The model shows
emergent traffic jams with a self-similar appearance near the throughput
maximum of the traffic. The lifetime distribution of these jams shows a short
scaling regime, which gets considerably longer if one reduces the fluctuations
for driving at maximum speed but leaves the fluctuations for slowing down or
accelerating unchanged. The outflow from a traffic jam self-organizes into this
state of maximum throughput.
