We perform an evaluation of the p-wave amplitudes of meson-baryon scattering
in the strangeness S=-1 sector starting from the lowest order chiral
Lagrangians and introducing explicitly the Sigma^* field with couplings to the
meson-baryon states obtained using SU(6) symmetry. The N/D method of
unitarization is used, equivalent, in practice, to the use of the
Bethe-Salpeter equation with a cut-off. The procedure leaves no freedom for the
p-waves once the s-waves are fixed and thus one obtains genuine predictions for
the p-wave scattering amplitudes, which are in good agreement with experimental
results for differential cross sections, as well as for the width and partial
decay widths of the Sigma^*(1385).
