The final results on the combination of all inclusive deep-inelastic
scattering cross section data from the H1 and ZEUS experiments at HERA are
reviewed. The parton distribution functions (PDFs) extracted from these data
(HERAPDF2.0) and from HERA data on heavy flavour production and jet production
are also presented (HERAPDF2.0Jets). The use of various heavy flavour schemes
is compared and the sensitivity of the data to cuts on Q2 is explored. When jet
data are included in the fits, a competitive value of $\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1184 \pm
0.0016$ is extracted at NLO, excluding scale uncertainties
