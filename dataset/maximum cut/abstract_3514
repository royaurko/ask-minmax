It has been suggested that observations of quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs)
in the X-ray fluxes from low mass X-ray binaries can be used to constrain the
mass of the compact object and the equation of state of its matter. A specific
suggestion that the kHz QPO frequency saturates at the maximum orbital
frequency has been widely considered. We examine rotating compact stars
described by a new model of strange quark matter (Dey et al. 1998). We
calculate the maximum orbital frequencies for both normal and supramassive
strange stars described by the Dey model, and present these frequencies for
sequences of equilibrium models with constant baryon mass. The maximum orbital
frequencies for these compact objects are always higher than the kHz QPO
frequencies observed to date.
