We discuss the observability of CP-violating asymmetries in the process e+ e-
-> X_1^0 X_2^0 -> X_1^0 X_1^0 l+ l-, with l = e,mu. We consider two examples of
supersymmetric scenarios: (i) with decays X_2^0 -> l_R l -> X_1^0 l+ l-; (ii)
with X_2^0 three-body decays. The asymmetries can be of order 0.1 but they are
partially washed out by the large backgrounds from W+ W- and slepton pair
production, being the observed asymmetries one order of magnitude smaller.
However, with appropriate kinematical cuts they can be observed at an e+ e-
collider with a centre of mass energy of 500 GeV and high luminosity.
