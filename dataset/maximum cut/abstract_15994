On December 27th 2000 during our regular SMC monitoring program with Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer, strong pulsations were detected with a period of 4.78
seconds. Subsequent slew observations performed on Jan 9th and 13th across the
field of view allowed localisation of the pulsar's position to RA: 0 52 17,
Dec: 72 19 51 (J2000). The outburst continued until Jan 24th, 7 PCA
observations were obtained during this period, yielding a maximum X-ray
luminosity ~10^38 ergs/s. Following calculation of the pulsar position, optical
observations of the RXTE error box were made on Jan 16th 2001 with the 1m
telescope of the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) while the source
was still in X-ray outburst. Candidate Be stars identified from their
photometric colours were subsequently observed with the SAAO 1.9m on Nov 7th
2001 to obtain spectra. Only one of the photometrically identified stars
[MA93]537 showed prominent H$\alpha$ emission, with a double peaked
line-profile (EW= -43.3+/-0.7 A, separation velocity= 200+/-15 km/s) confirming
the presence of a substantial circumstellar disk.
