We discuss the top-antitop production cross section near threshold at a
future linear collider accounting for the NNLL QCD corrections to the anomalous
dimension of the leading S-wave production current computed recently within
renormalization-group-improved NRQCD perturbation theory. We argue that the
still unknown soft NNLL mixing corrections are negligible so that the NNLL QCD
corrections to the total cross section can be considered complete for practical
purposes. Based on combined variations of the renormalization and matching
scales and the overall size of the perturbative corrections we estimate that
the NNLL QCD total cross section has a normalization uncertainty of 5% at
threshold. We present results for the total cross section and also for the
experimentally more relevant case, when moderate cuts are imposed on the
reconstructed top and antitop invariant masses.
