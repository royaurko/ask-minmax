Quantum dots in magnetic fields are studied within the current spin density
functional formalism avoiding any spatial symmetry restrictions of the
solutions. We find that the maximum density droplet reconstructs into states
with broken internal symmetry: The Chamon-Wen edge co-exists with a modulation
of the charge density along the edge. The phase boundaries between the
polarization transition, the maximum density droplet and its reconstruction are
in agreement with recent experimental results.
