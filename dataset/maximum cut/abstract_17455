In this paper we describe the design, construction, and operation of a first
large area double-phase liquid argon Large Electron Multiplier Time Projection
Chamber (LAr LEM-TPC). The detector has a maximum drift length of 60 cm and the
readout consists of a $40\times 76$ cm$^2$ LEM and 2D projective anode to
multiply and collect drifting charges. Scintillation light is detected by means
of cryogenic PMTs positioned below the cathode. To record both charge and light
signals, we have developed a compact acquisition system, which is scalable up
to ton-scale detectors with thousands of charge readout channels. The
acquisition system, as well as the design and the performance of custom-made
charge sensitive preamplifiers, are described. The complete experimental setup
has been operated for a first time during a period of four weeks at CERN in the
cryostat of the ArDM experiment, which was equipped with liquid and gas argon
purification systems. The detector, exposed to cosmic rays, recorded events
with a single-channel signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 30 for minimum
ionising particles. Cosmic muon tracks and their $\delta$-rays were used to
assess the performance of the detector, and to estimate the liquid argon purity
and the gain at different amplification fields.
