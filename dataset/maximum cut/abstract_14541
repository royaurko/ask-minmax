We extend Rice Formula to a process which is the sum of two independent
processes: a smooth process and a pure jump process with finitely many jumps.
Formulas for the mean number of both continuous and discontinuous crossings
through a fixed level on a compact time interval are obtained. We present
examples in which we compute explicitly the mean number of crossings and
compare which kind of crossings dominate for high levels. In one of the
examples the leading term of the tail of the distribution function of the
maximum of the process over a compact time interval as the level goes to
infinity is obtained. We end giving a generalization, to the non-stationary
case, of Borovkov-Last Rice Formula for Piecewise Deterministic Markov
Processes.
