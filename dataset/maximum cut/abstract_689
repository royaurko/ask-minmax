We present a deterministic O(n log log n) time algorithm for finding shortest
cycles and minimum cuts in planar graphs. The algorithm improves the previously
known fastest algorithm by Italiano et al. in STOC'11 by a factor of log n.
This speedup is obtained through the use of dense distance graphs combined with
a divide-and-conquer approach.
