One of the most important challenges for the largely accepted idea that
Galactic CRs are accelerated in SNR shocks is the maximum energy at which
particles can be accelerated. The resonant streaming instability, long invoked
for magnetic field amplification at shocks, can not provide sufficiently high
fields and efficient enough scattering so as to ensure particle acceleration up
to the knee. Here we discuss the non-resonant version of this instability
which, with its faster growth and larger value of the amplified field,
increases the achievable maximum energy. Because of their higher explosion
rate, we focus on type II SNe expanding in their red supergiant wind and we
find that the transition between Ejecta Dominated (ED) and Sedov-Taylor (ST)
phases takes place at very early times. In this environment, the accelerated
particle spectrum shows no high energy exponential cut-off but a spectral break
at the maximum energy (EM). Moreover, the maximum energy of protons can easily
reach PeV energies. With this model, we tried to fit KASCADE Grande and ARGO
-YBJ data but failed to find a parameter combination that can explain both data
sets. We discuss the different scenarios implied by the two data sets.
