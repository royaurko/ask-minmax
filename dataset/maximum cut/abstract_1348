We discuss some recent phenomenological models for strong interactions based
on the idea of gauge/string duality. A very good estimate for hadronic masses
can be found by placing an infrared cut off in AdS space. Considering static
strings in this geometry one can also reproduce the phenomenological Cornell
potential for a quark anti-quark potential at zero temperature. Placing static
strings in an AdS Schwarzschild space with an infrared cut off one finds a
transition from a confining to a deconfining phase at some critical horizon
radius (associated with temperature).
