For the confining phase of SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics we show that the
asymptotic series representing the pressure is Borel summable for negative
(unphysical) values of a suitably defined coupling constant. The inverse Borel
transform is meromorphic except for a branch cut along the positive-real axis.
The physical pressure is precisely nil at vanishing and acquires a small
imaginary admixture at small temperature the latter indicating violations of
thermal equilibrium (turbulences).
