The double graph of a graph $G$ is defined as $\mathcal{D}[G]$ = $G \times
T_2$, where \(T_2\) is the total graph with 2 vertices and $\times$ stands for
the Kronecker product of graphs. In this paper, sufficient conditions for
double graphs to be maximum vertex-connected, maximum edge-connected are
presented.
