In Figure 6 we inadvertently labeled the proxy circular velocity as the
virial velocity of the dark matter halo instead of what is actually plotted,
the maximum circular velocity of the dark matter halo. The maximum halo
circular velocity is a much better estimate of the disk V_c than is V_vir. This
confusion influenced the discussion of the Tully-Fisher relation in our paper.
In fact, Figure 6 demonstrates that it is possible to simultaneously reproduce
both the local Tully-Fisher relation and luminosity function using
semi-analytic techniques applied to the standard LCDM cosmology, thus
contradicting previous studies of this issue and our own discussion in Section
3.6.
