Graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising
materials for broadband and ultrafast photodetection and optical modulation.
These optoelectronic capabilities can augment complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices for high-speed and low-power optical
interconnects. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip ultrafast photodetector based on
a two-dimensional heterostructure consisting of high-quality graphene
encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. Coupled to the optical mode of a
silicon waveguide, this 2D heterostructure-based photodetector exhibits a
maximum responsivity of 0.36 A/W and high-speed operation with a 3 dB cut-off
at 42 GHz. From photocurrent measurements as a function of the top-gate and
source-drain voltages, we conclude that the photoresponse is consistent with
hot electron mediated effects. At moderate peak powers above 50 mW, we observe
a saturating photocurrent consistent with the mechanisms of electron-phonon
supercollision cooling. This nonlinear photoresponse enables optical on-chip
autocorrelation measurements with picosecond-scale timing resolution and
exceptionally low peak powers.
