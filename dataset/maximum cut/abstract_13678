We have calculated the electrostatic interaction between two rod-like charged
objects with arbitrary orientations in three dimensions. we obtained a closed
form formula expressing the interaction energy in terms of the separation
distance between the centers of the two rod-like objects, $r$, their lengths
(denoted by $2l_1$ and $2l_2$), and their relative orientations (indicated by
$\theta$ and $\phi$). When the objects have the same length ($2l_1=2l_2=l$),
for particular values of separations, i.e for $r\leq0.8 l$, two types of
minimum are appeared in the interaction energy with respect to $\theta$. By
employing the closed form formula and introducing a scaled temperature $t$, we
have also studied the thermodynamic properties of a one dimensional system of
rod-like charged objects. For different separation distances, the dependence of
the specific heat of the system to the scaled temperature has been studied. It
is found that for $r<0.8 l$, the specific heat has a maximum.
