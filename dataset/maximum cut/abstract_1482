We discuss the signatures, at the LHC, of the (1,0)-th Kaluza-Klein (KK)
gluon and quarks in the framework of the two universal extra dimensional (2UED)
model. Once produced, these particles typically suffer a cascade of decays
terminating in the Dark Matter candidate apart from Standard Model particles.
In this article, we are interested in focus on a particular signature of 2UED
wherein the final state comprises of at least four jets in association with a
hard photon and missing transverse energy. Several kinematic cuts are devised
to enhance the signal to background ratio. Finally, as a road map to parameter
determination at the LHC, we point out an interesting correlation between the
peak position of the M_eff distributions with the compactification radius R and
the cut-off scale M_s.
