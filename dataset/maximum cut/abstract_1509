We report the observation of highly energetic self-interfering matter-wave
(SIMW) patterns generated by a moving obstacle in a two-dimensional
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside a power trap cut off by hard-wall box
potential boundaries. The obstacle initially excites circular dispersive waves
radiating away from the center of the trap which are reflected from hard-wall
box boundaries at the edges of the trap. The resulting interference between
outgoing waves from the center of the trap and reflected waves from the box
boundaries institutes, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented standing
wave patterns. For this purpose we simulated the time dependent Gross-
Pitaevskii equation using the split-step Crank-Nicolson method. The obstacle is
modelled by a moving impenetrable Gaussian potential barrier. Various trapping
geometries are considered.
