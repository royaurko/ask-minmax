Accurate rotational-vibrational line lists for $^{31}$P$^{14}$N and
$^{31}$P$^{15}$N in their ground electronic states are computed. The line lists
are produced using an empirical potential energy curve obtained by fitting to
the experimental transition frequencies available in the literature in
conjunction with an accurate, high level \textit{ab initio} dipole moment
curve. In these calculations the programs DPotFit and LEVEL~8.0 were used. The
new line lists reproduce the experimental wavenumbers with a root-mean-square
error of 0.004~cm$^{-1}$. The line lists cover the frequency range 0--51000
cm$^{-1}$, contain almost 700~000 lines each and extend up to a maximum
vibrational level of $v$=66 and a maximum rotational level of $J$=357. They
should be applicable for a large range of temperature up to, at least, 5000~K.
These new line lists are used to simulate spectra for PN at a range of
temperatures and are deposited in the Strasbourg data centre. This work is
performed as part of the ExoMol project.
