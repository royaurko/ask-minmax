The UNEDF SciDAC collaboration of nuclear theorists, applied mathematicians,
and computer scientists is developing a comprehensive description of nuclei and
their reactions that delivers maximum predictive power with quantified
uncertainties. This paper illustrates significant milestones accomplished by
UNEDF through integration of the theoretical approaches, advanced numerical
algorithms, and leadership class computational resources.
