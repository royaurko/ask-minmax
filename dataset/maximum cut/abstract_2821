We present deductive systems for various modal logics that can be obtained
from the constructive variant of the normal modal logic CK by adding
combinations of the axioms d, t, b, 4, and 5. This includes the constructive
variants of the standard modal logics K4, S4, and S5. We use for our
presentation the formalism of nested sequents and give a syntactic proof of cut
elimination.
