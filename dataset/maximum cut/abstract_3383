Nanoparticles exhibiting zero backscattering but a large scattering cross
section in the forward direction should play a key role as light diffracting
elements in photonic devices like solar cells. Using Mie theory we address
lossless dielectric spheres that were recently reported to possess a
magnetodielectric response to the illuminating wave, and analyze their
scattering cross section together with their zero-backwards scattering
conditions. We show that there is an optimum particle refractive index (m =
2.47), which yields maximum forward scattering without backwards scattering of
light.
