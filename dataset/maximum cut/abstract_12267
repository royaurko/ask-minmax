Following the spirit of a previous work of ours, we investigate the group of
those General Coordinate Transformations (GCTs) which preserve manifest spatial
homogeneity. In contrast to the case of Bianchi Type Models we, here, permit an
isometry group of motions $G_{4}=SO(3)\otimes T_{r}$, where $T_{r}$ is the
translations group, along the radial direction, while SO(3) acts multiply
transitively on each hypersurface of simultaneity $\Sigma_{t}$. The basis
1-forms, can not be invariant under the action of the entire isometry group and
hence produce an Open Lie Algebra. In order for these GCTs to exist and have a
non trivial, well defined action, certain integrability conditions have to be
satisfied; their solutions, exhibiting the maximum expected ``gauge'' freedom,
can be used to simplify the generic, spatially homogeneous, line element. In
this way an alternative proof of the generality of the Kantowski-Sachs (KS)
vacuum is given, while its most general, manifestly homogeneous, form is
explicitly presented.
