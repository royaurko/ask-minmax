In this talk we propose a natural double inflation model in supergravity.
Chaotic inflation first takes place by virtue of the Nambu-Goldstone-like shift
symmetry. During chaotic inflation, an initial value of second inflation (new
inflation) is set, which is adequately far from the local maximum of the
potential due to the small linear term in the K\"ahler potential. Then,
primordial fluctuations within the present horizon scale may be produced during
both inflations. Primordial fluctuations responsible for anisotropies of the
cosmic microwave background radiation and the large scale structure are
produced during chaotic inflation, while fluctuations on smaller scales are
produced during new inflation. Because of the peculiar nature of new inflation,
they can become as large as $10^{-1}$-$10^{-2}$, which may lead to the
formation of primordial black holes.
