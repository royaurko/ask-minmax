Thermoelectric power, electrical conductivity, and high field Hall effect
were studied over a broad temperature range in ferromagnetic Ga(1-x)Mn(x)As
epitaxial layers (0.015<x<0.06). Thermoelectric power analysis gives the
information about carrier transport mechanisms in layers with both metallic and
non-metallic type of conductivity and allows determination of the Fermi energy
and carrier concentration. At high temperatures (T>70 K) the thermoelectric
power in GaMnAs linearly increases with increasing temperature. That indicates
the presence of a degenerate hole gas with the Fermi energy EF=220+-25 meV,
nearly independent of Mn content (for 0.02<x<0.05). At lower temperatures
GaMnAs layers with metallic-type conductivity show an additional contribution
to the thermoelectric power with the maximum close to the Curie temperature.
The layers exhibiting insulating electrical properties show 1/T-type increase
of thermoelectric power at low temperatures.
