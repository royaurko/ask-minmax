In this paper we present and experimentally validate a low-cost design of a
spectral splitting concentrator for the efficient conversion of solar energy.
The optical device consists of a dispersive prismatic lens made of
polycarbonate designed to simultaneously concentrate the solar light and split
it into its spectral components. With respect to our previous implementation,
this device concentrates the light along two axes and generates a light pattern
compatible with the dimensions of a set of concentrating photovoltaic cells
while providing a higher concentration ratio. The mathematical framework and
the constructive approach used for the design are presented and the device
performance is simulated using a ray-tracing software. We obtain spectral
separation in the visible range within a 3x1 cm2 area and a maximum
concentration of 210x for a single wavelength. The device is fabricated by
injection molding and its performance is experimentally investigated. We
measure an optical transmissivity above 90% in the range 400-800 nm and we
observe a spectral distribution in good accordance with simulations. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of the device for cost effective high
efficiency concentrated photovoltaic systems.
