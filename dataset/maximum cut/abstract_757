We present a new approach to quantifying pole parameters of single-channel
processes based on a Laurent expansion of partial-wave T-matrices in the
vicinity of the real axis. Instead of using the conventional power-series
description of the non-singular part of the Laurent expansion, we represent
this part by a convergent series of Pietarinen functions. As the analytic
structure of the non-singular part is usually very well known (physical cuts
with branch points at inelastic thresholds, and unphysical cuts in the negative
energy plane), we find that one Pietarinen series per cut represents the
analytic structure fairly reliably. The number of terms in each Pietarinen
series is determined by the quality of the fit. The method is tested in two
ways: on a toy model constructed from two known poles, various background
terms, and two physical cuts, and on several sets of realistic piN elastic
energy-dependent partial-wave amplitudes (GWU/SAID - [1, 2], and
Dubna-Mainz-Taipei - [3, 4]). We show that the method is robust and confident
using up to three Pietarinen series, and is particularly convenient in fits to
amplitudes, such as single-energy solutions, coming more directly from
experiment; cases where the analytic structure of the regular part is apriori
unknown.
