We report multi-epoch VLA H I absorption observations of the source 1741-038
(OT-068) before and during an extreme scattering event (ESE). Observations at
four epochs, three during the ESE, were obtained. We find no changes in the
equivalent width, maximum optical depth, or velocity of maximum optical depth
during the ESE, but we do find a secular trend of decreasing maximum optical
depth between our observations and ones by other observers a decade prior. The
resulting limit on the H I column density change during the ESE for a structure
with a spin temperature T_s is 6.4 x 10^{17} cm^{-2} (T_s/10 K). Tiny-scale
atomic structures (TSAS), with a column density N_H ~ 3 x 10^{18} cm^{-2}, are
ruled out marginally by this limit, though geometric arguments may allow this
limit to be relaxed. Galactic halo molecular clouds, that are opaque in the H I
line, cannot be excluded because the observed velocity range covers only 25% of
their allowed velocity range.
