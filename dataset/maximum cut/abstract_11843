We discuss how life-time broadening of quasiparticle states influences
single- and two-particle current transport through zero-energy states at normal
metal/d-wave superconductor junctions. We distinguish between intrinsic
broadening (imaginary part $\eta$ of the energy), which couples the bound
states with the superconducting reservoir, and broadening due to leakage
through the junction barrier, which couples the bound states with the normal
metal reservoir. We show that shot noise is highly sensitive to the mechanism
of broadening, while the conductance is not. In the limit of small but finite
intrinsic broadening, compared to the junction transparency $D$,
$\eta/\Delta_0\ll D$, the low-voltage shot noise at zero frequency and zero
temperature becomes proportional to the magnitude $\eta$ of intrinsic
broadening ($\Delta_0$ is the maximum d-wave gap).
