We present a novel interpretation of IceCube high energy neutrino events
(with energy larger than 60 TeV) in terms of an extraterrestrial flux due to
two different contributions: a flux originated by known astrophysical sources
and dominating IceCube observations up to few hundreds TeV, and a new flux
component where the most energetic neutrinos come from the leptophilic
three-body decays of dark matter particles with a mass of few PeV. Differently
from other approaches, we provide two examples of elementary particle models
that do not need fine-tuned tiny coupling constants. Interestingly, we find a
slightly better agreement of the theoretical predictions with the IceCube
results if the astrophysical flux has a cut-off at about 100 TeV (broken power
law). In this case the most energetic part of the spectrum (PeV neutrinos) is
due to an extra component such as the decay of a very massive dark matter
component. Of course, the low statistics at our disposal still allows for a
purely astrophysical origin of the neutrino flux if there is no cut-off in
energy below the PeV scale (unbroken power law). If future data will confirm
the presence of an ankle in the IceCube data at about 0.5 PeV and of a cut-off
above 2.5 PeV, both these features would be in favor of a dark matter
interpretation.
