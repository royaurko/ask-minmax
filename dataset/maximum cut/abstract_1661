This paper considers the three-parameter exponentiated Weibull family under
type II censoring. It first graphically illustrates the shape property of the
hazard function. Then, it proposes a simple algorithm for computing the maximum
likelihood estimator and derives the Fisher information matrix. The latter one
is represented through a single integral in terms of hazard function, hence it
solves the problem of computation difficulty in constructing inference for the
maximum likelihood estimator. Real data analysis is conducted to illustrate the
effect of censoring rate on the maximum likelihood estimation.
