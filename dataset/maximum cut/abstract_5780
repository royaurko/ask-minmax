We present the complete next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD and NLO electroweak
(EW) corrections to the $W$-boson pair production associated with a hard jet at
the LHC including the spin correlated $W$-boson leptonic decays. The dependence
of the leading order (LO) and NLO corrected cross sections on the jet
transverse momentum cut is investigated. In dealing with the subsequent
resonant $W$-boson decays, we adopt the {\sc MadSpin} method where the spin
correlation effect is included. We also provide the LO and NLO corrected
distributions of the transverse momenta and rapidities of final products. The
results show that the NLO EW correction is significant in high transverse
momentum region due to the EW Sudakov effect.
