In this paper we consider power and trigonometric series whose coefficients
are supposed to satisfy the Hausdorff conditions, which play a relevant role in
the moment problem theory. We prove that these series converge to functions
analytic in cut domains. We are then able to reconstruct the jump functions
across the cuts from the coefficients of the series expansions by the use of
the Pollaczek polynomials. We can thus furnish a solution for a class of Cauchy
integral equations.
