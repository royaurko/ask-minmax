We describe a method to help the search for a light stop squark [M(stop) +
M(LSP) < M(top)] at the Fermilab Tevatron. Traditional search methods rely upon
a series of stringent background-reducing cuts which, unfortunately, leave very
few signal events given the present data set. To avoid this difficulty, we
instead suggest using a milder set of cuts, combined with a "superweight,"
whose purpose is to discriminate between signal and background events. The
superweight consists of a sum of terms, each of which are either zero or one.
The terms are assigned event-by-event depending upon the values of various
observables. We suggest a method for choosing the observables as well as the
criteria used to assign the values such that the superweight is "large" for the
supersymmetric signal and "small" for the standard model background. For
illustration, we mainly consider the detection of stops coming from top decay,
making our analysis especially relevant to the W+2 jets top sample.
