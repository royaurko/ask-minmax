The Seebeck coefficients, electrical resistivities, total thermal
conductivities, and magnetization are reported for temperatures between 5 and
350 K for n-type Bi0.88Sb0.12 nano-composite alloys made by Ho-doping at the 0,
1 and 3% atomic levels. The alloys were prepared using a dc hot-pressing
method, and are shown to be single phase for both Ho contents with grain sizes
on the average of 900 nm. We find the parent compound has a maximum of ZT =
0.28 at 231 K, while doping 1% Ho increases the maximum ZT to 0.31 at 221 K and
the 3% doped sample suppresses the maximum ZT = 0.24 at a temperature of 260 K.
