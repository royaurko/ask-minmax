The atomic and electronic structure of positively charged P vacancies on
InP(110) surfaces is determined by combining scanning tunneling microscopy,
photoelectron spectroscopy, and density-functional theory calculations. The
vacancy exhibits a nonsymmetric rebonded atomic configuration with a charge
transfer level 0.75+-0.1 eV above the valence band maximum. The scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) images show only a time average of two degenerate
geometries, due to a thermal flip motion between the mirror configurations.
This leads to an apparently symmetric STM image, although the ground state
atomic structure is nonsymmetric.
