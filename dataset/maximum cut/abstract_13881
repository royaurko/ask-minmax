In order to achieve polariton lasing at room temperature, a new fabrication
methodology for planar microcavities is proposed: a ZnO-based microcavity in
which the active region is epitaxially grown on an AlGaN/AlN/Si substrate and
in which two dielectric mirrors are used. This approach allows as to
simultaneously obtain a high-quality active layer together with a high photonic
confinement as demonstrated through macro-, and micro-photoluminescence
({\mu}-PL) and reflectivity experiments. A quality factor of 675 and a maximum
PL emission at k=0 are evidenced thanks to {\mu}-PL, revealing an efficient
polaritonic relaxation even at low excitation power.
