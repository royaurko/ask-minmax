An iterative algorithm for determining a class of solutions of the
dispersionful 2-Toda hierarchy characterized by string equations is developed.
This class includes the solution which underlies the large N-limit of the
Hermitian matrix model in the one-cut case. It is also shown how the double
scaling limit can be naturally formulated in this scheme
