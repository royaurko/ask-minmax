The problem of designing good Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) with low
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding complexity has gathered much attention in the
literature. All the known low ML decoding complexity techniques utilize the
same approach of exploiting either the multigroup decodable or the
fast-decodable (conditionally multigroup decodable) structure of a code. We
refer to this well known technique of decoding STBCs as Conditional ML (CML)
decoding. In this paper we introduce a new framework to construct ML decoders
for STBCs based on the Generalized Distributive Law (GDL) and the Factor-graph
based Sum-Product Algorithm. We say that an STBC is fast GDL decodable if the
order of GDL decoding complexity of the code is strictly less than M^l, where l
is the number of independent symbols in the STBC, and M is the constellation
size. We give sufficient conditions for an STBC to admit fast GDL decoding, and
show that both multigroup and conditionally multigroup decodable codes are fast
GDL decodable. For any STBC, whether fast GDL decodable or not, we show that
the GDL decoding complexity is strictly less than the CML decoding complexity.
For instance, for any STBC obtained from Cyclic Division Algebras which is not
multigroup or conditionally multigroup decodable, the GDL decoder provides
about 12 times reduction in complexity compared to the CML decoder. Similarly,
for the Golden code, which is conditionally multigroup decodable, the GDL
decoder is only half as complex as the CML decoder.
