In this paper we quantify the impact of model mis-specification on the
properties of parameter estimators applied to fractionally integrated
processes. We demonstrate the asymptotic equivalence of four alternative
parametric methods: frequency domain maximum likelihood, Whittle estimation,
time domain maximum likelihood and conditional sum of squares. We show that all
four estimators converge to the same pseudo-true value and provide an
analytical representation of their (common) asymptotic distribution. As well as
providing theoretical insights, we explore the finite sample properties of the
alternative estimators when used to fit mis-specified models. In particular we
demonstrate that when the difference between the true and pseudo-true values of
the long memory parameter is sufficiently large, a clear distinction between
the frequency domain and time domain estimators can be observed - in terms of
the accuracy with which the finite sample distributions replicate the common
asymptotic distribution - with the time domain estimators exhibiting a closer
match overall. Simulation experiments also demonstrate that the two time-domain
estimators have the smallest bias and mean squared error as estimators of the
pseudo-true value of the long memory parameter, with conditional sum of squares
being the most accurate estimator overall and having a relative efficiency that
is approximately double that of frequency domain maximum likelihood, across a
range of mis-specification designs.
