An important challenge in cancer systems biology is to uncover the complex
network of interactions between genes (tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes)
implicated in cancer. Next generation sequencing provides unparalleled ability
to probe the expression levels of the entire set of cancer genes and their
transcript isoforms. However, there are onerous statistical and computational
issues in interpreting high-dimensional sequencing data and inferring the
underlying genetic network. In this study, we analyzed RNA-Seq data from
lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from a population of 69 human individuals and
implemented a probabilistic framework to construct biologically-relevant
genetic networks. In particular, we employed a graphical lasso analysis,
motivated by considerations of the maximum entropy formalism, to estimate the
sparse inverse covariance matrix of RNA-Seq data. Gene ontology, pathway
enrichment and protein-protein path length analysis were all carried out to
validate the biological context of the predicted network of interacting cancer
gene isoforms.
