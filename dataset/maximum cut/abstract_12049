We present measurements of the particle velocity distribution in the flow of
granular material through vertical channels. Our study is confined to dense,
slow flows where the material shears like a fluid only in thin layers adjacent
to the walls, while a large core moves without continuous deformation, like a
solid. We find the velocity distribution to be non-Gaussian, anisotropic, and
to follow a power law at large velocities. Remarkably, the distribution is
identical in the fluid-like and solid-like regions. The velocity variance is
maximum at the core, defying predictions of hydrodynamic theories. We show
evidence of spatially correlated motion, and propose a mechanism for the
generation of fluctuational motion in the absence of shear.
