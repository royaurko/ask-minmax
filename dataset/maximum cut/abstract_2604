We report the results of a next-to-leading order simulation of top quark pair
production in association with two jets. With our inclusive cuts, we show that
the corrections with respect to leading order are negative and small, reaching
11%. The error obtained by scale variation is of the same order. Additionally,
we reproduce the result of a previous study of top quark pair production in
association with a single jet.
