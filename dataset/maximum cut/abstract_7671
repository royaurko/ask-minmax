After a brief review of the BFKL approach to Regge processes in QCD and in
supersymmetric (SUSY) gauge theories we propose a strategy for calculating the
next-to-next-to-leading order corrections to the BFKL kernel. They can be
obtained in terms of various cross-sections for Reggeized gluon interactions.
The corresponding amplitudes can be calculated in the framework of the
effective action for high energy scattering. In the case of N=4 SUSY it is also
possible to use the Bern-Dixon-Smirnov (BDS) ansatz. For this purpose the
analytic properties of the BDS amplitudes at high energies are investigated, in
order to verify their self-consistency. It is found that, for the number of
external particles being larger than five, these amplitudes, beyond one loop,
are not in agreement with the BFKL approach which predicts the existence of
Regge cuts in some physical channels.
