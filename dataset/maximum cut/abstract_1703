This work completes the study of the solvable Leibniz algebras, more
precisely, it completes the classification of the $3$-filiform Leibniz algebras
of maximum length \cite{3-filiform}. Moreover, due to the good structure of the
algebras of maximum length, we also tackle some of their cohomological
properties. Our main tools are the previous result of Cabezas and Pastor
\cite{Pastor}, the construction of appropriate homogeneous basis in the
considered connected gradation and the computational support provided by the
two programs implemented in the software \textit{Mathematica}.
