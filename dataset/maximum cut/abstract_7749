We show here how Renormalized Perturbation Theory (RPT) calculations applied
to the quasi-linear growth of the large-scale structure can be carried on in
presence of primordial non-Gaussian (PNG) initial conditions. It is explicitly
demonstrated that the series reordering scheme proposed in Bernardeau, Crocce
and Scoccimarro (2008) is preserved for non-Gaussian initial conditions. This
scheme applies to the power spectrum and higher order spectra and is based on a
reorganization of the contributing terms into sum of products of multi-point
propagators. In case of PNG new contributing terms appear, the importance of
which is discussed in the context of current PNG models. The properties of the
building blocks of such resummation schemes, the multi-point propagators, are
then investigated. It is first remarked that their expressions are left
unchanged at one-loop order irrespectively of statistical properties of the
initial field. We furthermore show that the high-momemtum limit of each of
these propagators can be explicitly computed even for arbitrary initial
conditions. They are found to be damped by an exponential cutoff whose
expression is directly related to the moment generating function of the
one-dimensional displacement field. This extends what had been established for
multi-point propagators for Gaussian initial conditions. Numerical forms of the
cut-off are shown for the so-called local model of PNG.
