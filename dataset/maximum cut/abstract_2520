The electromagnetic form factors of nucleons are calculated using an AdS/QCD
model by considering a Dirac field coupled to a vector field in the
5-dimensional AdS space. We also calculate a gravitational or energy-momentum
form factor by perturbing the metric from the static AdS solution. We consider
both the hard-wall model where the AdS geometry is cutoff at z_0 and the
soft-wall model where the geometry is smoothly cut off by a background dilaton
field.
