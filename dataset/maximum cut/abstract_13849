In this paper we present theoretical investigation of optical conductivity
for intermetallic TbNi_{5-x}Cu_x series. In the frame of LSDA+U calculations
electronic structure for x=0,1,2 and on top of that optical conductivities were
calculated. Disorder effects of Ni for Cu substitution on a level of LSDA+U
densities of states (DOS) were taken into account via averaging over all
possible Cu ion positions for given doping level x. Gradual suppression and
loosing of structure of optical conductivity at 2 eV together with simultaneous
intensity growth at 4 eV correspond to increase of Cu and decrease of Ni
content. As reported before [Knyazev et al., Optics and Spectroscopy 104, 360
(2008)] plasma frequency has non monotonic doping behaviour with maximum at
x=1. This behaviour is explained as competition between lowering of total
density of states on the Fermi level N(E_F) and growing of number of carriers.
Our theoretical results agree well with variety of recent experiments.
