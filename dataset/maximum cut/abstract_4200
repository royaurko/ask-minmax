The polar and azimuthal angular distributions for the lepton pair arising
from the decay of a J/psi meson produced at transverse momentum p_T balanced by
a photon [or gluon] in hadronic collisions are calculated in the color singlet
model (CSM). It is shown that the general structure of the decay lepton
distribution is controlled by four invariant structure functions, which are
functions of the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the J/psi. We found
that two of these structure functions [the longitudinal and transverse
interference structure functions] are identical in the CSM. Analytical and
numerical results are given in the Collins-Soper and in the Gottfried-Jackson
frame. We present a Monte Carlo study of the effect of acceptance cuts applied
to the leptons and the photon for J/psi+ gamma production at the Tevatron.
