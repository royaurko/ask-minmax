In this paper, we consider the effect of cohesion on the stability of a
granular heap. We first briefly review literature results on the cohesion force
between two rough granular beads and specifically consider the dependence of
the adhesion force on the normal load. We then compute the dependence of the
maximum angle of stability of the heap as a function of the cohesion. We point
out that the dependence of the cohesive forces on the external normal load
between grains is a key point in determining the localization of the failure
plane. While for a constant cohesive force, slip occurs deep inside the heap,
surface failure is obtained for a linear dependence of the cohesion on the
normal stress.
