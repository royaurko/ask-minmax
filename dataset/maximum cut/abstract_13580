We consider the Riesz and Hardy-Littlewood wave i.e. a ``critical function''
whose behaviour is concerned with the possible truth of the Riemann Hypothesis
(RH). The function is studied numerically for the case alpha = 15/2 and beta =
4 in some range of the critical strip, using Maple 10.
  In the experiments, N = 2000 is the maximum argument used in the Moebius
function appearing in c_k i.e. the coefficients of Baez-Duarte, in the
representation of the inverse of the Zeta function by means of the Pochammer's
polynomials.
  The numerical results give some evidence that the critical function is
bounded for Re(s) > 1/2 and such an ``evidence'' is stronger in the region
Re(s) > 3/4} where the wave seems to decay slowly. This give further support in
favour of the absence of zeros of the Riemann Zeta function in some regions of
the critical strip (Re(s) > 3/4) and a (weaker) support in the direction to
believe that the RH may be true (Re(s) > 1/2).
