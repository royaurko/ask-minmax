Given a finite set $E$, a subset $D\sub E$ (viewed as a function $E\to \F_2$)
is orthogonal to a given subspace $\FF$ of the $\F_2$-vector space of functions
$E\to \F_2$ as soon as $D$ is orthogonal to every $\sub$-minimal element of
$\FF$. This fails in general when $E$ is infinite.
  However, we prove the above statement for the six subspaces $\FF$ of the edge
space of any 3-connected locally finite graph that are relevant to its
homology: the topological, algebraic, and finite cycle and cut spaces. This
solves a problem of [5]
