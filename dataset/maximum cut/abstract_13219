Heating processes inside large black holes can produce tremendous amounts of
entropy. Locality requires that this entropy adds on space-like surfaces, but
the resulting entropy (10^10 times the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in an example
presented in the companion paper) exceeds the maximum entropy that can be
accommodated by the black hole's degrees of freedom. Observer complementarity,
which proposes a proliferation of non-local identifications inside the black
hole, allows the entropy to be accommodated as long as individual observers
inside the black hole see less than the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In the
specific model considered with huge entropy production, we show that individual
observers do see less than the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, offering strong
support for observer complementarity.
