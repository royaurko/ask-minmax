The equation of state for quark matter is derived for a nonlocal, chiral
quark model within the mean field approximation. We investigate the effects of
a variation of the form factors of the interaction on the phase diagram of
quark matter under the condition of beta-equilibrium and charge neutrality.
Special emphasis is on the occurrence of a diquark condensate which signals a
phase transition to color superconductivity and its effects on the equation of
state. We calculate the quark star configurations by solving the Tolman-
Oppenheimer- Volkoff equations and obtain for the transition from a hot, normal
quark matter core of a protoneutron star to a cool diquark condensed one a
release of binding energy of the order of Delta M c^2 ~ 10^{53} erg. We study
the consequences of antineutrino trapping in hot quark matter for quark star
configurations with possible diquark condensation and discuss the claim that
this energy could serve as an engine for explosive phenomena. A "phase diagram"
for rotating compact stars (angular velocity-baryon mass plane) is suggested as
a heuristic tool for obtaining constraints on the equation of state of QCD at
high densities. It has a critical line dividing hadronic from quark core stars
which is correlated with a local maximum of the moment of inertia and can thus
be subject to experimental verification by observation of the rotational
behavior of accreting compact stars.
