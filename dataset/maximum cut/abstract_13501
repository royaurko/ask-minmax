The emergence of minimally structured (uniform and horizontal) magnetic field
from a depth of 20 Mm has been simulated. The field emerges first in a mixed
polarity pepper and salt pattern, but then collects into separate, unipolar
concentrations and produces pores. The field strength was then artificially
increased to produce spot-like structures. The field strength at continuum
optical depth unity peaks at 1 kG, with a maximum of 4 kG. Where the vertical
field is strong, the spots persist (at present an hour of solar time has been
simulated). Where the field is weak, the spot gets filled in and disappears.
Stokes profiles have been calculated and processed with the Hinode annular mtf,
the slit diffraction and frequency smoothing. These data are available at
steinr.pa.msu.edu/~bob/stokes.
