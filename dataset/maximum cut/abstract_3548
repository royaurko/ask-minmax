A large lepton asymmetry could be generated in the Early Universe by
oscillations of active to sterile neutrinos with a small mixing angle sin 2
\theta < 10^-2. The final order of magnitude of the lepton asymmetry \eta is
mainly determined by its growth in the last stage of evolution when the MSW
resonance dominates the kinetic equations. In this paper we present a simple
way of calculating the maximum possible lepton asymmetry which can be created.
Our results are in good agreement to previous calculations. Furthermore, we
find that the growth of asymmetry does not obey any particular power law. We
find that the maximum possible asymmetry at the freeze-out of the n/p ratio at
T \sim 1 MeV strongly depends on the mass-squared difference \delta m^2: the
asymmetry is negligible for \delta m^2 \ll 1 eV^2 and reaches asymptotically
large values for \delta m^2 \ge 50 eV^2.
