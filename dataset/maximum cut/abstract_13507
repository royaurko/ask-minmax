Lifted maximum rank distance (MRD) codes, which are constant dimension codes,
are considered. It is shown that a lifted MRD code can be represented in such a
way that it forms a block design known as a transversal design. A slightly
different representation of this design makes it similar to a $q-$analog of a
transversal design. The structure of these designs is used to obtain upper
bounds on the sizes of constant dimension codes which contain a lifted MRD
code. Codes which attain these bounds are constructed. These codes are the
largest known codes for the given parameters. These transversal designs can be
also used to derive a new family of linear codes in the Hamming space. Bounds
on the minimum distance and the dimension of such codes are given.
