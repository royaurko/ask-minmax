This work discusses the prospects of antiparticle flux measurements with the
proposed PEBS detector. The project foresees long duration balloon flights at
one of Earth's poles at an altitude of 40 km. The sky coverage of flights at
the poles is presented. In addition, cosmic-ray measurements at the poles
(small rigidity cut-offs) give the possibility to study solar modulation
effects down to energies of about 0.1 GeV. Furthermore, systematic effects due
to interactions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere are important. These effects
were studied with the Planetocosmics simulation software based on GEANT4 in the
energy range 0.1 - 1000 GeV.
