The fabrication of micro- and nano-scale silicon electronic devices requires
precision lithography and controlled processing to ensure that the electronic
properties of the device are optimized. Importantly, the Si-SiO2 interface
plays a crucial role in defining these properties. While transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) can be used to observe the device architecture, substrate /
contact crystallinity and interfacial roughness, the preparation and isolation
of the device active area is problematic. In this work, we describe the use of
focussed ion beam technologies to isolate and trench-cut targeted device
structures for subsequent TEM analysis. Architectures studied include radio
frequency, single electron transistors and electrically detected, magnetic
resonance devices that have also undergone ion implantation, rapid thermal and
forming gas anneals.
