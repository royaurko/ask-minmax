We obtain several new results contributing to the theory of real equiangular
line systems. Among other things, we present a new general lower bound on the
maximum number of equiangular lines in d dimensional Euclidean space; we
describe the two-graphs on 12 vertices; and we investigate Seidel matrices with
exactly three distinct eigenvalues. As a result, we improve on two
long-standing upper bounds regarding the maximum number of equiangular lines in
dimensions d=14, and d=16. Additionally, we prove the nonexistence of certain
regular graphs with four eigenvalues, and correct some tables from the
literature.
