The recently introduced semi-quasi-Z-source in- verter can be interpreted as
a DC-DC converter whose input- output voltage gain may take any value between
minus infinity and 1 depending on the applied duty cycle. In order to generate
a sinusoidal voltage waveform at the output of this converter, a time-varying
duty cycle needs to be applied. Application of a time-varying duty cycle that
produces large-signal behavior requires careful consideration of stability
issues. This paper provides stability results for both the large-signal
averaged and the switched models of the semi-quasi-Z-source inverter operating
in continuous conduction mode. We show that if the load is linear and purely
resistive then the boundedness and ultimate boundedness of the state
trajectories is guaranteed provided some reasonable operation conditions are
ensured. These conditions amount to keeping the duty cycle away from the
extreme values 0 or 1 (averaged and switched models), and limiting the maximum
PWM switching period (switched model). The results obtained can be used to give
theoretical justification to the inverter operation strategy recently proposed
by Cao et al. in [1].
