In this work we explore the ability of the Google search engine to find
results for random N-letter strings. These random strings, dense over the set
of possible N-letter words, address the existence of typos, acronyms, and other
words without semantic meaning. Interestingly, we find that the probability of
finding such strings sharply drops from one to zero at Nc = 6. The behavior of
such order parameter suggests the presence of a transition-like phenomenon in
the geometry of the search space. Furthermore, we define a susceptibility-like
parameter which reaches a maximum in the neighborhood, suggesting the presence
of criticality. We finally speculate on the possible connections to Ramsey
theory.
