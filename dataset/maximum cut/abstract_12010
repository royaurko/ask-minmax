Electron transport through a one-dimensional ring connected with two external
leads, in the presence of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) of strength \alpha and a
perpendicular magnetic field is studied. Applying Griffith's boundary
conditions we derive analytic expressions for the reflection and transmission
coefficients of the corresponding one-electron scattering problem. We
generalize earlier conductance results by Nitta et al. [Appl. Phys. Lett. 75,
695 (1999)] and investigate the influence of \alpha, temperature, and a weak
magnetic field on the conductance. Varying \alpha and temperature changes the
position of the minima and maxima of the magnetic-field dependent conductance,
and it may even convert a maximum into a minimum and vice versa.
