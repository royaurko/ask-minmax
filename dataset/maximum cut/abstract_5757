Motivated by quite recent research involving the relationship between the
dimension of a poset and graph theoretic properties of its cover graph, we show
that for every $d\geq 1$, if $P$ is a poset and the dimension of a subposet $B$
of $P$ is at most $d$ whenever the cover graph of $B$ is a block of the cover
graph of $P$, then the dimension of $P$ is at most $d+2$. We also construct
examples which show that this inequality is best possible. We consider the
proof of the upper bound to be fairly elegant and relatively compact. However,
we know of no simple proof for the lower bound, and our argument requires a
powerful tool known as the Product Ramsey Theorem. As a consequence, our
constructions involve posets of enormous size.
