We express the Connes-Chern character of the Dirac operator associated to a
b-metric on a manifold with boundary in terms of a retracted cocycle in
relative cyclic cohomology, whose expression depends on a scaling/cut-off pa-
rameter. Blowing-up the metric one recovers the pair of characteristic currents
that represent the corresponding de Rham relative homology class, while the
blow-down yields a relative cocycle whose expression involves higher eta
cochains and their b-analogues. The corresponding pairing formulae with
relative K-theory classes capture information about the boundary and allow to
derive geometric consequences. As a by-product, we show that the generalized
Atiyah-Patodi-Singer pairing introduced by Getzler and Wu is necessarily
restricted to almost flat bundles.
