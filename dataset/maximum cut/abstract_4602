To estimate realistic cross sections in ultra peripheral heavy ion collisions
we must remove effects of strong absorption. One method to eliminate these
effects make use of a Glauber model calculation, where the nucleon-nucleon
energy dependent cross sections at small impact parameter are suppressed. In
another method we impose a geometrical cut on the minimal impact parameter of
the nuclear collision ($b_{min} > R_1 + R_2$, where $R_i$ is the radius of ion
"$i$"). In this last case the effect of a possible nuclear radius dependence
with the energy has not been considered in detail up to now. Here we introduce
this effect showing that for final states with small invariant mass the effect
is negligible. However when the final state has a relatively large invariant
mass, e.g. an intermediate mass Higgs boson, the cross section can decrease up
to 50%.
