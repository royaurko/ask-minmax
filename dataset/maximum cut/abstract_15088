In this paper, we give an overview of spatially coupled turbo codes (SC-TCs),
the spatial coupling of parallel and serially concatenated convolutional codes,
recently introduced by the contributors. For presentation purposes, we focus on
spatially coupled serially concatenated codes (SC-SCCs). We review the main
principles of SC-TCs and discuss their exact density evolution (DE) analysis on
the binary erasure channel. We also consider the construction of a family of
rate-compatible SC-SCCs with simple 4-state component encoders. For all
considered code rates, threshold saturation of the belief propagation (BP) to
the maximum a posteriori threshold of the uncoupled ensemble is demonstrated,
and it is shown that the BP threshold approaches the Shannon limit as the
coupling memory increases. Finally we give some simulation results for finite
lengths.
