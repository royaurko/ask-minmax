Tunneling two level systems (TLS), present in dielectrics at low
temperatures, have been recently studied for fundamental understanding and
superconducting device development. According to a recent theory by Burin
\textit{et al.}, the TLS bath of any amorphous dielectric experiences a
distribution of Landau-Zener transitions if exposed to simultaneous fields. In
this experiment we measure amorphous insulating films at millikelvin
temperatures with a microwave field and a swept electric field bias using a
superconducting resonator. We find that the maximum dielectric loss per
microwave photon with the simultaneous fields is approximately the same as that
in the equilibrium state, in agreement with the generic material theory. In
addition, we find that the loss depends on the fields in a way which allows for
the separate extraction of the TLS bath dipole moment and density of states.
This method allows for the study of the TLS dipole moment in a diverse set of
disordered films, and provides a technique for continuously inverting their
population.
