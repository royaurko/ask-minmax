We present a model for biological aging that considers the number of
individuals whose (inherited) genetic charge determines the maximum age for
death: each individual may die before that age due to some external factor, but
never after that limit. The genetic charge of the offspring is inherited from
the parent with some mutations, described by a transition matrix. The model can
describe different strategies of reproduction and it is exactly soluble. We
applied our method to the bit-string model for aging and the results are in
perfect agreement with numerical simulations.
