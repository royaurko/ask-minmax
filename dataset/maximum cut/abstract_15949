We present first results from commissioning data of the SparsePak Integral
Field Unit on the WIYN telescope. SparsePak is a bundle of 82 fibers, each 5
arcsec in diameter and arranged in a sparsely filled, 76x77 arcsec hexagonal
grid. NGC 3982, a nearly face-on, blue and very high surface brightness galaxy,
was mapped in three spectral regions; around 5130A (MgI), 6680A (H-alpha) and
8660A (CaII-triplet) with FWHM spectral resolutions of 24, 16 and 37 km/s
respectively. At 3.5 disk scale lengths, the spectra of 18 fibers were averaged
after deprojection of the rotation curve. Stellar velocity dispersions were
determined in the CaII region by convolving the spectrum of a K0.5-III template
star with a Gaussian of varying FWHM and finding the best match to the
azimuthally avaraged galaxy spectra. A radial mass surface density profile has
been derived for a variety of scale heights assuming an isothermal vertical
density profile. At two disk scale lengths, the mass surface density of N3982
is ~3 times higher than that of the Milky Way in the solar neighborhood.
Surprisingly, the stellar rotation curve of this compact and high surface
brightness galaxy is substantially sub-maximum.
