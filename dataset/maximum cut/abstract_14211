In this paper, two upper bounds on the achievable code rate of linear block
codes for multiple phased-burst correction (MPBC) are presented. One bound is
constrained to a maximum correctable cyclic burst length within every subblock,
or equivalently a constraint on the minimum error free length or gap within
every phased-burst. This bound, when reduced to the special case of a bound for
single burst correction (SBC), is shown to be the Abramson bound when the
cyclic burst length is less than half the block length. The second MPBC bound
is developed without the minimum error free gap constraint and is used as a
comparison to the first bound.
