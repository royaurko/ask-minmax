Exact maximum clique finders have progressed to the point where we can
investigate cliques in million-node social and information networks, as well as
find strongly connected components in temporal networks. We use one such finder
to study a large collection of modern networks emanating from biological,
social, and technological domains. We show inter-relationships between maximum
cliques and several other common network properties, including network density,
maximum core, and number of triangles. In temporal networks, we find that the
largest temporal strong components have around 20-30% of the vertices of the
entire network. These components represent groups of highly communicative
individuals. In addition, we discuss and improve the performance and utility of
the maximum clique finder itself.
