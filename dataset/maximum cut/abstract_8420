We present a new and general Monte Carlo iteration method for generalized
ensembles. It consists of two elements: (1) a simple algorithm to distinguish
between distributions arising from respectively equilibrium- and
non-equilibrium processes, and (2) a selfconsistent maximum-likelyhood
estimation of the unknown thermodynamic quantities, based on the information
obtained at all previous iterations. We demonstrate the efficiency of the
method by calculating the density of state function of a homopolymer with 16^3
monomers. This represents an improvement of at least an order of magnitude
compared to previous studies.
