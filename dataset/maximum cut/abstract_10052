The properties of hybrid stars formed by hadronic and quark matter in
beta-equilibrium at fixed entropies are described by appropriate equations of
state (EOS) in the framework of relativistic mean-field theory. In this work we
include the possibility of neutrino trapped EOS and compare the star properties
with the ones obtained after deleptonization, when neutrinos have already
diffused out. We use the nonlinear Walecka model for the hadron matter with two
different sets for the hyperon couplings and the MIT Bag and the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models for the quark matter. The phase transition to a
deconfined quark phase is investigated. Depending on the model and the
parameter set used, the mixed phase may or may not exist in the EOS at high
densities.
  The star properties are calculated for each equation of state. The maximum
mass stellar configurations obtained within the NJL have larger masses than the
ones obtained within the Bag model. The Bag model predicts a mixed phase in the
interior of the most massive stable stars while, depending on the hyperon
couplings, the NJL model predicts a mixed phase or pure quark matter. Comparing
with neutrino free stars, the maximum allowed baryonic masses for protoneutron
stars are $\sim 0.4 M_\odot$ larger for the Bag model and $\sim 0.1 M_\odot$
larger for the NJL model when neutrino trapping is imposed.
