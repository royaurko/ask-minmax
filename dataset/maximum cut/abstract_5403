Dozens of research centers, foundations, international organizations and
scientific societies, including the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, have
joined forces to celebrate 2013 as a special year for the Mathematics of Planet
Earth. In its five-year history, the Annals of Applied Statistics has been
publishing cutting edge research in this area, including geophysical,
biological and socio-economic aspects of planet Earth, with the special section
on statistics in the atmospheric sciences edited by Fuentes, Guttorp and Stein
(2008) and the discussion paper by McShane and Wyner (2011) on paleoclimate
reconstructions [Stein (2011)] having been highlights.
