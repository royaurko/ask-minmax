We propose a direct reconstruction algorithm for Computed Tomography, based
on a local fusion of a few preliminary image estimates by means of a non-linear
fusion rule. One such rule is based on a signal denoising technique which is
spatially adaptive to the unknown local smoothness. Another, more powerful
fusion rule, is based on a neural network trained off-line with a high-quality
training set of images. Two types of linear reconstruction algorithms for the
preliminary images are employed for two different reconstruction tasks. For an
entire image reconstruction from full projection data, the proposed scheme uses
a sequence of Filtered Back-Projection algorithms with a gradually growing
cut-off frequency. To recover a Region Of Interest only from local projections,
statistically-trained linear reconstruction algorithms are employed. Numerical
experiments display the improvement in reconstruction quality when compared to
linear reconstruction algorithms.
