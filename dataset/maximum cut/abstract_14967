Favorable propagation, defined as mutual orthogonality among the
vector-valued channels to the terminals, is one of the key properties of the
radio channel that is exploited in Massive MIMO. However, there has been little
work that studies this topic in detail. In this paper, we first show that
favorable propagation offers the most desirable scenario in terms of maximizing
the sum-capacity. One useful proxy for whether propagation is favorable or not
is the channel condition number. However, this proxy is not good for the case
where the norms of the channel vectors may not be equal. For this case, to
evaluate how favorable the propagation offered by the channel is, we propose a
``distance from favorable propagation'' measure, which is the gap between the
sum-capacity and the maximum capacity obtained under favorable propagation.
Secondly, we examine how favorable the channels can be for two extreme
scenarios: i.i.d. Rayleigh fading and uniform random line-of-sight (UR-LoS).
Both environments offer (nearly) favorable propagation. Furthermore, to analyze
the UR-LoS model, we propose an urns-and-balls model. This model is simple and
explains the singular value spread characteristic of the UR-LoS model well.
