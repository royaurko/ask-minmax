We investigate the effect of unconventional density wave (UDW) condensate on
an Anderson impurity using large-N technique at T=0. In accordance with
previous treatments of a Kondo impurity in pseudogap phases, we find that Kondo
effect occurs only in a certain range of parameters. The f-electron density of
states reflects the influence of UDW at low energies and around the maximum of
the density wave gap. The static spin susceptibility diverges at the critical
coupling, indicating the transition from strong to weak coupling. In the
dynamic spin susceptibility an additional peak appears showing the presence the
UDW gap. Predictions concerning non-linear density of states are made. Our
results apply to other unconventional condensates such as d-wave
superconductors and d-density waves as well.
