We study asymptotic behavior of one-step $M$-estimators based on samples from
arrays of not necessarily identically distributed random variables and
representing explicit approximations to the corresponding consistent
$M$-estimators. These estimators generalize Fisher's one-step approximations to
consistent maximum likelihood estimators. Sufficient conditions are presented
for asymptotic normality of the one-step $M$-estimators under consideration.
