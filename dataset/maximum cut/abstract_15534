The majority of unconventional superconductors are found near the zero
temperature termination point of a line of phase transitions, a "quantum
critical point," where strong fluctuations are believed to be favourable for
the superconducting pairing.[1-4] A notable exception is URu2Si2, [5-8] which
exhibits unconventional superconductivity that is fully contained inside an
unknown broken symmetry phase ("hidden-order"), as revealed by numerous tuning
studies. [9-20] To explore the mechanism of superconductivity in this compound
we synthesized high purity single crystal specimens of chemically substituted
URu2Si2-xPx, where ligand site substitution is a "gentle" way to tune the
electronic state. Here we report electrical transport and thermodynamic
measurements which reveal a superconducting dome that is centered around x =
0.01, which disappears before hidden order is suppressed at x = 0.035. This
unexpected maximum in superconducting strength may suggest the presence of a
critical point that is defined by the termination of a phase boundary other
than that of the hidden order.
