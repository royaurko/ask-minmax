On 2010 Mar 10, V407 Cyg was discovered in outburst, eventually reaching V< 8
and detected by Fermi. Using medium and high resolution ground-based optical
spectra, visual and Swift UV photometry, and Swift X-ray spectrophotometry, we
describe the behavior of the high-velocity profile evolution for this nova
during its first three months. The peak of the X-ray emission occurred at about
day 40 with a broad maximum and decline after day 50. The main changes in the
optical spectrum began at around that time. The He II 4686A line first appeared
between days 7 and 14 and initially displayed a broad, symmetric profile that
is characteristic of all species before day 60. Low-excitation lines remained
comparatively narrow, with v(rad,max) of order 200-400 km/s. They were
systematically more symmetric than lines such as [Ca V], [Fe VII], [Fe X], and
He II, all of which showed a sequence of profile changes going from symmetric
to a blue wing similar to that of the low ionization species but with a red
wing extended to as high as 600 km/s . The Na I D doublet developed a broad
component with similar velocity width to the other low-ionization species. The
O VI Raman features were not detected. We interpret these variations as
aspherical expansion of the ejecta within the Mira wind. The blue side is from
the shock penetrating into the wind while the red wing is from the low-density
periphery. The maximum radial velocities obey power laws, v(rad,max) t^{-n}
with n ~ 1/3 for red wing and ~0.8 for the blue. (truncated)
