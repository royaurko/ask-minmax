We study an extended system that without noise shows a monostable dynamics,
but when submitted to an adequate multiplicative noise, an effective bistable
dynamics arise. The stochastic resonance between the attractors of the
\textit{noise-sustained dynamics} is investigated theoretically in terms of a
two-state approximation. The knowledge of the exact nonequilibrium potential
allows us to obtain the output signal-to-noise ratio. Its maximum is predicted
in the symmetric case for which both attractors have the same nonequilibrium
potential value.
