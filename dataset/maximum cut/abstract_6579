The degree of nonclassicality of states of a field mode is analysed
considering both phase-space and distance-type measures of nonclassicality. By
working out some general examples, it is shown explicitly that the phase-space
measure is rather sensitive to superposition of states, with finite
superpositions possessing maximum nonclassical depth (the highest degree of
nonclassicality) irrespective to the nature of the component states. Mixed
states are also discussed and examples with nonclassical depth varying between
the minimum and the maximum allowed values are exhibited. For pure Gaussian
states, it is demonstrated that distance-type measures based on the
Hilbert-Schmidt metric are equivalent to the phase-space measure. Analyzing
some examples, it is shown that distance-type measures are efficient to
quantify the degree of nonclassicality of non-Gaussian pure states.
