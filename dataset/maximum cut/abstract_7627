Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a scaling analysis method used to
quantify long-range power-law correlations in signals. Many physical and
biological signals are ``noisy'', heterogeneous and exhibit different types of
nonstationarities, which can affect the correlation properties of these
signals. We systematically study the effects of three types of
nonstationarities often encountered in real data. Specifically, we consider
nonstationary sequences formed in three ways: (i) stitching together segments
of data obtained from discontinuous experimental recordings, or removing some
noisy and unreliable parts from continuous recordings and stitching together
the remaining parts -- a ``cutting'' procedure commonly used in preparing data
prior to signal analysis; (ii) adding to a signal with known correlations a
tunable concentration of random outliers or spikes with different amplitude,
and (iii) generating a signal comprised of segments with different properties
-- e.g. different standard deviations or different correlation exponents. We
compare the difference between the scaling results obtained for stationary
correlated signals and correlated signals with these three types of
nonstationarities.
