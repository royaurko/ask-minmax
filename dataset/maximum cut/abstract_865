The classification of events involving jets as signal-like or background-like
can depend strongly on the jet algorithm used and its parameters. This is
partly due to the fact that standard jet algorithms yield a single partition of
the particles in an event into jets, even if no particular choice stands out
from the others. As an alternative, we propose that one should consider
multiple interpretations of each event, generalizing the Qjets procedure to
event-level analysis. With multiple interpretations, an event is no longer
restricted to either satisfy cuts or not satisfy them - it can be assigned a
weight between 0 and 1 based on how well it satisfies the cuts. These
cut-weights can then be used to improve the discrimination power of an analysis
or reduce the uncertainty on mass or cross-section measurements. For example,
using this approach on a Higgs plus Z boson sample, with h->bb we find an 28%
improvement in significance can be realized at the 8 TeV LHC. Through a number
of other examples, we show various ways in which having multiple
interpretations can be useful on the event level.
