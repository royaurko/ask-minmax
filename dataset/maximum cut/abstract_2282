A model of cut-off momentum distribution functions in a Quark Gluon Plasma
with finite baryon chemical potential is discussed. This produces a quark gluon
plasma signature in Ultra Relativistic Nuclear Collisions with a specific
structure of the dilepton spectrum in the transverse momentum region of
$(1-4)~GeV$ and the dilepton production rate is found to be a strong decreasing
function of the chemical potential.
