We investigate the effect of the density-dependent proton and neutron gaps on
vortex dynamics in neutron stars. We argue that the persistence of neutron star
magnetic fields on timescales of $10^9$ y suggests a superconducting gap curve
with local maximum at intermediate density. We discuss the implications for
exotic core phenomena such as pion/kaon condensation or a transition to quark
matter.
