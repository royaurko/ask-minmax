A systematic study of the synchrotron X-ray emission from supernova remnants
(SNRs) has been conducted. We selected a total of 12 SNRs whose synchrotron
X-ray spectral parameters are available in the literature with reasonable
accuracy, and studied how their luminosities change as a function of radius. It
is found that the synchrotron X-ray luminosity tends to drop especially when
the SNRs become larger than ~5 pc, despite large scatter. This may be explained
by the change of spectral shape caused by the decrease of the synchrotron
roll-off energy. A simple evolutionary model of the X-ray luminosity is
proposed and is found to reproduce the observed data approximately, with
reasonable model parameters. According to the model, the total energy of
accelerated electrons is estimated to be 10^(47-48) ergs, which is well below
the supernova explosion energy. The maximum energies of accelerated electrons
and protons are also discussed.
