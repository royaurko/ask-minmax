Triple Higgs boson production (3H) may provide essential information to
reconstruct the Higgs potential. We consider 3H-production in the International
Linear Collider (ILC) both in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)
and in the general Two-Higgs-doublet Model (2HDM). We compute the total
cross-section for the various 3H final states, such as H^+ H^- h^0, H^0 A^0
h^0, etc. and compare with the more traditional double Higgs (2H) boson
production processes. While the cross-sections for the 2H final states lie
within the same order of magnitude in both the MSSM and 2HDM, we find that for
the 3H states the maximum 2HDM cross-sections, being of order 0.1 pb, are much
larger than the MSSM ones which in most cases are of order 10^{-6} pb or less.
Actually, the 3H processes could be the dominant mechanism for Higgs boson
production in the 2HDM. Ultimately the origin of the remarkable enhancement of
the 3H channels in the 2HDM case (for both type I and type II models)
originates in the structure of the trilinear Higgs boson couplings. The
extremely clean environment of the ILC should allow a relatively comfortable
tagging of the three Higgs boson events. In view of the fact that the MSSM
contribution is negligible, these events should manifest themselves mainly in
the form of 6 heavy-quark jet final states. Some of these signatures could be
spectacular, and in case of being detected would constitute strong evidence of
an extended Higgs sector of non-supersymmetric origin.
