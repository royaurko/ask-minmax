We measured magnetization, M, of a twin-aligned single crystal of YBa2Cu 3Ox
(YBaCuO), with Tc = 91 K, as a function of temperature, T, and magnetic field,
H, with H applied along the ab planes. Isothermal M-vs.-H and M-vs.-time curves
were obtained with H applied parallel and perpendicular to the twin boundary,
TB, direction. M-vs.-H curves exhibited two minimums below 38 K, which
resembled similar curves that have been obtained in YBaCuO for H parallel to c
axis. Above 12 K, the field positions of the minimums for H||TB and HperpTB
were quite similar. Below 12 K, the position of the second minimum, Hmin,
occurred at a higher field value with H||TB. Below 6 K, only one minimum
appeared for both field directions. At low temperatures, these minimums in the
M-vs.-H curves produced maximums in the critical current. It was determined
that vortex lines were expelled more easily for H||TB than for HperpTB, and,
therefore, below a certain field value, that Jc(HperpTB) was larger than
Jc(H||TB) . At T<12 K with H||TB, the relaxation rate for flux lines leaving
the crystal was found to be different from that for flux entering the crystal.
We also observed flux jumps at low temperatures, with their sizes depending on
the orientation of magnetic field with respect to the TBs.
