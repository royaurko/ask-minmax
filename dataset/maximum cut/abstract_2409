We investigate the stability of the relativistic three-boson system with a
zero range force in the light front form. In particular we study the dependence
of the system on an invariant cut-off. We discuss the conditions for the
relativistic Thomas collapse. Finally, we fix the parameters of the model
introducing a scale.
