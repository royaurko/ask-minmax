In this note, we discuss the method explained in the recent paper [P. Manuel,
I. Rajasingh, B. Rajan, R. Sundara Rajan, A New Approach To Compute Wiener
Index, Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience 10, (2013)
1515-1521.] for computing the Wiener index of special chemical graphs. The
method is actually already well-known and equivalent to the 'cut method'
introduced in 1995 by Klavzar, Gutman and Mohar, and used in multiple papers
for computing various distance based graph invariants.
