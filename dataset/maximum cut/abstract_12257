We study $T^{3}$ Gowdy spacetimes in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion
system and show by the Fuchsian algorithm that they have in general
asymptotically velocity-term dominated singularities. The families of the
corresponding solutions depend on the maximum number of arbitrary functions.
Although coupling of the dilaton field with the Maxwell and/or the axion fields
corresponds to the ``potential'' which appears in the Hamiltonian of vacuum
Bianchi IX spacetimes, our result means that the spacetimes do not become
Mixmaster necessarily.
