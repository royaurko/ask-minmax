The first measurement of the top quark pair production cross section in the
fully hadronic channel at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt s = 7$ TeV is
presented. The measurement has been performed using an integrated luminosity of
1.09 fb$^{-1}$, collected with the CMS detector. The reconstruction of the
$t\bar t$ candidates is performed after a cut-based event selection using a
kinematic fit. A data-driven technique is used to estimate the dominant
background from QCD multijet production. The cross section is determined from a
fit to the top quark mass. The cross section measurement yields $\sigma(t\bar
t)=136 \pm 20 (stat.) \pm 40 (sys.) \pm 8 (lumi.)$ pb. This result is
consistent with an independent measurement in the same channel, with the
measurements in other decay channels and with the Standard Model predictions.
