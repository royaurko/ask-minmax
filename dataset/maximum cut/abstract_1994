A mechanism of ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic ray acceleration in
extragalactic radio sources at the interface between the relativistic jet and
the ambient medium is discussed as a supplement to the shock acceleration in
`hot spots'. Particles accelerated at the jet side boundary are expected to
dominate at highest energies. The spectrum formation near the cut-off energy is
modeled using the Monte Carlo particle simulations.
