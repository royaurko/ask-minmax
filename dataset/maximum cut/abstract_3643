We study the efficiency at maximum power of two coupled heat engines, using
thermoelectric generators (TEGs) as engines. Assuming that the heat and
electric charge fluxes in the TEGs are strongly coupled, we simulate
numerically the dependence of the behavior of the global system on the
electrical load resistance of each generator in order to obtain the working
condition that permits maximization of the output power. It turns out that this
condition is not unique. We derive a simple analytic expression giving the
relation between the electrical load resistance of each generator permitting
output power maximization. We then focuse on the efficiency at maximum power
(EMP) of the whole system to demonstrate that the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency may
not always be recovered: the EMP varies with the specific working conditions of
each generator but remains in the range predicted by irreversible
thermodynamics theory. We finally discuss our results in light of non-ideal
Carnot engine behavior.
