Two sets of spatially differential formulas of Lenz law on electromagnetic
inductance are presented. They are a cut-magnetic flux induced voltage, which
instantaneously results from cutting magnetic flux as a conductor moving with
respect to an external magnetic field, and a wave-induced voltage due to the
interaction of a conductor or charged particles with the arriving
electromagnetic wave, which is originated from a changing magnetic flux source.
Upon the Lenz differential forms, the induced electrical field strength,
relevant properties and their application are discussed.
