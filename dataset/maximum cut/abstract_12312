Inclusive distributions of charged particles in hadronic W decays are
experimentally investigated using the statistics collected by the DELPHI
experiment at LEP during 1997, 1998 and 1999, at centre-of-mass energies from
183 to around 200 GeV. The possible effects of interconnection between the
hadronic decays of two Ws are not observed. Measurements of the average
multiplicity for charged and identified particles in q qbar and WW events at
centre-of-mass energies from 130 to 200 GeV and in W decays are presented. The
results on the average multiplicity of identified particles and on the position
xi^* of the maximum of the xi_p = -log(2p/sqrt(s)) distribution are compared
with predictions of JETSET and MLLA calculations.
