This paper presents the design consideration and simulation of interpolator
of OSR 128. The proposed structure uses the half band filers & Comb/Sinc
filter. Experimental result shows that proposed interpolator achieves the
design specification, and also has good noise rejection capabilities. The
interpolator accepts the input at 44.1 kHz for applications like CD & DVD
audio. The interpolation filter can be applied to the delta sigma DAC. The
related work is done with the MATLAB & XILINX ISE simulators. The maximum
operating frequency is achieved as 34.584 MHz.
