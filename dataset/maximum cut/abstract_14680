We report the results of a muon spin rotation (muSR) study of the bulk of
Bi{2+x}Sr{2-x}CaCu2O{8+\delta}, as well as pure and Ca-doped YBa2Cu3Oy, which
together with prior measurements reveal a universal inhomogeneous
magnetic-field response of hole-doped cuprates extending to temperatures far
above the critical temperature (Tc). The primary features of our data are
incompatible with the spatially inhomogeneous response being dominated by known
charge density wave (CDW) and spin density wave (SDW) orders. Instead the
normal-state inhomogeneous line broadening is found to scale with the maximum
value Tc^max for each cuprate family, indicating it is controlled by the same
energy scale as Tc. Since the degree of chemical disorder varies widely among
the cuprates we have measured, the observed scaling constitutes evidence for an
intrinsic electronic tendency toward inhomogeneity above Tc.
