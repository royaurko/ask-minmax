The sequential change-point detection problem is considered when we are
monitoring multiple independent data streams but the post-change distributions
involve unknown parameters. One monitoring scheme is the SRRS scheme proposed
by Lorden and Pollak (2005) that estimates the post-change parameters by the
method of moments (MOM) or maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) of past
observations and then uses the Shiryaev-Roberts-type procedure to raise a
global alarm. However, it is well-known from the off-line point estimation
literature that "shrinkage" often leads to better performances compared to MOM
or MLE in the multi-dimensional scenario, see James and Stein (1961), Donoho
and Johnstone (1994). Here we propose to adopt two kinds of shrinkage
estimators in the SRRS scheme for online monitoring: linear shrinkage for
consensus detection and hard thresholding for parallel detection. Our
theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate the usefulness of
shrinkage in the sequential or online monitoring setting. Moreover, the SRRS
scheme and the shrinkage post-change estimators are also illustrated to be
flexible and can be modified to develop a computationally simple scheme when
monitoring large-scale data streams.
