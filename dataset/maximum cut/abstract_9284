Let $mad(G)$ denote the maximum average degree (over all subgraphs) of $G$
and let $\chi_i(G)$ denote the injective chromatic number of $G$. We prove that
if $mad(G) \leq 5/2$, then $\chi_i(G)\leq\Delta(G) + 1$; and if $mad(G) <
42/19$, then $\chi_i(G)=\Delta(G)$. Suppose that $G$ is a planar graph with
girth $g(G)$ and $\Delta(G)\geq 4$. We prove that if $g(G)\geq 9$, then
$\chi_i(G)\leq\Delta(G)+1$; similarly, if $g(G)\geq 13$, then
$\chi_i(G)=\Delta(G)$.
