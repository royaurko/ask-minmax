The stability of non-linear Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) model
was tested. The area of the stable region in transverse coordinates and the
maximum attainable tune spread were found as a function of non-linear lens
strength. Particle loss as a function of turn number was analyzed to determine
whether a dynamic aperture limitation present in the system. The system was
also tested with sextupoles included in the machine for chromaticity
compensation. A method of evaluation of the beam size in the linear part of the
accelerator was proposed.
