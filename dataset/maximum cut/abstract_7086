The recent discoveries of massive neutron stars, such as PSR J$0348+0432$ and
PSR J$1614-2230$, have raised questions about the existence of exotic matter
such as hyperons in the neutron star core. The validity of many established
equations of states (EoS's) like the GM1 and FSUGold are also questioned. We
investigate the existence of hyperonic matter in the central regions of massive
neutron stars using Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) theory with the recently
proposed IUFSU model. The IUFSU model is extended by including hyperons to
study the neutron star in $\beta$ equilibrium. The effect of different
hyperonic potentials, namely $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$ potentials, on the EoS and
hence the maximum mass of neutron stars has been studied. We have also
considered the effect of stellar rotation since the observed massive stars are
pulsars.
  It has been found that a maximum mass of $1.93M_{\odot}$, which is within the
3$\sigma$ limit of the observed mass of PSR J$0348+0432$, can be obtained for
rotating stars, with certain choices of the hyperonic potentials. The said star
  contains a fair amount of hyperons near the core.
