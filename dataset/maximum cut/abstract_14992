This paper focuses on the capacity of peer-to-peer relay communications
wherein the transmitter are assisted by an arbitrary number of parallel relays,
i.e. there is no link and cooperation between the relays themselves. We detail
the mathematical model of different relaying strategies including cutset and
amplify and forward strategies. The cutset upper bound capacity is presented as
a reference to compare another realistic strategy. We present its outer region
capacity which is lower than that in the existing literature. We show that a
multiple parallel relayed network achieves its maximum capacity by virtue of
only one relay or by virtue of all relays together. Adding a relay may even
decrease the overall capacity or may do not change it. We exemplify various
outer region capacities of the addressed strategies with two different case
studies. The results exhibit that in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
environments the cutset outperforms the amplify and forward strategy and this
is contrary in high SNR environments.
