In this paper we propose the Ising model to study the propagation of water in
2 dimensional (2D) petroleum reservoir in which each bond between its pores has
the probability $p$ of being activated. We analyze the water movement pattern
in porous media described by Darcy equations by focusing on its geometrical
objects. Using Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) technique we numerically show
that at $p=p_c\simeq 0.59$, this model lies within the Ising universality class
with the diffusivity parameter $\kappa=3$ and the fractal dimension
$D_f=\frac{11}{8}$. We introduce a self-organized critical model in which the
water movement is modeled by a chain of topplings taking place when the amount
of water exceeds the critical value and numerically show that it coincides with
the numerical reservoir simulation. For this model, the behaviors of
distribution functions of the geometrical quantities and the Green function are
investigated in terms of $p$. We show that percolation probability has a
maximum around $p=0.68$, in contrast to common belief.
