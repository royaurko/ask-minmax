We study Matrix Element corrections as implemented in four popular event
generators for hadron collisions. We compare PYTHIA, HERWIG, ALPGEN and SHERPA
in the Z/gamma* inclusive production at LHC. PYTHIA and HERWIG are able to
correct the first emission from the shower taking the Matrix Element
calculation for one additional parton into account. SHERPA and ALPGEN are able
to take into account Matrix Element corrections not only for one, but rather
for several hard emissions from the incoming partons. This can be done at the
price of introducing a separation cut to distinguish a Matrix Element and a
Parton Shower populated regions. In this paper we check the effect of Matrix
Element corrections in PYTHIA and HERWIG and we check that results from these
two generators are consistent. Then we turn to SHERPA and ALPGEN, that
implement two different methods to match Matrix Element calculations and Parton
Shower. If we constraint them so that no more than one parton can emerge from
the Matrix Element calculations they should both give results similar to PYTHIA
and HERWIG. In other words PYTHIA and HERWIG provide us with the correct
reference to spot possible issues with the matching prescriptions implemented
in SHERPA and ALPGEN. We also check to what extent the dependency on the Matrix
Element - Parton Shower separation cut is canceled in these two generators.
