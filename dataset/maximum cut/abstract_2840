We report on the first successful proof-of-principle experiment to manipulate
laser-matter interactions on the microscale using highly ordered Si microwire
arrays. The interaction of a high contrast short pulse laser with a flat target
via periodic Si microwires yields a substantial enhancement in both total and
cut-off energies of the produced electron beam. The self generated electric and
magnetic fields behave as an electromagnetic lens that confines and guides
electrons between the microwires as they acquire relativistic energies via
direct laser acceleration (DLA).
