Z Camelopardalis (Z Cam) stars are a subset of dwarf novae distinguished by
the occurrence of standstills, periods of relative constant brightness one to
one and a half magnitudes fainter than maximum brightness. As part of an
ongoing observing campaign, the Z CamPaign, the contributors focused attention on
several Z Cam suspects in the southern hemisphere. Two stars, BP Coronae
Australis and ST Chamaeleontis were found to exhibit standstill behavior in
2013, thus confirming them as Z Cam type systems. This adds two more bona fide
members to the 19 confirmed Z Cams, bringing the total to 21.
