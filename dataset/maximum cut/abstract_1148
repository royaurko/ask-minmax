We derive cutting rules for loop integrals containing propagators with
complex masses. Using a field-theoretical model of a heavy vector boson
interacting with a light fermion, we demonstrate that the complex-mass scheme
respects unitarity order by order in a perturbative expansion provided that the
renormalized coupling constant remains real.
