We investigate the magnetocaloric properties of the two-dimensional
frustrated J1-J2 model on a square lattice. This model describes well the
magnetic behavior of two classes of quasi-two-dimensional S = 1/2 vanadates,
namely the Li2VOXO4 (X = Si, Ge) and AA'VO(PO4)2 (A, A' = Pb, Zn, Sr, Ba)
compounds. The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) consists in the adiabatic
temperature change upon changing the external magnetic field. In frustrated
systems, the MCE can be enhanced close to the saturation field because of
massive degeneracies among low lying excitations. We discuss results for the
MCE in the two distinct antiferromagnetic regimes of the phase diagram.
Numerical finite temperature Lanczos as well as analytical methods based on the
spin wave expansion are employed and results are compared. We give explicit
values for the saturation fields of the vanadium compounds. We predict that at
subcritical fields there is first a (positive) maximum followed by sign change
of the MCE, characteristic of all magnetically ordered phases.
