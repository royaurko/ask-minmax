In Fern\'andez-Dur\'an (2004), a new family of circular distributions based
on nonnegative trigonometric sums (NNTS models) is developed. Because the
parameter space of this family is the surface of the hypersphere, an efficient
Newton-like algorithm on manifolds is generated in order to obtain the maximum
likelihood estimates of the parameters.
