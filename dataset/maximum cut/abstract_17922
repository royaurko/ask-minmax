The present paper determines the thermodynamic properties of the
superconducting state in the ${\rm H_{2}S}$ compound. The values of the
pressure from $130$ GPa to $180$ GPa were taken into consideration. The
calculations were performed in the framework of the Eliashberg formalism. In
the first step, the experimental course of the dependence of the critical
temperature on the pressure was reproduced: $T_{C}\in\left<31,88\right>$ K,
whereas the Coulomb pseudopotential equal to $0.15$ was adopted. Next, the
following quantities were calculated: the order parameter at the temperature of
zero Kelvin ($\Delta\left(0\right)$), the specific heat jump at the critical
temperature ($\Delta C\left(T_{C}\right)\equiv
C^{S}\left(T_{C}\right)-C^{N}\left(T_{C}\right)$), and the thermodynamic
critical field ($H_{C}\left(0\right)$). It was found that the values of the
dimensionless ratios: $R_{\Delta}\equiv 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{C}$,
$R_{C}\equiv{\Delta C\left(T_{C}\right)}/{C^{N}\left(T_{C}\right)}$, and
$R_{H}\equiv{T_{C}C^{N}\left(T_{C}\right)}/{H_{C}^{2}\left(0\right)}$ deviate
from the predictions of the BCS theory: $R_{\Delta}\in\left<3.64,4.16\right>$,
$R_{C}\in\left<1.59,2.24\right>$, and $R_{H}\in\left<0.144, 0.163\right>$.
Generalizing the results on the whole family of the ${\rm H_{n}S}$-type
compounds, it was shown that the maximum value of the critical temperature can
be equal to $\sim 290$ K, while $R_{\Delta}$, $R_{C}$ and $R_{H}$ adopt the
following values: $6.53$, $3.99$, and $0.093$, respectively.
