We introduce wavelets, curvelets and multiresolution analysis techniques to
assess the symmetry of X ray driven imploding shells in ICF targets. After
denoising X ray backlighting produced images, we determine the Shell Thickness
Averaged Radius (STAR) of maximum density, r*(N, {\theta}), where N is the
percentage of the shell thickness over which to average. The non-uniformities
of r*(N, {\theta}) are quantified by a Legendre polynomial decomposition in
angle, {\theta}. Undecimated wavelet decompositions outperform decimated ones
in denoising and both are surpassed by the curvelet transform. In each case,
hard thresholding based on noise modeling is used. We have also applied
combined wavelet and curvelet filter techniques with variational minimization
as a way to select the significant coefficients. Gains are minimal over
curvelets alone in the images we have analyzed.
