I review the method of Doppler tomography which translates binary-star line
profiles taken at a series of orbital phases into a distribution of emission
over the binary. I begin with a discussion of the basic principles behind
Doppler tomography, including a comparison of the relative merits of maximum
entropy regularisation versus filtered back-projection for implementing the
inversion. Following this I discuss the issue of noise in Doppler images and
possible methods for coping with it. Then I move on to look at the results of
Doppler Tomography applied to cataclysmic variable stars. Outstanding successes
to date are the discovery of two-arm spiral shocks in cataclysmic variable
accretion discs and the probing of the stream/magnetospheric interaction in
magnetic cataclysmic variable stars. Doppler tomography has also told us much
about the stream/disc interaction in non-magnetic systems and the irradiation
of the secondary star in all systems. The latter indirectly reveals such
effects as shadowing by the accretion disc or stream. I discuss all of these
and finish with some musings on possible future directions for the method. At
the end I include a tabulation of Doppler maps published in refereed journals.
