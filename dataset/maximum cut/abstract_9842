Our main goal in this work is to study magnetized neutron stars by using a
fully general$-$relativity approach presented in the LORENE
package\footnote{http://www.lorene.obspm.fr}. Here we have adopted a
non-uniform magnetic field profile which depends on the baryon density. This
profile has been used in many previous works and seems to be a good choice to
explore maximum effects of the internal magnetic field in these objects.
Equally important, the magnetic field treated here is poloidal and
axisymmetric. The preliminary results show that stars endowed with a strong
magnetic field will be deformed and the mass somewhat increased.
