We compare the performance of multiple codes written by different groups for
making polarized maps from Planck-sized, all-sky cosmic microwave background
(CMB) data. Three of the codes are based on a destriping algorithm; the other
three are implementations of an optimal maximum-likelihood algorithm.
Time-ordered data (TOD) were simulated using the Planck Level-S simulation
pipeline. Several cases of temperature-only data were run to test that the
codes could handle large datasets, and to explore effects such as the precision
of the pointing data. Based on these preliminary results, TOD were generated
for a set of four 217 GHz detectors (the minimum number required to produce I,
Q, and U maps) under two different scanning strategies, with and without noise.
Following correction of various problems revealed by the early simulation, all
codes were able to handle the large data volume that Planck will produce.
Differences in maps produced are small but noticeable; differences in computing
resources are large.
