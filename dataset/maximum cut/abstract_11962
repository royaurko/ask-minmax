We calculate analytically the effective mass and the quasiparticle
renormalization factor in an electron liquid with long-range Coulomb
interactions between electrons in two and three dimensions in the leading order
density expansion. We concentrate on the temperature dependence of the
effective mass in the limit (T/T_F)<<r_s<<1 and show that the leading
temperature correction is linear in two dimensions and proportional to T^2
Log(1/T) in three dimensions (positive in both cases). We explicitly calculate
the coefficients, which are shown to be universal density independent
parameters of the order of unity. The singular temperature corrections are due
to the singularity in the dynamic dielectric function. In two dimensions, we
predict a non-monotonic effective mass temperature dependence and find that the
maximum occurs at a temperature T* ~ (T_F r_s)/Log(1/r_s). We also study the
quasiparticle renormalization factor in both three and two dimensions.
