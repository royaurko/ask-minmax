Using N=2 superspace techniques we compute the four-loop spectrum of single
trace operators in the SU(2) x SU(2) sector of ABJM and ABJ supersymmetric
Chern-Simons theories. Our computation yields a four-loop contribution to the
function h^2(\lambda) (and its ABJ generalization) in the magnon dispersion
relation which has fixed maximum transcendentality and coincides with the
findings in components given in the revised versions of arXiv:0908.2463 and
arXiv:0912.3460. We also discuss possible scenarios for an all-loop function
h^2(\lambda) that interpolates between weak and strong couplings.
