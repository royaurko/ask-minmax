In this paper we present for the first time a detailed Monte Carlo study of
measuring WZGamma production with pure leptonic decays and probing anomalous
quartic gauge-boson WWZGamma couplings at the sqrt(s) = 14 TeV LHC, with parton
shower and detector simulation effects taken into account. We find that with an
integrated luminosity of 100 fb-1 and proper selection cuts, the Standard Model
WZGamma signal significance can be improved to as much as 3 sigma. After
reviewing previous parametrization on anomalous WWZGamma couplings (see
e.g.an/Lambda^2 or k2m/Lambda^2 as shown in Ref. [17]), we propose a more
general parametrization scheme with 4 free inputs leading only to genuine
WWZGamma aQGC couplings. Finally, our numerical results show that one can reach
constraints at 95% confidence level of -5.7 * 10^{-5} GeV^{-2} < k2m/Lambda^2 <
5.5 * 10^{-5} GeV^{-2} and -2.2 x 10^{-5} GeV^{-2} < an/Lambda^2 < 2.4 *
10^{-5} GeV^{-2}, which are more stringent than LEP's results by three orders
of magnitude.
