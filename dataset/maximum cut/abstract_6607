The JPEG2000 standard defines the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) as a
linear space-to-frequency transform of the image domain in an irreversible
compression. This irreversible discrete wavelet transform is implemented by FIR
filter using 9/7 Daubechies coefficients or a lifting scheme of factorizated
coefficients from 9/7 Daubechies coefficients. This work investigates the
tradeoffs between area, power and data throughput (or operating frequency) of
several implementations of the Discrete Wavelet Transform using the lifting
scheme in various pipeline designs. This paper shows the results of five
different architectures synthesized and simulated in FPGAs. It concludes that
the descriptions with pipelined operators provide the best area-power-operating
frequency trade-off over non-pipelined operators descriptions. Those
descriptions require around 40% more hardware to increase the maximum operating
frequency up to 100% and reduce power consumption to less than 50%. Starting
from behavioral HDL descriptions provide the best area-power-operating
frequency trade-off, improving hardware cost and maximum operating frequency
around 30% in comparison to structural descriptions for the same power
requirement.
