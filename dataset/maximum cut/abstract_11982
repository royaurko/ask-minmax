We consider the tunneling of phonon excitations across a potential barrier
spatially separating two condensates with different macroscopic phases. We
analyze the relation between the phase difference $\phi$ of the two condensates
and the transmission coefficient {\it T} by solving the Bogoliubov equations.
It is found that {\it T} strongly depends on $\phi$, and that the perfect
transmission of low-energy excitations disappears when the phase difference
reaches the critical value which gives the maximum supercurrent of the
condensate. We also discuss the feasibility of observing the phase differences
in experiments.
