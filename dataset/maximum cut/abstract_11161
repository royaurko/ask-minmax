The DENIS 2 micron survey is described. It's ability to probe galaxies at
very low galactic latitudes is computed using simulated images. This analysis
indicates that DENIS will be able to separate galaxies from stars, right
through the Galactic Plane, for galactic longitudes $45^\circ \leq \ell \leq
315^\circ$, with a maximum loss in the magnitude limit for reliable extraction
of $\simeq 1.2$ magnitude relative to that at the Galactic Pole (where the 92\%
reliability limit is $K' = 13.2$ for star/elliptical galaxy separation, and
fainter for other morphological types). Extinction corrected magnitude limits
are substantially worse, but for $|b| \geq 2^\circ$, they are within one
magnitude from that of the Galactic Poles. Thus, confusion by stars will not
prevent the establishment of a reliable galaxy catalog right through the
Galactic Plane. However, extinction will produce galaxies of lower surface
brightness, which will be more difficult to detect.
