We study neutrino spin oscillations in black hole backgrounds. In the case of
a charged black hole, the maximum frequency of oscillations is a monotonically
increasing function of the charge. For a rotating black hole, the maximum
frequency decreases with increasing the angular momentum. In both cases, the
frequency of spin oscillations decreases as the distance from the black hole
grows. As a phenomenological application of our results, we study simple
bipolar neutrino system which is an interesting example of collective neutrino
oscillations. We show that the precession frequency of the flavor pendulum as a
function of the neutrino number density will be higher for a
charged/non-rotating black hole compared with a neutral/rotating black hole
respectively.
