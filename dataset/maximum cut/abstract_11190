We report the optical identification of an $R=18.3$ mag, $z=2.432$ quasar at
the position of a 6 cm radio source and a faint \rosat PSPC X-ray source. The
quasar lies within the error circles of unidentified extreme-UV (EUV)
detections by the \euve and \rosat WFC all-sky surveys at $\sim 400$ \AA\ and
$\sim 150$ \AA, respectively. A 21 cm H I emission measurement in the direction
of the quasar with a $21'$-diameter beam yields a total H I column density of
$N_{H}=3.3\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, two orders of magnitude higher than the
maximum allowed for transparency through the Galaxy in the EUV. The source of
the EUV flux is therefore probably nearby ($\ltorder 100$ pc), and unrelated to
the quasar.
