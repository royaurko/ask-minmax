Theoretical modeling of the driving processes of solar-like oscillations is a
powerful way of understanding the properties of the convective zones of
solar-type stars. In this framework, the description of the temporal
correlation between turbulent eddies is an essential ingredient to model mode
amplitudes. However, there is a debate between a Gaussian or Lorentzian
description of the eddy-time correlation function (Samadi et al. 2003, Chaplin
et al. 2005). Indeed, a Gaussian description reproduces the low-frequency shape
of the mode amplitude for the Sun, but is unsatisfactory from a theoretical
point of view (Houdek, 2009) and leads to other disagreements with observations
(Samadi et al., 2007). These are solved by using a Lorentzian description, but
there the low-frequency shape of the solar observations is not correctly
reproduced. We reconcile the two descriptions by adopting the sweeping
approximation, which consists in assuming that the eddy-time-correlation
function is dominated by the advection of eddies, in the inertial range, by
energy-bearing eddies. Using a Lorentzian function together with a cut-off
frequency derived from the sweeping assumption allows us to reproduce the
low-frequency shape of the observations. This result also constitutes a
validation of the sweeping assumption for highly turbulent flows as in the
solar case.
