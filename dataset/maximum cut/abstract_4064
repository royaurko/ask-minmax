We describe a novel method of fabricating atom chips that are well suited to
the production and manipulation of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Our chip
was created using a silver foil and simple micro-cutting techniques without the
need for photolithography. It can sustain larger currents than conventional
chips, and is compatible with the patterning of complex trapping potentials. A
near pure Bose-Einstein condensate of 4 $\times$ 10$^4$ $^{87}$Rb atoms has
been created in a magnetic microtrap formed by currents through wires on the
chip. We have observed the fragmentation of atom clouds in close proximity to
the silver conductors. The fragmentation has different characteristic features
to those seen with copper conductors.
