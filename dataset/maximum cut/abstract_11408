We present simultaneous EUV and infrared (J,K) observations of the polar HU
Aqr obtained during August 1998 when the star was in a high mass accretion
state. EUV and IR light curves and EUV spectra are presented and compared with
previous observations. The accretion region on the white dwarf has increased in
temperature (124,000K to 240,000K) and radius (0.04 R$_{WD}$ to 0.06 R$_{WD} $)
compared with previous EUV observations made during low mass accretion states.
The EUV and IR photometric observations are shown to have a similar appearance
as a function o f orbital phase. The EUV photometry shows rapid changes and
provides evidence for mass accretion via blobs. The high state IR light curves
present an asymmetric double-humped shape with J=14.8 and K=14.1. We applied an
ellipsoidal model fit to the observations and the result indicates that the
cause of the modulated shape is both due to ellipsoidal variations from the
Roche Lobe filling secondary star and a complex flux combination probably
dominated at all orbital phases by cyclotron emission. The source of maximum
cyclotron emission appears to be in the accretion column high above the white
dwarf surface.
