The Manickam-Miklos-Singhi Conjecture states that when n is at least 4k,
every multiset of n real numbers with nonnegative total sum has at least (n-1
choose k-1) k-subsets with nonnegative sum. We develop a branch-and-cut
strategy using a linear programming formulation to show that verifying the
conjecture for fixed values of k is a finite problem. To improve our search, we
develop a zero-error randomized propagation algorithm. Using implementations of
these algorithms, we verify a stronger form of the conjecture for all k at most
seven.
