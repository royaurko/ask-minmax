One-loop amplitudes of gluons in supersymmetric Yang-Mills are
four-dimensional cut-constructible. This means that they can be determined from
their unitarity cuts. We present a new systematic procedure to explicitly carry
out any finite unitarity cut integral. The procedure naturally separates the
contributions from bubble, triangle and box scalar integrals. This technique
allows the systematic calculation of N=1 amplitudes of gluons. As an
application we compute all next-to-MHV six-gluon amplitudes in N=1
super-Yang-Mills.
