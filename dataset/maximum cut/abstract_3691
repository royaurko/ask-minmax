Let $\alpha_k(\lambda)$ denote the number of $k$-hooks in a partition
$\lambda$ and let $b(n,k)$ be the maximum value of $\alpha_k(\lambda)$ among
partitions of $n$. Amdeberhan posed a conjecture on the generating function of
$b(n,1)$. We give a proof of this conjecture. In general, we obtain a formula
that can be used to determine $b(n,k)$. This leads to a generating function
formula for $b(n,k)$. We introduce the notion of nearly $k$-triangular
partitions. We show that for any $n$, there is a nearly $k$-triangular
partition which can be transformed into a partition of $n$ that attains the
maximum number of $k$-hooks. The operations for the transformation enable us to
compute the number $b(n,k)$.
