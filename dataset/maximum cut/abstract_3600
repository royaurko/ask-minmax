In the present paper, the recent applications of optical parametric
amplifiers (OPAs) in hybrid wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)/time
division multiplexing (TDM) local area passive optical networks have been
modeled and parametrically investigated over wide range of the affecting
parameters. Moreover, we have analyzed the ability of the hybrid WDM/TDM
Passive optical networks to handle a triple play solution, offering voice,
video, and data services to the multiple users. Finally, we have investigated
the maximum time division multiplexing (MTDM) bit rates for optical network
units (ONUs) for maximum number of supported users with optical parametric
amplifier technique across the single mode fiber (SMF) or highly nonlinear
fiber (HNLF) cables to achieve both maximum network reach and quality of
service (QOS).
