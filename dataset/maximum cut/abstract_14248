Debris discs are known to exist around many planet-host stars, but no debris
dust has been found so far in systems with transiting planets. Using publicly
available catalogues, we searched for infrared excesses in such systems. In the
recently published Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalogue, we
found 52 stars with transiting planets. Two systems with one transiting "hot
Jupiter" each, TrES-2 and XO-5, exhibit small excesses both at 12 and 22
microns at a > 3 sigma level. Provided that one or both of these detections are
real, the frequency of warm excesses in systems with transiting planets of 2-4
% is comparable to that around solar-type stars probed at similar wavelengths
with Spitzer's MIPS and IRS instruments. Modelling suggests that the observed
excesses would stem from dust rings with radii of several AU. The inferred
amount of dust is close to the maximum expected theoretically from a
collisional cascade in asteroid belt analogues. If confirmed, the presence of
debris discs in systems with transiting planets may put important constraints
onto formation and migration scenarios of hot Jupiters.
