The new generation of lithography tools use high energy EUV radiation which
ionizes the present background gas due to photoionization. To predict and
understand the long term impact on the highly delicate mirrors It is essential
to characterize these kinds of EUV-induced plasmas. We measured the electron
density evolution in argon gas during and just after irradiation by a short
pulse of EUV light at 13.5 nm by applying microwave cavity resonance
spectroscopy. Dependencies on EUV pulse energy and gas pressure have been
explored over a range relevant for industrial applications.
  Our experimental results show that the maximum reached electron density
depends linearly on pulse energy. A quadratic dependence - caused by
photoionization and subsequent electron impact ionization by free electrons -
is found from experiments where the gas pressure is varied. This is
demonstrated by our theoretical estimates presented in this manuscript as well.
