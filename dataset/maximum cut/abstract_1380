In the cutting process, machine-tools vibrations are generally a real problem
when the amplitude crosses the limits of dimensional or surface quality
workpiece precision required. It is necessary to develop models taking into
account the three-dimensional vibratory approach to control the vibrations
phenomena. An experimental study has been realized to understand the behavior
of the cutting system and to identify its vibrations properties. The
displacement's localization of the tool in a spatial plan, showed by the
experimental results, allows us to simplify the three-dimensional dynamical
model. In this study, the experimental approach is completely presented and the
first points of the three dimensional vibratory model are proposed according to
the experimental results.
