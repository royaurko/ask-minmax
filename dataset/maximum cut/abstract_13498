Context: The detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background may be
imminent, but theoretical predictions are affected by substantial
uncertainties. AIMS. We calculate the signal and its uncertainty with the
present configuration of Super-Kamiokande and consider the possibility of
lowering the threshold by means of gadolinium loading. Methods: We model
neutrino emission following the analysis of SN1987A by Pagliaroli and
collaborators 2009 and use the number of expected events in the neutrino
detector as a free parameter of the fit. The best-fit value of this parameter
and its error are evaluated by means of standard maximum likelihood procedures,
taking into account properly the correlations. Results: The uncertainties in
the astrophysics of the emission dominates the total uncertainty in the
expected signal rate, which conservatively ranges from 0.3 to 0.9 events per
year and from 1.1 to 2.9 with gadolinium.
