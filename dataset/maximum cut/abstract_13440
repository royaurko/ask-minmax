Radiation reaction (RR) effects on the acceleration of a thin plasma foil by
a superintense laser pulse in the radiation pressure dominated regime are
investigated theoretically. A simple suitable approximation of the
Landau-Lifshitz equation for the RR force and a novel leapfrog pusher for its
inclusion in particle-in-cell simulations are provided. Simulations for both
linear and circular polarization of the laser pulse are performed and compared.
It is found that at intensities exceeding $10^{23} \Wcm$ the radiation reaction
force strongly affects the dynamics for a linearly polarized laser pulse,
reducing the maximum ion energy but also the width of the spectrum. In
contrast, no significant effect is found for circularly polarized laser pulses
whenever the laser pulse does not break through the foil.
