This paper is about vector autoregressive-moving average (VARMA) models with
time-dependent coefficients to represent non-stationary time series. Contrarily
to other papers in the univariate case, the coefficients depend on time but not
on the length of the series $n$. Under appropriate assumptions, it is shown
that a Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimator is almost surely consistent
and asymptotically normal. The theoretical results are illustrated by means of
two examples of bivariate processes. It is shown that the assumptions
underlying the theoretical results apply. In the second example the innovations
are also marginally heteroscedastic with a correlation ranging from -0.8 to
0.8. In the two examples, the asymptotic information matrix is obtained in the
Gaussian case. Finally, the finite-sample behaviour is checked via a Monte
Carlo simulation study for $n$ going from 25 to 400. The results confirm the
validity of the asymptotic properties even for short series and reveal that the
asymptotic information matrix deduced from the theory is correct.
