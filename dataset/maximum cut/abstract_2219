We consider the resonant production of charged sleptons at the LHC via
R-parity violation followed by gauge decays to a charged lepton and a
neutralino which then decays via R-parity violation. This gives a signature of
two like-sign charged leptons. In the simulation we include the full
hadronisation via Monte Carlo programs. We find a background, after cuts, of
5.1+/-2.5 events for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb^-1. A preliminary study
of the signal suggests that couplings of 2.10^-3 for a smuon mass of 223 GeV
and smuon masses of up to 540 GeV for couplings of 10^-2 can be probed.
