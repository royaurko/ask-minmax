Boson-boson scattering and Higgs production in boson-boson fusion hold the
key to electroweak symmetry breaking. In order to analyze these essential
features of the Standard Model we have performed a partonic level study of all
processes $q_1 q_2 \to q_3 q_4 q_5 q_6 l \nu$ at the LHC using the exact matrix
elements at $\O(\alpha_{em}^6)$ provided by \Phase, a new MC generator. These
processes include also three boson production and the purely electroweak
contribution to \toptop production as well as all irreducible backgrounds.
Kinematical cuts have been studied in order to enhance the VV scattering signal
over background. \Phase has been compared with different Monte Carlo's showing
that a complete calculation is necessary for a correct description of the
process.
