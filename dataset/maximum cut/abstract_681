We study the effect of a cut-off on the speed of pulled fronts of the one
dimensional reaction diffusion equation. We prove rigorous upper and lower
bounds on the speed in terms of the cut-off parameter epsilon. From these
bounds we estimate the range of validity of the Brunet--Derrida formula for a
general class of reaction terms.
