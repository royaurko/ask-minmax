Observing and controlling complex networks are of paramount interest for
understanding complex physical, biological and technological systems. Recent
studies have made important advances in identifying sensor or driver nodes,
through which we can observe or control a complex system. Yet, the observation
uncertainty induced by measurement noise and the energy cost required for
control continue to be significant challenges in practical applications. Here
we show that the control energy cost and the observation uncertainty vary
widely in different directions of the state space. In particular, we find that
if all nodes are directly driven, control is energetically feasible, as the
maximum energy cost increases sublinearly with the system size. If, however, we
aim to control a system by driving only a single node, control in some
directions is energetically prohibitive, increasing exponentially with the
system size. For the cases in between, the maximum energy decays exponentially
if we increase the number of driver nodes. We validate our findings in both
model systems and real networks. Our results provide fundamental laws that
deepen our understanding of diverse complex systems.
