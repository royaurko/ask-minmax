The decay process sigma to 2 pions at high temperature and density and its
relation with chiral phase transition are discussed in the framework of the NJL
model. The decay rate for the process sigma to 2 pions is calculated in the
whole temperature and density region. The contribution of the final state pion
statistics to the decay rate is discussed. The maximum decay rate at different
chemical potential is computed. Finally, we investigate the relation between
the starting point of the decay process and the critical point of the
first-order chiral phase transition.
