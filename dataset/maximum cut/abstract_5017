We study the capacity of the full-duplex bidirectional (or two-way) relay
channel with two nodes and one relay. The channels in the forward direction are
assumed to be different (in general) than the channels in the backward
direction, i.e. channel reciprocity is not assumed. We use the recently
proposed deterministic approach to capture the essence of the problem and to
determine a good transmission and relay strategy for the Gaussian channel.
Depending on the ratio of the individual channel gains, we propose to use
either a simple amplify-and-forward or a particular superposition coding
strategy at the relay. We analyze the achievable rate region and show that the
scheme achieves to within 3 bits the cut-set bound for all values of channel
gains.
