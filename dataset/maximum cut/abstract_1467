Starting from the universal entropy bounds suggested by Bekenstein and
Susskind and applying them to the black-body radiation situation, we get a
cut-off of space $ \Delta x \geq \chi l_{\mathrm{P}}$ with $\chi \geq 0.1$. We
go further to get a cut-off of time $ \Delta t \geq \chi l_{\mathrm{P}}/c $,
thus, the discrete space-time structure is obtained. With the discrete
space-time, we can explain the uncertainty principle. Based on the hypothesis
of information theory and the entropy of black holes, we get the precise value
of the parameter $\chi$ and demonstrate the reason why the entropy bounds hold.
