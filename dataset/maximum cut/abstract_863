We propose an adaptive version of the total variation algorithm proposed in
[3] for computing the balanced cut of a graph. The algorithm from [3] used a
sequence of inner total variation minimizations to guarantee descent of the
balanced cut energy as well as convergence of the algorithm. In practice the
total variation minimization step is never solved exactly. Instead, an accuracy
parameter is specified and the total variation minimization terminates once
this level of accuracy is reached. The choice of this parameter can vastly
impact both the computational time of the overall algorithm as well as the
accuracy of the result. Moreover, since the total variation minimization step
is not solved exactly, the algorithm is not guarantied to be monotonic. In the
present work we introduce a new adaptive stopping condition for the total
variation minimization that guarantees monotonicity. This results in an
algorithm that is actually monotonic in practice and is also significantly
faster than previous, non-adaptive algorithms.
