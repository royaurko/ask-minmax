Within the task of collaborative filtering two challenges for computing
conditional probabilities exist. First, the amount of training data available
is typically sparse with respect to the size of the domain. Thus, support for
higher-order interactions is generally not present. Second, the variables that
we are conditioning upon vary for each query. That is, users label different
variables during each query. For this reason, there is no consistent input to
output mapping. To address these problems we purpose a maximum entropy approach
using a non-standard measure of entropy. This approach can be simplified to
solving a set of linear equations that can be efficiently solved.
