We report on the fabrication and room temperature measurements of a high
frequency electrical signal detector. The device is based on the ballistic
transport in graphene to detect a high frequency signal. The observed response
is linear in the considered power range (-40dBm - 0dBm) and exhibits a
sensitivity as high as 10 Volts/Watt. Finally the device detected signals up to
50GHz with a maximum response at 10GHz. This device outperforms any previously
reported carbon based detectors in frequency response and compares to current
state of the art Schottky based detectors in dynamic range.
