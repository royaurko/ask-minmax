By performing estimates on the integral of the absolute value of vorticity
along a local vortex line segment, we establish a relatively sharp dynamic
growth estimate of maximum vorticity under some assumptions on the local
geometric regularity of the vorticity vector. Our analysis applies to both the
3D incompressible Euler equations and the surface quasi-geostrophic model
(SQG). As an application of our vorticity growth estimate, we apply our result
to the 3D Euler equation with the two anti-parallel vortex tubes initial data
considered by Hou-Li. Under some additional assumption on the vorticity field,
which seems to be consistent with the computational results of Hou-Li, we show
that the maximum vorticity can not grow faster than double exponential in time.
Our analysis extends the earlier results by Cordoba-Fefferman and Deng-Hou-Yu.
