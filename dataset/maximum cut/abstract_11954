We present measurements of the transport properties of hybrid structures
consisting of a Kondo AuFe film and a superconducting Al film. The temperature
dependence of the resistance indicates the existence of the superconducting
proximity effect in the Kondo AuFe wires over the range of $\sim0.5$ $\mu$m.
Electronic phase coherence in the Kondo AuFe wires has been confirmed by
observing the Aharanov-Bohm effect in the magnetoresistance of the loop
structure. The amplitude of the magnetoresistance oscillations shows a
reentrant behavior with a maximum at $\sim$ 870 mK, which results from an
interplay between the Kondo effect and the superconducting proximity effect.
