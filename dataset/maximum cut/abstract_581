It has been recently claimed that the Inverse Amplitude Method provides a
reliable unitarisation of Chiral Perturbation Theory allowing resonance poles
to be accurately uncovered. We illustrate the sensitivity of these claims to
the treatment of the Adler zero and to assumptions about the left hand cut (and
hence about the underlying exchange forces). Previously favoured methods are
shown to mistreat the Adler zeros and violate crossing symmetry casting doubt
on the precision of their phenomenology. A more reliable solution is proposed.
