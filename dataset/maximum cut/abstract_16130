The appearance and disappearance of collimated bipolar jets in the symbiotic
star Hen 3-1341 is reported and investigated. From modeling of the emission
line spectrum it turns out that the accreting white dwarf in quiescence has
T_WD ~ 1.2 10(5) K and R_WD ~ 0.14 Rsun, for a luminosity of 3.8 10(3) Lsun,
and it is stably burning hydrogen on the surface at a rate of 5 10(-8) Msun/yr,
feeding ionizing photons to a radiation bounded circumstellar nebula extending
for ~ 17 AU. The WD underwent a multi-maxima outburst lasting from 1998 to 2004
during which its H-burning envelope reacted to a probable small increase in the
mass accretion by expanding and cooling to T_eff ~ 1 10(4) K and R ~ 20 Rsun,
mimicking an A-type giant that radiated a total of 6 10(44) erg during the
outburst, at an average rate of 1 10(3) Lsun. Bipolar jets developed at the
time of outburst maximum and their strength declined in parallel with the
demise of a fast wind from the WD, finally disappearing when the wind stopped
halfway to quiescence, marking a 1:1 correspondence between jets presence and
feeding action of the fast wind. The total mass in the jets was M_jet ~ 2.5
10(-7) Msun for a kinetic energy of E_jet ~ 1.7 10(42)/(sin i) erg,
corresponding to 0.3/(sin i) percent of the energy radiated during the whole
outburst.
