We present XMM-Newton observations of NCG891, a nearby edge-on spiral galaxy.
We analyse the extent of the diffuse emission emitted from the disk of the
galaxy, and find that it has a single temperature profile with best fitting
temperature of 0.26 keV, though the fit of a dual-temperature plasma with
temperatures of 0.08 and 0.30 keV is also an acceptable fit. There is a
considerable amount of diffuse X-ray emission protruding from the disk in the
NW direction out to approximately 6 kpc. We analyse the point source population
using a Chandra observation, using a maximum likelihood method to find that the
slope of the cumulative luminosity function of point sources in the galaxy is
-0.77^{+0.13}_{-0.1}. Using a sample of other local galaxies, we compare the
X-ray and infrared properties of NGC891 with those of 'normal' and starburst
spiral galaxies, and conclude that NGC891 is most likely a starburst galaxy in
a quiescent state. We establish that the diffuse X-ray luminosity of spirals
scales with the far infra-red luminosity as L_X \propto L_FIR ^{0.87 +- 0.07},
except for extreme starbursts, and NGC891 does not fall in the latter category.
We study the supernova SN1986J in both XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, and
find that the X-ray luminosity has been declining with time more steeply than
expected (L_X \propto t^-3).
