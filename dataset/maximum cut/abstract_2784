In this paper we present tableau proof systems for various justification
logics. We establish that the tableau systems are sound and complete with
respect to Mkrtychev models. We show the subformula property for our tableaux,
and prove the decidability of justification logics with finite constant
specifications. Also sequent calculi with analytic cuts are introduced and the
subformula property are shown.
