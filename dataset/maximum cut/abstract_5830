The maximum entropy principle from statistical mechanics states that a closed
system attains an equilibrium distribution that maximizes its entropy. We first
show that for graphs with fixed number of edges one can define a stochastic
edge dynamic that can serve as an effective thermalization scheme, and hence,
the underlying graphs are expected to attain their maximum-entropy states,
which turn out to be Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graphs. We next show that (i) a
rate-equation based analysis of node degree distribution does indeed confirm
the maximum-entropy principle, and (ii) the edge dynamic can be effectively
implemented using short random walks on the underlying graphs, leading to a
local algorithm for the generation of ER random graphs. The resulting
statistical mechanical system can be adapted to provide a distributed and local
(i.e., without any centralized monitoring) mechanism for load balancing, which
can have a significant impact in increasing the efficiency and utilization of
both the Internet (e.g., efficient web mirroring), and large-scale computing
infrastructure (e.g., cluster and grid computing).
