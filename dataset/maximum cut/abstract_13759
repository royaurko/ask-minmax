The quark gluon plasma (QGP) at zero temperature and high baryon number is a
system that may be present inside compact stars. It is quite possible that this
cold QGP shares some relevant features with the hot QGP observed in heavy ion
collisions, being also a strongly interacting system. In a previous work we
have derived from the QCD Lagrangian an equation of state (EOS) for the cold
QGP, which can be considered an improved version of the MIT bag model EOS.
Compared to the latter, our equation of state reaches higher values of the
pressure at comparable baryon densities. This feature is due to perturbative
corrections and also to non-perturbative effects. Here we apply this EOS to the
study of neutron stars, discussing the absolute stability of quark matter and
computing the mass-radius relation for self-bound (strange) stars. The maximum
masses of the sequences exceed two solar masses, in agreement with the recently
measured values of the mass of the pulsar PSR J1614-2230, and the corresponding
radii around 10-11 km.
