We study the response of an attractor neural network, in the ferromagnetic
phase, to an external, time-dependent stimulus, which drives the system
periodically two different attractors. We demonstrate a non-trivial dependance
of the system via a system size resonance, by showing a signal amplification
maximum at a certain finite size.
