Beyond convergence studies and comparison of different codes, there are
essentially no controls on the accuracy in the non-linear regime of
cosmological N body simulations, even in the dissipationless limit. We propose
and explore here a simple test which has not been previously employed: when
cosmological codes are used to simulate an isolated overdensity, they should
reproduce, in physical coordinates, those obtained in open boundary conditions
without expansion. In particular, the desired collisionless nature of the
simulations can be probed by testing for stability in physical coordinates of
virialized equilibria. We investigate and illustrate the test using a suite of
simulations in an Einstein de Sitter cosmology from initial conditions which
rapidly settle to virial equilibrium. We find that the criterion of stable
clustering allows one to determine, for given particle number N in the "halo"
and force smoothing, a maximum red-shift range over which the collisionless
limit may be represented with desired accuracy. We also compare our results to
the so-called Layzer Irvine test, showing that it provides a weaker, but very
useful, tool to constrain the choice of numerical parameters. Finally we
outline in some detail how these methods could be employed to test the choice
of the numerical parameters used in a cosmological simulation.
