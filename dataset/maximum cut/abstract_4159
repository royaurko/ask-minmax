The thermodynamics of the SU(3) gauge theory has been analyzed with tree
level and tadpole improved Symanzik actions. A comparison with the continuum
extrapolated results for the standard Wilson action shows that improved actions
lead to a drastic reduction of finite cut-off effects already on lattices with
temporal extent $N_\tau=4$. Results for the pressure, the critical temperature,
surface tension and latent heat are presented. First results for the
thermodynamics of four-flavour QCD with an improved staggered action are also
presented. They indicate similarly large improvement factors for bulk
thermodynamics.
