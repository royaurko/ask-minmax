We study MHV amplitude for the 2 -> 5 scattering in the multi-Regge
kinematics. The Mandelstam cut correction to the BDS amplitude is calculated in
the leading logarithmic approximation (LLA) and the corresponding remainder
function is given to any loop order in a closed integral form. We show that the
LLA remainder function at two loops for 2 -> 5 amplitude can be written as a
sum of two 2 -> 4 remainder functions due to recursive properties of the
leading order impact factors. We also make some generalizations for the MHV
amplitudes with more external particles. The results of the present study are
in agreement with all leg two loop symbol derived by Caron-Huot as shown in a
parallel paper of one of the contributors with collaborators.
