Assuming that the neutrino mass matrix is diagonalized by the TBM, we looked
for the charged lepton mass matrix textures which render a lepton mixing matrix
consistent with data. We were interested in the textures with the maximum
number of zeros, so, we explored the cases of real matrices with three (and
also four zeros) and found which of them provide solutions in agreement with
data. We present the successful Yukawa textures and obtained the relative sizes
of their non-zero entries. We found some interesting relations among the
entries of these textures in terms of the charged lepton masses.
