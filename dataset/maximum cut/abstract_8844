We theoretically study reflection of light by a phase-conjugating mirror
preceded by a partially reflecting normal mirror. The presence of a suitably
chosen normal mirror in front of the phase conjugator is found to greatly
enhance the total phase-conjugate reflected power, even up to an order of
magnitude. Required conditions are that the phase-conjugating mirror itself
amplifies upon reflection and that constructive interference of light in the
region between the mirrors takes place. We show that the phase-conjugate
reflected power then exhibits a maximum as a function of the transmittance of
the normal mirror.
