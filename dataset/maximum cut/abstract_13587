We report observation of crystallization of the glass-forming binary
Lennard-Jones liquid first used by Wahnstr\"om [G. Wahnstr\"om, Phys. Rev. A
44, 3752 (1991)]. Molecular dynamics simulations of the metastable liquid on a
timescale of microseconds were performed. The liquid crystallized
spontaneously. The crystal structure was identified as MgZn_2. Formation of
transient crystallites is observed in the liquid. The crystallization is
investigate at different temperatures and compositions. At high temperature the
rate of crystallite formation is the limiting factor, while at low temperature
the limiting factor is growth rate. The melting temperature of the crystal is
estimated to be T_m=0.93 at rho=0.82. The maximum crystallization rate of the
A_2B composition is T=0.60+/-0.02.
