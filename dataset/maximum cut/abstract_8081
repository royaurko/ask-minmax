The purpose of this paper is to study the smoothing properties (in $L^p$
Sobolev spaces) of operators of the form $f\mapsto \psi(x) \int f(\gamma_t(x))
K(t)\: dt$, where $\gamma_t(x)$ is a $C^\infty$ function defined on a
neighborhood of the origin in $(t,x)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times \mathbb{R}^n$,
satisfying $\gamma_0(x)\equiv x$, $\psi$ is a $C^\infty$ cut-off function
supported on a small neighborhood of $0\in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $K$ is a
"multi-parameter fractional kernel" supported on a small neighborhood of $0\in
\mathbb{R}^N$. When $K$ is a Calder\'on-Zygmund kernel these operators were
studied by Christ, Nagel, Stein, and Wainger, and when $K$ is a multi-parameter
singular kernel they were studied by the contributor and Stein. In both of these
situations, conditions on $\gamma$ were given under which the above operator is
bounded on $L^p$ ($1<p<\infty$). Under these same conditions, we introduce
non-isotropic $L^p$ Sobolev spaces associated to $\gamma$. Furthermore, when
$K$ is a fractional kernel which is smoothing of an order which is close to $0$
(i.e., very close to a singular kernel) we prove mapping properties of the
above operators on these non-isotropic Sobolev spaces. As a corollary, under
the conditions introduced on $\gamma$ by Christ, Nagel, Stein, and Wainger, we
prove optimal smoothing properties in isotropic $L^p$ Sobolev spaces for the
above operator when $K$ is a fractional kernel which is smoothing of very low
order.
