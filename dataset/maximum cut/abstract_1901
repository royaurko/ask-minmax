We have investigated adsorption of Na and Ca on graphene with divacancy (DV)
and Stone-Wales (SW) defect. Our results show that adsorption is not possible
on pristine graphene. However, their adsorption on defective sheet is
energetically favorable. The enhanced adsorption can be attributed to the
increased charge transfer between adatoms and underlying defective sheet. With
the increase in defect density until certain possible limit, maximum percentage
of adsorption also increases giving higher battery capacity. For maximum
possible DV defect, we can achieve maximum capacity of 1459 mAh/g for Na-ion
batteries (NIBs) and 2900 mAh/g for Ca-ion batteries (CIBs). For graphene full
of SW defect, we find the maximum capacity of NIBs and CIBs is around 1071
mAh/g and 2142 mAh/g respectively. Our results will help create better anode
materials with much higher capacity and better cycling performance for NIBs and
CIBs.
