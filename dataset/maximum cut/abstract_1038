Gravito-acoustic modes in the Sun and other stars propagate in resonant
cavities with a frequency below a given limit known as the cut-off frequency.
At higher frequencies, waves are no longer trapped in the stellar interior and
become traveller waves. In this article we study six pulsating solar-like stars
at different evolutionary stages observed by the NASA Kepler mission. These
high signal-to-noise targets show a peak structure that extends at very high
frequencies and are good candidates for studying the transition region between
the modes and the interference peaks or pseudo-modes. Following the same
methodology successfully applied on Sun-as-a-star measurements, we uncover the
existence of pseudo-modes in these stars with one or two dominant interference
patterns depending on the evolutionary stage of the star. We also infer their
cut-off frequency as the midpoint between the last eigenmode and the first peak
of the interference patterns. By using ray theory we show that, while the
period of one of the interference pattern is very close to half the large
separation the other, one depends on the time phase of mixed waves, thus
carrying additional information on the stellar structure and evolution.
