It is shown that a strong intraplanar incoherent scattering can effectively
block the interplanar coherent tunneling between the weakly coupled planes of
the highly anisotropic but clean (intrinsic) materials such as the optimally
doped high-T_c layered cuprate superconductors. The calculated normal-state
C-axis resistivity \rho_c(T) then follows the metal-like temperature dependence
of the ab-plane resistivity \rho_{ab}(T) at high temperatures. At low enough
temperatures, however, \rho_c(T) exhibits a non-metal like upturn even as
\rho_{ab}(T) remains metallic. Moreover, in the metallic regime, \rho_c(T) is
not limited by the maximum metallic resistivity of Mott-Ioffe-Regel. This
correlation between the intrinsic \rho_c(T) and \rho_{ab}(T) is observed in the
normal state of the high-T_c stoichiometric cuprates.
