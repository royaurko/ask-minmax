We extend the notion of a star unfolding to be based on a simple
quasigeodesic loop Q rather than on a point. This gives a new general method to
unfold the surface of any convex polyhedron P to a simple, planar polygon:
shortest paths from all vertices of P to Q are cut, and all but one segment of
Q is cut.
