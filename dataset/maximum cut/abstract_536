We investigate the viability of observing charged Higgs bosons (H^+/-)
produced in association with W bosons at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, using
the leptonic decay H^+ -> tau^+ nu_tau and hadronic W-decay, within different
scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with both real
and complex parameters. Performing a parton level study we show how the
irreducible Standard Model background from W+2 jets can be controlled by
applying appropriate cuts and find that the size of a possible signal depends
on the cuts needed to suppress QCD backgrounds and misidentifications. In the
standard maximal mixing scenario of the MSSM we find a viable signal for large
tan(beta) and intermediate H^+/- masses (~m_t) when using optimistic cuts
whereas for more pessimistic ones we only find a viable signal for very large
tan(beta) (>~50). We have also investigated a special class of MSSM scenarios
with large mass-splittings among the heavy Higgs bosons where the cross-section
can be resonantly enhanced by factors up to one hundred, with a strong
dependence on the CP-violating phases. Even so we find that the signal after
cuts remains small except for small masses (~< m_t) with optimistic cuts.
Finally, in all the scenarios we have investigated we have only found small
CP-asymmetries.
