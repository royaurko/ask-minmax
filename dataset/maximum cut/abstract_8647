We present preliminary results from the first attempt to reconstruct the
spectral function in the nucleon and $\Delta$ channels from lattice QCD data
using the maximum entropy method (MEM). An advantage of the MEM analysis is to
enable us to access information of the excited state spectrum. Performing
simulations on two lattice volumes, we confirm the large finite size effect on
the first excited nucleon state in the lighter quark mass region.
