The study presents an analytic solution of the Balitsky-Kovchegov~(BK)
equation in a particular kinematics. The solution is written in the momentum
space and based on the eigenfunctions of the truncated
Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov~(BFKL) equation in the gauge adjoint
representation, which was used for calculation of the Regge~(Mandelstam) cut
contribution to the planar helicity amplitudes. We introduce an eigenfunction
of the singlet BFKL equation constructed of the adjoint eigenfunction
multiplied by a factor, which restores the dual conformal symmetry present in
the adjoint and broken in the singlet BFKL equations.
  The proposed analytic BK solution correctly reproduces the initial condition
and the high energy asymptotics of the scattering amplitude.
