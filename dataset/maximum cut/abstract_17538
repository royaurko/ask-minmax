Recent investigations revealed very peculiar properties of blue horizontal
branch (HB) stars in \omega Centauri, which show anomalously low surface
gravity and mass compared to other clusters and to theoretical models. \omega
Centauri, however, is a very unusual object, hosting a complex mix of multiple
stellar populations with different metallicity and chemical abundances. We
measured the fundamental parameters (temperature, gravity, and surface helium
abundance) of a sample of 71 blue HB stars in M22, with the aim of clarifying
if the peculiar results found in \omega Cen are unique to this cluster. M22
also hosts multiple sub-populations of stars with a spread in metallicity,
analogous to \omega Cen. The stellar parameters were measured on low-resolution
spectra fitting the Balmer and helium lines with a grid of synthetic spectra.
From these parameters, the mass and reddening were estimated. Our results on
the gravities and masses agree well with theoretical expectations, matching the
previous measurements in three "normal" clusters. The anomalies found in \omega
Cen are not observed among our stars. A mild mass underestimate is found for
stars hotter than 14\,000 K, but an exact analogy with \omega Cen cannot be
drawn. We measured the reddening in the direction of M22 with two independent
methods, finding E(B-V)=0.35 \pm 0.02 mag, with semi-amplitude of the maximum
variation \Delta(E(B-V))=0.06 mag, and an rms intrinsic dispersion of
\sigma(E(B-V))=0.03 mag.
