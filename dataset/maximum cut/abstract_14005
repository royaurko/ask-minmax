We prove that the Bounded Occurrence Ordering k-CSP Problem is not
approximation resistant. We give a very simple local search algorithm that
always performs better than the random assignment algorithm. Specifically, the
expected value of the solution returned by the algorithm is at least Alg > Avg
+ a(B,k) (Opt - Avg), where "Opt" is the value of the optimal solution; "Avg"
is the expected value of the random solution; and a(B,k)=Omega_k(B^{-(k+O(1))}
is a parameter depending only on "k" (the arity of the CSP) and "B" (the
maximum number of times each variable is used in constraints). The question
whether bounded occurrence ordering k-CSPs are approximation resistant was
raised by Guruswami and Zhou (APPROX 2012) who recently showed that bounded
occurrence 3-CSPs and "monotone" k-CSPs admit a non-trivial approximation.
