We present optical and/or infrared photometry of the Type Ia supernovae SN
1991T, SN 1991bg, SN 1999ek, SN 2001bt, SN 2001cn, SN 2001cz, and SN 2002bo.
All but one of these supernovae have decline rate parameters Delta m_15(B)
close to the median value of 1.1 for the whole class of Type Ia supernovae. The
addition of these supernovae to the relationship between the near-infrared
absolute magnitudes and Delta m_15(B) strengthens the previous relationships we
have found, in that the maximum light absolute magnitudes are essentially
independent of the decline rate parameter. (SN 1991bg, the prototype of the
subclass of fast declining Type Ia supernovae, is a special case.) The
dispersion in the Hubble diagram in JHK is only ~0.15 mag. The near-infrared
properties of Type Ia supernovae continue to be excellent measures of the
luminosity distances to the supernova host galaxies, due to the need for only
small corrections from the epoch of observation to maximum light, low
dispersion in absolute magnitudes at maximum light, and the minimal reddening
effects in the near-infrared.
