We perform a simplified analysis of finite temperature properties of the
generalized Falicov-Kimball model with Hund coupling. The model is studied on
the square lattice for fixed values of \emph{f-electron} and \emph{d-electron}
densities $\rho_f=1/2$, $\rho_d=1$. Using an approxiamte scheme we estimated
free energies of the following three phases: the charge and spin ordered (SCO),
the charge ordered (CO) and the non-ordered (NO). Comparing the free energies
we detected phase transitions and found how the transition temperatures depend
on the on-site interaction parameters. It appears, that the transition
temperture between SCO and CO is much lower than between CO and NO, but their
maximum values are attained at values of coupling constants very close to each
other.
