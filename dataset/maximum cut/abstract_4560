A dynamical model for S-- and P--wave correlated $2 \pi$ (and $K \bar K$)
exchange between a kaon and a nucleon is presented, starting from corresponding
$N \bar N \rightarrow K \bar K$ amplitudes in the pseudophysical region, which
have been constructed from nucleon, $\Delta$--isobar and hyperon ($\Lambda$,
$\Sigma$) exchange Born terms and a realistic meson exchange model of the $\pi
\pi \rightarrow K \bar K$ and $K \bar K \rightarrow K \bar K$ amplitude. The
contribution in the s--channel is then obtained by performing a dispersion
relation over the unitarity cut. In the $\rho$--channel, considerable
ambiguities exist, depending on how the dispersion integral is performed. Our
model, supplemented by short range interaction terms, is able to describe
empirical $K^+ N$ data below pion production threshold in a satisfactory way.
