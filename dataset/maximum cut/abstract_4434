We present a `spinon formulation' of the $SU(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten models.
Central to this approach are a set of massless quasi-particles, called
`spinons', which transform in the representation ${\bf \bar{n}}$ of $su(n)$ and
carry fractional statistics of angle $\theta = \pi/n$. Multi-spinon states are
grouped into irreducible representations of the yangian $Y(sl_n)$. We give
explicit results for the $su(n)$ content of these yangian representations and
present $N$-spinon cuts of the WZW character formulas. As a by-product, we
obtain closed expressions for characters of the $su(n)$ Haldane-Shastry spin
chains.
