Let $p$ be an odd prime such that $p \equiv 3\;{\rm mod}\;4$ and $n$ be an
odd integer. In this paper, two new families of $p$-ary sequences of period $N
= \frac{p^n-1}{2}$ are constructed by two decimated $p$-ary m-sequences $m(2t)$
and $m(dt)$, where $d = 4$ and $d = (p^n + 1)/2=N+1$. The upper bound on the
magnitude of correlation values of two sequences in the family is derived using
Weil bound. Their upper bound is derived as $\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}
\sqrt{N+\frac{1}{2}}+\frac{1}{2}$ and the family size is 4N, which is four
times the period of the sequence.
