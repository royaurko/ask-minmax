We calculate parton and generalized parton distributions in Minkowski space
using a scalar propagator with a pair of complex conjugate poles. Correct
spectral and support properties are obtained only after careful analytic
continuation from Euclidean space. Alternately the quark distribution function
can be calculated from modified cutting rules, which put the intermediate state
on its complex mass shells. Distribution functions agree with those resulting
from the model's Euclidean space double distribution which we calculate via
non-diagonal matrix elements of twist-two operators. Thus one can use a wide
class of analytic parameterizations of the quark propagator to connect
Euclidean space Green functions to light-cone dominated amplitudes.
