In this work, we investigate inflationary cosmology using scalar field theory
deformed by the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) containing a linear
momentum term. Apart from being consistent with the existence of a minimum
measurable length scale, this GUP is also consistent with doubly special
relativity and hence with the existence of maximum measurable momentum. We use
this deformed scalar field theory to analyze the tensor and scalar mode
equations in a de Sitter background, and to calculate modifications to the
tensor-to-scalar ratio. Finally, we compare our results for the
tensor-to-scalar ratio with the Planck data to constrain the minimum length
parameter in the GUP.
