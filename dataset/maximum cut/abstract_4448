We give an interpretation to the issue of the chiral determinant in the
heat-kernel approach. The extra dimension (5-th dimension) is interpreted as
(inverse) temperature. The 1+4 dim Dirac equation is naturally derived by the
Wick rotation for the temperature. In order to define a ``good'' temperature,
we choose those solutions of the Dirac equation which propagate in a fixed
direction in the extra coordinate. This choice fixes the regularization of the
fermion determinant. The 1+4 dimensional Dirac mass ($M$) is naturally
introduced and the relation: $|$4 dim electron momentum$|$ $\ll$ $|M|$ $\ll$
ultraviolet cut-off, naturally appears. The chiral anomaly is explicitly
derived for the 2 dim Abelian model. Typically two different regularizations
appear depending on the choice of propagators. One corresponds to the chiral
theory, the other to the non-chiral (hermitian) theory.
