A new approach to search for CP violation in the neutrino sector [1,2] is
proposed by the experiment called DAE{\delta}ALUS (Decay At rest Experiment for
{\delta}cp At Laboratory for Underground Science). DAE{\delta}ALUS needs three
sources of neutrino fluxes, each one located at 1.5, 8 and 20 km from the
underground detector. Here we present the study for a Superconducting Ring
Cyclotron able to accelerate the H2+ molecules and to deliver proton beam with
maximum energy of 800 MeV and the required high power. The magnetic field
produced by the proposed superconducting magnetic sector, simulated by the code
TOSCA, the isochronous magnetic field, some preliminary feature on the beam
dynamic and the magnetic forces acting on the coils are here presented.
