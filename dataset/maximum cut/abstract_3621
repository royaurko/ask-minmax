We study the smoothed log-concave maximum likelihood estimator of a
probability distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$. This is a fully automatic
nonparametric density estimator, obtained as a canonical smoothing of the
log-concave maximum likelihood estimator. We demonstrate its attractive
features both through an analysis of its theoretical properties and a
simulation study. Moreover, we use our methodology to develop a new test of
log-concavity, and show how the estimator can be used as an intermediate stage
of more involved procedures, such as constructing a classifier or estimating a
functional of the density. Here again, the use of these procedures can be
justified both on theoretical grounds and through its finite sample
performance, and we illustrate its use in a breast cancer diagnosis
(classification) problem.
