We present a detailed investigation of the magnetic properties of complex
vanadium phosphates M(VO)2(PO4)2 (M = Ca, Sr) by means of magnetization,
specific heat, 31P NMR measurements, and band structure calculations.
Experimental data evidence the presence of ferro- and antiferromagnetic
interactions in M(VO)2(PO4)2 resulting in a nearly vanishing Curie-Weiss
temperature \theta_{CW} < 1 K that contrasts with the maximum of magnetic
susceptibility at 3 K. Specific heat and NMR measurements also reveal weak
exchange couplings with the thermodynamic energy scale J_c = 10-15 K.
Additionally, the reduced maximum of the magnetic specific heat indicates
strong frustration of the spin system. Band structure calculations show that
the spin systems of the M(VO)2(PO4)2 compounds are essentially
three-dimensional with the frustration caused by competing ferro- and
antiferromagnetic interactions. Both calcium and strontium compounds undergo
antiferromagnetic long-range ordering at T_N = 1.5 K and 1.9 K, respectively.
The spin model reveals an unusual example of controllable frustration in
three-dimensional magnetic systems.
