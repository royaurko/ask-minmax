We study the electronic structures of two single layer superconducting
cuprates, Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Tl2201) and
(Bi$_{1.35}$Pb$_{0.85}$)(Sr$_{1.47}$La$_{0.38}$)CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Bi2201) which
have very different maximum critical temperatures (90K and 35K respectively)
using Angular Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES). We are able to
identify two main differences in their electronic properties. First, the shadow
band that is present in double layer and low T$_{c,max}$ single layer cuprates
is absent in Tl2201. Recent studies have linked the shadow band to structural
distortions in the lattice and the absence of these in Tl2201 may be a
contributing factor in its T$_{c,max}$.Second, Tl2201's Fermi surface (FS)
contains long straight parallel regions near the anti-node, while in Bi2201 the
anti-nodal region is much more rounded. Since the size of the superconducting
gap is largest in the anti-nodal region, differences in the band dispersion at
the anti-node may play a significant role in the pairing and therefore affect
the maximum transition temperature.
