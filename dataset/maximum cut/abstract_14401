This book is organized into six chapters. The first chapter introduces the
basic algebraic structures essential to make this book a self contained one.
Algebraic linear codes and their basic properties are discussed in chapter two.
In chapter three the contributors study the basic properties of erasure decoding in
maximum rank distance codes. Some decoding techniques about MRD codes are
described and discussed in chapter four of this book. Rank distance codes with
complementary duals and MRD codes with complementary duals are introduced and
their applications are discussed. Chapter five introduces the notion of integer
rank distance codes. The final chapter introduces some concatenation
techniques.
