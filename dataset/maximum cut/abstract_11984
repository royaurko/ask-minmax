Fluctuations of the amplitude of the order parameter govern the properties of
superconducting systems close to the critical transition temperature. In the
BCS regime we examine the contribution of these pairing fluctuations to the
superfluid order parameter for harmonically confined atomic Fermi gases. In the
limit of small systems we obtain an expression for the space dependence of the
fluctuations, in good agreement with the results of numerical calculations. In
this limit we also predict a parity effect, i.e. that pairing fluctuations
should show a maximum or a minimum at the centre of the trap, depending on the
value of the last occupied shell being even or odd. We finally propose to
detect pairing fluctuations by measuring the density-density correlation
function as evaluated after a ballistic expansion of the gas.
