A rotationally invariant random interaction ensemble was realized in a
single-j fermion model. The dominance of ground states with zero and maximum
spin was confirmed and explained with a statistical approach based on the
random coupling of individual angular momenta. The interpretation is supported
by the structure of the ground state wave functions.
