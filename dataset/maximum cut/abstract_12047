I present a generalization of the Ehrenfest urn model that is aimed at
simulating the approach to equilibrium in a dilute gas. The present model
differs from the original one in two respects: 1) the two boxes have different
volumes and are divided into identical cells with either multiple or single
occupancy; 2) particles, which carry also a velocity vector, are subjected to
random, but elastic, collisions, both mutual and against the container walls. I
show, both analytically and numerically, that the number and energy of
particles in a given urn evolve eventually to an equilibrium probability
density $W$ which, depending on cell occupancy, is binomial or hypergeometric
in the particle number and beta-like in the energy. Moreover, the Boltzmann
entropy $\ln W$ takes precisely the same form as the thermodynamic entropy of
an ideal gas. This exercise can be useful for pedagogical purposes in that it
provides, although in an extremely simplified case, a probabilistic
justification for the maximum-entropy principle.
