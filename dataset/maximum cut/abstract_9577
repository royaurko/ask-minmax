We demonstrated a 967 nm diode end-pumped Er:GSGG laser operated at 2.794
Micrometer with spectrum width 3.6 nm in the continuous wave(CW) mode. The
maximum output power of 440 mW is obtained at an incident pumping power of 3.4
W, which corresponds to an optical-to-optical efficiency of 13% and slope
efficiency of 13.2%. The results suggest that short cavity and efficient
cooling setup for crystal are advantageous to improve laser performance.
