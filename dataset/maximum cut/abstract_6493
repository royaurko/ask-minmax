We derive the effective Lagrangian for the low-energy massive meson
excitations of the color-flavor-locking (CFL) phase of QCD with 3 flavors of
light quarks. We compute the decay constants, the maximum velocities, and the
masses of the mesons at large baryon chemical potential mu. The decay constants
are linear in mu. The meson maximum velocities are close to that of sound. The
meson masses in the CFL phase are significantly smaller than in the normal QCD
vacuum and depend only on bare quark masses. The order of the meson masses is,
to some extent, reversed compared to that in the QCD vacuum. In particular, the
lightest particle is eta'.
