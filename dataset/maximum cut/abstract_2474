We compute the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to b \to
c l \bar \nu_l decay rate at a fully differential level. Arbitrary cuts on
kinematic variables of the decay products can be imposed. Our computation can
be used to study the NNLO QCD corrections to the total decay rate as well as to
the lepton energy, hadronic invariant mass and hadronic energy moments and to
incorporate those corrections into global fits of inclusive semileptonic
B-decays.
