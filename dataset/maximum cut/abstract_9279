This paper is the second part of a series of two papers dealing with bulking:
a way to define quasi-order on cellular automata by comparing space-time
diagrams up to rescaling. In the present paper, we introduce three notions of
simulation between cellular automata and study the quasi-order structures
induced by these simulation relations on the whole set of cellular automata.
Various aspects of these quasi-orders are considered (induced equivalence
relations, maximum elements, induced orders, etc) providing several formal
tools allowing to classify cellular automata.
