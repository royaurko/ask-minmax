A maximum modulus estimate for the nonstationary Stokes equations in $C^2$
domain is found. The singular part and regular part of Poisson kernel are
analyzed. The singular part consists of the gradient of single layer potential
and the gradient of composite potential defined on only normal component of the
boundary data. Furthermore, the normal velocity near the boundary is bounded if
the boundary data is bounded. If the normal component of the boundary data is
Dini-continuous and the tangential component of the boundary data is bounded,
then the maximum modulus of velocity is bounded in whole domain.
