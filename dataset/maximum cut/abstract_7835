With the increasing concern about global environmental protection and energy
demand due to rapid growth of population in developing countries and the
diminishing trend of resources of conventional grid supply, the need to produce
freely available pollution free natural energy such as solar/wind energy has
been drawing increasing interest in every corner of the world. In an effort to
utilize these energies effectively through Power converter, a great deal of
research is being carried out by different researchers / scientist and
engineers at different places in the world to meet the increasing demand of
load. The study presents methodology to integrate solar (PV) energy (which is
freely available in every corner of the world) with grid source and supplement
the existing grid power in rural houses during its cut off or restricted supply
period. In order to get consistency in supply a DG is also added as a standby
source in the proposed integration of network. The software using novel Direct
PWM modulation strategy and its soft control features extend the flexibility to
control converter (inverter) parameters like voltage, frequency, number of
samples of PWM pulses constituting sine-wave without changing any hardware
configuration in the circuit. The system simulation of PWM Pulse generation has
been done on a XILINX based FPGA Spartan 3E board using VHDL code. The test on
simulation of PWM generation program after synthesis and compilation were
recorded and verified on a prototype sample.
