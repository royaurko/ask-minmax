In this paper, we study infall collapse solutions for star formation in the
small radius limit where the particle orbits become nearly pressure-free. We
generalize previous solutions to simultaneously include the effects of both
radiation pressure and angular momentum. The effects of radiation pressure can
be modeled using a modified potential; for representative cases of such
potentials, we obtain analytical solutions for the density and velocity fields.
In general, radiation pressure limits the maximum mass of a forming star by
reversing the infall when the star becomes sufficiently large. Our results
imply that this maximum mass scale is given by the condition that the
turnaround radius $R_R$ (the radius at which the radiation pressure force
exceeds the gravitational force) exceeds the centrifugal radius $R_C$ (the
angular momentum barrier). The maximum mass scale for a star forming within a
rotating collapse flow with radiation pressure depends on the initial
conditions, but is generally much larger than for the case of spherical infall
considered previously. In particular, stars with masses $M_\ast$ $\sim 100$
$M_\odot$ can form for a fairly wide range of initial conditions.
