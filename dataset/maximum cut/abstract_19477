Detection of the fluctuations in 21 cm line emission from neutral hydrogen
during the Epoch of Reionization in thousand hour integrations poses stringent
requirements on calibration and image quality, both of which necessitate
accurate primary beam models. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) uses phased
array antenna elements which maximize collecting area at the cost of
complexity. To quantify their performance, we have developed a novel beam
measurement system using the 137 MHz ORBCOMM satellite constellation and a
reference dipole antenna. Using power ratio measurements, we measure the {\it
in situ} beampattern of the MWA antenna tile relative to that of the reference
antenna, canceling the variation of satellite flux or polarization with time.
We employ angular averaging to mitigate multipath effects (ground scattering),
and assess environmental systematics with a null experiment in which the MWA
tile is replaced with a second reference dipole. We achieve beam measurements
over 30 dB dynamic range in beam sensitivity over a large field of view (65\%
of the visible sky), far wider and deeper than drift scans through astronomical
sources allow. We verify an analytic model of the MWA tile at this frequency
within a few percent statistical scatter within the full width at half maximum.
Towards the edges of the main lobe and in the sidelobes, we measure tens of
percent systematic deviations. We compare these errors with those expected from
known beamforming errors.
