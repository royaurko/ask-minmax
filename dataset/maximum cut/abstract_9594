Let $S$ be a regular set of $\R^d$ and $X : S\rightarrow \R$ be Gaussian
field with regular paths. In order to give bound to the tail of the
distribution of the maximum, we use the record method of Mercadier. We present
some new form in dimension 2 and extend it to dimension 3 using the result of
the expectation of the absolute value of quadratic forms by Li and Wei.
Comparison with other methods is conducted.
