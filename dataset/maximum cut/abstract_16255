We present the results of a spectral study of the soft X-ray emission
(0.2-2.5 keV) from low-latitude (`disk') regions of Jupiter. The data were
obtained during two observing campaigns with XMM-Newton in April and November
2003. While the level of the emission remained approximately the same between
April and the first half of the November observation, the second part of the
latter shows an enhancement by about 40% in the 0.2-2.5 keV flux. A very
similar, and apparently correlated increase, in time and scale, was observed in
the solar X-ray and EUV flux.
  The months of October and November 2003 saw a period of particularly intense
solar activity, which appears reflected in the behaviour of the soft X-rays
from Jupiter's disk. The X-ray spectra, from the XMM-Newton EPIC CCD cameras,
are all well fitted by a coronal model with temperatures in the range 0.4-0.5
keV, with additional line emission from Mg XI (1.35 keV) and Si XIII (1.86
keV): these are characteristic lines of solar X-ray spectra at maximum activity
and during flares.
  The XMM-Newton observations lend further support to the theory that Jupiter's
disk X-ray emission is controlled by the Sun, and may be produced in large part
by scattering, elastic and fluorescent, of solar X-rays in the upper atmosphere
of the planet.
