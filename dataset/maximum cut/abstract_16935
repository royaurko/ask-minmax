We study nonparametric estimation of the sub-distribution functions for
current status data with competing risks. Our main interest is in the
nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), and for comparison we also
consider a simpler ``naive estimator.'' Both types of estimators were studied
by Jewell, van der Laan and Henneman [Biometrika (2003) 90 183--197], but
little was known about their large sample properties. We have started to fill
this gap, by proving that the estimators are consistent and converge globally
and locally at rate $n^{1/3}$. We also show that this local rate of convergence
is optimal in a minimax sense. The proof of the local rate of convergence of
the MLE uses new methods, and relies on a rate result for the sum of the MLEs
of the sub-distribution functions which holds uniformly on a fixed neighborhood
of a point. Our results are used in Groeneboom, Maathuis and Wellner [Ann.
Statist. (2008) 36 1064--1089] to obtain the local limiting distributions of
the estimators.
