We report on a continuum extrapolation of the vector current correlation
function for light valence quarks in the deconfined phase of quenched QCD. This
is achieved by performing a systematic analysis of the influence of cut-off
effects on light quark meson correlators at $T\simeq 1.45 T_c$ using clover
improved Wilson fermions. We discuss resulting constraints on the electrical
conductivity and the thermal dilepton rate in a quark gluon plasma. In addition
new results at 1.2 and 3.0 $T_c$ will be presented.
