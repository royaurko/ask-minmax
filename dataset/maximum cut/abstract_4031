IVC characteristics as well as their derivatives were recorded for contacts
on the base of CeNiSn, known as Kondo semiconductor, in the metallic and the
tunnelling regime at temperatures between 0.1-8 K and in magnetic fields up to
8 T using mechanically controllable break junctions (MCBJ). It was found that
CeNiSn behaves like a compound with typical metallic properties instead of the
expected semiconducting behaviour. The main spectral feature is a pronounced
zero-bias conductance minimum of about 10 meV width both for metallic and
tunnel regime, which appears to be of magnetic nature. The experiments provide
no clear-cut evidence for an energy (pseudo)gap in this compound.
