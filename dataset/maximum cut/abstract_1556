A method is introduced to isolate and measure the electrical transport
properties of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) aligned on an
ST-cut quartz, from room temperature down to 2 K. The diameter and chirality of
the measured SWNTs are accurately defined from Raman spectroscopy and atomic
force microscopy (AFM). A significant up-shift in the G-band of the resonance
Raman spectra of the SWNTs is observed, which increases with increasing SWNTs
diameter, and indicates a strong interaction with the quartz substrate. A
semiconducting SWNT, with diameter 0.84 nm, shows Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and
Coulomb blockade behaviors at low temperatures. Another semiconducting SWNT,
with a thinner diameter of 0.68 nm, exhibits a transition from the
semiconducting state to an insulating state at low temperatures. These results
elucidate some of the electrical properties of SWNTs in this unique
configuration and help pave the way towards prospective device applications.
