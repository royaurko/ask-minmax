We have succeeded in preparing high-quality Gd-doped single-crystalline EuO
films. Using Eu-distillation-assisted molecular beam epitaxy and a systematic
variation in the Gd and oxygen deposition rates, we have been able to observe
sustained layer-by-layer epitaxial growth on yttria-stabilized cubic zirconia
(001). The presence of Gd helps to stabilize the layer-by-layer growth mode. We
used soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Eu and Gd M4,5 edges to confirm
the absence of Eu3+ contaminants and to determine the actual Gd concentration.
The distillation process ensures the absence of oxygen vacancies in the films.
  From magnetization measurements we found the Curie temperature to increase
smoothly as a function of doping from 70 K up to a maximum of 125 K. A
threshold behavior was not observed for concentrations as low as 0.2%.
