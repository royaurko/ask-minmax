Effect of hydrostatic pressure and magnetic field on electrical resistance of
the Kondo-like perovskite manganese oxide,
La$_{0.1}$Ce$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.5}$MnO$_3$ with a ferrimagnetic ground state, have
been investigated up to 2.1 GPa and 9 T. In this compound, the Mn-moments
undergo double exchange mediated ferromagnetic ordering at $T_{\rm C}$ $\sim$
280 K and there is a resistance maximum, $T_{\rm max}$ at about 130 K which is
correlated with an antiferromagnetic ordering of {\it cerium} with respect to
the Mn-sublattice moments. Under pressure, the $T_{\rm max}$ shifts to lower
temperature at a rate of d$T_{max}$/d$P$ = -162 K/GPa and disappears at a
critical pressure $P_{\rm c}$ $\sim$ 0.9 GPa. Further, the coefficient, $m$ of
$-logT$ term due to Kondo scattering decreases linearly with increase of
pressure showing an inflection point in the vicinity of $P_{\rm c}$. These
results suggest that {\it cerium} undergoes a transition from Ce$^{3+}$ state
to Ce$^{4+}$/Ce$^{3+}$ mixed valence state under pressure. In contrast to
pressure effect, the applied magnetic field shifts $T_{\rm max}$ to higher
temperature presumably due to enhanced ferromagnetic Mn moments.
