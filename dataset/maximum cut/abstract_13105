The low-temperature transport coefficients of the degenerate periodic SU(N)
Anderson model are calculated in the limit of infinite correlation between {\it
f} electrons, within the framework of dynamical mean-field theory. We establish
the Fermi liquid (FL) laws in the clean limit, taking into account the
quasiparticle damping. The latter yields a reduced value of the Lorenz number
in the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results indicate that the renormalization of
the thermal conductivity and of the Seebeck coefficient can lead to a
substantial enhancement of the electronic thermoelectric figure-of-merit at low
temperature.
  Using the FL laws we discuss the low-temperature anomalies that show up in
the electrical resistance of the intermetallic compounds with Cerium and
Ytterbium ions, when studied as a function of pressure.
  Our calculations explain the sharp maximum of the coefficient of the
$T^2$-term of the electrical resistance and the rapid variation of residual
resistance found in a number of Ce and Yb intermetallics at some critical
pressure.
