We study observability of a Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation of a gluon in a
five-dimensional model with a warped geometry at the Large Hadron Collider. In
this model, the Standard Model fields reside in the bulk and the third
generation quarks couple to the KK gluon strongly. We focus on the processes
including three b-quarks as a final state where the first KK gluon propagates
as an intermediate state. We evaluate a significance of those processes by
taking account of kinematical cuts and a detector efficiency at the Large
Hadron Collider and find that the significance is lager than 5-sigma with the
integrated luminosity of 10 (100) fb^{-1} for a certain range of parameters of
the model.
