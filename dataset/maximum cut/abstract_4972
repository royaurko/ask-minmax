We present results from a simulation of SU(2) lattice gauge theory with N_f=4
flavors of Wilson fermion and non-zero quark chemical potential mu, using the
same 12^3x24 lattice, bare gauge coupling, and pion mass in cut-off units as a
previous study with N_f=2. The string tension for N_f=4 is found to be
considerably smaller implying smoother gauge field configurations.
Thermodynamic observables and order parameters for superfluidity and color
deconfinement are studied, and comparisons drawn between the two theories.
Results for quark density and pressure as functions of mu are qualitatively
similar for N_f=2 and N_f=4; in both cases there is evidence for a phase in
which baryonic matter is simultaneously degenerate and confined. Results for
the stress-energy tensor, however, suggest that while N_f=2 has a regime where
dilute matter is non-relativistic and weakly-interacting, N_f=4 matter is
relativistic and strongly-interacting for all values of mu above onset.
