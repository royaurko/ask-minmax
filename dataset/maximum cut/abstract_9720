In this paper we shall illustrate that each polytopal moment-angle complex
can be understood as the intersection of the minima of corresponding Siegel
leaves and the unit sphere, with respect to the maximum norm. Consequently, an
alternative proof of a rigidity theorem of Bosio and Meersseman is obtained; as
piecewise linear manifolds, polytopal real moment-angle complexes can be
smoothed in a natural way.
