BHAGEN-1PH is a FORTRAN program providing fast Monte Carlo event generation
of the process $e^+ e^- \to e^+ e^- \gamma$, within electroweak theory, for
both unpolarized beams and also for the longitudinally polarized electron beam.
The program is designed for final leptons outside a small cone around the
initial leptons direction and has a new algorithm allowing also for a fast
generation of non collinear initial and final emission, as well as for
asymmetric and different angular cuts for final leptons.
