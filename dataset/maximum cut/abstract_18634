We present deep polarimetric observations at 1420 MHz of the European Large
Area ISO Survey North 1 region (ELAIS N1) as part of the Dominion Radio
Astrophysical Observatory Planck Deep Fields project. By combining closely
spaced aperture synthesis fields, we image a region of 7.43 square degrees to a
maximum sensitivity in Stokes Q and U of 78 microJy/beam, and detect 786
compact sources in Stokes I. Of these, 83 exhibit polarized emission. We find
that the differential source counts (log N - log p) for polarized sources are
nearly constant down to p > 500 microJy, and that these faint polarized radio
sources are more highly polarized than the strong source population. The median
fractional polarization is (4.8 +/- 0.7)% for polarized sources with Stokes I
flux density between 1 and 30 mJy; approximately three times larger than
sources with I > 100 mJy. The majority of the polarized sources have been
identified with galaxies in the Spitzer Wide Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey
(SWIRE) image of ELAIS N1. Most of the galaxies occupy regions in the IRAC
5.8/3.6 micron vs. 8.0/4.5 micron color-color diagram associated with dusty
AGNs, or with ellipticals with an aging stellar population. A few host galaxies
have colors that suggests significant PAH emission in the near-infrared. A
small fraction, 12%, of the polarized sources are not detected in the SWIRE
data. None of the polarized sources in our sample appears to be associated with
an actively star-forming galaxy.
