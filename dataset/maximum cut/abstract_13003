Metal/semiconductor hybrids are artificially created structures presenting
novel properties not exhibited by either of the component materials alone. Here
we present a giant piezoresistance effect in a hybrid formed from silicon and
aluminum. The maximum piezoresistive gage factor (GF) of 843, measured at room
temperature, compares with a GF of -93 measured in the bulk homogeneous
silicon. This piezoresistance boost is not due to the silicon/aluminum
interface, but results from a stress induced anisotropy in the silicon
conductivity that acts to switch current away from the highly conductive
aluminum for uniaxial tensile strains. Its magnitude is shown, via the
calculation of hybrid resistivity weighting functions, to depend only on the
geometrical arrangement of the component parts of the hybrid.
