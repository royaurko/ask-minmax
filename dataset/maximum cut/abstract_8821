The $^1S_0$-pairing gap in semi-infinite nuclear matter is evaluated
microscopically using the effective pairing interaction recently found
explicitly in the coordinate representation starting from the separable form of
the Paris NN-potential. Instead of direct iterative solution of the gap
equation, a new method proposed by V.A.Khodel, V.V.Khodel and J.W.Clark was
used which simplifies the procedure significantly. The gap $\Delta$ obtained in
our calculations exibits a strong variation in the surface region with a
pronounced maximum near the surface.
