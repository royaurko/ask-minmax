Let $K_v$ denote the complete graph of order $v$ and $K_v - I$ denote $K_v$
minus a 1-factor. In this article we investigate uniformly resolvable
decompositions of $K_v$ and $K_v-I$ into $r$ classes containing only copies of
$3$-stars and $s$ classes containing only copies of $3$-cycles. We completely
determine the spectrum in the case where the number of resolution classes of
3-stars is maximum.
