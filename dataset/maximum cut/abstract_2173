We have investigated some observable consequences of colour reconnection in
the reaction e+e- -> W+ W- -> q_1 qbar_2 q_3 qbar_4. We use a measure based on
the momentum structure of the event, comparing reconnected events with
`standard' ones. Some different recoupling models are described and studied as
well as simpler toy models to show where the effects are present and what makes
most of them disappear in realistic models. Some attempts are made to introduce
suitable cuts in order to select the interesting events.
