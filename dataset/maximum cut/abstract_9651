Resonant in situ photoemission from Mn 3d states in Ga_{1-x}Mn_{x}As is
reported for Mn concentrations down to very dilute limit of 0.1 at %. The
properties of the peak at the valence-band maximum reveal an effective
interaction between Mn 3d states for concentration as low as 2.5 %.
Concentration-dependent spectral features are analyzed on the basis of
first-principles calculations for systems with selected impurity positions as
well as for random alloys.
