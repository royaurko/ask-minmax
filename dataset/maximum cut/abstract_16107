The photometric and spectroscopic properties of 26 well observed Type Ia
Supernovae (SNeIa) were analyzed with the aim to explore SNIa diversity. The
sample includes (Branch-)normal SNe as well as extreme events like SNe 1991T
and 1991bg, while the truly peculiar SNIa, SN2000cx and SN2002cx are not
included in our sample . A statistical treatment reveals the existence of three
different groups. The first group (FAINT) consists of faint SNeIa similar to
SN1991bg, with low expansion velocities and rapid evolution of SiII velocity. A
second group consists of ``normal'' SNeIa, also with high temporal velocity
gradient (HVG), but with brighter mean absolute magnitude <M_B>=-19.3 and
higher expansion velocities than the FAINT SNe. The third group includes both
``normal'' and SN1991T-like SNeIa: these SNe populate a narrow strip in the
SiII velocity evolution plot, with a small velocity gradient (SVG), but have
absolute magnitudes similar to HVGs. While the FAINT and HVG SNeIa together
seem to define a relation between RSi(II) and Dm15(B), the SVG ones either do
not conform with that relation or define a new, looser one. The RSi(II)
pre-maximum evolution of HVGs is strikingly different from that of SVGs. The
impact of this evidence on the understanding of SNIa diversity, in terms of
explosion mechanisms, degree of ejecta mixing, and ejecta-CSM interaction, is
discussed.
