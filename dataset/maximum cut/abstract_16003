(abridged) We present the discovery of two T dwarf binaries, 2MASS
1225-2739AB and 2MASS 1534-2952AB, identified in a sample of ten T dwarfs
imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2. The
separations of the two binary systems are 0{\farcs}282$\pm$0{\farcs}005 and
0{\farcs}065$\pm$0{\farcs}007, implying projected separations of 3.17$\pm$0.14
and 1.0$\pm$0.3 AU, respectively. The observed binary fraction of our HST
sample, 20$^{+17}_{-7}$%, is consistent with results obtained for late-M and L
field dwarfs, and implies a bias-corrected binary fraction of 9$^{+15}_{-4}$%
for $a \gtrsim 1$ AU and $q \gtrsim 0.4$, significantly lower than the binary
fractions of F--G and early-type M dwarf stars. Neither of the T binaries have
separations $a \gtrsim 10$ AU, consistent with results from other brown dwarf
binary searches. We conclude that tidal disruption by passing stars or Giant
Molecular Clouds, which limits the extent of wide stellar binaries, plays no
role in eliminating wide brown dwarf binaries, implying either disruption very
early in the formation process (ages $\lesssim 1-10$ Myr) or a formation
mechanism which precludes such systems. We find that the maximum binary
separation in the brown dwarf regime appears to scale as M$_{total}^2$, a
possible clue to the physical mechanism which restricts wide substellar
systems.
