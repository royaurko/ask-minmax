A new five-parameter continuous distribution which generalizes the
Kumaraswamy and the beta distributions as well as some other well-known
distributions is proposed and studied. The model has as special cases new four-
and three-parameter distributions on the standard unit interval. Moments, mean
deviations, R\'enyi's entropy and the moments of order statistics are obtained
for the new generalized Kumaraswamy distribution. The score function is given
and estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. Hypothesis testing is also
discussed. A data set is used to illustrate an application of the proposed
distribution.
