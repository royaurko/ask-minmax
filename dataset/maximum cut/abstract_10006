We present early-time optical and near-infrared photometry of supernova (SN)
2005cf. The observations, spanning a period from about 12 days before to 3
months after maximum, have been obtained through the coordination of
observational efforts of various nodes of the European Supernova Collaboration
and including data obtained at the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope. From the
observed light curve we deduce that SN 2005cf is a fairly typical SN Ia with a
post-maximum decline (Delta m_15(B) = 1.12) close to the average value and a
normal luminosity of M_B,max = -19.39+/-0.33. Models of the bolometric light
curve suggest a synthesised 56Ni mass of about 0.7 solar masses. The negligible
host galaxy interstellar extinction and its proximity make SN 2005cf a good
Type Ia supernova template.
