We present a computation of the O(alpha_s) QCD corrections to W^\pm Z \gamma
production at the Large Hadron Collider. The photon is considered as real, and
we include full leptonic decays for the W and Z bosons. Based on the structure
of the VBFNLO program package, we obtain numerical results through a fully
flexible Monte Carlo program, which allows to implement general cuts and
distributions of the final-state particles. The NLO QCD corrections are sizable
and strongly exceed the theory error obtained by a scale variation of the
leading-order result. Also, the shapes of relevant observables are
significantly altered.
