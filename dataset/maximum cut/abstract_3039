The geometry of the LMC bar is studied using the de-reddened mean magnitudes
of the red clump stars ($I_0$) from the OGLE II catalogue. The value of $I_0$
is found to vary in the east-west direction such that both the east and the
west ends of the bar are closer to us with respect to the center of the bar.
The maximum observed variation has a statistical significance of more than 7.6
$\sigma$ with respect to the maximum value of random error. The variation in
$I_0$ indicates the presence of warp in the bar of LMC. The warp and the
structures seen in the bar indicate that the bar could be a dynamically
disturbed structure.
