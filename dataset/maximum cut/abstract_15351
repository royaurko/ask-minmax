In this paper, the impact of energy constraints on a two-hop network with a
source, a relay and a destination under random medium access is studied. A
collision channel with erasures is considered, and the source and the relay
nodes have energy harvesting capabilities and an unlimited battery to store the
harvested energy. Additionally, the source and the relay node have external
traffic arrivals and the relay forwards a fraction of the source node's traffic
to the destination; the cooperation is performed at the network level. An inner
and an outer bound of the stability region for a given transmission probability
vector are obtained. Then, the closure of the inner and the outer bound is
obtained separately and they turn out to be identical. This work is not only a
step in connecting information theory and networking, by studying the maximum
stable throughput region metric but also it taps the relatively unexplored and
important domain of energy harvesting and assesses the effect of that on this
important measure.
