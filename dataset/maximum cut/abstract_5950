We studied patterns of contributorship in computer science~(CS) research in the
Philippines by using data mining and graph theory techniques on archives of
scientific papers presented in the Philippine Computer Science Congresses from
2000 to 2010 involving 326~papers written by 605~contributors. We inferred from
these archives various graphs namely, a paper--contributor bipartite graph, a
co-contributorship graph, and two mixing graphs. Our results show that the
scientific articles by Filipino computer scientists were generated at a rate of
33~papers per year, while the papers were written by an average of 2.64~contributors
(maximum=13). The frequency distribution of the number of contributors per paper
follows a power-law with a power of $\varphi=-2.04$ ($R^2=0.71$). The number of
Filipino CS researchers increases at an annual rate of 60~new scientists. The
researchers have written an average of 1.42~papers (maximum=20) and have
collaborated with 3.70~other computer scientists (maximum=54). The frequency
distribution of the number of papers per contributor follows a power law with
$\varphi=-1.88$ ($R^2=0.83$). This distribution closely agrees with Lotka's
{\em law of scientific productivity} having $\varphi\approx -2$. The number of
co-contributors per contributor also follows a power-law with $\varphi=-1.65$
($R^2=0.80$). These results suggest that most CS~papers in the country were
written by scientists who prefer to work alone or at most in small groups.
These also suggest that few papers were written by scientists who were involved
in large collaboration efforts. The productivity of the Philippines' CS
researchers, as measured by their number of papers, is positively correlated
with their participation in collaborative research efforts, as measured by
their number of co-contributors (Pearson $r=0.7425$).
