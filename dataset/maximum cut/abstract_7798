We present predictions for top anti-top bottom anti-bottom production at the
LHC in next-to-leading order QCD. The precise description of this background
process is a prerequisite to observe associated top anti-top Higgs production
in the Higgs -> bottom anti-bottom decay channel and to directly measure the
top-quark Yukawa coupling at the LHC. The leading-order cross section is
extremely sensitive to scale variations. We observe that the traditional scale
choice adopted in ATLAS simulations underestimates the top anti-top bottom
anti-bottom background by a factor two and introduce a new dynamical scale that
stabilizes the perturbative predictions. We study various kinematic
distributions and observe that the corrections have little impact on their
shapes if standard cuts are applied. In the regime of highly boosted Higgs
bosons, which offers better perspectives to observe the top anti-top Higgs
signal, we find significant distortions of the kinematic distributions. The
one-loop amplitudes are computed using process-independent algebraic
manipulations of Feynman diagrams and numerical tensor reduction. We find that
this approach provides very high numerical stability and CPU efficiency.
