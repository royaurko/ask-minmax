The electronic transmission and conductance of a gapped graphene superlattice
were calculated by means of the transfer-matrix method. The system that we
study consists of a sequence of electron-doped graphene as wells and hole-doped
graphene as barriers. We show that the transmission probability approaches
unity at some critical value of the gap. We also find that there is a domain
around the critical gap value for which the conductance of the system attains
its maximum value.
