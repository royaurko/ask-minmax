We continue the study of the tensor-four-scalars theory which is a
modification of general relativity. We include normal matter by applying the
displace, cut, and reflect method to our previous vacuum solutions with dark
halo. The resulting disklike solution has physical and unphysical features: the
matter density for large radius is proportional to the forth power of the
circular velocity in agreement with the Tully-Fisher relation; but the radial
pressure is negative.
