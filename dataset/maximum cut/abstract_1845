We present direct measurements of the density of states by tunneling
spectroscopy on slightly overdoped Bi2212 single crystals at low temperature
using break-junction and point-contact techniques. We find that (i) the
variation of the gap magnitude, Delta, between 20 and 36 meV is likely to be
intrinsic to the Bi2212, and (ii) there is a correlation between the maximum
value of the Josephson IcRn product and the gap magnitude: IcRn decreases with
the increase of Delta. The maximum IcRn value of 26 mV is observed at Delta =
20.5 meV. For Delta = 36.5 meV, the maximum measured value of IcRn is 7.3 mV.
We conclude that (i) the distribution of the Josephson IcRn product as a
function of gap magnitude can not be explained by the presence of a single
energy gap in Bi2212, and (ii) the coherence energy scale in Bi2212 has the
maximum Josephson strength.
