We carry out a model-independent EFT method study on the vacuum statistics of
general F-term SUSY breaking models. Assuming a smooth distribution of
Lagrangian parameters, SUSY breaking vacua are rare in global SUSY models with
a canonical K\"ahler potential, and have a peaked distribution near the cut-off
of the SUSY breaking scale in both global SUSY and SUGRA models with a general
K\"ahler potential. After including different mass scales in the Lagrangian, we
compare the total number of SUSY and non-SUSY vacua and estimate quantitatively
the rareness of SUSY breaking. The EFT method provides a general view to the
amount of parameter tuning needed for a metastable SUSY breaking vacuum. The
tuning also indicates the importance of R-symmetries in SUSY breaking even for
metastable SUSY breaking.
