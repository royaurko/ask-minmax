In the context of SUSY GUTs, GUT scale cosmic strings formed at the end of
hybrid inflation are compatible with currently available CMB measurements. The
maximum allowed cosmic strings contribution to the CMB data constrains the free
parameters (mass scales, couplings) of inflationary models. For F-term
inflation either the superpotential coupling must be fine tuned or one has to
invoke the curvaton mechanism. D-term inflation should be addressed in the
framework of SUGRA. We find that the cosmic strings contribution is not
constant, contrary to some previous results. Using CMB measurements we
constrain the gauge and the superpotential couplings.
