A gossamer structure for end-of-life disposal of spacecraft to mitigate space
debris is considered in comparison with other end-of-life disposal concepts to
determine when it would be preferable. A needs analysis, potential use cases,
and concept-of-operations are developed. A survey of disposal strategies is
presented for comparison prior to a down-selection of viable competing
techniques; solar sailing, high and low-thrust propulsion, and electrodynamic
tethers. A parametric comparison of the down-selection competing techniques is
presented. Exploiting solar radiation pressure on the structure is of limited
value. Atmospheric drag augmentation was found to be of most benefit for
end-of-life disposal when an entirely passive means is required, allowing the
gossamer device to act as a fail-safe. This is applicable to only low and
medium mass spacecraft, or spacecraft that are unlikely to survive atmospheric
re-entry, hence minimizing risk to human life. It does not significantly alter
the operating ceiling altitude but does the maximum allowable end-of-life mass.
Peak mass benefit occurs in the altitude range 550 - 650 km and is largely
independent of de-orbit time.
