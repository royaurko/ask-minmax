Reed conjectured that for any graph $G$, $\chi(G) \leq \lceil
\frac{\omega(G)+\Delta(G)+1}{2}\rceil$, where $\chi(G)$, $\omega(G)$, and
$\Delta(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number, the clique number and the
maximum degree of $G$. In this paper, we verify this conjecture for some
special classes of graphs, in particular for subclasses of $P_5$-free graphs or
$Chair$-free graphs.
