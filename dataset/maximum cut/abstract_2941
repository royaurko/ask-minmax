Given a (genus 2) cube-with-holes M, i.e. the complement in S^3 of a
handlebody H, we relate intrinsic properties of M (like its cut number) with
extrinsic features depending on the way the handlebody H is knotted in S^3.
Starting from a first level of knotting that requires the non-existence of a
planar spine for H, we define several instances of knotting of H in terms of
the non-existence of spines with special properties. Some of these instances
are implied by an intrinsic counterpart in terms of the non-existence of
special cut-systems for M. We study a natural partial order on these instances
of knotting, as well as its intrinsic counterpart, and the relations between
them. To this aim, we recognize a few effective "obstructions" based on recent
quandle-coloring invariants for spatial handlebodies, on the extension to the
context of spatial handlebodies of tools coming from the theory of homology
boundary links, on the analysis of appropriate coverings of M, and on the very
classical use of Alexander elementary ideals of the fundamental group of M. Our
treatment of the matter also allows us to revisit a few old-fashioned beautiful
themes of 3-dimensional geometric topology.
