We show how to compute the coefficients of the double box basis integrals in
a massless four-point amplitude in terms of tree amplitudes. We show how to
choose suitable multidimensional contours for performing the required cuts, and
derive consistency equations from the requirement that integrals of total
derivatives vanish. Our formulae for the coefficients can be used either
analytically or numerically.
