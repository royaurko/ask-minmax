We calculate ratios of higher-order susceptibilities quantifying fluctuations
in the number of net protons and in the net-electric charge using the Hadron
Resonance Gas (HRG) model. We take into account the effect of resonance decays,
the kinematic acceptance cuts in rapidity, pseudo-rapidity and transverse
momentum used in the experimental analysis, as well as a randomization of the
isospin of nucleons in the hadronic phase. By comparing these results to the
latest experimental data from the STAR collaboration, we determine the
freeze-out conditions from net-electric charge and net-proton distributions and
discuss their consistency.
