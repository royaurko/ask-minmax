We examine the compatibility between existing experimental data and a
recently proposed explanation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies, given in
terms of a sterile neutrino $N$ whose decay is dominated by a radiative mode.
We find that current experimental data on $\tau\rightarrow \mu\nu\nu\gamma$
decays are compatible with the sterile neutrino parameters required for the
explanation of the anomalies, but $K\rightarrow \mu\nu\gamma$ shows a marginal
tension with those parameters. We also propose experimental cuts on radiative
$K$ decays that could test the sterile neutrino hypothesis better. Finally, we
study the contribution of this sterile neutrino to $K\to\mu\nu e e$, and find
that measurements of this process would provide powerful tests for the sterile
neutrino explanation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies, if the experimental
cut on the invariant mass of the $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair could be reduced from its
current value of 145 MeV to a value below 40 MeV.
