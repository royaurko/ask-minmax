We prove, as our main theorem, the finiteness of topological type of a
complete open Riemannian manifold $M$ with a base point $p \in M$ whose radial
curvature at $p$ is bounded from below by that of a non-compact model surface
of revolution $\tilde{M}$ which admits a finite total curvature and has no pair
of cut points in a sector. Here a sector is, by definition, a domain cut off by
two meridians emanating from the base point $\tilde{p} \in \tilde{M}$. Notice
that our model $\tilde{M}$ does not always satisfy the diameter growth
condition introduced by Abresch and Gromoll. In order to prove the main
theorem, we need a new type of the Toponogov comparison theorem. As an
application of the main theorem, we present a partial answer to Milnor's open
conjecture on the fundamental group of complete open manifolds.
