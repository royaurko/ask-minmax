The detection of 1.37$\, $s pulsations from NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 implies the
existence of an accreting pulsar, which challenges the conventional
understanding of ultraluminous X-ray source. This kind of sources are proposed
to be massive pulsars in this paper. Considering the general relativistic
effect, stronger gravity of massive pulsars could lead to a larger maximum
luminosity, scaled as the Eddington luminosity. The pseudo-Newtonian potential
is employed to simulate the gravitational field in general relativity, and the
Eddington luminosity is calculated for self-bound stars (quark star and
quark-cluster star) and for the Tolman IV solution. It is found that, for a
massive pulsar with radius close to the Schwarszchild radius, the Eddington
luminosity could be as high as $2\times10^{39} \, {\rm erg\, s}^{-1}$. It is
able to account for the X-ray luminosity of NuSTAR J095551+6940.8 with
reasonable beaming factor. It is also suggested that massive pulsar-like
compact stars could form via this super-Eddington phase of ultraluminous X-ray
source.
