The product expansion of conditional probabilities for belief nets is not
maximum entropy. This appears to deny a desirable kind of assurance for the
model. However, a kind of guarantee that is almost as strong as maximum entropy
can be derived. Surprisingly, a variant model also exhibits the guarantee, and
for many cases obtains a higher performance score than the product expansion.
