The method of detection of dust in the stratosphere and mesosphere by the
twilight sky background observations is being considered. The polarization
measurements are effective for detection of the meteoric dust scattering on the
background consisting basically of troposphere multiple scattering. The method
is based on the observed and explained polarization properties of the sky
background during different stages of twilight. It is used to detect the
mesosphere dust after the Leonids maximum in 2002 and to investigate its
evolution. The polarization method takes into account the multiple scattering
and sufficient contribution of moonlight scattering background and turns out to
be more sensitive than existing analogs used in the present time.
