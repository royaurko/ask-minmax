We discuss the renormalon-based approach to power corrections in non-singlet
deep inelastic scattering structure functions and compare it with the general
operator product expansion. The renormalon technique and its variations relate
the power corrections directly to infrared-sensitive parameters such as the
position of the Landau pole \Lambda_{QCD} or the infinitesimal gluon mass
\lambda. In terms of the standard OPE these techniques unify evaluations of the
coefficient functions and of matrix elements. We argue that in case of deep
inelastic scattering there is a proliferation of competeing infrared sensitive
parameters. In particular we consider the gluon and quark masses, virtuality of
quarks and \Lambda_{QCD} as possible infrared cut offs and compare the emerging
results. In the standard renormalon technique where \Lambda_{QCD} is the
infrared parameter, the argument of the running coupling is crucial to obtain
the correct x dependance of the structure functions. Finally we discuss the
limitations of the use of the renormalon based methods for determining of the x
dependance of the power corrections.
