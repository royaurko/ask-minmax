The radio light curves of novae rise and fall over the course of months to
years, allowing for detailed observations of the evolution of the nova shell.
However, the main parameter determined by radio models of nova explosions - the
mass of the ejecta - often seems to exceed theoretical expectations by an order
of magnitude. With the recent technological improvements on the Karl G. Jansky
Very Large Array (VLA), new observations can test the assumptions upon which
ejecta mass estimates are based. Early observations of the classical nova V1723
Aql showed an unexpectedly rapid rise in radio flux density and a distinct bump
in the radio light curve on the rise to radio maximum, which is inconsistent
with the simple model of spherical ejecta expelled in a single discrete event.
This initial bump appears to indicate the presence of shocked material in the
outer region of the ejected shell, with the emission from the shocks fading
over time. We explore possible origins for this emission and its relation to
the mass loss history of the nova. The evolution of the radio spectrum also
reveals the density profile, the mass of the ejected shell, and other
properties of the ejecta. These observations comprise one of the most complete,
longterm set of multi-wavelength radio observations for any classical nova to
date.
