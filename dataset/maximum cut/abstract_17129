This paper presents a new family of interior solutions of Einstein-Maxwell
field equations in general relativity for a static spherically symmetric
distribution of a charged perfect fluid with a particular form of charge
distribution. This solution gives us wide range of parameter, K, for which the
solution is well behaved hence, suitable for modeling of superdense star. For
this solution the gravitational mass of a star is maximized with all degree of
suitability by assuming the surface density equal to normal nuclear density,
2.5E17 kg/m3. By this model we obtain the mass of the Crab pulsar, MCrab 1.3679
solar mass and radius 13.21 km, constraining the moment of inertia > 1.61E38 kg
m2 for the conservative estimate of Crab nebula of 2 solar mass . And MCrab =
1.9645 solar mass with radius 14.38 km constraining the moment of inertia >
3.04E38 kg m2 for the newest estimate of Crab nebula mass, 4.6 solar mass.
These results are quite well in agreement with the possible values of mass and
radius of Crab pulsar. Besides this, our model yields moments of inertia for
PSR J0737-3039A and PSR J0737-3039B, I_A = 1.4285E38 kg m2 and I_B=1.3647E38 kg
m2 respectively. It has been observed that under well behaved conditions this
class of solutions gives us the overall maximum gravitational mass of super
dense object, Mmax, 4.7487 solar mass with radius R(Mmax) = 15.24 km, surface
redshift 0.9878, charge 7.91E20 C, and central density 4.31 times nuclear
density.
