This paper describes a simple procedure to estimate the parameters of the
univariate truncated normal and lognormal distributions by maximum likelihood.
It starts from a reparameterization of the lognormal that was previously
introduced by the contributor and is especially useful when the lognormal is close
to a power law, which is a limiting case of the first distribution. One of the
new parameters quantifies the distance from the power law, and vanishes when
the power law gives a sufficient description of the data. At this point, the
other parameter equals the exponent of the power law. In contrast, when using
the standard parameterization, the parameters of the lognormal diverge in the
neighborhood of the power law. Whether or not we are in this neighborhood, the
new parameters have properties that ease the process of estimation.
