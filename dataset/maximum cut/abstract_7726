The area of stable motion for fictitious Trojan asteroids around Uranus'
equilateral equilibrium points is investigated with respect to the inclination
of the asteroid's orbit to determine the size of the regions and their shape.
For this task we used the results of extensive numerical integrations of orbits
for a grid of initial conditions around the points L4 and L5, and analyzed the
stability of the individual orbits. Our basic dynamical model was the Outer
Solar System (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune). We integrated the equations
of motion of fictitious Trojans in the vicinity of the stable equilibrium
points for selected orbits up to the age of the Solar system of 5 billion
years. One experiment has been undertaken for cuts through the Lagrange points
for fixed values of the inclinations, while the semimajor axes were varied. The
extension of the stable region with respect to the initial semimajor axis lies
between 19.05 < a < 19.3 AU but depends on the initial inclination. In another
run the inclination of the asteroids' orbit was varied in the range 0 < i < 60
and the semimajor axes were fixed. It turned out that only four 'windows' of
stable orbits survive: these are the orbits for the initial inclinations 0 < i
< 7, 9 < i < 13, 31 < i < 36 and 38 < i < 50. We postulate the existence of at
least some Trojans around the Uranus Lagrange points for the stability window
at small and also high inclinations.
