We study the TIP5P water model proposed by Mahoney and Jorgensen, which is
closer to real water than previously-proposed classical pairwise additive
potentials. We simulate the model in a wide range of deeply supercooled states
and find (i) the existence of a non-monotonic ``nose-shaped'' temperature of
maximum density line and a non-reentrant spinodal, (ii) the presence of a low
temperature phase transition, (iii) the free evolution of bulk water to ice,
and (iv) the time-temperature-transformation curves at different densities.
