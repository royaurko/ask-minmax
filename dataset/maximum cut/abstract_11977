The temperature dependence of the thermoelectric power, S(T), and the
electrical resistivity of the magnetically ordered CeRu_2Ge_2 (T_N=8.55 K and
T_C=7.40 K) were measured for pressures p < 16 GPa in the temperature range 1.2
K < T < 300 K. Long-range magnetic order is suppressed at a p_c of
approximately 6.4 GPa. Pressure drives S(T) through a sequence of temperature
dependences, ranging from a behaviour characteristic for magnetically ordered
heavy fermion compounds to a typical behaviour of intermediate-valent systems.
At intermediate pressures a large positive maximum develops above 10 K in S(T).
Its origin is attributed to the Kondo effect and its position is assumed to
reflect the Kondo temperature T_K. The pressure dependence of T_K is discussed
in a revised and extended (T,p) phase diagram of CeRu_2Ge_2.
