Inspired by recent lattice calculations, we model certain aspects of the
$\theta$-vacuum using a matrix model with gaussian weights. The vacuum energy
exhibits a cusp at $\theta <\pi$ that is sensitive to both the accuracy of the
numerical analysis and the maximum density of winding modes present in a finite
volume.
