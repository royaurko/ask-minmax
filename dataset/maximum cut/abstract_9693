Time-resolved beam parameters measurement system can be achieve electron beam
energy in LIA. In this paper introduce work principle and method of
time-resolved beam parameters measurement system. Show the experiment layout of
energy measuring. The principle of magnetic analyzer was described, with the
bending radius of 300 mm and the bending angle of 60 degree after hard-edge
approximation, The measured energy is about 18MeV, the maximum energy variation
is 2%.
