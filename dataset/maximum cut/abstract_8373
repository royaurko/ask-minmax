We report on infrared reflectivity measurements of the $ab$-plane response of
superconducting Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_6$ single crystals. The frequency dependent
conductivity has a maximum near 700 cm$^{-1}$ at room temperature, which shifts
to lower frequency and merges with a Drude-peak below 100 K. We attribute the
unusual behaviour of the mid-infrared conductivity to low frequency transitions
between electronic bands of mainly BiO character near the $\overline{M}$ point.
The linear temperature dependence of the low-frequency resistivity can be
followed down to approximately 40 K where it saturates.
