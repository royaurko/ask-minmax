Strong coupling calculations for the glueball spectrum in an $AdS^7$ black
hole are modified by introducing an UV cut-off at a Planck brane. A new
normalizable state in the tensor spectrum is found which reproduces
Einstein-Hilbert gravity up to exponentially small corrections due to off shell
mixing with massive glueballs.
