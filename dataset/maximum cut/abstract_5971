Characterisations of interval graphs, comparability graphs, co-comparability
graphs, permutation graphs, and split graphs in terms of linear orderings of
the vertex set are presented. As an application, it is proved that interval
graphs, co-comparability graphs, AT-free graphs, and split graphs have
bandwidth bounded by their maximum degree.
