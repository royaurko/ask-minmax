We represent an algorithm reducing a big class of systems of
($M+1$)-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) to the
systems of $M$-dimensional first order PDEs. Thus, we integrate the original
system with respect to only one independent variable reducing its
dimensionality by one. For this reason we call such systems partially
integrable ones. In particular, if M=1, then $M$-dimensional PDEs become ODEs.
Our method may be referred to as a generalization of the method of
characteristics. Possible application in hydrodynamics is discussed.
