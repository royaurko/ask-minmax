We derive the representative Bernstein measure of the density of
$(X_{\alpha})^{-\alpha/(1-\alpha)}, 0 < \alpha < 1$, where $X_{\alpha}$ is a
positive stable random variable, as a Fox-H function. When $1-\alpha = 1/j$ for
some integer $j \geq 2$, the Fox H-function reduces to a Meijer G-function so
that the Kanter's random variable (see below) is closely related to a product
of $(j-1)$ independent Beta random variables. When $\alpha$ tends to 0, the
Bernstein measure becomes degenerate thereby agrees with Cressie's result for
the asymptotic behaviour of stable distributions for small values of $\alpha$.
Coming to free probability, our result makes more explicit that of Biane on the
density of its free analog. The paper is closed with analytic arguments
explaining the occurence of the Kanter's random variable in both the classical
and the free settings.
