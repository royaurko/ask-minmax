Template extraction is the process of isolating the template of a given
webpage. It is widely used in several disciplines, including webpages
development, content extraction, block detection, and webpages indexing. One of
the main goals of template extraction is identifying a set of webpages with the
same template without having to load and analyze too many webpages prior to
identifying the template. This work introduces a new technique to automatically
discover a reduced set of webpages in a website that implement the template.
This set is computed with an hyperlink analysis that computes a very small set
with a high level of confidence.
