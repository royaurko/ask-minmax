We investigate the class field theory for an open curve over a local field.
In particular, we determine the kernel and the cokernel of the reciprocity
homomorphism and obtain the one to one correspondence between the set of finite
abelian \'etale coverings which are not completely split and the set of finite
index open subgroups of the id\`ele class group as in the classical class field
theory.
