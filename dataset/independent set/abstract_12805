Recently, several strong limit theorems for the oscillation moduli of the
empirical process have been given in the iid-case. We show that, with very
slight differences, those strong results are also obtained for some
representation of the reduced empirical process based on the (non-overlapping)
k-spacings generated by a sequence of independent random variables (rv's)
uniformly distributed on $(0,1)$. This yields weak limits for the mentioned
process. Our study includes the case where the step k is unbounded. The results
are mainly derived from several properties concerning the increments of gamma
functions with parameters k and one.
