A {\it shadow} is an exact solution to a chaotic system of equations that
remains close to a numerically computed solution for a long time, ending in a
{\it glitch}. We study the distribution of shadow durations at low dimension
and how shadow durations scale as dimension increases up to 300 in a slightly
simplified gravitational n-body system. We find that ``softened'' systems are
shadowable for many tens of crossing times even for large n, while in an
``unsoftened'' system each particle encounters glitches independently as a
Poisson process, giving shadow durations that scale as 1/n.
