We study sufficient conditions for the belonging of random process to certain
Besov space and for the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in these spaces.
  We investigate also the non-asymptotic tail behavior of normed sums of
centered random independent variables (vectors) with values in these spaces.
  Main apparatus is the theory of mixed (anisotropic) Lebesgue-Riesz spaces, in
particular so-called permutation inequality.
