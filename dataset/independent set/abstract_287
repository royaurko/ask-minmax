We address the response of a random heteropolymer to preferential solvation
of certain monomer types at the globule-solvent interface. For each set of
monomers that can comprise the molecule's surface, we represent the ensemble of
allowed configurations by a Gaussian distribution of energy levels, whose mean
and variance depend on the set's composition. Within such a random energy
model, mean surface composition is proportional to solvation strength under
most conditions. The breadth of this linear response regime arises from
approximate statistical independence of surface and volume energies. For a
diverse set of monomer types, the excess of solvophilic monomers at the surface
is large only for very strong solvent preference, even in the ground state.
