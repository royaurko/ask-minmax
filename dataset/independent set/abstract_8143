For a finite set $U$ of directions in the Euclidean plane, a convex
non-degenerate polygon $P$ is called a $U$-polygon if every line parallel to a
direction of $U$ that meets a vertex of $P$ also meets another vertex of $P$.
We characterize the numbers of edges of $U$-polygons of class $c\geq4$ with all
their vertices in certain subsets of the plane and derive explicit results in
the case of cyclotomic model sets.
