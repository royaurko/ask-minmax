The Einstein's equivalence principle and experiments, in which bodies and
observers are in different G potentials, have been used to prove that the chain
of hypothesis coming from assuming the absolute invariability of the bodies,
after a change of G potential, are wrong. The absolute changes of frequencies,
masses and lengths of every well-defined part of the non-local bodies, compared
with the local ones, are linearly related to the differences of G potential
between the non-local bodies and the observer. Such absolute changes are
independent on the forces within the structure of the bodies. Then the increase
of G potential due to universe expansion also expands bodies in same proportion
as distances. Consequently, such uniform expansion cannot change the results of
any measurement of distance or velocity. The cosmological red shifts and the
average universe density cannot change with the time, i.e., the new universe
age is not limited by the Hubble law. The new linear G relationships and the
unlimited age of the universe fix a new astrophysical context that turns out to
be independent on any cosmological hypothesis. Thus the best fit of this new
scenario with astronomical observations has been obtained independently on the
chain of hypotheses that are not simultaneously consistent with all of the
experimental facts.
