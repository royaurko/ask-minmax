Cotunneling is an important error process in the application of single
electron tunneling devices for metrological and electronic applications. Here
we present an experimental investigation of the theory for adiabatic
enhancement of cotunneling by coherent microwaves. The dependence is
investigated as function of temperature, gate voltage, frequency, and applied
microwave power. At low temperatures and applied power levels, the results are
consistent with theory, using only the unknown damping in the microwave line as
a free parameter. However, the results indicate that the effects of
temperature, frequency and microwave power are not independent, contrary to
what is suggested by theory.
