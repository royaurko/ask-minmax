An algorithm to decide the emptiness of a regular type expression with set
operators given a set of parameterised type definitions is presented. The
algorithm can also be used to decide the equivalence of two regular type
expressions and the inclusion of one regular type expression in another. The
algorithm strictly generalises previous work in that tuple distributivity is
not assumed and set operators are permitted in type expressions.
