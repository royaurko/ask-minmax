This is intended to be a simple discussion of work done in collaboration with
S. Cecotti, K. Intriligator and C. Vafa; and with H. Saleur. I discuss how $ Tr
F (-1)^F e^{-\beta H}$ can be computed exactly in any N=2 supersymmetric theory
in two dimensions. It gives exact information on the soliton spectrum of the
theory, and corresponds to the partition function of a single self-avoiding
polymer looped once around a cylinder of radius $\beta$. It is independent of
almost all deformations of the theory, and satisfies an exact differential
equation as a function of $\beta$. For integrable theories it can also be
computed from the exact S-matrix. This implies a highly non-trivial equivalence
of a set of coupled integral equations with the classical sinh-Gordon and the
affine Toda equations.
