It is shown that by defining the Debye mass through the relevant pole of the
static gluon propagator rather than the zero-momentum limit of the time-time
component of the gluon self-energy, a gauge-independent result for the
next-to-leading order correction can be derived upon resummation of
hard-thermal-loop contributions. The result turns out to be logarithmically
sensitive to the magnetic screening mass. [Talk given at the 3rd Workshop on
Thermal Field Theories and their Applications, August 15-27, 1993, Banff,
