Two philosophical applications of the concept of program-size complexity are
discussed. First, we consider the light program-size complexity sheds on
whether mathematics is invented or discovered, i.e., is empirical or is a
priori. Second, we propose that the notion of algorithmic independence sheds
light on the question of being and how the world of our experience can be
partitioned into separate entities.
