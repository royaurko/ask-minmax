Athena is the ATLAS off-line software framework, based upon the GAUDI
architecture from LHCb. As part of ATLAS' continuing efforts to enhance and
customise the architecture to meet our needs, we have developed a data object
description tool suite and service for Athena. The aim is to provide a set of
tools to describe, manage, integrate and use the Event Data Model at a design
level according to the concepts of the Athena framework (use of patterns,
relationships, ...). Moreover, to ensure stability and reusability this must be
fully independent from the implementation details. After an extensive
investigation into the many options, we have developed a language grammar based
upon a description language (IDL, ODL) to provide support for object
integration in Athena. We have then developed a compiler front end based upon
this language grammar, JavaCC, and a Java Reflection API-like interface. We
have then used these tools to develop several compiler back ends which meet
specific needs in ATLAS such as automatic generation of object converters, and
data object scripting interfaces. We present here details of our work and
experience to date on the Athena Definition Language and Athena Data
Dictionary.
