We examine the spectrum of small vibrations of giant gravitons, when the
gravitons expand in the anti-de-Sitter space and when they expand on the
sphere. For any given angular harmonic, the modes are found to have frequencies
related to the curvature length scale of the background; these frequencies are
independent of radius (and hence angular momentum) of the brane itself. This
implies that the holographic dual theory must have, in a given R charge sector,
low-lying non-BPS excitations with level spacings independent of the R charge.
