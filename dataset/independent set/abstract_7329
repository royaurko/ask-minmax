Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) begins from a context, given as a binary
relation between some objects and some attributes, and derives a lattice of
concepts, where each concept is given as a set of objects and a set of
attributes, such that the first set consists of all objects that satisfy all
attributes in the second, and vice versa. Many applications, though, provide
contexts with quantitative information, telling not just whether an object
satisfies an attribute, but also quantifying this satisfaction. Contexts in
this form arise as rating matrices in recommender systems, as occurrence
matrices in text analysis, as pixel intensity matrices in digital image
processing, etc. Such applications have attracted a lot of attention, and
several numeric extensions of FCA have been proposed. We propose the framework
of proximity sets (proxets), which subsume partially ordered sets (posets) as
well as metric spaces. One feature of this approach is that it extracts from
quantified contexts quantified concepts, and thus allows full use of the
available information. Another feature is that the categorical approach allows
analyzing any universal properties that the classical FCA and the new versions
may have, and thus provides structural guidance for aligning and combining the
approaches.
