We show how to relate moments of the reconstructed hadronic invariant mass
distribution to the moments of the physical spectrum in a model independent
way. The only information needed on detector resolution functions are their
first few moments. Theoretical predictions for the first three moments as
functions of non-perturbative parameters are given for various lepton energy
cuts.
