In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-armed bandits with a large,
possibly infinite number of correlated arms. We assume that the arms have
Bernoulli distributed rewards, independent across time, where the probabilities
of success are parametrized by known attribute vectors for each arm, as well as
an unknown preference vector, each of dimension $n$. For this model, we seek an
algorithm with a total regret that is sub-linear in time and independent of the
number of arms. We present such an algorithm, which we call the Two-Phase
Algorithm, and analyze its performance. We show upper bounds on the total
regret which applies uniformly in time, for both the finite and infinite arm
cases. The asymptotics of the finite arm bound show that for any $f \in
\omega(\log(T))$, the total regret can be made to be $O(n \cdot f(T))$. In the
infinite arm case, the total regret is $O(\sqrt{n^3 T})$.
