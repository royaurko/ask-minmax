A numeral system is an infinite sequence of different closed normal
$\lambda$-terms intended to code the integers in $\lambda$-calculus. H.
Barendregt has shown that if we can represent, for a numeral system, the
functions : Successor, Predecessor, and Zero Test, then all total recursive
functions can be represented. In this paper we prove the independancy of these
particular three functions. We give at the end a conjecture on the number of
unary functions necessary to represent all total recursive functions.
