The statistical analysis of the lensing effects coupled with the statistical
analysis of the number counts is a tool to probe directly the relation between
the mass and the light. In particular, some properties of the bias parameter
can be investigated. The correlation between the shear of a given population of
galaxies, and the number counts of a different population of galaxies along the
same line of sight is calculated for the linear and the non-linear power
spectra of density fluctuations for different cosmologies. The estimator R
defined as the ratio of this correlation and the variance of the number counts
is inversely proportional to the bias parameter. Unfortunately, R is highly
dependent on the cosmological model, which makes a direct measure of the bias
quite difficult. However, it is showed that Rb is independent on the power
spectrum and the smoothing scale, thus R is a direct measure of the inverse of
the bias times a function of the cosmological parameters. From R, a new
estimator is defined which is only sensible to the scale dependence of the
bias. It is showed that with a sample of 25 square degrees, one can measure a
scale variation of the bias larger than 20% in the 1' to 10' scale range,
almost independently of the cosmological parameters, the redshift distribution
of the galaxies, and the power spectrum.
