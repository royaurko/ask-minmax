In this paper we derived a model based on general assumptions and allowed us
to derive some important thermodynamic functions that are time-dependent, also
we could see the behavior of these functions by surfaces. The model is based on
independent movements that couple and construct a flux, which makes the system
as a whole not to be independent at all.
