This is the first paper in a series which proposes and develops the polyfold
Fredholm structure--Kuranishi structure correspondence, identifying these two
abstract perturbative structures which are indispensable for constructing and
understanding symplectic invariants in the most general settings. In this
paper, I present my version of the theory of Kuranishi structures in full
generality. This theory is independent of all the choices made in the
construction (including the choices of good coordinate systems); and it uses
the equivalence of Kuranishi structures as the germ to capture the intrinsic
underlying structure to which the perturbation theory descends. This is the
first theory in the literature that has these two properties. This
choice-independent theory is essential for canonically and functorially
identifying the polyfold Fredholm theory of Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder with the
theory of Kuranishi structures. The next two papers in this series will be on
the forgetful functor and the globalization functor in the respective
directions of the polyfold--Kuranishi correspondence, as well as illustrating
the use of the correspondence with a few sample applications.
