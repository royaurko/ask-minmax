We investigate operator-valued monotone independence, a noncommutative
version of independence for conditional expectation. First we introduce
operator-valued monotone cumulants to clarify the whole theory and show the
moment-cumulant formula. As an application, one can obtain an easy proof of
Central Limit Theorem for operator-valued case. Moreover, we prove a
generalization of Muraki's formula for the sum of independent random variables
and a relation between generating functions of moments and cumulants.
