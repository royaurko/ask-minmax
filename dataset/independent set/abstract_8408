The sum-product conjecture of Erd\H os and Szemer\'edi states that, given a
finite set $A$ of positive numbers, one can find asymptotic lower bounds for
$\max\{|A+A|,|A\cdot A|\}$ of the order of $|A|^{1+\delta}$ for every $\delta
<1$. In this paper we consider the set of all spectral radii of $n\times n$
matrices with entries in $A$, and find lower bounds for the cardinality of this
set. In the case $n=2$, this cardinality is necessarily larger than
$\max\{|A+A|,|A\cdot A|\}$.
