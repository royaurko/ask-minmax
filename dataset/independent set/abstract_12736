For a spectrally one-sided \levy process we extend various two-sided exit
identities to the situation when the process is only observed at arrival epochs
of an independent Poisson process. In addition, we consider exit problems of
this type for processes reflected from above or from below. The resulting
transforms of the main quantities of interest are in terms of scale functions
and turn out to be simple analogues of the classical formulas.
