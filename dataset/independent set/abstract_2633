We present extended versions and give detailed proofs of results concerning
percolation (using various sets of two-replica bond occupation variables) in
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glasses (with zero external field) that were first
given in an earlier paper by the same contributors. We also explain how
ultrametricity is manifested by the densities of large percolating clusters.
Our main theorems concern the connection between these densities and the usual
spin overlap distribution. Their corollaries are that the ordered spin glass
phase is characterized by a unique percolating cluster of maximal density
(normally coexisting with a second cluster of nonzero but lower density). The
proofs involve comparison inequalities between SK multireplica bond occupation
variables and the independent variables of standard Erdos-Renyi random graphs.
