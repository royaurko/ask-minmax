Scott considered the determinant of 1/(y-z)^2, with y,z running over two sets
X,Y of size n, and determined its specialisation when Y and Z are the roots of
y^n-a and z^n-b. We give the same specialisation for the determinant
1/\prod_x(xy-z), where {x} is an arbitrary set of indeterminates. The case of
the Gaudin-Izergin-Korepin is for {x}={q,1/q}.
