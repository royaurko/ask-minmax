In this paper new test statistics are introduced and studied for the
important problem of testing hypothesis that involves inequality constraint on
proportions when the sample comes from independent binomial random variables:
Wald type and phi-divergence based test-statistics. As a particular case of
phi-divergence based test-statistics, the classical likelihood ratio test is
considered. An illustrative example is given and the performance of all of them
for small and moderate sample sizes is analyzed in an extensive simulation
study.
