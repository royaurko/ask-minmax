Borsuk's conjecture states that any bounded set in R^n can be partitioned
into n+1 sets of smaller diameter. It is known to be false for all n bigger or
equal to 323.
  Here we show that Borsuk's conjecture fails in dimensions 321 and 322. (This
result has been independently discovered by Hinrichs and Richter.)
