In this paper, we present a regularization to 1D Grad's moment system to
achieve global hyperbolicity. The regularization is based on the observation
that the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian of the flux in Grad's moment
system is independent of the intermediate moments. The method is not relied on
the form of the collision at all, thus this regularization is applicable to the
system without collision terms. Moreover, the proposed approach is proved to be
the unique one if only the last moment equation is allowed to be alternated to
match the condition of non-equilibrium independent characteristic speeds. The
hyperbolic structure of the regularized system, including the signal speeds,
Riemann invariants and the properties of the characteristic waves including the
rarefaction wave, contact discontinuity and shock are provided in the perfect
formations.
