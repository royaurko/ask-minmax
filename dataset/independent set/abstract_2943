The Boolean autonomous dynamical systems, also called regular autonomous
asynchronous systems are systems whose 'vector field' is a function
{\Phi}:{0,1}^{n}{\to}{0,1}^{n} and time is discrete or continuous. While the
synchronous systems have their coordinate functions {\Phi}_{1},...,{\Phi}_{n}
computed at the same time:
{\Phi},{\Phi}{\circ}{\Phi},{\Phi}{\circ}{\Phi}{\circ}{\Phi},... the
asynchronous systems have {\Phi}_{1},...,{\Phi}_{n} computed independently on
each other. The purpose of the paper is that of studying the basins of
attraction of the fixed points, of the orbits and of the {\omega}-limit sets of
the regular autonomous asynchronous systems. The bibliography consists in
analogies.
