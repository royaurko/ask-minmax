A broad set of sufficient conditions that guarantees the existence of the
maximum entropy (maxent) distribution consistent with specified bounds on
certain generalized moments is derived. Most results in the literature are
either focused on the minimum cross-entropy distribution or apply only to
distributions with a bounded-volume support or address only equality
constraints. The results of this work hold for general moment inequality
constraints for probability distributions with possibly unbounded support, and
the technical conditions are explicitly on the underlying generalized moment
functions. An analytical characterization of the maxent distribution is also
derived using results from the theory of constrained optimization in
infinite-dimensional normed linear spaces. Several auxiliary results of
independent interest pertaining to certain properties of convex coercive
functions are also presented.
