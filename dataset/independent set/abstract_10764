Recent measurements of the diffractive deep-inelastic cross section are used
to extract diffractive parton densities of the proton. These are subsequently
applied in models to predict the production of jets and open charm in the final
state. A rapidity gap suppression factor for dijet production in diffractive
photoproduction relative to diffractive deep-inelastic scattering is obtained
using a model-independent comparison.
