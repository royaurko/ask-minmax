A Triple Helix (TH) of bi- and trilateral relations among universities,
industries, and governments can be considered as an ecosystem in which
uncertainty can be reduced auto-catalytically. The correlations among the
distributions of relations span a vector space in which two vectors (P and Q)
represent "sending" and "receiving," respectively. These vectors can also be
understood in terms of the generation versus reduction of uncertainty in the
communication field that results from interactions among the three (bi-lateral)
communication channels. We specify a set of Lotka-Volterra equations between
the vectors that can be solved. Redundancy generation can then be simulated and
the results can be decomposed in terms of the TH components. Among other
things, we show that the strength and frequency of the relations are
independent parameters. Different components in terms of frequencies in
triple-helix systems can also be distinguished and interpreted using Fourier
analysis of the empirical time-series. The case of co-contributorship relations in
Japan is analyzed as an empirical example; but "triple contingencies" in an
ecosystem of relations can also be considered more generally as a model for
redundancy generation by providing meaning to the (Shannon-type) information in
inter-human communications.
