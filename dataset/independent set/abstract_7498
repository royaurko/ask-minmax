We study magnetization reversal using various r.f. magnetic pulses. We show
numerically that switching is possible with simple sinusoidal pulses; however
the optimum approach is to use a frequency-swept (chirped) r.f. magnetic pulse,
the shape of which can be derived analytically. Switching times of the order of
nanoseconds can be achieved with relatively small r.f. fields, independent of
the anisotropy's strength.
