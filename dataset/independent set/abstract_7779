Discrete non-abelian flavor symmetries give in a natural way tri-bimaximal
(TBM) mixing as showed in a prototype model. However neutrino mass matrix
pattern may be very different from the tri-bimaximal one if small deviations of
TBM will be observed. We give the result of a model independent analysis for
TBM neutrino mass pattern.
