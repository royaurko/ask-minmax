We study an infinite version of the "jeu de taquin" sliding game, which can
be thought of as a natural measure-preserving transformation on the set of
infinite Young tableaux equipped with the Plancherel probability measure. We
use methods from representation theory to show that the
Robinson-Schensted-Knuth ($\operatorname {RSK}$) algorithm gives an isomorphism
between this measure-preserving dynamical system and the one-sided shift
dynamics on a sequence of independent and identically distributed random
variables distributed uniformly on the unit interval. We also show that the jeu
de taquin paths induced by the transformation are asymptotically straight lines
emanating from the origin in a random direction whose distribution is computed
explicitly, and show that this result can be interpreted as a statement on the
limiting speed of a second-class particle in the Plancherel-TASEP particle
system (a variant of the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process associated
with Plancherel growth), in analogy with earlier results for second class
particles in the ordinary TASEP.
