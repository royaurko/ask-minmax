We show that if n>1 then there exists a Lebesgue null set in R^n containing a
point of differentiability of each Lipschitz function mapping from R^n to
R^(n-1); in combination with the work of others, this completes the
investigation of when the classical Rademacher theorem admits a converse.
Avoidance of sigma-porous sets, arising as irregular points of Lipschitz
functions, plays a key role in the proof.
