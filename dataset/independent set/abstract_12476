We consider generalized linear stochastic dynamical systems with second-order
state transition matrices. The entries of the matrix are assumed to be either
independent and exponentially distributed or equal to zero. We give an overview
of new results on evaluation of asymptotic growth rate of the system state
vector, which is called the Lyapunov exponent of the system.
