We present a sample of 968 K5-M6 dwarfs detected in the AKARI-IRC Point
Source Catalog. The vast majority of these low-mass stars have brightnesses in
the AKARI broad 9-micron (S9W) filter that match expectations of model
photospheres. Mismatched double stars have been excluded. Hot (200-600K) debris
disks can produce excesses in this mid-infrared filter. We discuss five M
dwarfs which have excesses that may be significant but require independent
confirmation. We also discuss 50 detections with the L18W filter, and support
the claimed Spitzer detection of a warm debris disk around AT Mic. We also
report a previously unrecognized disk around a T Tauri star.
