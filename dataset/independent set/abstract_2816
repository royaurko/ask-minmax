Human memory is not perfect - people constantly memorize new facts and forget
old ones. One example is forgetting a password, a common problem raised at IT
help desks. We present several protocols that allow a user to automatically
recover a password from a server using partial knowledge of the password. These
protocols can be easily adapted to the personal entropy setting, where a user
can recover a password only if he can answer a large enough subset of personal
questions.
  We introduce client-server password recovery methods, in which the recovery
data are stored at the server, and the recovery procedures are integrated into
the login procedures. These methods apply to two of the most common types of
password based authentication systems. The security of these solutions is
significantly better than the security of presently proposed password recovery
schemes. Our protocols are based on a variation of threshold encryption that
may be of independent interest.
