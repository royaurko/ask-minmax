I present numerical tests of several recent proposals for the Yang-Mills
vacuum wavefunctional in D=2+1 dimensions. In these tests the predicted
relative values of the squared wavefunctional, evaluated on a finite set of
abelian plane wave and non-abelian constant configurations, are compared to the
corresponding values for the true ground state, extracted from Monte Carlo
simulations. I also study how the 2+1 dimensional color Coulomb potential,
averaged over a set of simple trial configurations, varies with the proximity
of those configurations to the Gribov horizon.
