We consider the problem of estimating an unknown $n_1 \times n_2$ matrix
$\mathbf{\theta^*}$ from noisy observations under the constraint that
$\mathbf{\theta}^*$ is nondecreasing in both rows and columns. We consider the
least squares estimator (LSE) in this setting and study its risk properties. We
show that the worst case risk of the LSE is $n^{-1/2}$, up to multiplicative
logarithmic factors, where $n = n_1 n_2$ and that the LSE is minimax rate
optimal (up to logarithmic factors). We further prove that for some special
$\mathbf{\theta}^*$, the risk of the LSE could be much smaller than $n^{-1/2}$;
in fact, it could even be parametric i.e., $n^{-1}$ up to logarithmic factors.
Such parametric rates occur when the number of "rectangular" blocks of
$\mathbf{\theta}^*$ is bounded from above by a constant. We derive, as a
consequence, an interesting adaptation property of the LSE which we term
variable adaptation -- the LSE performs as well as the oracle estimator when
estimating a matrix that is constant along each row/column. Our proofs borrow
ideas from empirical process theory and convex geometry and are of independent
interest.
