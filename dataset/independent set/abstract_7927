We illustrate how a generalization of the JIMWLK formalism which treats
independently the direct and complex conjugate amplitudes can be used to
describe semi-inclusive multiparticle production with rapidity correlations in
pA collisions. The evolution equations that are obtained with this formalism
are susceptible of numerical implementation as a Langevin process.
