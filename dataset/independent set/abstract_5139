We develop a notion of finite order lacunarity for direction sets in $\mathbb
R^{d+1}$. Given a direction set $\Omega$ that is sublacunary according to this
definition, we construct random examples of Euclidean sets that contain unit
line segments with directions from $\Omega$ and enjoy analytical features
similar to those of traditional Kakeya sets of infinitesimal Lebesgue measure.
This generalizes to higher dimensions a planar result due to Bateman. Combined
with earlier work of Alfonseca, Bateman, Parcet and Rogers, this notion of
lacunarity and Kakeya-type sets also yields a characterization in all
dimensions for directional maximal operators to be $L^p$-bounded.
