It is well known that $\ell_1$ minimization can be used to recover
sufficiently sparse unknown signals from compressed linear measurements. In
fact, exact thresholds on the sparsity, as a function of the ratio between the
system dimensions, so that with high probability almost all sparse signals can
be recovered from i.i.d. Gaussian measurements, have been computed and are
referred to as "weak thresholds" \cite{D}. In this paper, we introduce a
reweighted $\ell_1$ recovery algorithm composed of two steps: a standard
$\ell_1$ minimization step to identify a set of entries where the signal is
likely to reside, and a weighted $\ell_1$ minimization step where entries
outside this set are penalized. For signals where the non-sparse component
entries are independent and identically drawn from certain classes of
distributions, (including most well known continuous distributions), we prove a
\emph{strict} improvement in the weak recovery threshold. Our analysis suggests
that the level of improvement in the weak threshold depends on the behavior of
the distribution at the origin. Numerical simulations verify the distribution
dependence of the threshold improvement very well, and suggest that in the case
of i.i.d. Gaussian nonzero entries, the improvement can be quite
impressive---over 20% in the example we consider.
