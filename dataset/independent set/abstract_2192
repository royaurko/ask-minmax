In the now well established conventional view (see Rees [1] and references
therein), quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and related active galactic nuclei (AGN)
phenomena are explained as the result of accretion of plasma onto giant black
holes which are postulated to form via gravitational collapse of the high
density regions in the centers of massive host galaxies. This model is
supported by a wide variety of indirect evidence and seems quite likely to
apply at least to some observed AGN phenomena. However, one surprising set of
new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations [2-4] directly challenges the
conventional model, and the well known evolution of the QSO population raises
some additional, though not widely recognized, difficulties. We propose here an
alternative possibility: the Universe contains a substantial independent
population of super-massive black holes, and QSO's are a phenomenon that occurs
due to their collisions with galaxies or gas clouds in the intergalactic medium
(IGM). This hypothesis would naturally explain why the QSO population declines
very rapidly towards low redshift, as well as the new HST data.
