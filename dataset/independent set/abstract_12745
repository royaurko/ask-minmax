Dihadron correlations are reported for peripheral and central d+Au collisions
at 200 GeV from STAR. The ZYAM background subtracted correlation yields are
larger in central than peripheral collisions. The difference is mainly caused
by centrality biases to jet-like correlations. Fourier coefficients of the raw
dihadron correlations are also reported. It is found that the first harmonic
coefficient is approximately inversely proportional to event multiplicity,
whereas the second harmonic coefficient is approximately independent of event
multiplicity.
