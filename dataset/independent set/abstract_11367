We give a lower bound for the non-collision probability up to a long time T
in a system of n independent random walks with fixed obstacles on the
two-dimensional lattice. By `collision' we mean collision between the random
walks as well as collision with the fixed obstacles. We give an analogous
result for Brownian particles on the plane. We also explain how this result can
be used to describe in terms of "quasi random walks" a diluted gas evolving
under Kawasaki dynamics or simple exclusion.
