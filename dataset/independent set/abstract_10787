Model-independent bounds are presented for the form-factors describing the
semileptonic decay $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_ce\bar\nu_e$ at the end-point of the
lepton energy spectrum. For the axial-vector form-factor $f_1^A(1)$ we obtain
$f_1^A(1)\leq 0.960\div 0.935$, where the uncertainty arises from the value of
$\mu_\pi^2$, the average kinetic energy of the $b$ quark inside of the
$\Lambda_b$ baryon. A bound is given on the forward matrix element of the axial
current in a $\Lambda_b$ baryon which is relevant for the inclusive
semileptonic decays of the polarized $\Lambda_b$ decays.
