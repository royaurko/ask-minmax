We consider positronium-like bound states of doubly charged fermions.We
consider also $P(CP)$-parity violation in positronium like system (including
quarkonium and lepton antilepton bound states and mesoatoms) which take place
due to $Z^0$-bosons or Higgs bosons exchange.By model independent way we
consider also vector bosons bound states in the Coulomb and Higgs potential and
have shown that in the presence of the Higgs potential effective potential
become less singular and in this case fall down on the center is absent.Vector
bosons energy levels in the magnetic field are considered. Considered magnetism
of electron gas in the finite volume.
