The thermodynamic and dynamical properties of a variable dark energy model
with density scaling as rho_x \propto (1+z)^m, z being the redshift, are
discussed following the outline of Jetzer et al. This kind of models are proven
to lead to the creation/disruption of matter and radiation, which affect the
cosmic evolution of both matter and radiation components in the Universe. In
particular, we have concentrated on the temperature-redshift relation of
radiation, which has been constrained using a very recent collection of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) temperature measurements up to z ~ 3. For the first
time, we have combined this observational probe with a set of independent
measurements (Supernovae Ia distance moduli, CMB anisotropy, large-scale
structure and observational data for the Hubble parameter), which are commonly
adopted to constrain dark energy models. We find that, within the
uncertainties, the model is indistinguishable from a cosmological constant
which does not exchange any particles with other components. Anyway, while
temperature measurements and Supernovae Ia tend to predict slightly decaying
models, the contrary happens if CMB data are included. Future observations, in
particular measurements of CMB temperature at large redshift, will allow to
give firmer bounds on the effective equation of state parameter w_eff of this
kind of dark energy models.
