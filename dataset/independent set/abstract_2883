This paper is devoted to a comparison of early works of Kato and Yosida on
the integration of non-autonomous linear evolution equations $\dot{x} = A(t)x$
in Banach space, where the domain $D$ of $A(t)$ is independent of $t$. Our
focus is on the regularity assumed of $t\mapsto A(t)$ and our main objective is
to clarify the meaning of the rather involved set of assumptions given in
Yosida's classic and highly influential \emph{Functional Analysis}. We prove
Yosida's assumptions to be equivalent to Kato's condition that $t\mapsto A(t)x$
is continuously differentiable for each $x\in D$.
