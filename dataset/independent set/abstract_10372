The conformal invariant character of $\nu$-multicomponent integrable systems
(with $\nu$ branches of gapless excitations) is described from the point of
view of the response to curvature of the two-dimensional space. The
$\nu\times\nu$ elements of the dressed charge matrix are shown to be transition
matrix elements of the zero ($\mu =0$) components of the diagonal generators of
$\nu$ independent Kac-Moody algebras (Cartan currents). The dynamical
decoupling which occurs in these systems is characterized in terms of the
conductivities associated with the $\mu = 1$ components of the Cartan currents.
