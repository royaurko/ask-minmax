We show how the natural context for the definition of parabolic sheaves on a
scheme is that of logarithmic geometry. The key point is a reformulation of the
concept of logarithmic structure in the language of symmetric monoidal
categories, which might be of independent interest. Our main result states that
parabolic sheaves can be interpreted as quasi-coherent sheaves on certain
stacks of roots.
