We evaluate the spin squeezing dynamics of N independent spin-1/2 particles
with exchange symmetry. Each spin interacts with its own reservoir, and the
reservoirs are independently and identical. The spin squeezing parameter is
analytically calculated with different kinds of decoherence. The spin squeezing
property vanishes with evolution time under the Markovian decoherence. Whereas
coupled to the non-Markovian decoherence channels, the spin squeezing property
collapses and revives with time. As spin squeezing can be regarded as a witness
of multipartite entanglement, thus our scheme shows the collapse and revival of
multipartite entanglement under non-Markovian decoherence.
