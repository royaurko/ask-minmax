This note deals with semiclassical measures associated to {(sufficiently
accurate)} quasimodes $(u_h)$ for the Laplace-Dirichlet operator on the disk.
In this time-independent set-up, we simplify the statements of our preprint
arXiv:1406.0681 and their proofs. We describe the restriction of semiclassical
measures to every invariant torus in terms of two-microlocal measures. As
corollaries, we show regularity and delocalization properties for limit
measures of $|u_h|^2 dx$: these are absolutely continuous in the interior of
the disk and charge every open set intersecting the boundary.
