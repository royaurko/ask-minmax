We introduce a random matrix model where the entries are dependent across
both rows and columns. More precisely, we investigate matrices of the form
$\X=(X_{(i-1)n+t})_{it}\in\R^{p\times n}$ derived from a linear process
$X_t=\sum_j c_j Z_{t-j}$, where the $\{Z_t\}$ are independent random variables
with bounded fourth moments. We show that, when both $p$ and $n$ tend to
infinity such that the ratio $p/n$ converges to a finite positive limit $y$,
the empirical spectral distribution of $p^{-1}\X\X^{\T}$ converges almost
surely to a deterministic measure. This limiting measure, which depends on $y$
and the spectral density of the linear process $X_t$, is characterized by an
integral equation for its Stieltjes transform. The matrix $p^{-1}\X\X^{\T}$ can
be interpreted as an approximation to the sample covariance matrix of a
high-dimensional process whose components are independent copies of $X_t$.
