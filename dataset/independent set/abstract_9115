Many experiments are currently looking for evidence of neutrino mass in the
form of neutrino oscillations. Oscillation probabilities are non-linear
functions of the neutrino mixing matrix elements, so most comparisons of data
to theory are based on simplifying models of the mixing matrix. We begin this
dissertation with a review of neutrino interactions and a few of the popular
models describing neutrino masses and mixing. Next we present our
model-independent description of neutrino oscillations and derive the
predictions of various models in terms of our new ``box'' parameterization.
Finally, we use our boxes to find mixing matrices consistent with existing
neutrino data. As more definitive data becomes available, these solutions will
probably need to be adjusted; when such a need arises, our box notation will
provide a convenient method for finding new solutions.
