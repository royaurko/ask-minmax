The set of all m-tuples of compatible full conditional distributions on
discrete random variables is an algebraic set whose defining ideal is a
unimodular toric ideal. We identify the defining polynomials of these ideals
with closed walks on a bipartite graph. Our algebraic characterization provides
a natural generalization of the requirement that compatible conditionals have
identical odds ratios and holds regardless of the patterns of zeros in the
conditional arrays.
