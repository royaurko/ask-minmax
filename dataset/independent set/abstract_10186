In this paper we presented the semantics of database mappings in the
relational DB category based on the power-view monad T and monadic algebras.
The objects in this category are the database-instances (a database-instance is
a set of n-ary relations, i.e., a set of relational tables as in standard
RDBs). The morphisms in DB category are used in order to express the semantics
of view-based Global and Local as View (GLAV) mappings between relational
databases, for example those used in Data Integration Systems. Such morphisms
in this DB category are not functions but have the complex tree structures
based on a set of complex query computations between two database-instances.
Thus DB category, as a base category for the semantics of databases and
mappings between them, is different from the Set category used dominantly for
such issues, and needs the full investigation of its properties. In this paper
we presented another contributions for an intensive exploration of properties
and semantics of this category, based on the power-view monad T and the Kleisli
category for databases. Here we stressed some Universal algebra considerations
based on monads and relationships between this DB category and the standard Set
category. Finally, we investigated the general algebraic and induction
properties for databases in this category, and we defined the initial monadic
algebras for database instances.
