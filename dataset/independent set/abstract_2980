We provide a complete set of results for the scalar 4-point function
appearing in one-loop calculations in QCD, QED, the electroweak Standard Model
and popular extensions thereof. Complex internal masses, which are needed for
calculations involving unstable particles, are supported throughout, whereas
complex momenta are not supported. In particular, for the most general, regular
case we present two independent results in terms of 72 and 32 dilogarithms. In
addition we list explicit results for all soft- and/or collinear-singular cases
in dimensional regularization, mass regularization, and in regularizations of
mixed type. The exceptional case with a vanishing modified Cayley determinant,
which hardly appears in applications, is not considered.
