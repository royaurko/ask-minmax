Let $R$ be a commutative ring and ${\Bbb{A}}(R)$ be the set of ideals with
non-zero annihilators. The annihilating-ideal graph of $R$ is defined as the
graph ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ with vertex set
${\Bbb{A}}(R)^*={\Bbb{A}}\setminus\{(0)\}$ such that two distinct vertices $I$
and $J$ are adjacent if and only if $IJ=(0)$. We characterize commutative
Noetherian rings $R$ whose annihilating-ideal graphs have finite genus
$\gamma(\Bbb{AG}(R))$. It is shown that if $R$ is a Noetherian ring such that
$0<\gamma(\Bbb{AG}(R))<\infty$, then $R$ has only finitely many ideals.
