We obtain estimates on the exponential rate of decay of the relative entropy
from equilibrium for Markov processes with a non-local infinitesimal generator.
We adapt some of the ideas coming from the Bakry-Emery approach to this
setting. In particular, we obtain volume-independent lower bounds for the
Glauber dynamics of interacting point particles and for various classes of
hardcore models.
