We have investigated the gauge dependence of the vacuum expectation
value(VEV) both in the $R_{\xi }$ and the $\overline{R_{\xi }}$ gauge in the
$\overline{MS}$ scheme. We have found that, in case of the $R_{\xi }$ gauge,
the gauge dependence of the VEV should be modified due to the presence of the
parameter in the gauge function that should be identified as a VEV in the
broken symmetry phase. However the pole mass remains gauge independent.
