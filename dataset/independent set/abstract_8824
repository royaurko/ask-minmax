For a weighted outerplanar graph, the set of lex short cycles is known to be
a minimum cycle basis [Inf. Process. Lett. 110 (2010) 970-974 ]. In this work,
we show that the set of lex short cycles is a minimum cycle basis in weighted
partial 2-trees (graphs of treewidth two) which is a superclass of outerplanar
graphs.
