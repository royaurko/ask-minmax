We show how a description of Brownian exponential functionals as a renewal
series gives access to the law of the hitting time of a square-root boundary by
a Bessel process. This extends classical results by Breiman and Shepp,
concerning Brownian motion, and recovers by different means, extensions for
Bessel processes, obtained independently by Delong and Yor.
