Certain correlation functions are computed exactly in the zero coupling limit
of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N). A set of linearly
independent operators that are in one-to-one correspondence with the half-BPS
representations of the SU(N) gauge theory is given. These results are used to
study giant gravitons in the dual AdS5xS5 string theory. In addition, for the
U(N) gauge theory, we explain how to systematically identify contributions
coming from the boundary degrees of freedom.
