We set up a general framework for enriching a subcategory of the category of
noncommutative sets over a category C using products of the objects of a
non-\Sigma operad P in \C. By viewing the simplicial category as a subcategory
of the category of noncommutative sets in two different ways, we obtain two
generalizations of simplicial objects. For the operad given by the Stasheff
associahedra we obtain a model for the 2-sided bar construction in the first
case and the cyclic bar and cobar construction in the second case. Using either
the associahedra or the cyclohedra in place of the geometric simplices we can
define the geometric realization of these objects.
