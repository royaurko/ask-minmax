We propose a novel model-independent method to search for W' bosons at the
Large Hadron Collider by looking at dijets where one jet is identified as a
boosted-top jet and another jet is tagged as a boosted-bottom jet. Performing a
detector simulated signal and background study, we demonstrate that the reach
in effective coupling g' is improved over existing analysis methods by up to
factor of 2 for W' masses above 1.5 TeV, and the reach in mass is extended by
600 GeV to 2.6 TeV at an 8 TeV Large Hadron Collider. We introduce a method for
distinguishing high-energy b jets from light-quark jets, and describe a
previously unexplored set of backgrounds to top-jets. We propose a series of
data-driven samples that might be used to measure the efficiencies for these
new backgrounds in the LHC data.
