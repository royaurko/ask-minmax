We study the existence and the exponential ergodicity of a general
interacting particle system, whose components are driven by independent
diffusion processes with values in an open subset of $\mathds{R}^d$, $d\geq 1$.
The interaction occurs when a particle hits the boundary: it jumps to a
position chosen with respect to a probability measure depending on the position
of the whole system. Then we study the behavior of such a system when the
number of particles goes to infinity. This leads us to an approximation method
for the Yaglom limit of multi-dimensional diffusion processes with unbounded
drift defined on an unbounded open set. While most of known results on such
limits are obtained by spectral theory arguments and are concerned with
existence and uniqueness problems, our approximation method allows us to get
numerical values of quasi-stationary distributions, which find applications to
many disciplines. We end the paper with numerical illustrations of our
approximation method for stochastic processes related to biological population
models.
