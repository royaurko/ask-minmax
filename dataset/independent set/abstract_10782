The effects of the CP violating $\theta$ term in the QCD Lagrangian upon low
energy hadronic phenomenology are reconsidered. Strong CP violating
interactions among Goldstone bosons and octet baryons are incorporated into an
effective chiral Lagrangian framework. The $\theta$ term's impact upon the
decays $\eta\to\pi\pi$ and $\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma$ is then investigated but
found to be extremely small. A refined model independent estimate of
nonanalytic contributions to the neutron electric dipole moment is also
determined using velocity dependent Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory. We
obtain the approximate upper bound $|\theta| < 4.5 \times 10^{-10}$.
