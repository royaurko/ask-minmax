This paper considers estimation and inference of nonparametric conditional
expectation relations with a high dimensional conditioning set. Rates of
convergence and asymptotic normality are derived for series estimators for
models where conditioning information enters in an additively separable manner
and satisfies sparsity assumptions. Conditioning information is selected
through a model selection procedure which chooses relevant variables in a
manner that generalizes the post-double selection procedure proposed in
(Belloni et al., 2014) to the nonparametric setting. The proposed method
formalizes considerations for trading off estimation precision with omitted
variables bias in a nonparametric setting. The results account for both
flexibility in allowing an unknown functional form for the response of the
outcome to regressor of interest and allow a high dimensional set of
confounders. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator
performs favorably in terms of size of tests and risk properties relative to
other estimation strategies.
