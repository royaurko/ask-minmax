We perform a model-independent study of inelastic dark matter at the LHC,
concentrating on the parameter space with the mass splitting between the
excited and ground states of dark matter above a few hundred MeV, where the
direct detection experiments are unlikely to explore. The generic signatures of
inelastic dark matter at the LHC are displaced pions together with a monojet
plus missing energy, and can be tested at the 7 TeV LHC.
