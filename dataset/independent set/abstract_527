Let n be a nonzero integer and assume that a set S of positive integers has
the property that xy+n is a perfect square whenever x and y are distinct
elements of S. In this paper we find some upper bounds for the size of the set
S. We prove that if |n| <= 400 then |S| <= 32, and if |n| > 400 then |S| <
267.81 log|n| (log log|n|)^2. The question whether there exists an absolute
bound (independent on n) for |S| still remains open.
