A thermodynamically consistent particle-based model for fluid dynamics with
continuous velocities and a non-ideal equation of state is presented. Excluded
volume interactions are modeled by means of biased stochastic multiparticle
collisions which depend on the local velocities and densities. Momentum and
energy are exactly conserved locally. The equation of state is derived and
compared to independent measurements of the pressure. Results for the kinematic
shear viscosity and self-diffusion constants are presented. A caging and
order/disorder transition is observed at high densities and large collision
frequency.
