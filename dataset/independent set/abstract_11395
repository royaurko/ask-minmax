The semi-classical limit of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz method is used to
solve the theory of Gaudin models. Via the off-shell method we find the spectra
and eigenvectors of the N-1 independent Gaudin Hamiltonians with symmetry
osp(2|1). We also show how the off-shell Gaudin equation solves the
trigonometric Knizhnik- Zamolodchikov equation.
