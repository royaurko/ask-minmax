When gravitational fields are at their strongest, the evolution of spacetime
is thought to be highly erratic. Over the past decade debate has raged over
whether this evolution can be classified as chaotic. The debate has centered on
the homogeneous but anisotropic mixmaster universe. A definite resolution has
been lacking as the techniques used to study the mixmaster dynamics yield
observer dependent answers. Here we resolve the conflict by using observer
independent, fractal methods. We prove the mixmaster universe is chaotic by
exposing the fractal strange repellor that characterizes the dynamics. The
repellor is laid bare in both the 6-dimensional minisuperspace of the full
Einstein equations, and in a 2-dimensional discretisation of the dynamics. The
chaos is encoded in a special set of numbers that form the irrational Farey
tree. We quantify the chaos by calculating the strange repellor's Lyapunov
dimension, topological entropy and multifractal dimensions. As all of these
quantities are coordinate, or gauge independent, there is no longer any
ambiguity--the mixmaster universe is indeed chaotic.
