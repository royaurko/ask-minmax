With an inferred bolometric luminosity exceeding 10^42 erg/s, HLX-1 in ESO
243-49 is the most luminous of ultraluminous X-ray sources and provides one of
the strongest cases for the existence of intermediate mass black holes. We
obtain good fits to disk-dominated observations of the source with BHSPEC, a
fully relativistic black hole accretion disk spectral model. Due to
degeneracies in the model arising from the lack of independent constraints on
inclination and black hole spin, there is a factor of 100 uncertainty in the
best-fit black hole mass M. Nevertheless, spectral fitting of XMM-Newton
observations provides robust lower and upper limits with 3000 Msun < M < 3 x
10^5 Msun, at 90% confidence, placing HLX-1 firmly in the intermediate-mass
regime. The lower bound on M is entirely determined by matching the shape and
peak energy of the thermal component in the spectrum. This bound is consistent
with (but independent of) arguments based solely on the Eddington limit. Joint
spectral modelling of the XMM-Newton data with more luminous Swift and Chandra
observations increases the lower bound to 6000 Msun, but this tighter
constraint is not independent of the Eddington limit. The upper bound on M is
sensitive to the maximum allowed inclination i, and is reduced to M < 10^5 Msun
if we limit i < 75 deg.
