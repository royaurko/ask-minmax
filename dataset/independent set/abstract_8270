In a previous paper we introduced a notion of "genericity" for countable sets
of curves in the curve complex of a surface S, based on the Lebesgue measure on
the space of projective measured laminations in S. With this definition we
prove that for each fixed g > 1 the set of irreducible genus g Heegaard
splittings of high distance is generic, in the set of all irreducible Heegaard
splittings. Our definition of "genericity" is different and more intrinsic then
the one given via random walks.
