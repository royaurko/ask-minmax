A set-theoretic property called Property S is introduced as a generalization
of the well-known Property B. Property S is named for A.Schrijver who first
used it to formulate an equivalent of the boolean prime ideal theorem. It was
independently introduced by A. Kolany to give a uniform treatment for a variety
of satisfiability problems who then used a generalized resolution method to
determine satisfiability. Here we further investigate Property S and the
resolution method.
