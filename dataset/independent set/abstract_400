Maxwell's derivaion of the distributions of the velocities of molecules is
based on the assumption that the velocity components in the three mutualy
orthogonal directions are independent. Here we note that his assumption, the
phase space is isotropic, in fact nullifies the effect of a variety of
dependencies among the velocity componenets. Thus we can do away with the
independence assumption. Further, we observe that his conclusion regarding
distribution of the velocity components (Gaussian) remains true under a set of
weaker assumptions.
