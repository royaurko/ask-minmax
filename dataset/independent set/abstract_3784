We present an explicit example of a gauge symmetry breaking phase transition
in heterotic models, the dynamics of which are not thermal and can be described
in a well controlled manner throughout. The phase transition is driven by the
evolution of bundle moduli - moduli associated with gauge field vacuum
expectation values in the hidden dimensions. We present the necessary parts of
the four dimensional effective theory including moduli which describe the
embedding of the gauge bundle within the gauge group. We then present exact
cosmological solutions to the system before going on to use them to describe
the phase transition. The explicit nature of our description enables us to plot
how the gauge bosons associated with the symmetries which are broken in the
transition gain masses with time. This is in contrast to the use, for example,
of a brane collision as a modulus driven phase transition. In the course of
this work we find a number of other interesting results. We observe that the
Kahler potential of the system is given by the logarithm of the volume of the
compact space even when bundle moduli are included. We also note that the
dynamics of the gauge bundle mean that small instanton transitions are
classically forbidden for all but a set of measure zero of the initial
conditions of the system. The paper is written in such a manner that the
cosmological description of the phase transition can be read independently of
the derivation of the four dimensional theory.
