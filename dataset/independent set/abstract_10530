The detailed derivation of a theory for transport in quasi-two-dimensional
metals, with small-angle elastic scattering and angle-independent inelastic
scattering is presented. The transport equation is solved for a model Fermi
surface representing a typical cuprate superconductor. Using the small-angle
elastic and the inelastic scattering rates deduced from angle-resolved
photoemission experiments, good quantitative agreement with the observed
anomalous temperature dependence of the Hall angle in optimally doped cuprates
is obtained, while the resistivity remains linear in temperature. The theory is
also extended to the frequency-dependent complex Hall angle.
