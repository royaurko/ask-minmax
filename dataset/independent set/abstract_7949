We obtain a sufficient condition for boundary regularity of quasiminimizers
of the p-energy integral in terms of a Wiener type sum of power type. The
exponent in the sum is independent of the dimension and is explicitly expressed
in terms of p and the quasiminimizing constant. We also show by an example that
the exponent is sharp in a certain sense.
