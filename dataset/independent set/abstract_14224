Let f be a non-invertible holomorphic endomorphism of P^k having an
attracting set A. We show that, under some natural assumptions, A supports a
unique invariant positive closed current \tau, of the right bidegree and of
mass 1. Moreover, if R is a current supported in a small neighborhood of A then
its push-forwards by f^n converge to \tau exponentially fast. We also prove
that the equilibrium measure on A is hyperbolic.
