We propose a simple scheme to swap the non local correlations, characteristic
of a Franson interferometric setup, between pairs of frequency entangled
photons emitted by distinct non linear crystals in a parametric down conversion
process. Our scheme consists of two distinct sources of frequency entangled
photons. One photon of each pair is sent to a separate Mach - Zender
interferometer while the other photons of the pairs are mixed by a beam
splitter and then detected in a Ou - Mandel interferometer. For suitably
postselected joint measuremetns, the photons sent at the Mach -Zender show a
coincidence photocount statistics which depends non locally on the settings of
the two interferometers.
