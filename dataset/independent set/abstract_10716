We present a systematic treatment of the initial conditions and evolution of
cosmological perturbations in a universe containing photons, baryons,
neutrinos, cold dark matter, and a scalar quintessence field. By formulating
the evolution in terms of a differential equation involving a matrix acting on
a vector comprised of the perturbation variables, we can use the familiar
language of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. As the largest eigenvalue of the
evolution matrix is fourfold degenerate, it follows that there are four
dominant modes with non-diverging gravitational potential at early times,
corresponding to adiabatic, cold dark matter isocurvature, baryon isocurvature
and neutrino isocurvature perturbations. We conclude that quintessence does not
lead to an additional independent mode.
