Baizhanov and Baldwin introduced the notion of benign and weakly benign sets
to investigate the preservation of stability by naming arbitrary subsets of a
stable structure. They connected the notion with works of Baldwin, Benedikt,
Bouscaren, Casanovas, Poizat, and Ziegler. Stimulated by those results, we
investigate here the existence of benign or weakly benign sets.
