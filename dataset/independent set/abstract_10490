We show how to coarse grain polymers in a good solvent as single particles,
interacting with density-independent or density-dependent interactions. These
interactions can be between the centres of mass, the mid-points or end-points
of the polymers. We also show how to extend these methods to polymers in poor
solvents and mixtures of polymers. Treating polymers as soft colloids can
greatly speed up the simulation of complex many-polymer systems, including
polymer-colloid mixtures.
