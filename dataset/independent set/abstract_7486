In this work we assess the quality and performance of several novel
dissipative particle dynamics integration schemes that have not previously been
tested independently. Based on a thorough comparison we identify the respective
methods of Lowe and Shardlow as particularly promising candidates for future
studies of large-scale properties of soft matter systems.
