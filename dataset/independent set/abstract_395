A new filter for independent stochastic populations is studied and detailed,
based on recent works introducing the concept of distinguishability in point
processes. This filter propagates a set of hypotheses corresponding to
individuals in a population, using a version of Bayes' theorem for multi-object
systems. Due to the inherent complexity of the general multi-object data
association problem, approximations are required to make the filter tractable.
These approximations are justified and detailed along with explanations for the
modelling choices. The efficiency of this new approach is then demonstrated
through a comparison against one of the most popular multi-object filters.
