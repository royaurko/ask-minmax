If massive compact halo objects (\ms) are detected in ongoing searches, then
\tsmctlmc, the ratio of the optical depth toward the Small and Large Magellanic
Clouds, will be a robust indicator of the flattening of the Galactic dark
matter halo. For a spherical halo, \tsmctlmc\ is about 1.45, independent of
details of the shape of the Galactic rotation curve, the assumed mass of the
Galactic disk and spheroid, and the truncation distance (if any) of the dark
halo. For an E6 halo (axis ratio $c/a = 0.4$), the ratio of optical depths is
\tsmctlmc\ $\sim 0.95$, again independent of assumptions about Galactic
parameters. This ratio can be measured with a precision as good as $\sim 10\%$
depending on the typical mass of the MACHOs. If the halo is highly flattened
(\eg E6) and closely truncated (\eg at twice the solar galactocentric radius),
then the optical depth toward the LMC can be reduced by a factor of about two.
For these extreme parameters, and the assumption of a heavy Galactic disk and
spheroid, the upper limit of the \m\ mass range to which ongoing experiments
are sensitive is reduced from ${\cal O}(10^6)\,M_\odot$ to ${\cal
O}(10)\,M_\odot$.
