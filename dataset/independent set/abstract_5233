Harrington and Soare introduced the notion of an n-tardy set. They showed
that there is a nonempty $\mathcal{E}$ property Q(A) such that if Q(A) then A
is 2-tardy. Since they also showed no 2-tardy set is complete, Harrington and
Soare showed that there exists an orbit of computably enumerable sets such that
every set in that orbit is incomplete. Our study of n-tardy sets takes off from
where Harrington and Soare left off. We answer all the open questions asked by
Harrington and Soare about n-tardy sets. We show there is a 3-tardy set A that
is not computed by any 2-tardy set B. We also show that there are nonempty
$\mathcal{E}$ properties $Q_n(A)$ such that if $Q_n(A)$ then A is properly
n-tardy.
