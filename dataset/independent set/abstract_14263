In this paper we investigate the derivations of filiform Leibniz algebras.
Recall that the set of filiform Leibniz algebras of fixed dimension is
decomposed into three non-intersected families. We found sufficient conditions
under which filiform Leibniz algebras of the first family are
characteristically nilpotent. Moreover, for the first family we classify
non-characteristically nilpotent algebras by means of Catalan numbers. In
addition, for the rest two families of filiform Leibniz algebras we describe
non-characteristically nilpotent algebras, i.e., those filiform Leibniz
algebras which lie in the complementary set to those characteristically
nilpotent.
