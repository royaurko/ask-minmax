The centrality dependence of pseudorapidity density of charged particles and
transverse energy is studied for a wide range of collision energies for
heavy-ion collisions at midrapidity. A two-component model approach has been
adopted to quantify the soft and hard components of particle production, coming
from nucleon participants and binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, respectively.
Within experimental uncertainties, the hard component contributing to the
particle production has been found to be nearly independent of collisions
energy from RHIC to LHC. The suppression of high-$p_{\rm T}$ hadrons and jets
in the medium created in heavy-ion collisions seem to play a role in the nearly
independent collision energy behavior of hard components in particle
production. We also use MC event generators, like HIJING and AMPT to study the
possible effects of the suppression of high $p_{T}$ partons inside the medium
and the effect of the threshold momentum for minijets, contributing to hard
scattering processes.
