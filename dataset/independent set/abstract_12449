In this article we extend independent results of Lusztig and H\'ezard
concerning the existence of irreducible characters of finite reductive groups,
(defined in good characteristic and arising from simple algebraic groups),
satisfying a strong numerical relationship with their unipotent support. Along
the way we obtain some results concerning quasi-isolated semisimple elements.
