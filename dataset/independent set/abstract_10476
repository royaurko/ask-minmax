A high resolution non-adiabatic method for measuring the heat capacity
($C_v$) of bulk samples of condensable gases in the range 7.5-70 K is
described. In this method $C_v$ is evaluated by directly comparing the heating
and cooling rates of the sample temperature for two algebraically independent
heat pulse sequences without explicit use of the thermal conductance between
sample and thermal bath. A fully automated calorimeter for rapid measurement of
$C_v$ of molecular solids utilizing this technique is presented.
