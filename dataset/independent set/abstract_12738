We provide some on-off type criteria for recurrence and transience of
regime-switching diffusion processes using the theory of M-matrix and the
Perron-Frobenius theorem. State-independent and state-dependent
regime-switching diffusion processes in a finite space and a countable space
are both studied. We put forward a finite partition method to deal with
switching process in a countable space. As an application, we improve the known
criteria for recurrence of linear regime-switching diffusion processes, and
provide an on-off type criterion for a kind of nonlinear regime-switching
diffusion processes.
