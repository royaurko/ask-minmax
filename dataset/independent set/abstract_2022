We present a method to analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
young stellar objects (YSOs). Our approach is to fit data with pre-computed 2-D
radiation transfer models spanning a large region of parameter space. This
allows us to determine not only a single set of physical parameter values but
the entire range of values consistent with the multi-wavelength observations of
a given source. In this way we hope to avoid any over-interpretation when
modeling a set of data. We have constructed spectral energy distributions from
optical to sub-mm wavelengths, including new Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry,
for 30 young and spatially resolved sources in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming
region. We demonstrate fitting model SEDs to these sources, and find that we
correctly identify the evolutionary stage and physical parameters found from
previous independent studies, such as disk mass, disk accretion rate, and
stellar temperature. We also explore how fluxes at various wavelengths help to
constrain physical parameters, and show examples of degeneracies that can occur
when fitting SEDs. A web-based version of this tool is available to the
community at http://www.astro.wisc.edu/protostars .
