For $S$ a set of positive integers, and $k$ and $r$ fixed positive integers,
denote by $f(S,k;r)$ the least positive integer $n$ (if it exists) such that
within every $r$-coloring of $\{1,2,...,n\}$ there must be a monochromatic
sequence $\{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{k}\}$ with $x_{i}-x_{i-1} \in S$ for $2 \leq i
\leq k$. We consider the existence of $f(S,k;r)$ for various choices of $S$, as
well as upper and lower bounds on this function. In particular, we show that
this function exists for all $k$ if $S$ is an odd translate of the set of
primes and $r=2$.
