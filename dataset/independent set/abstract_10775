We impose the axial and vector Ward identities on local fermion bilinear
operators in the Sheikholesalami-Wohlert discretization of fermions. From this
we obtain all the coefficients needed to improve the theory at O(a), as well as
the scale and scheme independent renormalization constants, Z_A, Z_V and
Z_S/Z_P.
