The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the main principles of
superconductivity as a phenomenon, valid for every superconductor independently
of its characteristic properties and material. The underlying mechanisms of
superconductivity can be different for various materials, but certain
principles must be satisfied. The chapter introduces four principles of
superconductivity. (The chapter is slightly nodified from the original one in
order to be self-contained.)
