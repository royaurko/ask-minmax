We consider the problem of distinguishing between two arbitrary black-box
distributions defined over the domain [n], given access to $s$ samples from
both. It is known that in the worst case O(n^{2/3}) samples is both necessary
and sufficient, provided that the distributions have L1 difference of at least
{\epsilon}. However, it is also known that in many cases fewer samples suffice.
We identify a new parameter, that provides an upper bound on how many samples
needed, and present an efficient algorithm that requires the number of samples
independent of the domain size. Also for a large subclass of distributions we
provide a lower bound, that matches our upper bound up to a poly-logarithmic
factor.
