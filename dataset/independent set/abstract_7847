In this paper we prove a new degenerated version of Fay's trisecant identity.
The new identity is applied to construct new algebro-geometric solutions of the
multi-component nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. This approach also provides
an independent derivation of known algebro-geometric solutions to the
Davey-Stewartson equations.
