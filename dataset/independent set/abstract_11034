Recently the Bose-Einstein phenomenon has been proposed as possible physical
mechanism underlying the spontaneous symmetry breaking in cold gauge theories.
The mechanism is natural and we use it to drive the electroweak symmetry
breaking. The mechanism can be implemented in different ways while here we
review two simple models in which the Bose-Einstein sector is felt directly or
indirectly by all of the standard model fields. The structure of the
corrections due to the new mechanism is general and independent on the model
used leading to experimental signatures which can be disentangled from other
known extensions of the standard model.
