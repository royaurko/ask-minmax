Classification is one of the major issues in Data Mining Research fields. The
classification problems in medical area often classify medical dataset based on
the result of medical diagnosis or description of medical treatment by the
medical practitioner. This research work discusses the classification process
of Gene Expression data for three different cancers which are breast cancer,
lung cancer and leukemia cancer with two classes which are cancerous stage and
non cancerous stage. We have applied a fuzzy soft set similarity based
classifier to enhance the accuracy to predict the stages among cancer genes and
the informative genes are selected by using Entopy filtering.
