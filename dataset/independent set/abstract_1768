Consider a graph with a set of vertices and oriented edges connecting pairs
of vertices. Each vertex is associated with a random variable and these are
assumed to be independent. In this setting, suppose we wish to solve the
following hypothesis testing problem: under the null, the random variables have
common distribution N(0,1) while under the alternative, there is an unknown
path along which random variables have distribution $N(\mu,1)$, $\mu> 0$, and
distribution N(0,1) away from it. For which values of the mean shift $\mu$ can
one reliably detect and for which values is this impossible? Consider, for
example, the usual regular lattice with vertices of the form \[\{(i,j):0\le
i,-i\le j\le i and j has the parity of i\}\] and oriented edges $(i,j)\to
(i+1,j+s)$, where $s=\pm1$. We show that for paths of length $m$ starting at
the origin, the hypotheses become distinguishable (in a minimax sense) if
$\mu_m\gg1/\sqrt{\log m}$, while they are not if $\mu_m\ll1/\log m$. We derive
equivalent results in a Bayesian setting where one assumes that all paths are
equally likely; there, the asymptotic threshold is $\mu_m\approx m^{-1/4}$. We
obtain corresponding results for trees (where the threshold is of order 1 and
independent of the size of the tree), for distributions other than the Gaussian
and for other graphs. The concept of the predictability profile, first
introduced by Benjamini, Pemantle and Peres, plays a crucial role in our
analysis.
