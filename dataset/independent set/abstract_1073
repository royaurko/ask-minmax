A multivariable generalisation of the Bessel polynomials is introduced and
studied. In particular, we deduce their series expansion in Jack polynomials, a
limit transition from multivariable Jacobi polynomials, a sequence of
algebraically independent eigenoperators, Pieri type recurrence relations, and
certain orthogonality properties. We also show that these multivariable Bessel
polynomials provide a (finite) set of eigenfunctions of the hyperbolic
Sutherland model with external Morse potential.
