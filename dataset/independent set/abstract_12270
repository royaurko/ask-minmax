Subject to strong experimental constraints at low energies, baryon number
violation is nonetheless well motivated from a theoretical point of view. We
examine the possibility of observing baryon-number-violating top-quark
production or decay at hadron colliders. We adopt a model independent effective
approach and focus on operators with minimal mass-dimension. Corresponding
effective coefficients could be directly probed at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) already with an integrated luminosity of 1 inverse femtobarn at 7 TeV,
and further constrained with 30 (100) inverse femtobarns at 7 (14) TeV.
