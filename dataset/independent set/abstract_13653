To any metric space it is possible to associate the cardinal invariant
corresponding to the least number of rectifiable curves in the space whose
union is not meagre. It is shown that this invariant can vary with the metric
space considered, even when restricted to the class of convex subspaces of
separable Banach spaces.  As a corollary it is obtained that it is consistent
with set theory that that any set of reals of size $\aleph_1$ is meagre yet
therer are $\aleph_1$ rectifiable curves in $\Reals^3$ whose union is not
meagre. The consistency of this statement when the phrase ``rectifiable
curves'' is replaced by ``straight lines'' remains open.
