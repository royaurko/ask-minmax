The controversy concerning both the definition of the species and methods for
inferring the boundaries and numbers of species has occupied biologists for
centuries, and the debate itself has become known as the species problem. The
modern theory of evolution depends on a fundamental redefinition of "species".
Here we show that based on the model of evolutionary continuum combined with
fuzzy theory that the evolution system is a uncountable infinite set and
species is a fuzzy set, the contradiction between discrete biological entities
and continuous evolution system is solved, i.e. when a species evolved, the
individuals scattered in space but continuously distributed on time sequences.
Moreover, the calculation methods for species are suggested both in theory and
practice.
