In this paper we study the thermodynamics of a crystalline solid by applying
q-deformed algebra of Fibonacci oscillators through the generalized Fibonacci
sequence of two real and independent deformation parameters q1 and q2. We find
a (q1, q2)-deformed Hamiltonian and consequently the q-deformed thermodynamic
quantities. The results led us to interpret the deformation parameters acting
as disturbance or impurities factors modifying the characteristics of a crystal
structure. More specifically, we found the possibility of adjusting the
Fibonacci oscillators to describe the change of thermal conductivity of a given
element as one inserts impurities.
