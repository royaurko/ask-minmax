The Wigner phase-space distribution function provides the basis for Moyal's
deformation quantization alternative to the more conventional Hilbert space and
path integral quantizations. General features of time-independent Wigner
functions are explored here, including the functional ("star") eigenvalue
equations they satisfy; their projective orthogonality spectral properties;
their Darboux ("supersymmetric") isospectral potential recursions; and their
canonical transformations. These features are illustrated explicitly through
simple solvable potentials: the harmonic oscillator, the linear potential, the
Poeschl-Teller potential, and the Liouville potential.
