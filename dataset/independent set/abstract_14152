We set up a formalism of Maurer-Cartan moduli sets for L-infinity algebras
and associated twistings based on the closed model category structure on formal
differential graded algebras (a.k.a. differential graded coalgebras). Among
other things this formalism allows us to give a compact and manifestly homotopy
invariant treatment of Chevalley-Eilenberg and Harrison cohomology. We apply
the developed technology to construct rational homotopy models for function
spaces.
