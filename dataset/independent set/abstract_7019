Motivated by a work of Boros, Brualdi, Crama and Hoffman, we consider the
sets of (i) possible Perron roots of nonnegative matrices with prescribed row
sums and associated graph, and (ii) possible eigenvalues of complex matrices
with prescribed associated graph and row sums of the moduli of their entries.
To characterize the set of Perron roots or possible eigenvalues of matrices in
these classes we introduce, following an idea of Al'pin, Elsner and van den
Driessche, the concept of row uniform matrix, which is a nonnegative matrix
where all nonzero entries in every row are equal. Furthermore, we completely
characterize the sets of possible Perron roots of the class of nonnegative
matrices and the set of possible eigenvalues of the class of complex matrices
under study. Extending known results to the reducible case, we derive new sharp
bounds on the set of eigenvalues or Perron roots of matrices when the only
information available is the graph of the matrix and the row sums of the moduli
of its entries. In the last section of the paper a new constructive proof of
the Camion-Hoffman theorem is given.
