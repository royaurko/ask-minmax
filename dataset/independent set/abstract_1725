In this work, we discuss the problem of approximating a multivariate function
by discrete least squares projection onto a polynomial space using a specially
designed deterministic point set. The independent variables of the function are
assumed to be random variables, stemming from the motivating application of
Uncertainty Quantification (UQ).
  Our deterministic points are inspired by a theorem due to Andr\'e Weil. We
first work with the Chebyshev measure and consider the approximation in
Chebyshev polynomial spaces. We prove the stability and an optimal convergence
estimate, provided the number of points scales quadratically with the dimension
of the polynomial space. A possible application for quantifying
\textit{epistemic} uncertainties is then discussed. We show that the point set
asymptotically equidistributes to the product-Chebyshev measure, allowing us to
propose a weighted least squares framework, and extending our method to more
general polynomial approximations. Numerical examples are given to confirm the
theoretical results. It is shown that the performance of our deterministic
points is similar to that of randomly-generated points. However our
construction, being deterministic, does not suffer from probabilistic
qualifiers on convergence results. (E.g., convergence "with high probability".)
