We consider exact Lagrangian submanifolds in cotangent bundles. Under certain
additional restrictions (triviality of the fundamental group of the cotangent
bundle, and of the Maslov class and second Stiefel-Whitney class of the
Lagrangian submanifold) we prove such submanifolds are Floer-cohomologically
indistinguishable from the zero-section. This implies strong restrictions on
their topology. An essentially equivalent result was recently proved
independently by Nadler, using a different approach.
