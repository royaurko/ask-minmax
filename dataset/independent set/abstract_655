We solve the problem of spatial distribution of inertial particles that
sediment in Navier-Stokes turbulence with small ratio $Fr$ of acceleration of
fluid particles to acceleration of gravity $g$. The particles are driven by
linear drag and have arbitrary inertia. We demonstrate that independently of
the particles' size or density the particles distribute over fractal set with
log-normal statistics determined completely by the Kaplan-Yorke dimension
$D_{KY}$. When inertia is not small $D_{KY}$ is proportional to the ratio of
integral of spectrum of turbulence multiplied by wave-number and $g$. This
ratio is independent of properties of particles so that the particles
concentrate on fractal with universal, particles-independent statistics. We
find Lyapunov exponents and confirm predictions numerically. The considered
case includes typical situation of water droplets in clouds.
