We address the cost-sensitive feature acquisition problem, where
misclassifying an instance is costly but the expected misclassification cost
can be reduced by acquiring the values of the missing features. Because
acquiring the features is costly as well, the objective is to acquire the right
set of features so that the sum of the feature acquisition cost and
misclassification cost is minimized. We describe the Value of Information
Lattice (VOILA), an optimal and efficient feature subset acquisition framework.
Unlike the common practice, which is to acquire features greedily, VOILA can
reason with subsets of features. VOILA efficiently searches the space of
possible feature subsets by discovering and exploiting conditional independence
properties between the features and it reuses probabilistic inference
computations to further speed up the process. Through empirical evaluation on
five medical datasets, we show that the greedy strategy is often reluctant to
acquire features, as it cannot forecast the benefit of acquiring multiple
features in combination.
