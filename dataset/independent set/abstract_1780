Physical properties of alloys are compared as computed from ``direct'' and
``inverse'' procedures. The direct procedure involves Monte Carlo simulations
of a set of local density approximation (LDA)-derived pair and multibody
interactions {\nu_f}, generating short-range order (SRO), ground states, order-
disorder transition temperatures, and structural energy differences. The
inverse procedure involves ``inverting'' the SRO generated from {\nu_f} via
inverse-Monte-Carlo to obtain a set of pair only interactions {\tilde{\nu}_f}.
The physical properties generated from {\tilde{\nu}_f} are then compared with
those from {\nu_f}. We find that (i) inversion of the SRO is possible (even
when {\nu_f} contains multibody interactions but {\tilde{\nu}_f} does not) but,
(ii) the resulting interactions {\tilde{\nu}_f} agree with the input
interactions {\nu_f} only when the problem is dominated by pair interactions.
Otherwise, {\tilde{\nu}_f} are very different from {\nu_f}. (iii) The same SRO
pattern can be produced by drastically different sets {\nu_f}. Thus, the
effective interactions deduced from inverting SRO are not unique. (iv)
Inverting SRO always misses configuration-independent (but composition-
dependent) energies such as the volume deformation energy G(x); consequently,
the ensuing {\tilde{\nu}_f} cannot be used to describe formation enthalpies or
two-phase regions of the phase diagram, which depend on G(x).
