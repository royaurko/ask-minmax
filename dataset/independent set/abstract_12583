In this paper we investigate how a finite detection efficiency affects three
popular multiplicity distributions, namely the Poisson, the Binomial and the
Negative Binomial distributions. We found that a multiplicity-independent
detection efficiency does not change the characteristic of a distribution,
while a multiplicity-dependent detection efficiency does. We layout a procedure
to study the deviation of moments and their derivative quantities from the
baseline distribution due to a multiplicity-dependent detection efficiency.
