Present human languages display slightly asymmetric log-normal (Gauss)
distribution for size [1-3], whereas present cities follow power law
(Pareto-Zipf law)[4]. Our model considers the competition between languages and
that between cities in terms of growing (multiplicative noise process)[5] and
fragmentation [6]; where, relevant parameters are (naturally) different for
languages and cities. We consider lifetime distribution for old and living
languages and that for old and living cities. We study also the effect of
random elimination (punctuation) within time evolution of languages and cities.
Finally, we assume decreasing exponential distribution for cities over size
with independent random amplitude and random (negative) exponent; and show
that, this gives the Pareto-Zipf law.
