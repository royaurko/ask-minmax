We propose a simple scheme capable of adiabatically splitting an atomic wave
packet using two independent translating traps. Implemented with optical dipole
traps, our scheme allows a high degree of flexibility for atom interferometry
arrangements and highlights its potential as an efficient and high fidelity
atom optical beam splitter.
