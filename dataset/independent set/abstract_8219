We study sets of pure states in a Hilbert space of dimension d which are
mutually unbiased (MU), that is, the squares of the moduli of their scalar
products are equal to zero, one, or 1/d. These sets will be called a MU
constellation, and if four MU bases were to exist for d=6, they would give rise
to 35 different MU constellations. Using a numerical minimisation procedure, we
are able to identify only 18 of them in spite of extensive searches. The
missing MU constellations provide the strongest numerical evidence so far that
no seven MU bases exist in dimension six.
