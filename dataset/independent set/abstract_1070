Recently, Ben Arous and Voiculescu considered taking the maximum of two free
random variables and brought to light a deep analogy with the operation of
taking the maximum of two independent random variables. We present here a new
insight on this analogy: its concrete realization based on random matrices
giving an interpolation between classical and free settings.
