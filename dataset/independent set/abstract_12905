In this article, the reliabilities $R(t)=P(X\geq t)$, when $X$ follows
two-parameter geometric distribution and $R=P(X\leq Y)$, arises under
stress-strength setup, when X and Y assumed to follow two-parameter geometric
independently have been found out. Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and an
Unbiased Estimator (UE) of these have been derived. MLE and UE of the
reliability of k-out-of-m system have also been derived. The estimators have
been compared through simulation study.
