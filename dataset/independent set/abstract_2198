It is shown how to set up a mathematically elegant and fully relativistic
superfluid model that can provide a realistic approximation (neglecting small
anisotropies due to crust solidity, magnetic fields, et cetera, but allowing
for the regions with vortex pinning) of the global structure of a rotating
neutron star, in terms of just two independently moving constituents, one of
which represents the differentially rotating neutron superfluid, while the
other part represents the combination of all the other ingredients, including
the degenerate electrons, the superfluid protons in the core, and the ions in
the crust, whose electromagnetic interactions will tend to keep them locked
together in a state of approximately rigid rotation. Order of magnitude
estimates are provided for relevant parameters such as the resistive drag
coefficient and the maximum pinning force.
