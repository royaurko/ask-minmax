We introduce the notion of numerical (strong) peak function and investigate
the denseness of the norm and numerical peak functions on complex Banach
spaces. Let $A_b(B_X:X)$ be the Banach space of all bounded continuous
functions $f$ on the unit ball $B_X$ of a Banach space $X$ and their
restrictions $f|_{B_X^\circ}$ to the open unit ball are holomorphic. In finite
dimensional spaces, we show that the intersection of the set of all norm peak
functions and the set of all numerical peak functions is a dense $G_\delta$
subset of $A_b(B_X:X)$. We also prove that if $X$ is a smooth Banach space with
the Radon-Nikod\'ym property, then the set of all numerical strong peak
functions is dense in $A_b(B_X:X)$. In particular, when $X=L_p(\mu)$
$(1<p<\infty)$ or $X=\ell_1$, it is shown that the intersection of the set of
all norm strong peak functions and the set of all numerical strong peak
functions is a dense $G_\delta$ subset of $A_b(B_X:X)$.
  In the meanwhile, we study the properties of the numerical radius of an
holomorphic function and the numerical index of subspaces of $A_b(B_X:X)$. As
an application, the existence and properties of numerical boundary of
$A_b(B_X:X)$ are studied. Finally, the numerical peak function in $A_b(B_X:X)$
is characterized when $X=\ell_\infty^n$ and some negative results on the
denseness of numerical (strong) peak holomorphic functions are given.
