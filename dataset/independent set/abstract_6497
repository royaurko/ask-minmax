The problem of maximum likelihood (ML) detection in training-assisted
single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems with phase noise impairments is
studied for two different scenarios, i.e. the case when the channel is
deterministic and known (constant channel) and the case when the channel is
stochastic and unknown (fading channel). Further, two different operations with
respect to the phase noise sources are considered, namely, the case of
identical phase noise sources and the case of independent phase noise sources
over the antennas. In all scenarios the optimal detector is derived for a very
general parametrization of the phase noise distribution. Further, a high
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) analysis is performed to show that
symbol-error-rate (SER) floors appear in all cases. The SER floor in the case
of identical phase noise sources (for both constant and fading channels) is
independent of the number of antenna elements. In contrast, the SER floor in
the case of independent phase noise sources is reduced when increasing the
number of antenna elements (for both constant and fading channels).
