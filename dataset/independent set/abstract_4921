This paper is complementary to the work Rosen-Silverman, which derives a
criteria on the number fields for the independence of Heegner points associated
to them on non-CM elliptic curves. We show that the same criteria holds for CM
elliptic curves. A generalisation of the independence criteria for the Heegner
points associated to an order of fixed conductor of quadratic imaginary fields
can also be found in this paper.
