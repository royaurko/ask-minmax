We study the variations in the Cyclotron Resonant Scattering Feature (CRSF)
during 2011 outburst of the high mass X-ray binary 4U 0115+63 using
observations performed with Suzaku, RXTE, Swift and INTEGRAL satellites. The
wide-band spectral data with low energy coverage allowed us to characterize the
broadband continuum and detect the CRSFs. We find that the broadband continuum
is adequately described by a combination of a low temperature (kT ~ 0.8 keV)
blackbody and a power-law with high energy cutoff (Ecut ~ 5.4 keV) without the
need for a broad Gaussian at ~ 10 keV as used in some earlier studies. Though
winds from the companion can affect the emission from the neutron star at low
energies (< 3 keV), the blackbody component shows a significant presence in our
continuum model. We report evidence for the possible presence of two
independent sets of CRSFs with fundamentals at ~ 11 keV and ~ 15 keV. These two
sets of CRSFs could arise from spatially distinct emitting regions. We also
find evidence for variations in the line equivalent widths, with the 11 keV
CRSF weakening and the 15 keV line strengthening with decreasing luminosity.
Finally, we propose that the reason for the earlier observed anti-correlation
of line energy with luminosity could be due to modelling of these two
independent line sets (~ 11 keV and ~ 15 keV) as a single CRSF.
