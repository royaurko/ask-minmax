In this paper, the dynamics of heuristic algorithms for constructing small
vertex covers (or independent sets) of finite-connectivity random graphs is
analysed. In every algorithmic step, a vertex is chosen with respect to its
vertex degree. This vertex, and some environment of it, is covered and removed
from the graph. This graph reduction process can be described as a Markovian
dynamics in the space of random graphs of arbitrary degree distribution. We
discuss some solvable cases, including algorithms already analysed using
different techniques, and develop approximation schemes for more complicated
cases. The approximations are corroborated by numerical simulations.
