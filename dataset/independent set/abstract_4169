Visualizing and navigating through large astronomy images from a remote
location with current astronomy display tools can be a frustrating experience
in terms of speed and ergonomics, especially on mobile devices. In this paper,
we present a high performance, versatile and robust client-server system for
remote visualization and analysis of extremely large scientific images.
Applications of this work include survey image quality control, interactive
data query and exploration, citizen science, as well as public outreach. The
proposed software is entirely open source and is designed to be generic and
applicable to a variety of datasets. It provides access to floating point data
at terabyte scales, with the ability to precisely adjust image settings in
real-time. The proposed clients are light-weight, platform-independent web
applications built on standard HTML5 web technologies and compatible with both
touch and mouse-based devices. We put the system to the test and assess the
performance of the system and show that a single server can comfortably handle
more than a hundred simultaneous users accessing full precision 32 bit
astronomy data.
