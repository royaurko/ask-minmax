We study the dynamics of a lattice of coupled nonidentical Fitz Hugh-Nagumo
system subject to independent external noise. It is shown that these stochastic
oscillators can lead to global synchronization behavior {\sl without an
external signal}. With the increase of the noise intensity, the system exhibits
coherence resonance behavior. Coupling can enhance greatly the noise-induced
coherence in the system.
