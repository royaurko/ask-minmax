We compute the volume of the convex N^2-1 dimensional set M_N of density
matrices of size N with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt measure. The hyper--area
of the boundary of this set is also found and its ratio to the volume provides
an information about the complex structure of M_N. Similar investigations are
also performed for the smaller set of all real density matrices. As an
intermediate step we analyze volumes of the unitary and orthogonal groups and
of the flag manifolds.
