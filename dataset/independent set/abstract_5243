In this paper, generalised intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets and relations on
generalised intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets are defined and a few of their
properties are studied. An application of generalised intuitionistic fuzzy soft
sets in decision making with respect to degree of preference is investigated.
