A set-labeling of a graph $G$ is an injective function $f:V(G)\to
\mathcal{P}(X)$, where $X$ is a finite set and a set-indexer of $G$ is a
set-labeling such that the induced function $f^{\oplus}:E(G)\rightarrow
\mathcal{P}(X)-\{\emptyset\}$ defined by $f^{\oplus}(uv) = f(u){\oplus}f(v)$
for every $uv{\in} E(G)$ is also injective. An integer additive set-labeling is
an injective function $f:V(G)\rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}_0)$,
$\mathbb{N}_0$ is the set of all non-negative integers and an integer additive
set-indexer is an integer additive set-labeling such that the induced function
$f^+:E(G) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}_0)$ defined by $f^+ (uv) = f(u)+
f(v)$ is also injective. In this paper, we extend the concepts of set-graceful
labeling to integer additive set-labelings of graphs and provide some results
on them.
