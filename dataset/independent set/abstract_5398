Similarity measures provide one of the core tools that enable reasoning about
fuzzy sets. While many types of similarity measures exist for type-1 and
interval type-2 fuzzy sets, there are very few similarity measures that enable
the comparison of general type-2 fuzzy sets. In this paper, we introduce a
general method for extending existing interval type-2 similarity measures to
similarity measures for general type-2 fuzzy sets. Specifically, we show how
similarity measures for interval type-2 fuzzy sets can be employed in
conjunction with the zSlices based general type-2 representation for fuzzy sets
to provide measures of similarity which preserve all the common properties
(i.e. reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity and overlapping) of the original
interval type-2 similarity measure. We demonstrate examples of such extended
fuzzy measures and provide comparisons between (different types of) interval
and general type-2 fuzzy measures.
