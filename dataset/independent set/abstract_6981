The module theorem by Janhunen et al. demonstrates how to provide a modular
structure in answer set programming, where each module has a well-defined
input/output interface which can be used to establish the compositionality of
answer sets. The theorem is useful in the analysis of answer set programs, and
is a basis of incremental grounding and reactive answer set programming. We
extend the module theorem to the general theory of stable models by Ferraris et
al. The generalization applies to non-ground logic programs allowing useful
constructs in answer set programming, such as choice rules, the count
aggregate, and nested expressions. Our extension is based on relating the
module theorem to the symmetric splitting theorem by Ferraris et al. Based on
this result, we reformulate and extend the theory of incremental answer set
computation to a more general class of programs.
