Using a large sample of 38,478 star-forming galaxies selected from the Second
Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database (SDSS-DR2), we derive
analytical calibrations for oxygen abundances from several
metallicity-sensitive emission-line ratios: [N II]/H_alpha, [O III]/[N II], [N
II]/[O II], [N II]/[S II], [S II]/H_alpha, and [O III]/H_beta. This consistent
set of strong-line oxygen abundance calibrations will be useful for future
abundance studies. Among these calibrations, [N II]/[O II] is the best for
metal-rich galaxies due to its independence on ionization parameter and low
scatter. Dust extinction must be considered properly at first. These
calibrations are more suitable for metal-rich galaxies (8.4<12+log(O/H)<9.3),
and for the nuclear regions of galaxies. The observed relations are consistent
with those expected from the photoionization models of Kewley & Dopita (2002).
However, most of the observational data spread in a range of ionization
parameter q from 1*10^7 to 8*10^7 cm s^{-1}, corresponding to logU= -3.5 to
-2.5, narrower than that suggested by the models. We also estimate the (N/O)
abundance ratios of this large sample of galaxies, and these are consistent
with the combination of a "primary" and a dominant "secondary" components of
nitrogen.
