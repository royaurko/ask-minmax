In this work, we conduct a study on the properties of single-{\Lambda}
hypernuclei in the relativistic mean-field theory with the parameter set FSU,
where the isoscalar-isovector coupling has been included to soften the symmetry
energy. In our model, a tensor coupling between {\omega} and {\Lambda} is
employed, which is found to be essential in obtaining the small spin-orbit
interaction in single-{\Lambda} hypernuclei. Our calculated values of {\Lambda}
single-particle energies are in good agreement with the known experimental
data. As a comparison to other existing parameter sets, calculations are also
carried out by using parameterizaions such as NL3 and NL3*. The results show
that the parameter set FSU is as successful as those of NL3 and NL3* in terms
of reproducing the properties of single-{\Lambda} hypernuclei.
