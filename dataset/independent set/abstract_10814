We present a new calculation of the $O(\alpha_s^2)$ coefficient of the
energy-energy correlation function (EEC) using two different schemes to cancel
infrared and collinear poles. The numerical evaluation uses the phase space
slicing and the hybrid subtraction method. Both schemes converge with
decreasing slicing cut. The results are independent of the scheme for small
cuts. For the pure phase space slicing method, the cut must be below $10^{-6}$
to achieve good results. All four approaches agree with each other and confirm
the results of Kunszt and Nason and Glover and Sutton, for the latter also with
respect to contributions of different colour factors.
