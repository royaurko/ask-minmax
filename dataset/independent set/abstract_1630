We discuss a novel approach, the point-to-set correlation functions, that
allows to determine relevant static and dynamic length scales in glass-forming
liquids. We find that static length scales increase monotonically when the
temperature is lowered, whereas the measured dynamic length scale shows a
maximum around the critical temperature of mode-coupling theory. We show that a
similar non-monotonicity is found in the temperature evolution of certain
finite size effects in the relaxation dynamics. These two independent sets of
results demonstrate the existence of a change in the transport mechanism when
the glass-former is cooled from moderately to deeply supercooled states across
the mode-coupling crossover and clarify the status of the theoretical
calculations done at the mean field level.
