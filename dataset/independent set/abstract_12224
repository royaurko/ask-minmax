We follow a polynomial approach to analyse strong stability of linear
difference equations with rationally independent delays. Upon application of
the Hermite stability criterion on the discrete-time homogeneous characteristic
polynomial, assessing strong stability amounts to deciding positive
definiteness of a multivariate trigonometric polynomial matrix. This latter
problem is addressed with a converging hierarchy of linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs). Numerical experiments indicate that certificates of strong stability
can be obtained at a reasonable computational cost for state dimension and
number of delays not exceeding 4 or 5.
