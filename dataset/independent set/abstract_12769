We study the nonlinear waves propagating in metal slot waveguides with a
Kerr-type dielectric core. We develop two independent semi-analytical models to
describe the properties of such waveguides. Using those models we compute the
dispersion curves for the first ten modes of a nonlinear slot waveguide. For
symmetric waveguides we find symmetric, antisymmetric, and asymmetric modes
which are grouped in two families. In addition, we study the influence of the
slot width on the first symmetric and asymmetric modes, and we show that the
dispersion curve of the first asymmetric mode is invariant with respect to the
slot width for high propagation constant values and we provide analytical
approximations of this curve.
