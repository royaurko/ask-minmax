The paper's main result is an effective uniform bound for the finiteness
statement of the Shafarevich Conjecture over function fields. Several results
on the projective geometry of curves are established in the course of the
proof. These results should be of independent interest. As a corollary, a
uniform effective bound for the Mordell Conjecture over function fields is
derived via Parshin's trick.
