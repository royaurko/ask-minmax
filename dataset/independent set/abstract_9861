We have suspended an Al based single-electron transistor whose island can
resonate freely between the source and drain leads forming the clamps. In
addition to the regular side gate, a bottom gate with a larger capacitance to
the SET island is placed underneath to increase the SET coupling to mechanical
motion. The device can be considered as a doubly clamped Al beam that can
transduce mechanical vibrations into variations of the SET current. Our
simulations based on the orthodox model, with the SET parameters estimated from
the experiment, reproduce the observed transport characteristics in detail.
