Let $G$ be a Lie group acting on a vector space $V$. Given a set of
$G$-invariants, one can ask the question : does this set of invariants
characterize the group $G$ ? We recall here some known results, ask questions
and state some conjectures for different choices of invariants : polynomial
functions, orbits, distributions, and different types of groups.
