The curvaton reheating in a non-oscillatory inflationary universe model is
studied in a Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. For different scenarios, the
temperature of reheating is computed. The result tells us that the reheating
temperature becomes practically independent of the Jordan-Brans-Dicke parameter
$w$. This reheating temperature results to be quite different when compared
with that obtained from Einstein`s theory of gravity.
