We study the HBT interferometry of ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions
using a freezeout model in which free pions emerge in the course of the last
binary collisions in the hadron gas. We show that the HBT correlators of both
identical and non-identical pions change with respect to the case of
independent pion production. Practical consequences for the design of the event
generator with the built in Bose-Einstein correlations are discussed. We argue
that the scheme of inclusive measurement of the HBT correlation function does
not require the symmetrization of the multi-pion transition amplitudes
(wave-functions).
