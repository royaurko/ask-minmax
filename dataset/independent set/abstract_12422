A numerical analysis of mechanical frictionless contact between rough
self-affine elastic manifolds was carried out. It is shown that the lower
cutoff wavenumber in surface spectra is a key parameter controlling the
representativity of the numerical model. Using this notion we demonstrate that
for representative surfaces the evolution of the real contact area with load is
universal and independent of the Hurst roughness exponent. By introducing a
universal law containing three constants, we extend the study of this evolution
beyond the limit of infinitesimal area fractions.
