The notion of Macaulayfication, which is analogous of the desingularization,
was introduced by Faltings in 1978 and he construct a Macaulayfication of
quasi-projective scheme whose non-Cohen-Macaulay locus is of dimension 0 or 1
by a characteristic free method. In this paper, we gave a Macaulayfication of a
quasi-projective scheme whose non-Cohen-Macaulay locus is of dimension 2. Of
course out method is independent of the characteristic.
