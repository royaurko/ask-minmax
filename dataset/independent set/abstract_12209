We have analyzed the longitudinally polarized proton target asymmetry data of
the Deep Virtual Compton process recently published by the HERMES collaboration
in terms of Generalized Parton Distributions. We have fitted these new data in
a largely model-independent fashion and the procedure results in numerical
constraints on the $\tilde{H}_\mathrm{Im}$ Compton Form Factor. We present its
$t-$ and $\xi-$ dependencies. We also find improvement on the determination of
two other Compton Form Factors, $H_\mathrm{Re}$ and $H_\mathrm{Im}$.
