Using two independent measurements of the semileptonic CP asymmetry in the
$B_s$ system, we constrain the CP violating phase of the $B_s$ system to be
$\phi_s = -0.70^{+0.47}_{-0.39}$. The data sample corresponds to an integrated
luminosity of 1.1 fb$^{-1}$ accumulated with D0 detector at the Fermilab
Tevatron collider. We also measure the direct CP violating asymmetry in the
decay $B^+ \to J/\psi K^+$ to be $A_{CP}(B^+ \to J/\psi K^+) = +0.0067 \pm
0.0074$(stat)$\pm0.0026$(syst). The data corresponds to an integrated
luminosity of 1.6 fb$^{-1}$.
