We study the structure of quantized enveloping algebras called twisted
Yangians, which are naturally associated with the B, C, and D series of the
classical Lie algebras. We obtain an explicit formula for the formal series
(the Sklyanin determinant) whose coefficients are free generators of the center
of the twisted Yangian. As a corollary we obtain a new system of algebraically
independent generators of the center of the universal enveloping algebra for
the orthogonal and symplectic Lie algebras and find the characteristic
polynomial for the matrix formed by the generators of these Lie algebras.
