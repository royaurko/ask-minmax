Within the possibilistic approach to uncertainty modeling, the paper presents
a modal logical system to reason about qualitative (comparative) statements of
the possibility (and necessity) of fuzzy propositions. We relate this
qualitative modal logic to the many--valued analogues MVS5 and MVKD45 of the
well known modal logics of knowledge and belief S5 and KD45 respectively.
Completeness results are obtained for such logics and therefore, they extend
previous existing results for qualitative possibilistic logics in the classical
non-fuzzy setting.
