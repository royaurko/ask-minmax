For $G$ a finite group, let $\kappa(G)$ be the probability that
$\sigma,\tau\in G$ are conjugate, when $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are chosen
independently and uniformly at random. In this paper, we extend the methods of
Blackburn et al [2012] to show that $n^2\kappa(A_n) \to A$ as $n\to\infty$ for
a constant A, which we will give explicitly.
