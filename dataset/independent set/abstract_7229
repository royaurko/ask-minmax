The goal of this paper is to propose an approach to the formulation of
dynamics for causal sets and coupled matter fields. We start from the continuum
version of the action for a Klein-Gordon field coupled to gravity, and rewrite
it first using quantities that have a direct correspondent in the case of a
causal set, namely volumes, causal relations, and timelike lengths, as
variables to describe the geometry. In this step, the local Lagrangian density
$L(f;x)$ for a set of fields $f$ is recast into a quasilocal expression
$L_0(f;p,q)$ that depends on pairs of causally related points $p \prec q$ and
is a function of the values of $f$ in the Alexandrov set defined by those
points, and whose limit as $p$ and $q$ approach a common point $x$ is $L(f;x)$.
We then describe how to discretize $L_0(f;p,q)$, and use it to define a
discrete action.
