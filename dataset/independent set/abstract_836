This technical note describes a monotone and continuous fixpoint operator to
compute the answer sets of programs with aggregates. The fixpoint operator
relies on the notion of aggregate solution. Under certain conditions, this
operator behaves identically to the three-valued immediate consequence operator
$\Phi^{aggr}_P$ for aggregate programs, independently proposed Pelov et al.
This operator allows us to closely tie the computational complexity of the
answer set checking and answer sets existence problems to the cost of checking
a solution of the aggregates in the program. Finally, we relate the semantics
described by the operator to other proposals for logic programming with
aggregates.
