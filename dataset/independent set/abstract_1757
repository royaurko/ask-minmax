An analysis of the relative motion and point feature model configurations
leading to solution degeneracy is presented, for the case of a Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping system using multicamera clusters with non-overlapping
fields-of-view. The SLAM optimization system seeks to minimize image space
reprojection error and is formulated for a cluster containing any number of
component cameras, observing any number of point features over two keyframes.
The measurement Jacobian is transformed to expose a reduced-dimension
representation such that the degeneracy of the system can be determined by the
rank of a dense submatrix. A set of relative motions sufficient for degeneracy
are identified for certain cluster configurations, independent of target model
geometry. Furthermore, it is shown that increasing the number of cameras within
the cluster and observing features across different cameras over the two
keyframes reduces the size of the degenerate motion sets significantly.
