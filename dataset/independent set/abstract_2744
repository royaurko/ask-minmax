In 1997 Cochran-Orr-Teichner introduced a natural filtration, called the
n-solvable filtration, of the smooth knot concordance group, C. Its terms {F_n}
are indexed by half integers. We show that each associated graded abelian group
G_n=F_n/F_{n.5}, n>1, contains infinite linearly independent sets of elements
of order 2 (this was known previously for n=0,1). Each of the representative
knots is negative amphichiral, with vanishing s-invariant, tau-invariant,
delta-invariants and Casson-Gordon invariants. Moreover each is smoothly slice
in a rational homology 4-ball. In fact we show that there are many distinct
such classes in G_n, distinguished by their classical Alexander polynomials and
by the orders of elements in their higher-order Alexander modules.
