Using the recent precise measurements of eta photopro- duction in proton and
deuteron targets, we extract the ratio of the helicity amplitudes A^n_1/2 /
A^p_1/2, for the excitation of N^*(1535), in the effective Lagrangian
approach, It is fairly model-independent, free from the final-state interaction
effects, and negative as predicted by the quark models. We stress the
importance of polarization observables in further elucidation of the N^*(1520)
photoexcitation amplitudes.
