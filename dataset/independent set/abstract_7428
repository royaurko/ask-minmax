Two equivalent versions of the matrix Fej\'er-Riesz theorem characterize
positive semidefinite matrix polynomials on the complex unit circle
$\mathbb{T}$ and on the real line $\mathbb{R}$. We extend the characterization
to arbitrary closed basic semialgebraic sets $\mathscr{K}\subseteq \mathbb{T}$
and $K\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ by the use of matrix preorderings from real
algebraic geometry. In the $\mathbb{T}$-case the characterization is the same
for all sets $\mathscr{K}$, while in the $\mathbb{R}$-case the
characterizations for compact and non-compact sets $K$ are different.
Furthermore, we study a complexity of the characterizations in terms of a bound
on the degrees of the summands needed. We prove, for which sets $\mathscr{K}$,
$K$ the degrees can be bounded by the degree of the given matrix polynomial and
provide counterexamples for the sets, where this is not possible. At the end we
give an application of results to a matrix moment problem.
