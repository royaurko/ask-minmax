The set D of distinct signed degrees of the vertices in a signed graph G is
called its signed degree set. In this paper, we prove that every non-empty set
of positive (negative) integers is the signed degree set of some connected
signed graph and determine the smallest possible order for such a signed graph.
We also prove that every non-empty set of integers is the signed degree set of
some connected signed graph.
