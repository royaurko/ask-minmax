We study the evolution of universe with a single scalar field of constant
potential minimally coupled to gravity in the brane world cosmology.We find an
exact inflationary solution which is not in slow roll.We discuss the limiting
cases of the solution.We show that at late times the solution is asymptotic to
the de Sitter solution independently of the brane tension. For $t\to 0$ the
solution leads to singularity but the nature of the approach to singularity
depends upon the brane tension.
