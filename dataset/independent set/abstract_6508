We demonstrate a two-crystal mid-infrared dual-wavelength optical parametric
oscillator, synchronously pumped by a high power femtosecond Yb:fiber laser.
The singly-resonant ring cavity, containing two periodically poled lithium
niobate crystals, is capable of generating two synchronized idler wavelengths,
independently tunable over 30 THz in the 2.9 - 4.2 {\mu}m wavelength region,
due to the cascaded quadratic nonlinear effect. The independent tunability of
the two idlers makes the optical parametric oscillator a promising source for
ultrafast pulse generation towards the THz wavelength region, based on
different frequency generation. In addition, the observed frequency doubled
idler within the crystal indicates the possibility to realize a broadband
optical self-phase locking between pump, signal, idler and higher order
generated parametric lights.
