With the help of AMPT default model, we study the influence of initial size
(centrality of collisions) on higher cumulant ratios of net-proton
distributions. If the centrality is presented by impact parameter, there is a
strong centrality dependent, in particular, in those peripheral collisions.
This dependence is slightly reduced if the centrality is presented by number of
participant, or charged multiplicity. However, the dynamical ratios are almost
centrality independent. So the centrality dependence of dynamical ratios at
RHIC beam energy scan are presented.
