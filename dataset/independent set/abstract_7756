We discuss applications of some concepts of Compressed Sensing in the recent
work on invertibility of random matrices due to Rudelson and the contributor. We
sketch an argument leading to the optimal bound N^{-1/2} on the median of the
smallest singular value of an N by N matrix with random independent entries. We
highlight the parts of the argument where sparsity ideas played a key role.
