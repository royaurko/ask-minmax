We present a new algorithm for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which has
provable performance guarantees. In particular, suppose we are given samples of
the form $y = Ax + \eta$ where $A$ is an unknown $n \times n$ matrix and $x$ is
a random variable whose components are independent and have a fourth moment
strictly less than that of a standard Gaussian random variable and $\eta$ is an
$n$-dimensional Gaussian random variable with unknown covariance $\Sigma$: We
give an algorithm that provable recovers $A$ and $\Sigma$ up to an additive
$\epsilon$ and whose running time and sample complexity are polynomial in $n$
and $1 / \epsilon$. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel "quasi-whitening"
step that may be useful in other contexts in which the covariance of Gaussian
noise is not known in advance. We also give a general framework for finding all
local optima of a function (given an oracle for approximately finding just one)
and this is a crucial step in our algorithm, one that has been overlooked in
previous attempts, and allows us to control the accumulation of error when we
find the columns of $A$ one by one via local search.
