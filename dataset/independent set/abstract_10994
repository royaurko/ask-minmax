Barut's formula for the mass of leptons is successfully extended to quarks. A
very simple non-linear scalar field model explains both the N^4 power law
dependence of the mass, and the existence of a cut-off which limits the number
of leptons to three and the number of quarks to five, suggesting that the mass
of the sixth quark is of different origin.
