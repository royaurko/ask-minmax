We report N* masses in the spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 sectors using the method of
QCD Sum Rules. They are based on three independent sets derived from
generalized interpolating fields. The predictive ability of each sum rule is
examined by a Monte-Carlo based analysis procedure in which all three
phenomenological parameters (mass, coupling, threshold) are extracted
simultaneously. A parity projection technique is also studied.
