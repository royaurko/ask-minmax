We derive local kinematic numerators for gauge theory tree amplitudes which
manifestly satisfy Jacobi identities analogous to color factors. They naturally
emerge from the low energy limit of superstring amplitudes computed with the
pure spinor formalism. The manifestation of the color--kinematics duality is a
consequence of the superstring computation involving no more than (n-2)!
kinematic factors for the full color dressed n-point amplitude. The bosonic
part of these results describe gluon scattering independent on the number of
supersymmetries and captures any N^kMHV helicity configuration after
dimensional reduction to D=4 dimensions.
