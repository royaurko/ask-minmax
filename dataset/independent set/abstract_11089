Sum rule constraints dominated by the independent high-scale input,
alpha_s(M_Z), are shown to be satisfied by I=1 spectral data from hadronic tau
decays, but violated by the pre-2005 electroproduction (EM) cross-section data.
Determinations of the Standard Model (SM) hadronic contribution to (g-2)_mu
incorporating tau decay data are thus favored over those based solely on EM
data, implying a SM prediction for (g-2)_mu in agreement with current
experimental results.
