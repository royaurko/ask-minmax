In this paper, we demonstrate that the modified Emden type equation (MEE),
$\ddot{x}+\alpha x\dot{x}+\beta x^3=0$, is integrable either explicitly or by
quadrature for any value of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We also prove that the MEE
possesses appropriate time-independent Hamiltonian function for the full range
of parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In addition, we show that the MEE is
intimately connected with two well known nonlinear models, namely the
force-free Duffing type oscillator equation and the two dimensional
Lotka-Volterra (LV) equation and thus the complete integrability of the latter
two models can also be understood in terms of the MEE.
