Linearly repetitive cut and project sets are mathematical models for
perfectly ordered quasicrystals. In a previous paper we gave a characterization
of all linearly repetitive canonical cut and project sets. In this paper we
extend the classical definition of linear repetitivity to try to discover
whether or not there is a natural class of cut and project sets which are
models for `super perfectly ordered' quasicrystals. In the positive direction,
we demonstrate an uncountable collection of such sets (in fact, a collection
with large Hausdorff dimension) for every choice of dimension of the physical
space. On the other hand we show that, for many natural versions of the
problems under consideration, the existence of these sets turns out to be
equivalent to the negation of a well known open problem in Diophantine
approximation, the Littlewood conjecture.
