The purpose of this article is to show that a $\mathcal{C}^1$ differential
system on $\R^n$ which admits a set of $n-1$ independent $\mathcal{C}^2$
conservation laws defined on an open subset $\Omega\subseteq \R^n$, is
essentially $\mathcal{C}^1$ equivalent on an open and dense subset of $\Omega$,
with the linear differential system $u^\prime_1=u_1, \ u^\prime_2=u_2,..., \
u^\prime_n=u_n$. The main results are illustrated in the case of two concrete
dynamical systems, namely the three dimensional Lotka-Volterra system, and
respectively the Euler equations from the free rigid body dynamics.
