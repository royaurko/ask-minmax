The factorization theorems for transverse momentum distributions of
dilepton/boson production, recently formulated by Collins and
Echevarria-Idilbi-Scimemi in terms of well-defined transverse momentum
dependent distributions (TMDs), allows for a systematic and quantitative
analysis of non-perturbative QCD effects of the cross sections involving these
quantities. In this paper we perform a global fit using all current available
data for Drell-Yan and $Z$-boson production at hadron colliders within this
framework. The perturbative calculable pieces of our estimates are included
using a complete resummation at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy.
Performing the matching of transverse momentum distributions onto the standard
collinear parton distribution functions and recalling that the corresponding
matching coefficient can be partially exponentiated, we find that this
exponentiated part is spin-independent and resummable. We argue that the
inclusion of higher order perturbative pieces is necessary when data from lower
energy scales are analyzed. We consider non-perturbative corrections both to
the intrinsic nucleon structure and to the evolution kernel and find that the
non-perturbative part of the TMDs could be parametrized in terms of a minimal
set of parameters (namely 2-3). When all corrections are included the global
fit so performed gives a $\chi^2/{\rm d.o.f.} \lesssim 1$ and a very precise
prediction for vector boson production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
