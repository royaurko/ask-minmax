I will give an overview on fragmentation functions with particular emphasis
on spin-dependence. A straightforward classification scheme permits to label
all independent fragmentation functions for a given physical situation in an
unambiguous way. In the context of light-cone quantisation the leading twist
fragmentation functions have an intuitive probabilistic interpretation.
