The Singlet-Doublet model of dark matter is a minimal extension of the
Standard Model with dark matter that is a mixture of a singlet and a non-chiral
pair of electroweak doublet fermions. The stability of dark matter is ensured
by the typical parity symmetry, and, similar to a "Bino-Higgsino" system, the
extra matter content improves gauge coupling unification. We revisit the
experimental constraints on the Singlet-Doublet dark matter model, combining
the most relevant bounds from direct (spin independent and spin dependent) and
indirect searches. We show that such comprehensive analysis sets strong
constraints on a large part of the 4-dimensional parameter space, closing the
notorious "blind-spots" of spin independent direct searches. Our results
emphasise the complementarity of direct and indirect searches in probing dark
matter models in diverse mass scale regimes. We also discuss the LHC bounds on
such scenario, which play a relevant role in the low mass region of the dark
matter candidate.
