We measure the effective mass in a dilute two-dimensional electron system in
(111)-silicon by analyzing temperature dependence of the Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations in the low-temperature limit. A strong enhancement of the
effective mass with decreasing electron density is observed. The mass
renormalization as a function of the interaction parameter r_s is in good
agreement with that reported for (100)-silicon, which shows that the relative
mass enhancement is system- and disorder-independent being determined by
electron-electron interactions only.
