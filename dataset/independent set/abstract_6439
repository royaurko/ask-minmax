There has been a substantial amount of research on the relationship between
hippocampal neurogenesis and behaviour over the past fifteen years, but the
causal role that new neurons have on cognitive and affective behavioural tasks
is still far from clear. This is partly due to the difficulty of manipulating
levels of neurogenesis without inducing off-target effects, which might also
influence behaviour. In addition, the analytical methods typically used do not
directly test whether neurogenesis mediates the effect of an intervention on
behaviour. Previous studies may have incorrectly attributed changes in
behavioural performance to neurogenesis because the role of known (or unknown)
neurogenesis-independent mechanisms were not formally taken into consideration
during the analysis. Causal models can tease apart complex causal relationships
and were used to demonstrate that the effect of exercise on pattern separation
is via neurogenesis-independent mechanisms. Many studies in the neurogenesis
literature would benefit from the use of statistical methods that can separate
neurogenesis-dependent from neurogenesis-independent effects on behaviour.
