In program algebra, different instruction sets for Boolean registers are
conceivable. In previous work on instruction sequence size complexity, we chose
instruction sets for Boolean registers that contain only a few of the possible
instructions. In the current paper, we study instruction sequence size bounded
functional completeness of instruction sets for Boolean registers. This work is
among other things a requisite for making progress with proving lower bounds of
non-asymptotic instruction sequence size complexity in cases where auxiliary
Boolean registers may be used.
