In this article, we study the nature of zeros of weakly holomorphic modular
forms. In particular, we prove results about transcendental zeros of modular
forms of higher levels and for certain Fricke groups which extend a work of
Kohnen. Furthermore, we investigate the algebraic independence of values of
weakly holomorphic modular forms.
