We present a halo-independent analysis of direct detection data on "light
WIMPs," i.e. weakly interacting massive particles with mass close to or below
10 GeV/c^2. We include new results from silicon CDMS detectors (bounds and
excess events), the latest CoGeNT acceptances, and recent measurements of low
sodium quenching factors in NaI crystals. We focus on light WIMPs with
spin-independent isospin-conserving and isospin-violating interactions with
nucleons. For these dark matter candidates we find that a low quenching factor
would make the DAMA modulation incompatible with a reasonable escape velocity
for the dark matter halo, and that the tension among experimental data tightens
in both the isospin-conserving and isospin-violating scenarios. We also find
that a new although milder tension appears between the CoGeNT and DAMA annual
modulations on one side and the silicon excess events on the other, in that it
seems difficult to interpret them as the modulated and unmodulated aspects of
the same WIMP dark matter signal.
