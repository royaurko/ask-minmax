We present the energy-dependent power spectral density (PSD) and
cross-spectral properties of Mkn 766, obtained from combining data obtained
during an XMM-Newton observation spanning six revolutions in 2005 with data
obtained from an XMM-Newton long-look in 2001. The PSD shapes and rms-flux
relations are found to be consistent between the 2001 and 2005 observations,
suggesting the 2005 observation is simply a low-flux extension of the 2001
observation and permitting us to combine the two data sets. The resulting PSD
has the highest temporal frequency resolution for any AGN PSD measured to date.
Applying a broken power-law model yields break frequencies which increase in
temporal frequency with photon energy. Obtaining a good fit when assuming
energy-independent break frequencies requires the presence of a Lorentzian at
4.6+/-0.4 * 10^-4 Hz whose strength increases with photon energy, a behavior
seen in black hole X-ray binaries. The cross-spectral properties are measured;
temporal frequency-dependent soft-to-hard time lags are detected in this object
for the first time. Cross-spectral results are consistent with those for other
accreting black hole systems. The results are discussed in the context of
several variability models, including those based on inwardly-propagating
viscosity variations in the accretion disk.
