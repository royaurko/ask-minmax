We show that the Laplace transforms of traces of words in independant unitary
Brownian motions converge towards an analytic function on a non trivial disc.
This results allow to study asymptotics of Wilson loops under the unitary
Yang-Mills measure on the plane. The limiting objects obtained are shown to be
characterized by equations analog to Schwinger-Dyson's ones, named here after
Makeenko and Migdal.
