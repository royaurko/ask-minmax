The independent cross section ratio for production of nuclei from 197Au
targets irradiated with 4 GeV deuterons have been measured by off-line
gamma-spectroscopy. On the basis of the measured independent cross section
ratio of 198m, gAu the average intrinsic angular momentum of the primary
nucleus was estimated by means of a simple statistical-model analysis based on
the formalism developed by Huizenga and Vandenbosch.
