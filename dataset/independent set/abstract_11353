Let S_n:=a_1\vp_1+...+a_n\vp_n, where \vp_1,...,\vp_n are independent
Rademacher random variables (r.v.'s) and a_1,...,a_n are any real numbers such
that a_1^2+...+a_n^2=1. Let Z be a standard normal r.v. It is proved that the
best constant factor c in inequality
  \P(S_n>x) \leq c\P(Z>x) for all x in \R is between two explicitly defined
absolute constants c_1 and c_2 such that c_1<c_2 \approx 1.01c_1.
