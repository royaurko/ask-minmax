Finite photon lifetimes for light fields in an opto-mechanical cavity impose
a bandwidth limit on displacement sensing at mechanical resonance frequencies
beyond the loaded cavity photon decay rate. Opto-mechanical modulation
efficiency can be enhanced via multi-GHz transduction techniques such as
piezo-opto-mechanics at the cost of on-chip integration. In this paper, we
present a novel high bandwidth displacement sense scheme employing Rayleigh
scattering in photonic resonators. Using this technique in conjunction with
on-chip electrostatic drive in silicon enables efficient modulation at
frequencies up to 9.1GHz. Being independent of the drive mechanism, this scheme
could readily be extended to piezo-opto-mechanical and all optical transduced
systems.
