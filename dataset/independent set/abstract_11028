Using generalized Nielsen identities a formal proof is given that the
fermionic quasiparticle dispersion relations in a color superconductor are
gauge independent. This turns out to involve gluonic tadpoles which are
calculated to one-loop order in a two-flavor color superconductor. Regarding
the appearance of gluon tadpoles, we argue that in QCD the color
superconducting phase is automatically color neutral.
