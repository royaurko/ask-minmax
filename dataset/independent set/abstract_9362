Ehrenfest, Born-Oppenheimer, Langevin and Smoluchowski dynamics are shown to
be accurate approximations of time-independent Schr\"odinger observables for a
molecular system avoiding caustics, in the limit of large ratio of nuclei and
electron masses, without assuming that the nuclei are localized to vanishing
domains. The derivation, based on a Hamiltonian system interpretation of the
Schr\"odinger equation and stability of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi
equation, bypasses the usual separation of nuclei and electron wave functions,
includes crossing electron eigenvalues, and gives a different perspective on
the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian systems,
stochastic electron equilibrium states and numerical simulation in molecular
dynamics modeling.
