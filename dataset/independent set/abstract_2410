We review our recent works on tests of perturbative QCD, inspired by the
relation between the hadronic decay of the tau lepton and the e+ e-
annihilation into hadrons. First, we present a set of commensurate scale
relations that probe the self-consistency of leading-twist QCD predictions for
any observable which defines an effective charge. These tests are independent
of the renormalization scheme and scale, and are applicable over wide data
ranges. As an example we apply this approach to R_{e+ e-}. Second, using a
differential form of these conmensurate scale relations, we present a method to
measure the QCD Gell-Mann--Low Psi function.
