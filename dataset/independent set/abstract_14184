Badzioch showed that in the category of simplicial sets each homotopy algebra
of a Lawvere theory is weakly equivalent to a strict algebra. In seeking to
extend this result to other contexts Rosicky observed a key point to be that
each homotopy colimit in simplicial sets admits a decomposition into a homotopy
sifted colimit of finite coproducts, and asked the contributor whether a similar
decomposition holds in the 2-category of categories Cat. Our purpose in the
present paper is to show that this is the case.
