We consider the problem of finding an induced subgraph in a random
$d$-regular graph such that its components have bounded size as the size of the
graph gets arbitrarily large. We show that for any threshold $\tau$, the
largest size density of such an induced subgraph with component sizes bounded
by $\tau$ is at most $2 (\log d)/d$ for asymptotically large $d$. A matching
lower bound is known for independent sets. We also prove an analogous result
for sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs.
