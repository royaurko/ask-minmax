In his works [R1,R2] David Robbins proposed several interrelated conjectures
on the area of the polygons inscribed in a circle as an algebraic function of
its sides. Most recently, these conjectures have been established in the course
of several independent investigations. In this note we give an informal outline
of these developments.
