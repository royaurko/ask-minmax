We introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) for creating sets of tile types
for simulations of the abstract Tile Assembly Model. The language defines
objects known as tile templates, which represent related groups of tiles, and a
small number of basic operations on tile templates that help to eliminate the
error-prone drudgery of enumerating such tile types manually or with low-level
constructs of general-purpose programming languages. The language is
implemented as a class library in Python (a so-called internal DSL), but is
presented independently of Python or object-oriented programming, with emphasis
on supporting the creation of visual editing tools for programmatically
creating large sets of complex tile types without needing to write a program.
