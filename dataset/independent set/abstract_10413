We consider the scattering of an electron from a semi-infinite
one-dimensional random medium. The random medium is characterized by force,
$-\d V/\d L$ being the basic random variable. We obtain an analytical
expression for the stationary delay time ($\tau$) distribution $P_s(\tau)$
within a random phase approximation. Our result agrees with earlier analytical
expressions, where the random potential is taken to be of different kind,
indicating universality of the delay time distribution, i.e., delay time
distribution is independent of the nature of disorder.
