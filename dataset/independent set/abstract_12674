The Internet and Social Media change our way of decision-making. We are no
longer the independent decision makers we used to be. Instead, we have become
networked minds, social decision-makers, more than ever before. This has
several fundamental implications. First of all, our economic theories must
change, and second, our economic institutions must be adapted to support the
social decision-maker, the "homo socialis", rather than tailored to the perfect
egoist, known as "homo economicus".
