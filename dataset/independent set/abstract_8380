A new mathematical notation is proposed for the iteration of functions. It
facilitates the application of the iteration of functions in mathematical and
logical expressions, definitions of sets, and formulations of algorithms.
Illustrations of the notation include definitions of constant points, periodic
points, a filled-in Julia set, the Mandelbrot set, iterations of a logistic
map, the double-approximating procedure for solving the Lorenz equations, a
description of a financial time series, and reordering nonnegative integers
useful for the investigation of the Collatz's (3x+1)/2 convergence problem. The
terms iteral and iteral of function are suggested to name the new denomination.
