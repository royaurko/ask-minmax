Let $I_n$ be the set of involutions in the symmetric group $S_n$, and for $A
\subseteq \{0,1,\ldots,n\}$, let \[ F_n^A=\{\sigma \in I_n \mid \text{$\sigma$
has $a$ fixed points for some $a \in A$}\}. \] We give a complete
characterisation of the sets $A$ for which $F_n^A$, with the order induced by
the Bruhat order on $S_n$, is a graded poset. In particular, we prove that
$F_n^{\{1\}}$ (i.e., the set of involutions with exactly one fixed point) is
graded, which settles a conjecture of Hultman in the affirmative. When $F_n^A$
is graded, we give its rank function. We also give a short new proof of the
EL-shellability of $F_n^{\{0\}}$ (i.e., the set of fixed point-free
involutions), which was recently proved by Can, Cherniavsky, and Twelbeck.
