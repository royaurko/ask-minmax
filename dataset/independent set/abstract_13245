This is a progress report on the extension of the analysis of hep-ph/9909498
to constructing a complete list of O(q^4) terms in the presence of external
fields, directly within Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory (HBChPT) {\it
without having to first construct the relativistic BChPT Lagrangian and then
carry out the ${1\over\rm m}$-reduction}. In addition to a phase rule to
implement all symmetries including charge conjugation invariance directly at
the nonrelativistic level, generalized Jacobi identities, curvature relation
(that relates the commutator of two covariant derivatives to a linear
combination of the traceless and isosinglet field strengths and the commutator
of two axial vector building blocks), Schouten's identity and the relationship
between the antisymmetrized covariant derivative - axial-(building block)
vector commutator and another traceless field strength, are used to ensure
linear independence of the terms and their low energy coupling constants. We
first construct O($q^4$) terms for off-shell nucleons, and then perform the
on-shell reduction, again within HBChPT.
