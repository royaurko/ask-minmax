A universal decoding procedure is proposed for the intersymbol interference
(ISI) Gaussian channels. The universality of the proposed decoder is in the
sense of being independent of the various channel parameters, and at the same
time, attaining the same random coding error exponent as the optimal
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder, which utilizes full knowledge of these unknown
parameters. The proposed decoding rule can be regarded as a frequency domain
version of the universal maximum mutual information (MMI) decoder. Contrary to
previously suggested universal decoders for ISI channels, our proposed decoding
metric can easily be evaluated.
