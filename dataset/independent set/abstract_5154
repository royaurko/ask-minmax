Studying the factorization theory of numerical monoids relies on
understanding several important factorization invariants, including length
sets, delta sets, and $\omega$-primality. While progress in this field has been
accelerated by the use of computer algebra systems, many existing algorithms
are computationally infeasible for numerical monoids with several irreducible
elements. In this paper, we present dynamic algorithms for the factorization
set, length set, delta set, and $\omega$-primality in numerical monoids and
demonstrate that these algorithms give significant improvements in runtime and
memory usage. In describing our dynamic approach to computing
$\omega$-primality, we extend the usual definition of this invariant to the
quotient group of the monoid and show that several useful results naturally
extend to this broader setting.
