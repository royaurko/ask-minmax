We describe an optoelectronic system for simultaneously generating parallel,
independent streams of random bits using spectrally separated noise signals
obtained from a single optical source. Using a pair of non-overlapping spectral
filters and a fiber-coupled superluminescent light-emitting diode (SLED), we
produced two independent 10 Gb/s random bit streams, for a cumulative
generation rate of 20 Gb/s. The system relies principally on chip-based
optoelectronic components that could be integrated in a compact, economical
package.
