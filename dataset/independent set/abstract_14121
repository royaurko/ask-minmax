In the setting of Euclidean space with the Gaussian measure g, we consider
all first-order Riesz transforms associated to the infinitesimal generator of
the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. These operators are known to be bounded on
L^p(g), for 1<p<\infty. We determine which of them are bounded from H^1(g) to
L^1(g) and from L^\infty(g) to BMO(g). Here H^1(g) and BMO(g) are the spaces
introduced in this setting by the first two contributors. Surprisingly, we find that
the results depend on the dimension of the ambient space.
