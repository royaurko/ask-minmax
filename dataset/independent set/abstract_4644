We explore the cosmological implications of the angle-averaged correlation
function, xi(s), and the clustering wedges, xi_perp(s) and xi_para(s), of the
LOWZ and CMASS galaxy samples from Data Release 10 and 11 of the SDSS-III
Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. Our results show no significant
evidence for a deviation from the standard LCDM model. The combination of the
information from our clustering measurements with recent data from the cosmic
microwave background is sufficient to constrain the curvature of the Universe
to Omega_k = 0.0010 +- 0.0029, the total neutrino mass to Sum m_nu < 0.23 eV
(95% confidence level), the effective number of relativistic species to
N_eff=3.31 +- 0.27, and the dark energy equation of state to w_DE = -1.051 +-
0.076. These limits are further improved by adding information from type Ia
supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations from other samples. In particular,
this data set combination is completely consistent with a time-independent dark
energy equation of state, in which case we find w_DE=-1.024 +- 0.052. We
explore the constraints on the growth-rate of cosmic structures assuming
f(z)=Omega_m(z)^gamma and obtain gamma=0.69 +- 0.15, in agreement with the
predictions from general relativity of gamma=0.55.
