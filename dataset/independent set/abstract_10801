In the heavy quark limit, hadrons appear as eigenstates of the light degrees
of freedom under the static color field of the heavy quark. In this formalism,
the weak form factors appear naturally as the overlaps of the initial and final
wavefunctions of the light degrees of freedom, and the Bjorken and Voloshin sum
rules are statements of conservation of probability and energy. Moreover,
parity conservation can lead to a sum rule which relates weak form factors at
different kinematic points. {}From this sum rule, model independent lower
bounds on Isgur--Wise form factors can be obtained analytically.
