Simulated dark matter haloes are fitted by self-similar, universal density
profiles, where the scaled parameters depend only on a scaled (truncation)
radius which, in turn, is supposed to be independent on the mass and the
formation redshift. A criterion for the choice of the best fitting density
profile is proposed, with regard to a set of high-resolution simulations, where
some averaging procedure on scaled density profiles has been performed, in
connection with a number of fitting density profiles. An application is made to
a pair of sets each made of a dozen of high-resolution simulations, which are
available in literature, in connection with two currently used fitting density
profiles, where the dependence of the scaled radius on the mass and the
formation redshift, may be neglected to a first extent. Some features of the
early evolution of dark matter haloes represented by fitting density profiles,
are discussed in the limit of the spherical top-hat model.
