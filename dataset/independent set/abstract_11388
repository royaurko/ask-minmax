An 1D tight-binding version of the Dirac equation is considered; after
checking that it recovers the usual discrete Schr?odinger equation in the
nonrelativistic limit, it is found that for two-valued Bernoulli potentials the
zero mass case presents absence of dynamical localization for specific values
of the energy, albeit it has no continuous spectrum. For the other energy
values (again excluding some very specific ones) the Bernoulli Dirac system is
localized, independently of the mass.
