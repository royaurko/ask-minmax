We prove in this paper that there exists some infinitary rational relations
which are Sigma^0_3-complete Borel sets and some others which are
Pi^0_3-complete. This implies that there exists some infinitary rational
relations which are Delta^0_4-sets but not (Sigma^0_3U Pi^0_3)-sets. These
results give additional answers to questions of Simonnet and of Lescow and
Thomas.
