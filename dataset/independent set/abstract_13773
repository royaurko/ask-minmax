The paper uses the formalism of indexed categories to recover the proof of a
standard final coalgebra theorem, thus showing existence of final coalgebras
for a special class of functors on categories with finite limits and colimits.
As an instance of this result, we build the final coalgebra for the powerclass
functor, in the context of a Heyting pretopos with a class of small maps. This
is then proved to provide a model for various non-well-founded set theories,
depending on the chosen axiomatisation for the class of small maps.
