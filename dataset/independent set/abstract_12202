We discuss how to find the well-covered dimension of a graph that is the
Cartesian product of paths, cycles, complete graphs, and other simple graphs.
Also, a bound for the well-covered dimension of $K_n\times G$ is found,
provided that $G$ has a largest greedy independent decomposition of length
$c<n$.
  Formulae to find the well-covered dimension of graphs obtained by vertex
blowups on a known graph, and to the lexicographic product of two known graphs
are also given.
