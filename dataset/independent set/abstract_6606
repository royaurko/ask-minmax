Say that a cardinal number $\kappa$ is \emph{small} relative to the space $X$
if $\kappa <\Delta(X)$, where $\Delta(X)$ is the least cardinality of a
non-empty open set in $X$. We prove that no Baire metric space can be covered
by a small number of discrete sets, and give some generalizations. We show a
ZFC example of a regular Baire $\sigma$-space and a consistent example of a
normal Baire Moore space which can be covered by a small number of discrete
sets. We finish with some remarks on linearly ordered spaces.
