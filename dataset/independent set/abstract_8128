We prove that if $n$ closed disks $D_1, D_2, ..., D_n$, of the Riemann sphere
are spectral sets for a bounded linear operator $A$ on a Hilbert space, then
their intersection $D_1\cap D_2...\cap D_n$ is a complete $K$-spectral set for
$A$, with $K\leq n+n(n-1)/\sqrt3$. When $n=2$ and the intersection $X_1\cap
X_2$ is an annulus, this result gives a positive answer to a question of A.L.
