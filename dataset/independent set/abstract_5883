We apply to the case of gauge group G = SU(2) in three dimensions a recently
proposed gauge-independent mechanism for confinement that is based on a
particular form of the dual spin foam framework for lattice gauge theory.
Explicit formulae for interaction factors and their asymptotics are introduced
and their behavior in different sectors of the theory are identified and
analyzed. We arrive at several elementary properties of the dual theory that
represent one scenario by which confinement may be realized at weak coupling.
We conclude with an outlook for further development of this approach.
