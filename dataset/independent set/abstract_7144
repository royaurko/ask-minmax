Let K be a number field. For any system of semisimple mod l Galois
representations {\phi_l:Gal_K->GL_N(F_l)} arising from \'etale cohomology,
there exists a finite normal extension L of K such that if we denote
\phi_l(Gal_K) and \phi_l(Gal_L) by respectively \Gamma_l and \gamma_l for all
l, and let S_l be the F_l-semisimple subgroup of GL_N associated to \gamma_l
(or \Gamma_l) by Nori [No87] for all sufficiently large l, then the following
statements hold for all sufficiently large l:
  A(i) The formal character of S_l->GL_N is independent of l and is equal to
the formal character of the tautological representation of the derived group of
the identity component of the monodromy group of the corresponding
semi-simplified l-adic Galois representation.
  A(ii) The non-cyclic composition factors of \gamma_l and S_l(F_l) are
identical. Therefore, the composition factors of \gamma_l are finite simple
groups of Lie type of characteristic l and cyclic groups.
  B(i) The total l-rank rk_l\Gamma_l of \Gamma_l is equal to the rank of S_l
and is therefore independent of l.
  B(ii) The A_n-type l-rank rk_l^{A_n}\Gamma_l of \Gamma_l for n belonging to
N\{1,2,3,4,5,7,8} and the parity of (rk_l^{A_4}\Gamma_l)/4 are independent of
l.
