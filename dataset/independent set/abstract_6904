This investigation completely classifies the spatial chaos problem in plane
edge coloring (Wang tiles) with two symbols. For a set of Wang tiles
$\mathcal{B}$, spatial chaos occurs when the spatial entropy $h(\mathcal{B})$
is positive. $\mathcal{B}$ is called a minimal cycle generator if
$\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B})\neq\emptyset$ and
$\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B}')=\emptyset$ whenever $\mathcal{B}'\subsetneqq
\mathcal{B}$, where $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B})$ is the set of all periodic
patterns on $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ generated by $\mathcal{B}$. Given a set of Wang
tiles $\mathcal{B}$, write $\mathcal{B}=C_{1}\cup C_{2} \cup\cdots \cup C_{k}
\cup N$, where $C_{j}$, $1\leq j\leq k$, are minimal cycle generators and
$\mathcal{B}$ contains no minimal cycle generator except those contained in
$C_{1}\cup C_{2} \cup\cdots \cup C_{k}$. Then, the positivity of spatial
entropy $h(\mathcal{B})$ is completely determined by $C_{1}\cup C_{2}
\cup\cdots \cup C_{k}$.
  Furthermore, there are 39 equivalent classes of marginal positive-entropy
(MPE) sets of Wang tiles and 18 equivalent classes of saturated zero-entropy
(SZE) sets of Wang tiles. For a set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{B}$,
$h(\mathcal{B})$ is positive if and only if $\mathcal{B}$ contains an MPE set,
and $h(\mathcal{B})$ is zero if and only if $\mathcal{B}$ is a subset of an SZE
set.
