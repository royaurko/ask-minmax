Encountered in the literature generalisations of general relativity to
independent area variables are considered, the discrete (generalised Regge
calculus) and continuum ones. The generalised Regge calculus can be either with
purely area variables or, as we suggest, with area tensor-connection variables.
Just for the latter, in particular, we prove that in analogy with corresponding
statement in ordinary Regge calculus (by Feinberg, Friedberg, Lee and Ren),
passing to the (appropriately defined) continuum limit yields the generalised
continuum area tensor-connection general relativity.
