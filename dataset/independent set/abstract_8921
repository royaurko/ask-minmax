Given some set, how hard is it to construct a measure supported by it? We
classify some variations of this task in the Weihrauch lattice. Particular
attention is paid to Frostman measures on sets with positive Hausdorff
dimension. As a side result, the Weihrauch degree of Hausdorff dimension itself
is determined.
