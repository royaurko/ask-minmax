Following the second HST servicing mission in 1997 when the STIS instrument
was installed and the capability for parallel observations was enhanced, a
substantial archive of non-proprietary parallel data has been accumulating. In
this paper, we discuss the use of unfiltered STIS imaging data for a project
that requires deep observations along as many independent lines-of-sight as
possible. We have developed a technique to determine which datasets in the
archive can safely be co-added together and have developed an iterative
co-addition technique which enabled us to produce 498 high-quality, deep
images. The principal motivation for this work is to measure the Cosmic Shear
on small angular scales and a value derived from these data will be presented
in a subsequent paper. A valuable by-product of this work is a set of high
quality combined fields which can be used for other projects. The data are
publicly available at http://www.stecf.org/projects/shear/
