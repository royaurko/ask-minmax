The inclusive NC and CC neutrino(antineutrino)-nucleus scattering for the
case of a nucleus with isotopic spin equal to zero is considered. It is shown
that the measurement of the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry at relatively small
energies could allow to obtain model-independent information about the
contribution of the axial strange current to the cross sections of the NC
processes.
