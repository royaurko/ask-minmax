Type III solar radio storms, observed at frequencies below approximately 16
MHz by space borne radio experiments, correspond to the quasi-continuous,
bursty emission of electron beams onto open field lines above active regions.
The mechanisms by which a storm can persist in some cases for more than a solar
rotation whilst exhibiting considerable radio activity are poorly understood.
To address this issue, the statistical properties of a type III storm observed
by the STEREO/WAVES radio experiment are presented, examining both the
brightness distribution and (for the first time) the waiting-time distribution.
Single power law behavior is observed in the number distribution as a function
of brightness; the power law index is approximately 2.1 and is largely
independent of frequency. The waiting-time distribution is found to be
consistent with a piecewise-constant Poisson process. This indicates that
during the storm individual type III bursts occur independently and suggests
that the storm dynamics are consistent with avalanche type behavior in the
underlying active region.
