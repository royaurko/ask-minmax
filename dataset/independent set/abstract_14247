In this note we introduce in precise mathematical terms some of the empirical
concepts used to describe intermittency in a fully developed turbulence. We
will give definitions of the active turbulent region, volume, eddies, energy
dissipation set, and derive rigorously some power laws of turbulence. In
particular, the formula for the Hausdorff dimension of the energy dissipation
set will be justified, and upper/lower bounds on the energy spectrum will be
obtained.
