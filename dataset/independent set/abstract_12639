A lower bound on the R\'enyi differential entropy of a sum of independent
random vectors is demonstrated in terms of rearrangements. For the special case
of Boltzmann-Shannon entropy, this lower bound is better than that given by the
entropy power inequality. Several applications are discussed, including a new
proof of the classical entropy power inequality and an entropy inequality
involving symmetrization of L\'evy processes.
