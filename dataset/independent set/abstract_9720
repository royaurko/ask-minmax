The transverse and trace-free (TT) part of the extrinsic curvature represents
half of the dynamical degrees of freedom of the gravitational field in the 3 +
1 formalism. As such, it is part of the freely specifiable initial data for
numerical relativity. Though TT tensors in 3-space possess only two degrees of
freedom, they cannot ordinarily be given solely by two differential functions.
However, coordinate expressions depending on two scalar potentials alone have
been derived for all TT tensors in flat space (Conboye and \'O Murchadha 2014
Class. Quantum Grav. 31, 085019), with either a linear or axial symmetry. Since
TT tensors are conformally covariant, these also give TT tensors in
conformally-flat space. Here, this work has been extended to give a
coordinate-independent expression for these TT tensors, also generalizing the
symmetry conditions to invariance along any hypersurface orthogonal Killing
vector.
