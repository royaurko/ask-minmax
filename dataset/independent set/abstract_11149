The Sp(2)-symmetric Lagrangian quantization scheme is represented in a
completely anticanonical form. Antifields are assigned to all field variables
including former "parametric" ones \pi^{Aa}. The antibrackets (F, G)^a as well
as the operators \triangle^a and V^a are extended to include the new
anticanonical pairs \pi^{Aa}, \bar{\phi}_A. A new version of the gauge fixing
mechanism in the Lagrangian effective action is proposed. The corresponding
functional integral is shown to be gauge independent.
