We present a novel method for detecting communities in bipartite networks.
Based on an extension of the $k$-clique community detection algorithm, we
demonstrate how modular structure in bipartite networks presents itself as
overlapping bicliques. If bipartite information is available, the bi-clique
community detection algorithm retains all of the advantages of the $k$-clique
algorithm, but avoids discarding important structural information when
performing a one-mode projection of the network. Further, the bi-clique
community detection algorithm provides a new level of flexibility by
incorporating independent clique thresholds for each of the non-overlapping
node sets in the bipartite network.
