Say that a graph $G$ is \emph{representable in $\R ^n$} if there is a map $f$
from its vertex set into the Euclidean space $\R ^n$ such that $\| f(x) -
f(x')\| = \| f(y) - f(y')\|$ iff $\{x,x'\}$ and $\{y, y'\}$ are both edges or
both non-edges in $G$. The purpose of this note is to present the proof of the
following result, due to Einhorn and Schoenberg: if $G$ finite is neither
complete nor independent, then it is representable in $\R ^{|G|-2}$. A similar
result also holds in the case of finite complete edge-colored graphs.
