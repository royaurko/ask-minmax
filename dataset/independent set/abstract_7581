N=2 string amplitudes, when required to have the Lorentz covariance of the
equivalent N=4 string, describe a self-dual form of N=4 super Yang-Mills in 2+2
dimensions. Spin-independent couplings and the ghost nature of SO(2,2)
spacetime make it a topological-like theory with vanishing loop corrections.
