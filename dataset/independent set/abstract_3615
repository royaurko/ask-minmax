Optical pulling with tractor beams is so far highly dependent on (i) the
property of embedding background or the particle itself , (ii) the number of
the particles and/or (iii) the manual ramping of beam phase. A necessary
theoretical solution of these problems is proposed here. This article
demonstrates a novel active tractor beam for multiple fully immersed objects
with its additional abilities of yielding a controlled rotation and a desired
3D trapping. Continuous and stable long distance levitation, controlled
rotation and 3D trapping are demonstrated with a single optical set-up by using
two coaxial, or even non-coaxial, superimposed non-diffracting higher order
Bessel beams of reverse helical nature and different frequencies. The
superimposed beam has periodic intensity variations both along and around the
beam-axis because of the difference in longitudinal wave-vectors and beam
orders, respectively. The difference in frequencies of two laser beams makes
the intensity pattern move along and around the beam-axis in a continuous way
without manual ramping of phase, which allows for either linear motion (forward
or backward) or angular movement (clockwise or anticlockwise) of fully immersed
multiple particles. As a major contribution, the condition for increasing the
target binding regions is also proposed to manipulate multiple immersed objects
of different sizes and shapes.
