We study two simple $CP$-violating asymmetries of leptons coming from the
decay of $t$ and $\o t$ in $e^+e^- \ra \tt$, which do not need the full
reconstruction of the $t$ or $\o t$ for their measurement. They can arise when
the top quark possesses nonzero electric and weak dipole form factors in the
couplings to the photon and $Z$, respectively. Together, these two asymmetries
can help to determine the electric and weak dipole form factors independently.
If longitudinal beam polarization is available, independent determination of
form factors can be done by measuring only one of the asymmetries. We obtain
estimates of 90\% confidence limits that can be put on these form factors at a
future linear $\ee$ collider operating at $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV.
