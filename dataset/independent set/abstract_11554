The purpose of this paper is to give affirmative answers to two open
questions as follows. Let $(R, \m)$ be a generalized Cohen-Macaulay Noetherian
local ring. Both questions, the first question was raised by M. Rogers \cite
{R} and the second one is due to S. Goto and H. Sakurai \cite {GS1}, ask
whether for every parameter ideal $\q$ contained in a high enough power of the
maximal ideal $\m $ the following statements are true: (1) The index of
reducibility $N_R(\q;R)$ is independent of the choice of $\q$; and (2) $I^2=\q
I$, where $I=\q:_R\m$.
