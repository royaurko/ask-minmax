We show that the $\pi NN$ coupling constant extracted model-independently
from $\bar pp$ charge exchange is subject to a systematic correction, and, more
importantly, that the strong absorption in the critical region prevents a
determination of the coupling constant to high precision using this process.
This attenuates the possible conflict with the value determined from the np
charge exchange cross sections.
