We apply a discrete version of the methodology in \cite{gauss} to obtain a
recursive asymptotic expansion for $\esp[h(W)]$ in terms of Poisson
expectations, where $W$ is a sum of independent integer-valued random variables
and $h$ is a polynomially growing function. We also discuss the remainder
estimations.
