It is known from the work in \cite{Lu:2007bu} of Lu et. al. that the
non-supersymmetric charged D3-brane (with anisotropies in time as well as one
of the spatial directions of D3-brane) of type IIB string theory is
characterized by five independent parameters. By fixing one of the parameters
and zooming into a particular region of space-time we construct a four
parameter family of solution in AdS$_5$, which interpolates between AdS$_5$
black hole and AdS$_5$ soliton (when one of spatial directions in the Poincare
coordinates is compact) by continuously changing the parameters (there is no
need to take a double Wick rotation as is usual to go from one solution to the
other) from one set of values to another. We consider two cases. In the first
case the dilaton is constant for this transition and there are only three
independent parameters, whereas in the second case the dilaton varies and there
are four independent parameters. In the latter case, the solution interpolates
between AdS$_5$ black hole, AdS$_5$ soliton as well as the so-called
`soft-wall' gravity solution of AdS/QCD model. We also compare our solution to
the previously obtained Constable-Myers solution which is helpful in
generalizing the solution for other D$p$ (for $p\neq 3$) branes.
