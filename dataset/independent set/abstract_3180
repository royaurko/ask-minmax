In this contributed paper I review our current knowledge of the local Black
Hole (BH) scaling relations, and their impact on the determination of the local
BH mass function. I particularly emphasize the remaining systematic
uncertainties impinging upon a secure determination of the BH mass function and
how progress can be made. I then review and discuss the evidence for a
different time evolution for separate BH-galaxy scaling relations, and how
these independent empirical evidences can be reconciled with the overall
evolution of the structural properties of the host galaxies. I conclude
discussing BH demography in the context of semi-empirical continuity accretion
models, as well as more complex evolutionary models, emphasizing the general
constraints we can set on them.
