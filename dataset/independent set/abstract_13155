We have measured 492 redshifts (311 new) in the direction of the poor cluster
AWM~7 and have identified 179 cluster members (73 new). We use two independent
methods to derive a self-consistent mass profile, under the assumptions that
the absorption-line galaxies are virialized and that they trace an underlying
Navarro, Frenk & White (1997) dark matter profile: (1) we fit such an NFW
profile to the radial distribution of galaxy positions and to the velocity
dispersion profile; (2) we apply the virial mass estimator to the cluster. With
these assumptions, the two independent mass estimates agree to \sim 15% within
1.7 h^{-1} Mpc, the radial extent of our data; we find an enclosed mass \sim
(3+-0.5)\times 10^{14} h^{-1} M_\odot. The largest potential source of
systematic error is the inclusion of young emission-line galaxies in the mass
estimate.
  We investigate the behavior of the surface term correction to the virial mass
estimator under several assumptions about the velocity anisotropy profile,
still within the context of the NFW model, and remark on the sensitivity of
derived mass profiles to outliers. We find that one must have data out to a
large radius in order to determine the mass robustly, and that the surface term
correction is unreliable at small radii.
