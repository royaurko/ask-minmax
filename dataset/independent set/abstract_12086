We consider the Ginzburg-Landau functional defined over a bounded and smooth
three dimensional domain. Supposing that the magnetic field is comparable with
the second critical field and that the Ginzburg-Landau parameter is large, we
determine a sharp asymptotic estimate of the minimizing energy. In particular,
this shows how bulk superconductivity decreases in average as the applied
magnetic field approaches the second critical field from below. Other estimates
are also obtained which allow us to obtain, in a subsequent paper, a fine
characterization of the second critical field. The approach relies on a careful
analysis of several limiting energies, which is of independent interest.
