We study elementary submodels of a stable homogeneous structure. We improve
the independence relation defined in [T. Hyttinen, On nonstructure of
elementary submodels of a stable homogeneous structure, Fundamenta
Mathematicae, 156(1998): 167-182]. We apply this to prove a structure theorem.
We also show that dop and sdop are essentially equivalent, where the negation
of dop is the property we use in our structure theorem and sdop implies
nonstructure.
