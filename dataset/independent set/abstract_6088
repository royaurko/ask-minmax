In this paper, we extend Stein's method to products of independent beta,
gamma, generalised gamma and mean zero normal random variables. In particular,
we obtain Stein characterisations for mixed products of these distributions,
which include the classical beta, gamma and normal characterisations as special
cases. These characterisations, lead us to closed form formulas, involving the
Meijer $G$-function, for the probability density function and characteristic
function of the mixed product of independent beta, gamma and central normal
random variables.
