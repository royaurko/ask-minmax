Let G be a k-step Carnot group. We prove an isoperimetric-type inequality for
compact C^2-smooth immersed hypersurfaces with boundary, involving the
horizontal mean curvature of the hypersurface. This generalizes an inequality
due to Michael and Simon, and Allard, independently. Some applications are
discussed.
