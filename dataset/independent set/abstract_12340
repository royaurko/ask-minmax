It is commonly observed that objects in a gravitational field experience a
rate of acceleration that is independent of their mass and that, as a result,
all massive objects with the same initial conditions follow the same
trajectory. It is not generally recognized, however, that charged particles in
an electric field experience an acceleration which is \emph{inversely
proportional} to their mass. This dynamical behavior is an interesting clue to
the fundamental nature of the electric force, equally as important as the more
familiar behavior of falling bodies, and seems to be the true significance of
the observed fact that different charged particles have the same magnitude of
charge $e$.
