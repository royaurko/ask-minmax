We construct examples showing that the normalized Lebesgue measure of the
conical limit set of a uniformly quasiconformal group acting discontinuously
on the disc may take any value between zero and one. This is in contrast to
the cases of Fuchsian groups acting on the disc, conformal groups acting
discontinuously on the ball in dimension three or higher, uniformly
quasiconformal groups acting discontinuously on the ball in dimension three or
higher, and discrete groups of biholomorphic mappings acting on the ball in
several complex dimensions. In these cases the normalized Lebesgue measure is
either zero or one.
