The comparative analysis of different sets of the parton distribution
functions (PDFs), based on the description of the whole sets of experimental
data of electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron, is made in the
framework of the model of t-dependence of the generalized parton distributions
(GPDs) with minimum free parameters and some extending variants of the model.
In some cases, a large difference in the description of electromagnetic form
factors of nucleons with using the different sets of PDF are found out. The
different variants of the flavor dependence of the up and down quark form
factors are presented and discussed. The gravitation form factors, obtained
with the different sets of PDF, are also calculated and the anomalous
gravimagnetic moment is compared with the Equivalence Principle. The
calculations of the differential cross sections of the real Compton scattering
are presented.
