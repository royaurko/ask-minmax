The HERMES collaboration has recently published a set of (correlated) beam
charge, beam spin and target spin relative asymmetries for the Deeply Virtual
Compton Scattering process. This reaction allows in principle to access the
Generalized Parton Distributions of the nucleon. We have fitted, in the QCD
leading-order and leading-twist handbag approximation, but in a model
independent way, this set of data and we report our results for the extracted
Compton Form Factors. In particular, we are able to extract constrains on the
$H$ GPD.
