Blue primordial power spectra with a spectral index $n>1$ can lead to a
significant production of primordial black holes in the very early Universe.
The evaporation of these objects leads to a number of observational
consequences and a model independent upper limit of $n \approx 1.4$. In some
cases this limit is strengthened to $n=1.3$. Such limits may be employed to
define the boundary to the region of parameter space consistent with
generalized inflationary predictions. [To appear in Proceedings of the CASE
