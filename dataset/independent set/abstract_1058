We construct a new set of combinations from the mass matrices of the charged
leptons and neutrinos that are invariant under basis transformation, hereafter
{\it the} invariants. We use these invariants to study various symmetries and
neutrino mass textures in a basis independent way. In particular, we show that
by using these invariants the ansatz such as $\mu-\tau$ exchange and reflection
symmetries, various texture zeros and flavor symmetries can be expressed in a
general basis.
