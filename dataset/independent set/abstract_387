We use a link invariant defined by Cimasoni-Florens to compute
\rho-invariants. This generalizes results of Cochran-Teichner and Friedl on
knots to the setting of links. As an application, we prove with only twelve
possible exceptions that the twist knots of algebraic order two are linearly
independent in the topological concordance group.
