Ultracold atomic Fermi gases present an opportunity to study strongly
interacting Fermi systems in a controlled and uncomplicated setting. The
ability to tune attractive interactions has led to the discovery of
superfluidity in these systems with an extremely high transition temperature,
near T/T_F = 0.2. This superfluidity is the electrically neutral analog of
superconductivity; however, superfluidity in atomic Fermi gases occurs in the
limit of strong interactions and defies a conventional BCS description. For
these strong interactions, it is predicted that the onset of pairing and
superfluidity can occur at different temperatures. This gives rise to a
pseudogap region where, for a range of temperatures, the system retains some of
the characteristics of the superfluid phase, such as a BCS-like dispersion and
a partially gapped density of states, but does not exhibit superfluidity. By
making two independent measurements: the direct observation of pair
condensation in momentum space and a measurement of the single-particle
spectral function using an analog to photoemission spectroscopy, we directly
probe the pseudogap phase. Our measurements reveal a BCS-like dispersion with
back-bending near the Fermi wave vector k_F that persists well above the
transition temperature for pair condensation.
