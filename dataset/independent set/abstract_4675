Multiplicity is a key statistic for understanding the formation of very low
mass (VLM) stars and brown dwarfs. Currently, the separation distribution of
VLM binaries remains poorly constrained at small separations ($\leq$ 1 AU),
leading to uncertainty in the overall binary fraction. We approach this problem
by searching for late-M/early-L plus T dwarf spectral binaries whose combined
light spectra exhibit distinct peculiarities, allowing for
separation-independent identification. We define a set of spectral indices
designed to identify these systems, and use a spectral template fitting method
to confirm and characterize spectral binary (SB) candidates from a library of
815 spectra from the SpeX Prism Spectral Libraries. We present eleven new
binary candidates, confirm three previously reported candidates and rule out
two previously identified candidates, all with primary and secondary spectral
types between M7-L7 and T1-T8, respectively. We find that subdwarfs and blue L
dwarfs are the primary contaminants in our sample and propose a method for
segregating these sources. If confirmed by follow-up observations, these
systems may add to the growing list of tight separation binaries, whose orbital
properties may yield further insight into brown dwarf formation scenarios.
