We prove that the form of conditional independence at play in database theory
and independence logic is reducible to the first-order dividing calculus in the
theory of atomless Boolean algebras. This establishes interesting connections
between independence in database theory and stochastic independence. As indeed,
in light of the aforementioned reduction and recent work of Ben-Yaacov [4], the
former case of independence can be seen as the discrete version of the latter.
