We study the application of the Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) scale setting
prescription to event shape distributions in electron-positron collisions. The
renormalization scale is set dynamically according to the BLM method. We study
NLO predictions and we discuss extensions of the prescription to NNLO.
