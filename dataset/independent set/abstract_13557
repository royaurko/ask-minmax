We study the localized direct CP violation in the hadronic decays
$B^\pm\rightarrow \rho^0 (\omega)\pi^\pm\rightarrow\pi^+ \pi^-\pi^\pm$,
including the effect caused by an interesting mechanism involving the charge
symmetry violating mixing between $\rho^0$ and $\omega$. We calculate the
localized integrated direct CP violation when the low invariant mass of
$\pi^+\pi^-$ [$m(\pi^+\pi^-)_{low}$] is near $\rho^0(770)$. For five models of
form factors investigated, we find that the localized integrated direct CP
violation varies from -0.0170 to -0.0860 in the ranges of parameters in our
model when $0.750<m(\pi^+\pi^-)_{low}<0.800$\,GeV. This result, especially the
sign, agrees with the experimental data and is independent of form factor
models. The new experimental data shows that the signs of the localized
integrated CP asymmetries in the regions $0.470<m(\pi^+\pi^-)_{low}<0.770$\,GeV
and $0.770<m(\pi^+\pi^-)_{low}<0.920$\,GeV are positive and negative,
respectively. We find that $\rho$-$\omega$ mixing makes the localized
integrated CP asymmetry move towards the negative direction, and therefore
contributes to the sign change in those two regions. This behavior is also
model independent. We also calculate the localized integrated direct CP
violating asymmetries in the regions $0.470<m(\pi^+\pi^-)_{low}<0.770$\,GeV and
$0.770<m(\pi^+\pi^-)_{low}<0.920$\,GeV and find that they agree with the
experimental data in some models of form factors.
