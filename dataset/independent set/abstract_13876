It has been well-known that for two-way contingency tables with fixed row
sums and column sums the set of square-free moves of degree two forms a Markov
basis. However when we impose an additional constraint that the sum of a
subtable is also fixed, then these moves do not necessarily form a Markov
basis. Thus, in this paper, we show a necessary and sufficient condition on a
subtable so that the set of square-free moves of degree two forms a Markov
basis.
