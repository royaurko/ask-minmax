We present full Stokes observations from SPINOR in the \ion{Ca}{2} infrared
triplet and the \ion{He}{1} multiplet at 1083 nm from which some properties of
spicules have been derived. There are important advantages in multi-line
observations, particularly from different elements. We find that the
orientation of the plane of polarization is very different for the Ca and He
lines, which provides the first direct model-independent evidence for magnetic
fields in spicules. Our data shows that the Ca and He lines have almost
identical widths. Since the Ca atom is 10 times heavier than He, we are able to
conclude that most of the broadening is non-thermal ($\simeq$16 km s$^{-1}$)
and to set an upper limit of 13 kK to the spicular temperatures. The bisectors
of the lines span a velocity range of over 15 km s$^{-1}$ for the He line and
30 km s$^{-1}$ for the Ca ones. The vertical gradient of line-of-sight
velocities is also very different for both elements. We obtain 2.8 km s$^{-1}$
Mm$^{-1}$ from He versus 6.4 km s$^{-1}$ Mm$^{-1}$ from Ca. These properties,
and others from similar observations, should be taken into account in future
physical models of spicules.
