Using the recent result of the SNO solar neutrino experiment, we have
demonstrated in a model independent way that the contribution of Be-7 and other
medium energy neutrinos to the event rate of the Homestake experiment is 4
sigma smaller than the BP2000 SSM prediction. We have considered the
implications of this result for the future BOREXINO experiment.
