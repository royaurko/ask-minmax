We explore the possibility of deriving model independent limits on the
anomalous trilinear electroweak gauge boson couplings from high energy
$e^+e^-\to W^+W^-$, by combining the cross sections for the different initial
and final states polarizations integrated with suitable kinematical cuts. In
the case of the CP conserving couplings the limits can be disentangled, and are
given by simple mathematical expressions. Numerical results show the advantages
of this approach, in particular the important role of polarization in improving
the bounds.
