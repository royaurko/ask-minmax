We quantitatively discuss the possibility of deriving model-independent
constraints on the general four-fermion contact interaction couplings, from the
currently available data on the two-fermion production processes
$e^+e^-\to\mu^+\mu^-$, $b\bar{b}$ and $c\bar{c}$ with unpolarized initial
beams. The method is essentially based on particular, simple, combinations of
the measured total cross section and forward-backward asymmetry that allow
partial separation of the helicity cross sections, and the combination of
experimental data obtained at the different energies of TRISTAN, LEP1 and LEP2.
