We propose to operate a superconducting transition edge sensor (TES) using a
different type of biasing, in which the resistance of the TES is kept constant
by means of feedback on the bias voltage and is independent of the incoming
signal power. By combining a large negative electrothermal feedback with a load
independent resistance, this approach can significantly linearise the response
of the detector in the large signal limit. The electrothermal feedback is
enhanced in comparison with the commonly applied voltage biasing, which further
increases the speed of the detector. Furthermore, in frequency domain
multiplexed (FDM) readout, the sinusoidal bias voltages for each TES can be
generated cryogenically with the readout SQUIDs.
