We investigate the QCD phase diagram as a function of isospin chemical
potential at a fixed temperature by directly putting large numbers of \pi^+s
into the system. Correlation functions of N \pi^+s systems involves N!N!
contractions, and become extremely expensive when N is large. In order to
alleviate this problem, a recursion relation of correlation functions has been
derived in Ref. [1] that substantially reduces the number of independent
contractions needed and makes the study of many pions systems be possible. In
this proceeding this method is investigated numerically. We have also
constructed a new method that is even more efficient, enabling us to study
systems of up to 72 \pi^+s.
