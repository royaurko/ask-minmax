We numerically study the momentum distribution of one-dimensional Bose and
Fermi systems with long-range interaction $g/r^2$ for the ``special'' values
$g= -\frac{1}{2}, 0, 4$, singled out by random matrix theory. The critical
exponents are shown to be independent of density and in excellent agreement
with estimates obtained from $c=1$ conformal finite-size scaling analysis.
