We construct control policies that ensure bounded variance of a noisy
marginally stable linear system in closed-loop. It is assumed that the noise
sequence is a mutually independent sequence of random vectors, enters the
dynamics affinely, and has bounded fourth moment. The magnitude of the control
is required to be of the order of the first moment of the noise, and the
policies we obtain are simple and computable.
