We study discrete fixed point sets of holomorphic self-maps of complex
manifolds. The main attention is focused on the cardinality of this set and its
configuration. As a consequence of one of our observations, a bounded domain in
${\Bbb C}^n$ with no non-trivial holomorphic retractions is constructed.
