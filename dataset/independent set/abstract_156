We show that every (sub)cubic n-vertex graph with sufficiently large girth
has fractional chromatic number at most 2.2978 which implies that it contains
an independent set of size at least 0.4352n. Our bound on the independence
number is valid to random cubic graphs as well as it improves existing lower
bounds on the maximum cut in cubic graphs with large girth.
