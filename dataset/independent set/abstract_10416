We compute the magnetic profile of spin Peierls solitons in a simple
Heisenberg model with magneto elastic couplings, using independently the DMRG
method and the Hartree Fock approximation. Our results agree qualitatively with
published NMR data provided we average over the spin profiles. We conclude that
he dynamics of the spin plus lattice system must be included in a more detailed
theory of the spin Peierls transition in CuGeO.
