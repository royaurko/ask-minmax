We extend the classification of the free fermionic heterotic-string vacua to
models in which the SO(10) GUT symmetry at the string scale is broken to the
flipped SU(5) subgroup. In our classification method, the set of basis vectors
defined by the boundary conditions which are assigned to the free fermions is
fixed and the enumeration of the string vacua is obtained in terms of the
Generalised GSO (GGSO) projection coefficients entering the one-loop partition
function. We derive algebraic expressions for the GGSO projections for all the
physical states appearing in the sectors generated by the set of basis vectors.
This enables the analysis of the entire string spectrum to be programmed in to
a computer code therefore, we performed a statistical sampling in the space of
2^{44} (approximately 10^{13}) flipped $SU(5)$ vacua and scanned up to 10^{12}
GGSO configurations. For that purpose, two independent codes were developed
based on JAVA and FORTRAN95. All the results presented here are confirmed by
the two independent routines. Contrary to the corresponding Pati-Salam
classification, we do not find exophobic flipped SU(5) vacua with an odd number
of generations. We study the structure of exotic states appearing in the three
generation models that additionally contain a viable Higgs spectrum. Moreover,
we demonstrate the existence of models in which all the exotic states are
confined by a hidden sector non-Abelian gauge symmetry as well as models that
may admit the racetrack mechanism.
