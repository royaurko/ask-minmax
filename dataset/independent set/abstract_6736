In this paper we shall introduce some nonmeasurable and completely
nonmeasurable subsets of the plane with various additional properties, e.g.
being Hamel basis, intersecting each line in a strong Luzin / Sierpi\'nski set.
Also some additive properties of Luzin and Sierpi\'nski sets and their
generalization I-Luzin sets, on the line are investigated.
