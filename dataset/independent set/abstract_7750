Existence of nontrivial nonnegative equilibrium solutions for age structured
population models with nonlinear diffusion is investigated. Introducing a
parameter measuring the intensity of the fertility, global bifurcation is shown
of a branch of positive equilibrium solutions emanating from the trivial
equilibrium. Moreover, for the parameter-independent model we establish
existence of positive equilibria by means of a fixed point theorem for conical
shells.
