We use Padoa's principle of independence of primitive symbols in axiomatic
systems in order to discuss the mathematical role of time and space-time in
some classical physical theories. We show that time is eliminable in Newtonian
mechanics and that space-time is also dispensable in Hamiltonian mechanics,
Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, the Dirac electron, classical gauge fields,
and general relativity.
