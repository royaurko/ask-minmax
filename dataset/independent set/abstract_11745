We present a particularly nice Binet-style formula that can be used to
produce the k-generalized Fibonacci numbers (that is, the Tribonaccis,
Tetranaccis, etc). Furthermore, we show that in fact one needs only take the
integer closest to the first term of this Binet-style formula to generate the
desired sequence. These results were also found (independently) at about the
same time by Zhaohui Du of Singapore, China. We are working on a joint paper.
