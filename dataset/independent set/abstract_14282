We study exit times from a set for a family of multivariate autoregressive
processes with normally distributed noise. By using the large deviation
principle, and other methods, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the exit
time depends only on the set itself and on the covariance matrix of the
stationary distribution of the process. The results are extended to exit times
from intervals for the univariate autoregressive process of order n, where the
exit time is of the same order of magnitude as the exponential of the inverse
of the variance of the stationary distribution.
