In order better to understand how dynamo systems saturate, we study the
kinematic dynamo properties of velocity fields that arise from nonlinearly
saturated dynamos. The technique is implemented by solving concurrently, in
addition to the momentum equation, two induction equations, one for the actual
magnetic field, and one for an independent passive field. We apply this
technique to two illustrative examples: convectively driven turbulence, and
turbulence represented by a shell model. In all cases we find that the velocity
remains an efficient kinematic dynamo even after nonlinear saturation occurs.
We discuss the implications to the process of dynamo saturation.
