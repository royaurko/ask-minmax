We study the Euler characteristic of the real Milnor fibres of a real
analytic map, using a relation between complex monodromy and complex
conjugation. We deduce the result of Coste and Kurdyka that the Euler
characteristic of the link of an irreducible algebraic subset of a real
algebraic set is generically constant modulo 4. We generalize this result to
iterated links of ordered families of algebraic subsets.
