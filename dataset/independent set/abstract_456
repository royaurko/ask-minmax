We show that the ordering of the Hanf number of L_{omega, omega}(wo) (well
ordering), L^c_{omega, omega} (quantification on countable sets), L_{omega,
omega}(aa) (stationary logic) and second order logic, have no more restraints
provable in ZFC than previously known (those independence proofs assume
CON(ZFC) only). We also get results on corresponding logics for L_{lambda, mu} .
