For many practical applications of ASP, for instance data integration or
planning, query answering is important, and therefore query optimization
techniques for ASP are of great interest. Magic Sets are one of these
techniques, originally defined for Datalog queries (ASP without disjunction and
negation). Dynamic Magic Sets (DMS) are an extension of this technique, which
has been proved to be sound and complete for query answering over ASP programs
with stratified negation.
  A distinguishing feature of DMS is that the optimization can be exploited
also during the nondeterministic phase of ASP engines. In particular, after
some assumptions have been made during the computation, parts of the program
may become irrelevant to a query under these assumptions. This allows for
dynamic pruning of the search space, which may result in exponential
performance gains.
  In this paper, the correctness of DMS is formally established and proved for
brave and cautious reasoning over the class of super-consistent ASP programs
(ASP^{sc} programs). ASP^{sc} programs guarantee consistency (i.e., have answer
sets) when an arbitrary set of facts is added to them. This result generalizes
the applicability of DMS, since the class of ASP^{sc} programs is richer than
ASP programs with stratified negation, and in particular includes all
odd-cycle-free programs. DMS has been implemented as an extension of DLV, and
the effectiveness of DMS for ASP^{sc} programs is empirically confirmed by
experimental results with this system.
