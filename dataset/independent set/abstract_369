We identify an explicit set of complete and independent Wilson loop
invariants for 2+1 gravity on a three-manifold $M=\R\times\Sigma^g$, with
$\Sigma^g$ a compact oriented Riemann surface of arbitrary genus $g$. In the
derivation we make use of a global cross section of the $PSU(1,1)$-principal
bundle over Teichm\"uller space given in terms of Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates.
