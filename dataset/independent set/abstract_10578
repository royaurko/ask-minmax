We characterize the late-time scaling state of dry, coarsening,
two-dimensional froths using a detailed, force-based vertex model. We find that
the slow evolution of bubbles leads to systematic deviations from 120degree
angles at three-fold vertices in the froth, with an amplitude proportional to
the vertex speed, v ~ sqrt(t), but with a side-number dependence that is
independent of time. We also find that a significant number of T1
side-switching processes occur for macroscopic bubbles in the scaling state,
though most bubble annihilations involve four-sided bubbles at microscopic
scales.
