A Coxeter group W is called reflection independent if its reflections are
uniquely determined by W only, independently on the choice of the generating
set. We give a new sufficient condition for the reflection independence, and
examine this condition for Coxeter groups in certain classes, possibly of
infinite ranks. We also determine the finite irreducible components of another
Coxeter group, that is a subgroup of W generated by the reflections
centralizing a given generator of W. Determining such a subgroup makes our
criterion efficient.
