We provide a set of copulas that can be interpreted as having the negative
extreme dependence. This set of copulas is interesting because it coincides
with countermonotonic copula for a bivariate case, and more importantly, is
shown to be minimal in concordance ordering in the sense that no copula exists
which is strictly smaller than the given copula outside the proposed copula
set. Admitting the absence of the minimum copula in multivariate dimensions
greater than 2, the study of the set of minimal copulas can be important in the
investigation of various optimization problems. To demonstrate the importance
of the proposed copula set, we provide the variance minimization problem of the
aggregated sum with arbitrarily given uniform marginals. As a
financial/actuarial application of these copulas, we define a new herd behavior
index using weighted Spearman's rho, and determine the sharp lower bound of the
index using the proposed set of copulas.
