In the Thomas-Fermi model for the atom or ion, the electric potential $\phi$
and electron density $n$ are both expressed in terms of a screening number
$\chi$ and the radius $x$. The second order differential equation for the
screening function $\chi(x)$ cannot be solved in closed form. Two approximate
formulas for the screening function of the neutral atom are proposed: the first
formula is analytically simple, the second formula has the roles of dependent
and independent variable interchanged. Both formulas reproduce the true
screening function very accurately.
