In contemporary applied and computational mathematics, a frequent challenge
is to bound the expectation of the spectral norm of a sum of independent random
matrices. This quantity is controlled by the norm of the expected square of the
random matrix and the expectation of the maximum squared norm achieved by one
of the summands; there is also a weak dependence on the dimension of the random
matrix. The purpose of this paper is to give a complete, elementary proof of
this important, but underappreciated, inequality.
