We investigate a simplified model of two fully connected magnetic systems
maintained at different temperatures by virtue of being connected to two
independent thermal baths while simultaneously being inter-connected with each
other. Using generating functional analysis, commonly used in statistical
mechanics, we find exactly soluble expressions for their individual
magnetisations that define a two-dimensional non-linear map, the equations of
which have the same form as those obtained for densely connected equilibrium
systems. Steady states correspond to the fixed points of this map, separating
the parameter space into a rich set of non-equilibrium phases that we analyse
in asymptotically high and low (non-equilibrium) temperature limits. The
theoretical formalism is shown to subvert to the classical non-equilibrium
steady state problem for two interacting systems with a non-zero heat transfer
between them that catalyses a phase transition between ambient non-equilibrium
states.
