Leptonic unitarity triangle (LUT) provides a geometric description of CP
violations in the lepton-neutrino sector and is directly measurable in
principle. In this work, we reveal that the angles in the LUT have definite
physical meaning, and demonstrate the exact connection of the LUT to neutrino
oscillations. For the first time, we prove that these leptonic angles act as
phase shifts in neutrino oscillations, by shifting \Delta m^{2}L/2E to \Delta
m^{2}L/2E + \alpha, where (L, E, \alpha) denote the baseline length, neutrino
energy and corresponding angle of the LUT. Each LUT has three independent
parameters and contains only partial information of the PMNS matrix. We
demonstrate that the partial information in each LUT can describe the
corresponding neutrino oscillation. Hence, for the first time, we uncover that
any given kind of neutrino oscillations contain at most three (rather than
four) independent degrees of freedom from the PMNS matrix. This may provide a
cleaner way for fitting the corresponding oscillation data.
