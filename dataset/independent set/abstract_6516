We consider effects of the spin degree of freedom on the nanomechanics of a
single-electron transistor (SET) containing a nanometer-sized metallic cluster
suspended between two magnetic leads. It is shown that in such a
nanoelectromechanical SET(NEM-SET) the onset of an electromechanical
instability leading to cluster vibrations and "shuttle" transport of electrons
between the leads can be controlled by an external magnetic field. Different
stable regimes of this spintronic NEM-SET operation are analyzed. Two different
scenarios for the onset of shuttle vibrations are found.
