We study non-Gaussian random fields constructed by the selection normal
distribution, and we term them selection Gaussian random fields. The selection
Gaussian random field can capture skewness, multi-modality, and to some extend
heavy tails in the marginal distribution. We present a Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm for efficient simulation of realizations from the random field, and a
numerical algorithm for estimating model parameters by maximum likelihood. The
algorithms are demonstrated and evaluated on synthetic cases and on a real
seismic data set from the North Sea. In the North Sea data set we are able to
reduce the mean square prediction error by 20-40% compared to a Gaussian model,
and we obtain more reliable prediction intervals.
