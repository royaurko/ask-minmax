Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. A family
$\mathcal{S}$ of nonempty sets $\{S_1,\ldots,S_n\}$ is a set representation of
$G$ if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices $v_1,
\ldots, v_n$ in $V(G)$ and the sets in $\mathcal{S}$ such that $v_iv_j \in
E(G)$ if and only if $S_i\cap S_j\neq \es$. A set representation $\mathcal{S}$
is a distinct (respectively, antichain, uniform and simple) set representation
if any two sets $S_i$ and $S_j$ in $\mathcal{S}$ have the property $S_i\neq
S_j$ (respectively, $S_i\nsubseteq S_j$, $|S_i|=|S_j|$ and $|S_i\cap
S_j|\leqslant 1$). Let $U(\mathcal{S})=\bigcup_{i=1}^n S_i$. Two set
representations $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{S}'$ are isomorphic if
$\mathcal{S}'$ can be obtained from $\mathcal{S}$ by a bijection from
$U(\mathcal{S})$ to $U(\mathcal{S}')$. Let $F$ denote a class of set
representations of a graph $G$. The type of $F$ is the number of equivalence
classes under the isomorphism relation. In this paper, we investigate types of
set representations for linegraphs. We determine the types for the following
categories of set representations: simple-distinct, simple-antichain,
simple-uniform and simple-distinct-uniform.
