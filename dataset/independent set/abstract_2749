An old result by Shearer relates the Lov\'asz Local Lemma with the
independent set polynomial on graphs, and consequently, as observed by Scott
and Sokal, with the partition function of the hard core lattice gas on graphs.
We use this connection and a recent result on the analyticity of the logarithm
of the partition function of the abstract polymer gas to get an improved
version of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma. As applications we obtain tighter bounds
on conditions for the existence of latin transversal matrices and the
satisfiability of k-SAT forms.
