Model-independent consequences of applying a generalized hidden horizontal
Z_2 symmetry to the neutrino mass matrix are explored. The Dirac CP phase
delta_D can be expressed in terms of the three mixing angles as 4 c_a s_a c_s
s_s s_x cos delta_D = (s^2_s - c^2_s s^2_x) (c^2_a - s^2_a) where the s_i, c_i
are sines and cosines of the atmospheric, solar, and reactor angles. This
relation is independent of neutrino masses and whether neutrinos are Dirac- or
Majorana-type. Given the present constraints on the angles, delta_D is
constrained to be almost maximal, a result which can be explored in experiments
such as NOvA and T2K. The Majorana CP phases do not receive any constraint and
are thus model-dependent. Also a distribution of theta_x with a lower limit is
obtained without specifying delta_D.
