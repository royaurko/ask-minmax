Scattering on the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric Coulomb potential is studied along a
U-shaped trajectory circumventing the origin in the complex $x$ plane from
below. This trajectory reflects ${\cal PT}$ symmetry, sets the appropriate
boundary conditions for bound states and also allows the restoration of the
correct sign of the energy eigenvalues. Scattering states are composed from the
two linearly independent solutions valid for non-integer values of the 2L
parameter, which would correspond to the angular momentum in the usual
Hermitian setting. Transmission and reflection coefficients are written in
closed analytic form and it is shown that similarly to other ${\cal
PT}$-symmetric scattering systems the latter exhibit handedness effect.
Bound-state energies are recovered from the poles of the transmission
coefficients.
