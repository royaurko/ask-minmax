Digital world is growing very fast and become more complex in the volume
(terabyte to petabyte), variety (structured and un-structured and hybrid),
velocity (high speed in growth) in nature. This refers to as Big Data that is a
global phenomenon. This is typically considered to be a data collection that
has grown so large it can not be effectively managed or exploited using
conventional data management tools: e.g., classic relational database
management systems (RDBMS) or conventional search engines. To handle this
problem, traditional RDBMS are complemented by specifically designed a rich set
of alternative DBMS; such as - NoSQL, NewSQL and Search-based systems. This
paper motivation is to provide - classification, characteristics and evaluation
of NoSQL databases in Big Data Analytics. This report is intended to help
users, especially to the organizations to obtain an independent understanding
of the strengths and weaknesses of various NoSQL database approaches to
supporting applications that process huge volumes of data.
