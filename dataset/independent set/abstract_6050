We present a systematic halo-independent analysis of available Weakly
Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP) direct detection data within the framework
of Inelastic Dark Matter (IDM). We show that, when the smallest number of
assumptions is made on the WIMP velocity distribution in the halo of our
Galaxy, it is possible to find values of the WIMP mass and the IDM mass
splitting for which compatibility between present constraints and any of the
three experiments claiming to see a WIMP excess among DAMA, CDMS-Si and CRESST
can be achieved.
