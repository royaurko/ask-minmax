In order to simplify and optimize the operation of our home made torque
magnetometer we created a new software system. The architecture is based on
parallel, independently running instrument handlers communicating with a main
control program. All programs are designed as command driven state machines
which greatly simplifies their maintenance and expansion. Moreover, as the main
program may receive commands not only from the user interface, but also from
other parallel running programs, an easy way of automation is achieved. A
program working through a text file containing a sequence of commands and
sending them to the main program suffices to automatically have the system
conduct a complex set of measurements. In this paper we describe the system's
architecture and its implementation in LabVIEW.
