In this paper we have applied the cluster-expansion ansatz for the wave
operator \Omega which incorporates the orbital relaxation and correlation
effects in an efficient manner. We have used both ordinary and normal ordered
cluster operator (\Omega) to compute the ionization potential for different
states of Ne, Ar, and Kr. The result in our calculation clearly shows how the
relaxation and correlation effects play the role in determining the ionization
potential, one of the interesting aspects in theoretical spectroscopy.
