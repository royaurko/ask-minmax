We explore the phenomenological implications on non-minimal flavor violating
(NMFV) processes from squark flavor mixing within the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model. We work under the model-independent hypothesis of general
flavor mixing in the squark sector, being parametrized by a complete set of
dimensionless delta^AB_ij (A,B = L, R; i,j = u, c, t or d, s, b) parameters.
The present upper bounds on the most relevant NMFV processes, together with the
requirement of compatibility in the choice of the MSSM parameters with the
recent LHC and g-2 data, lead to updated constraints on all squark flavor
mixing parameters.
