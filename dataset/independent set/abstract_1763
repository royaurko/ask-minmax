We consider top-antitop quark ($t{\bar t}$) production at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) with subsequent decay into dileptonic and lepton plus jets final
states. We present a set of leptonic angular correlations and distributions
with which experiments can probe all the independent coefficient functions of
the top-spin dependent parts of the $t{\bar t}$ production spin density
matrices. We compute these angular correlations and distributions for LHC
center-of-mass energies 8, 13, and 14 TeV within the Standard Model at
next-to-leading order in the QCD coupling including the mixed QCD-weak
corrections and for the transverse top-quark polarization and the $t{\bar t}$
charge asymmetry also the mixed QCD-QED corrections. In addition we analyze and
compute the effects of new interactions on these observables in terms of a
gauge-invariant effective Lagrangian which contains all operators relevant for
hadronic $t{\bar t}$ production up to mass dimension six.
