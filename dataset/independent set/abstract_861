We tested Rousseau's (in press) recent proposal to define percentile classes
in the case of the Integrated Impact Indicator (I3) so that the largest number
in a set always belongs to the highest (100th) percentile rank class. In the
case a set of nine uncited papers and one with citation, however, the uncited
papers would all be placed in the 90th percentile rank. A lowly-cited document
set would thus be advantaged when compared with a highly-cited one.
Notwithstanding our reservations, we extended the program for computing I3 in
Web-of-Science data (at http://www.leydesdorff.net/software/i3) with this
option; the quantiles without a correction are now the default. As Rousseau
mentions, excellence indicators (e.g., the top-10%) can be considered as
special cases of I3: only two percentile rank classes are distinguished for the
evaluation. Both excellence and impact indicators can be tested statistically
using the z-test for independent proportions.
