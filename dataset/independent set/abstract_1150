One of the earliest and best-known application of the probabilistic method is
the proof of existence of a 2 log n$-Ramsey graph, i.e., a graph with n nodes
that contains no clique or independent set of size 2 log n. The explicit
construction of such a graph is a major open problem. We show that a reasonable
hardness assumption implies that in polynomial time one can construct a list
containing polylog(n) graphs such that most of them are 2 log n-Ramsey.
