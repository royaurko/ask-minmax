In the Standard Model the Fermi constant is associated with the vacuum
expectation value of the Higgs field, `the condensate', usually believed to be
a cutoff-independent quantity. General arguments related to the `triviality' of
$\Phi^4$ theory in 4 space-time dimensions suggest, however, a dramatic
renormalization effect in the continuum limit that is clearly visible on the
relatively large lattices available today. The result can be crucial for the
Higgs phenomenology and in any context where spontaneous symmetry breaking is
induced through scalar fields.
