An exploratory study has been performed in order to assess the possibility of
probing the symmetry breaking mechanism through the $VV$ fusion process using
the CMS detector. A model independent analysis was carried out with no
assumption on the mechanism restoring the unitarity in the scattering amplitude
and without any degrees of freedom beyond the SM. In order to explore the
sensitivity of the analysis method to an heavy Higgs resonance, we analyzed a
data set produced using an Higgs boson mass of $500GeV$. Moreover, in order to
consider the $VV$ fusion cross section in a region where no resonances are
present, a sample corresponding to the no-Higgs scenario, that in the SM is
equivalent to a very high Higgs mass, has been also studied.
