An irreversible $k$-threshold process (also a $k$-neighbor bootstrap
percolation) is a dynamic process on a graph where vertices change color from
white to black if they have at least $k$ black neighbors. An irreversible
$k$-conversion set of a graph $G$ is a subset $S$ of vertices of $G$ such that
the irreversible $k$-threshold process starting with $S$ black eventually
changes all vertices of $G$ to black. We show that deciding the existence of an
irreversible 2-conversion set of a given size is NP-complete, even for graphs
of maximum degree 4, which answers a question of Dreyer and Roberts.
Conversely, we show that for graphs of maximum degree 3, the minimum size of an
irreversible 2-conversion set can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, we
find an optimal irreversible 3-conversion set for the toroidal grid,
simplifying constructions of Pike and Zou.
