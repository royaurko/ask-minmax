Let C be an algebraic curve in a power of an elliptic curve, both defined
over the algebraic numbers. We show that the set of algebraic points of C which
satisfy certain conditions is a finite set. This result has implications with
the Pink-Zilber Conjeture and the Mordel-Lang plus Bogomolov Theorem for
curves.
