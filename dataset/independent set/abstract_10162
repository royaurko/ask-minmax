We determine the possible even sets of nodes on sextic surfaces in $\Pn 3$,
showing in particular that their cardinalities are exactly the numbers in the
set $\{24, 32, 40, 56 \}$. We also show that all the possible cases admit an
explicit description. The methods that we use are an interplay of coding theory
and projective geometry on one hand, of homological and computer algebra on the
other. We give a detailed geometric construction for the new case of an even
set of 56 nodes, but the ultimate verification of existence relies on computer
calculations. The construction gives a maximal family, unirational and of
dimension 27, of nodal sextics with an even set of 56 nodes. According to a
general theorem of Casnati and Catanese each such nodal surface $F$ is given as
the determinant of a symmetric map for an appropriate vector bundle $\E$
depending on $F$. The first difficulty here is to show the existence of such
vector bundles. This leads us to the investigation of a hitherto unknown moduli
space of rank 6 vector bundles which we show to be birational to a moduli space
of plane representations of cubic surfaces in $\PP^3$. The resulting picture
shows a very rich and interesting geometry. The main difficulty is to show the
existence of "good" maps $\phi$, and the interesting phenomenon which shows up
is the following: the "moduli space" of such pairs $(\E, \phi)$ is reducible,
indeed for a general choice of $\E$ the determinant of $ \phi $ is the double
of a cubic surface $G$.
