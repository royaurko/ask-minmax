We have constructed the leading order strangeness S=-1,-2 baryon-baryon
potential in a chiral effective field theory approach. The chiral potential
consists of one-pseudoscalar-meson exchanges and non-derivative four-baryon
contact terms. The potential, derived using SU(3) symmetry constraints,
contains six independent low-energy coefficients. We have solved a regularized
Lippmann-Schwinger equation and achieved a good description of the available
scattering data. Furthermore a correctly bound hypertriton has been obtained.
