It has been found, that free electromagnetic (EM) field in restricted volume
(typical experimental case) consists of two independent and equally possible
components with different parity under spatial inversion transformations.
Either of the two components indicated represents the system of also two
independent and equally possible fields, which are even and uneven under time
reversal transformations. The rules for local quantization of EM-field in
Minkowski space are obtained.
