We obtain some Poincar\'{e} type formulas, that we use, together with the
level set analysis, to detect the one-dimensional symmetry of monotone and
stable solutions of possibly degenerate elliptic systems of the form
{eqnarray*} {{array}{ll} div(a(|\nabla u|) \nabla u) = F_1(u, v), div(b(|\nabla
v|) \nabla v) = F_2(u, v), {array}. {eqnarray*} where $F\in
C^{1,1}_{loc}(\R^2)$. Our setting is very general, and it comprises, as a
particular case, a conjecture of De Giorgi for phase separations in $\R^2$.
