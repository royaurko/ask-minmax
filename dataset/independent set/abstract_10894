We study a 2-dimensional model of Fermi fields that is closely related to the
Gross-Neveu model, and show that to leading order in 1/N a <psi-psi> condensate
forms. This effect is independent of the chemical potential, a peculiarity that
we expect to be specific to 2 dimensions. We also expect the condensate to be
unstable against corrections at higher orders in 1/N. We compute the Green's
functions associated with the composite psi-psi, and show that the Fermion
acquires a Majorana mass proportional to the gap, and that a massless Goldstone
pole appears.
