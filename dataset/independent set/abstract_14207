Within the frame-work of relativistic Thomas-Fermi and relativistic extended
Thomas-Fermi approximations, we calculate the giant monopole resonance (GMR)
excitation energies for Sn and related nuclei. A large number of non-linear
relativistic force parameters are used in this calculations. We find that a
parameter set is capable to reproduce the experimental monopole energy of Sn
isotopes, when its nuclear matter compressibility lies within $210-230$ MeV,
however fails to reproduce the GMR energy of other related nuclei. That means,
simultaneously a parameter set can not reproduce the GMR values of Sn and other
nuclei.
