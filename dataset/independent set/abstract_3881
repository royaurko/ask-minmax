Local increases in the mean of a random field are detected (conservatively)
by thresholding a field of test statistics at a level $u$ chosen to control the
tail probability or $p$-value of its maximum. This $p$-value is approximated by
the expected Euler characteristic (EC) of the excursion set of the test
statistic field above $u$, denoted $\mathbb{E}\varphi(A_u)$. Under isotropy,
one can use the expansion
$\mathbb{E}\varphi(A_u)=\sum_k\mathcal{V}_k\rho_k(u)$, where $\mathcal{V}_k$ is
an intrinsic volume of the parameter space and $\rho_k$ is an EC density of the
field. EC densities are available for a number of processes, mainly those
constructed from (multivariate) Gaussian fields via smooth functions. Using
saddlepoint methods, we derive an expansion for $\rho_k(u)$ for fields which
are only approximately Gaussian, but for which higher-order cumulants are
available. We focus on linear combinations of $n$ independent non-Gaussian
fields, whence a Central Limit theorem is in force. The threshold $u$ is
allowed to grow with the sample size $n$, in which case our expression has a
smaller relative asymptotic error than the Gaussian EC density. Several
illustrative examples including an application to "bubbles" data accompany the
theory.
