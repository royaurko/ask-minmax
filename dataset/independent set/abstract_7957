The method of brackets, consisting of a small number of heuristic rules, was
created by Ivan Gonzalez for the evaluation of definite integrals appearing in
the resolution of Feynman diagrams. The current work verifies each step of this
method, proves the independence on different representations of the integrand,
and also modifies the rule by further considering analytic continuation.
