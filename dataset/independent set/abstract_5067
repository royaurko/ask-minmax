The CDMS and EDELWEISS collaborations have combined the results of their
direct searches for dark matter using cryogenic germanium detectors. The total
data set represents 614 kg.d equivalent exposure. A straightforward method of
combination was chosen for its simplicity before data were exchanged between
experiments. The results are interpreted in terms of limits on spin-independent
WIMP-nucleon cross-section. For a WIMP mass of 90 GeV/c^2, where this analysis
is most sensitive, a cross-section of 3.3 x 10^{-44} cm^2 is excluded at 90%
CL. At higher WIMP masses, the combination improves the individual limits, by a
factor 1.6 above 700 GeV/c^2. Alternative methods of combining the data provide
stronger constraints for some ranges of WIMP masses and weaker constraints for
others.
