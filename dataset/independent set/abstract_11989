We present the results of a search for relations between observables that are
independent of the Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) Next-to-Next-to-Leading
Order (NNLO) Low-Energy Constants (LECs). We have found some relations between
observables in $\pi\pi$, $\pi K$ scattering and $K_{l4}$ decay which have been
evaluated numerically using fit 10 in \cite{Amoros:2001cp} for the NLO LECs. We
also show some preliminary results for a new global fit of the NLO LECs
