We describe results of electronic Raman-scattering experiments in differently
doped single crystals of Y-123 and Bi-2212. The comparison of AF insulating and
metallic samples suggests that at least the low-energy part of the spectra
originates predominantly from excitations of free carriers. We therefore
propose an analysis of the data in terms of a memory function approach.
Dynamical scattering rates and mass-enhancement factors for the carriers are
obtained. In B2g symmetry the Raman data compare well to the results obtained
from ordinary and optical transport. For underdoped materials the dc scattering
rates in B1g symmetry become temperature independent and considerably larger
than in B2g symmetry. This increasing anisotropy is accompanied by a loss of
spectral weight in B2g symmetry in the range between the superconducting
transition at Tc and a characteristic temperature T* of order room temperature
which compares well with the pseudogap temperature found in other experiments.
The energy range affected by the pseudogap is doping and temperature
independent. The integrated spectral loss is approximately 25% in underdoped
samples and becomes much weaker towards higher carrier concentration. In
underdoped samples, superconductivity related features in the spectra can be
observed only in B2g symmetry. The peak frequencies scale with Tc. We do not
find a direct relation between the pseudogap and the superconducting gap.
