A procedure to derive bounds on coupling strengths of exotic particles to
nucleons from the neutrino signal of supernovae is outlined. The analysis is
based on a model independent calculation for the emissivities for the exotic,
detailed simulation for the evolution of the early proto-neutron star as well
as a Likelihood analysis. As an example we derive confidence levels for the
upper bound of the size of gravity only extra dimensions.
