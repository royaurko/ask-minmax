Bolthausen used a variation of Stein's method to give an inductive proof of
the Berry-Esseen theorem for sums of independent, identically distributed
random variables. We modify this technique to prove a Berry-Esseen theorem for
character ratios of a random representation of the symmetric group on
transpositions. An analogous result is proved for Jack measure on partitions.
