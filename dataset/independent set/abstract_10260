We try here to find new constraints on thick disk population using samples at
intermediate latitude and North Galactic Pole, which include photometry and
proper motions. The algorithm SEM (Stochastic-Estimation-Maximization; Celeux
\& Deibolt 1986) was used to deconvolve the stellar components up to large
distances above the plane, allowing to study of their statistical properties
independently. The multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) is used to qualify
the thick disk using observations in multidimensional space (V,B-V,U-B,
$\mu_{l}$ \& $\mu_{b}$).
