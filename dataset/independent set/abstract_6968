We show that the well-known fact that the equivariant cohomology of a torus
action is a torsion-free module if and only if the map induced by the inclusion
of the fixed point set is injective generalises to actions of arbitrary compact
connected Lie groups if one replaces the fixed point set by the set of points
with maximal isotropy rank. This is true essentially because the action on this
set is always equivariantly formal. In case this set is empty we show that the
induced action on the set of points with highest occuring isotropy rank is
Cohen-Macaulay. It turns out that just as equivariant formality of an action is
equivalent to equivariant formality of the action of a maximal torus, the same
holds true for equivariant injectivity and the Cohen-Macaulay property. In
addition, we find a topological criterion for equivariant injectivity in terms
of orbit spaces.
