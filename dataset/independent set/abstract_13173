The recent observations support that our universe is flat and expanding with
acceleration. A quintessence model with a general relation between the
quintessence potential and the quintessence kinetic energy was proposed to
explain the phenomenon. The dark energy potential includes both the hyperbolic
and the double exponential potentials. We analyze this model in detail by using
the recent supernova and the first year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(WMAP) observations. For a flat universe dominated by a dark energy with
constant $\omega$ which is a special case of the general model, we find that
$\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.30^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$ and $\omega_{\rm Q}\le -0.82$, and the
turnaround redshift $z_{\rm T}$ when the universe switched from the
deceleration phase to the acceleration phase is $z_{\rm T}=0.65$. For the
general model, we find that $\Omega_{\rm m0}\sim 0.3$, $\omega_{\rm Q0}\sim
-1.0$, $\beta\sim 0.5$ and $z_{\rm T}\sim 0.67$. A model independent polynomial
parameterization is also considered, the best fit model gives $\Omega_{\rm
m0}=0.40\pm 0.14$, $\omega_{\rm Q0}=-1.4$ and $z_{\rm T}=0.37$.
