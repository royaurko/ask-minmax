Regular colored graphs are dual representations of pure colored D-dimensional
complexes. These graphs can be classified with respect to an integer, their
degree, much like maps are characterized by the genus. We analyse the structure
of regular colored graphs of fixed positive degree and perform their exact and
asymptotic enumeration. In particular we show that the generating function of
the family of graphs of fixed degree is an algebraic series with a positive
radius of convergence, independant of the degree. We describe the singular
behavior of this series near its dominant singularity, and use the results to
establish the double scaling limit of colored tensor models.
