We predict analytically and confirm with numerical simulations that
inter-mode dispersion in nanowire waveguide arrays can be tailored through
periodic waveguide bending, facilitating flexible spatio-temporal reshaping
without break-up of femtosecond pulses. This approach allows simulta- neous and
independent control of temporal dispersion and spatial diffraction that are
often strongly connected in nanophotonic structures.
