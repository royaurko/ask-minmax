I review recent results regarding the nucleon charge and magnetization
densities as well as the shape of the nucleon. First, some phenomenolgical
considerations that show that the shape of the proton is not round are
discussed. Then model independent results regarding the neutron and proton
charge density, and the proton magnetization density are presented. Finally, I
show how the spin-dependent densities that reveal the shape of the proton can
be measured via their relation with transverse momentum distributions. The
present work is made possible by the recent tremendous experimental progress
made at Bates, Mainz and Jefferson Laboratory.
