We establish a conditional equivalence between quantitative unboundedness of
the analytic rank of elliptic curves over $\mathbb Q$ and the existence of
highly biased elliptic curve prime number races. We show that conditionally on
a Riemann Hypothesis and on a hypothesis on the multiplicity of the zeros of
$L(E,s)$, large analytic ranks translate into an extreme Chebyshev bias.
Conversely, we show under a certain linear independence hypothesis on zeros of
$L(E,s)$ that if highly biased elliptic curve prime number races do exist, then
the Riemann Hypothesis holds for infinitely many elliptic curve $L$-functions
and there exist elliptic curves of arbitrarily large rank.
