We show that Abe's general pseudoadditivity for entropy prescribed by thermal
equilibrium in nonextensive systems holds not only for entropy, but also for
energy. The application of this general pseudoadditivity to Tsallis entropy
tells us that the factorization of the probability of a composite system into
product of the probabilities of the subsystems is just a consequence of the
existence of thermal equilibrium and not due to the independence of the
subsystems.
