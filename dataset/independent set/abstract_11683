We report the direct measurement of the non-adiabatic component of the
spin-torque in domain walls. Our method is independent of both the pinning of
the domain wall in the wire as well as of the Gilbert damping parameter. We
demonstrate that the ratio between the non-adiabatic and the adiabatic
components can be as high as 1, and explain this high value by the importance
of the spin-flip rate to the non-adiabatic torque. Besides their fundamental
significance these results open the way for applications by demonstrating a
significant increase of the spin torque efficiency.
