We explain the physical nature of the subset solution to the sign problem in
chiral random matrix theory: The subset sum is shown to project out the
canonical determinant with zero quark charge from a given configuration. As the
grand canonical chiral random matrix partition function is independent of the
chemical potential, the zero quark charge sector provides the full result.
