In this paper, we first establish a Poincar\'e-Lelong type formula in the
almost complex setting. Then, after introducing the notion of $J$-analytic
subsets, we study the restriction of a closed positive current defined in an
almost complex manifold $(M,J)$ on a $J$-analytic subset. Finally, we prove
that the Lelong numbers of a plurisubharmonic current defined on an almost
complex manifold are independent of the coordinate systems.
