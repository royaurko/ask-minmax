We introduce and study the block voter model with noise on two-dimensional
square lattices using Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling
techniques. The model is defined by an outflow dynamics where a central set of
$N_{PCS}$ spins, here denoted by persuasive cluster spins (PCS), tries to
influence the opinion of their neighbouring counterparts. We consider the
collective behaviour of the entire system with varying PCS size. When
$N_{PCS}>2$, the system exhibits an order-disorder phase transition at a
critical noise parameter $q_{c}$ which is a monotonically increasing function
of the size of the persuasive cluster. We conclude that how large the PCS is
more power of persuasion it has. It also seems that the resulting critical
behaviour is Ising-like independent of the range of the interactions.
