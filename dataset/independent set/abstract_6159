A spectrahedron is a set defined by a linear matrix inequality. A projection
of a spectrahedron is often called a semidefinitely representable set. We show
that the convex hull of a finite union of such projections is again a
projection of a spectrahedron. This improves upon the result of Helton and Nie,
who prove the same result in the case of bounded sets.
