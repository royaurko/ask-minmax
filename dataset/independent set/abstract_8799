Let $f:\mathbb{C}\sp n\to\mathbb{C}\sp n$, $n\geq2$, be a biholomorphism and
let $\Lambda\subseteq \mathbb{C}\sp n$ be a compact $f$-invariant set such that
$f|\Lambda$ is partially hyperbolic. We give equivalent conditions to
hyperbolicity on $\Lambda$. In the particular case of generalized H\'enon map
with dominated splitting in the Julia set $J$, we characterize the
hyperbolicity of $J$.
