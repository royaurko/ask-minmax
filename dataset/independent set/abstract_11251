We introduce the notion of bilinear moment functional and study their general
properties. The analogue of Favard's theorem for moment functionals is proven.
The notion of semi-classical bilinear functionals is introduced as a
generalization of the corresponding notion for moment functionals and motivated
by the applications to multi-matrix random models. Integral representations of
such functionals are derived and shown to be linearly independent.
