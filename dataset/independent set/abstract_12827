We compute the partition function for non-interacting chiral fermions at
second order in a derivative expansion of an arbitrary time-independent
gravitational and gauge background. We find that Pauli-Villars regularization
of the vacuum part is needed to get consistent results. We use our results to
discuss some features of the non-dissipative constitutive relations of second
order hydrodynamics.
