Let $G$ be a finite group acting linearly on the vector space $V$ over a
field of arbitrary characteristic. The action is called coregular if the
invariant ring is generated by algebraically independent homogeneous invariants
and the direct summand property holds if there is a surjective $k[V]^G$-linear
map $\pi:k[V]\to k[V]^G$. The following Chevalley-Shephard-Todd type theorem is
proved. Suppose $V$ is an irreducible $kG$-representation, then the action is
coregular if and only if $G$ is generated by pseudo-reflections and the direct
summand property holds.
