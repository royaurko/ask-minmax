A vortex-antivortex (VA) dipole may be generated due to a spin-polarized
current flowing through a nano-aperture in a magnetic element. We study the
vortex dipole dynamics using the Landau-Lifshitz equation in the presence of an
in-plane applied magnetic field and a Slonczewski spin-torque term with
in-plane polarization. We establish that the vortex dipole is set in steady
state rotational motion. The frequency of rotation is due to two independent
forces: the interaction between the two vortices and the external magnetic
field. The nonzero skyrmion number of the dipole is responsible for both forces
giving rise to rotational dynamics. The spin-torque acts to stabilize the
vortex dipole motion at a definite vortex-antivortex separation distance. We
give analytical and numerical results for the angular frequency of rotation and
VA dipole features as functions of the parameters.
