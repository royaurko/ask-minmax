The Sun's vertical displacement from the galactic plane is determined
model-independently from 3457 spectroscopic-parallax distance estimates for
2397 OB stars within 1200 pc of the Sun. The result, 19.5 +/- 2.2 pc, agrees
well with other recent determinations. The distribution of stellar z-values
with galactic longitude shows a slight sinusoidal dependence with an amplitude
of about 26 pc.
