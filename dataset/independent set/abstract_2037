We investigate the relation between a postulated skeleton expansion and the
conformal limit of QCD. We begin by developing some consequences of an
Abelian-like skeleton expansion, which allows one to disentangle
running-coupling effects from the remaining skeleton coefficients. The latter
are by construction renormalon-free, and hence hopefully better behaved. We
consider a simple ansatz for the expansion, where an observable is written as a
sum of integrals over the running-coupling. We show that in this framework one
can set a unique Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) scale-setting procedure as an
approximation to the running-coupling integrals, where the BLM coefficients
coincide with the skeleton ones. Alternatively, the running-coupling integrals
can be approximated using the effective charge method. We discuss the
limitations in disentangling running coupling effects in the absence of a
diagrammatic construction of the skeleton expansion. Independently of the
assumed skeleton structure we show that BLM coefficients coincide with the
conformal coefficients defined in the small $\beta_0$ (Banks-Zaks) limit where
a perturbative infrared fixed-point is present. This interpretation of the BLM
coefficients should explain their previously observed simplicity and smallness.
Numerical examples are critically discussed.
