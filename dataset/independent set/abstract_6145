For axiom A diffeomorphisms and equilibrium state, we prove a Large deviation
result for the sequence of successive return times into a fixed open set, under
some assumption on the boundary. Our result relies on and extends the work by
Chazottes and Leplaideur who where considering cylinder sets of a Markov
partition.
