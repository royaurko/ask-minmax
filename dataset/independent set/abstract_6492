This paper proposes a new statistic to test independence between two high
dimensional random vectors ${\mathbf{X}}:p_1\times1$ and
${\mathbf{Y}}:p_2\times1$. The proposed statistic is based on the sum of
regularized sample canonical correlation coefficients of ${\mathbf{X}}$ and
${\mathbf{Y}}$. The asymptotic distribution of the statistic under the null
hypothesis is established as a corollary of general central limit theorems
(CLT) for the linear statistics of classical and regularized sample canonical
correlation coefficients when $p_1$ and $p_2$ are both comparable to the sample
size $n$. As applications of the developed independence test, various types of
dependent structures, such as factor models, ARCH models and a general
uncorrelated but dependent case, etc., are investigated by simulations. As an
empirical application, cross-sectional dependence of daily stock returns of
companies between different sections in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is
detected by the proposed test.
