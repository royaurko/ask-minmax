The invisibility graph $I(X)$ of a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is a
(possibly infinite) graph whose vertices are the points of $X$ and two vertices
are connected by an edge if and only if the straight-line segment connecting
the two corresponding points is not fully contained in $X$. We consider the
following three parameters of a set $X$: the clique number $\omega(I(X))$, the
chromatic number $\chi(I(X))$ and the convexity number $\gamma(X)$, which is
the minimum number of convex subsets of $X$ that cover $X$. We settle a
conjecture of Matou\v{s}ek and Valtr claiming that for every planar set $X$,
$\gamma(X)$ can be bounded in terms of $\chi(I(X))$. As a part of the proof we
show that a disc with $n$ one-point holes near its boundary has $\chi(I(X))
\geq \log\log(n)$ but $\omega(I(X))=3$. We also find sets $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^5$
with $\chi(X)=2$, but $\gamma(X)$ arbitrarily large.
