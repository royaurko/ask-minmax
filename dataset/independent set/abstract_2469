A background-independent, Lorentz-covariant approach to compute conserved
charges in odd-dimensional AdS gravity, alternative to the standard
counterterms method, is presented. A set of boundary conditions on the
asymptotic extrinsic and Lorentz curvature, rather than a Dirichlet boundary
condition on the metric is used. With a given prescription of the boundary
term, a well-defined action principle in any odd dimension is obtained. The
same boundary term regularizes the Euclidean action and gives the correct black
hole thermodynamics. The conserved charges are obtained from the asymptotic
symmetries through Noether theorem without reference to any background. For
topological AdS black holes the vacuum energy matches the expression
conjectured by Emparan, Johnson and Myers \cite{Emparan-Johnson-Myers} for all
odd dimensions.
