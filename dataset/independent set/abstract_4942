The contributors in this book introduce the notion of special set linear algebra
and special set fuzzy Linear algebra, which is an extension of the notion set
linear algebra and set fuzzy linear algebra. These concepts are best suited in
the application of multi expert models and cryptology. This book has five
chapters. In chapter one the basic concepts about set linear algebra is given
in order to make this book a self contained one. The notion of special set
linear algebra and their fuzzy analogue is introduced in chapter two. In
chapter three the notion of special set semigroup linear algebra is introduced.
The concept of special set n-vector spaces, n greater than or equal to three is
defined and their fuzzy analogue is their fuzzy analogue is given in chapter
four. The probable applications are also mentioned. The final chapter suggests
66 problems.
