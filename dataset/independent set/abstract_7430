We study a simple motion differential game of many pursuers and one evader in
the plane. We give a nonempty closed convex set in the plane, and the pursuers
and evader move on this set. They cannot leave this set during the game.
Control functions of players are subject to coordinate-wise integral
constraints. If the state of the evader $y$, coincides with that of a pursuer
$x_i$, $i=\{1,...,m\}$, at some time $t_i$ (unspecified), i.e.
$x_i(t_i)=y(t_i)$, then we say that pursuit is completed. We obtain some
conditions under which pursuit can be completed from any position of the
players in the given set. Moreover, we construct strategies for the pursuers.
