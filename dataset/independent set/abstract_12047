The literature on statistical learning for time series assumes the asymptotic
independence or ``mixing' of the data-generating process. These mixing
assumptions are never tested, nor are there methods for estimating mixing rates
from data. We give an estimator for the $\beta$-mixing rate based on a single
stationary sample path and show it is $L_1$-risk consistent.
