We consider a discretized version of the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson model for
the propagation of a driven interface through a random field of obstacles. Our
model consists of a system of ordinary differential equations on a
d-dimensional lattice coupled by the discrete Laplacian. At each lattice point,
the system is subject to a constant driving force and a random obstacle force
impeding free propagation. The obstacle force depends on the current state of
the solution and thus renders the problem non-linear. For independent and
identically distributed obstacle strengths with exponential moment we prove
ballistic propagation of the interface if the driving force is large enough.
