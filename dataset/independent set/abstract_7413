Unlike the relativity theory it seeks to replace, causal set theory has been
interpreted to leave space for a substantive, though perhaps 'localized', form
of 'becoming'. The possibility of fundamental becoming is nourished by the fact
that the analogue of Stein's theorem from special relativity does not hold in
causal set theory. Despite this, we find that in many ways, the debate
concerning becoming parallels the well-rehearsed lines it follows in the domain
of relativity. We present, however, some new twists and challenges. In
particular, we show that a novel and exotic notion of becoming is compatible
with causal sets. In contrast to the 'localized' becoming considered compatible
with the dynamics of causal set theory by its advocates, our novel kind of
becoming, while not answering to the typical A-theoretic demands, is 'global'
and objective.
