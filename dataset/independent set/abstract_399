We present a complete list of the independent dimension-7 operators that are
constructed using the Standard Model degrees of freedom and are invariant under
the Standard Model gauge group. This list contains only 20 independent
operators; far fewer than the 63 operators available at dimension 6. All of
these dimension-7 operators contain fermions and violate lepton number, and 7
of the 20 violate baryon number as well. This result extends the Standard Model
Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and allows a more detailed exploration of the
structure and properties of possible deformations from the Standard Model
Lagrangian.
