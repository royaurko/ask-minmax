A search for supersymmetric particles in events with large missing transverse
momentum, heavy flavor jet candidates and no leptons (e,\mu) in {\surd}s = 7
TeV proton-proton collisions is presented. In a data sample corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 0.83 fb^-1 recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the
Large Hadron Collider, no significant excess is observed with respect to the
prediction for Standard Model processes. Model-independent production cross
section upper limits are provided in the context of simplified models as well
as conventional limits.
