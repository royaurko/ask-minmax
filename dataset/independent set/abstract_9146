The leptonic sector in a recently proposed minimal extension of the standard
model, in which the permutation symmetry S_3 is assumed to be an exact flavor
symmetry at the weak scale, is revisited. We find that S_3 with an additional
Z_{N} symmetry allows CP violating phases in the neutrino mixing.
  The leptonic sector contains six real parameters with two independent phases
to describe charged lepton and neutrino masses and the neutrino mixing. The
model predicts: an inverted spectrum of neutrino mass, tan
theta_{23}=1+O(m_e^2/m_mu^2) and sin
theta_{13}=m_e/sqrt{2}m_mu+O(m_em_mu/m_{tau}^2) simeq 0.0034. Neutrino mass as
well as the effective Majorana mass <m_{ee}> in the neutrinoless double-beta
decay can be expressed in a closed form as a function of phi_nu, Delta
m^2_{21},Delta m^2_{23} and tantheta_{12}, where phi_nu is one of the
independent phases. The model also predicts <m_{ee}> geq (0.036 - 0.066) eV.
