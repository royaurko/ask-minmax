This article first lists reasons why - in the long term or when creating a
new knowledge base (KB) for general knowledge sharing purposes -
collaboratively building a well-organized KB does/can provide more
possibilities, with on the whole no more costs, than the mainstream approach
where knowledge creation and re-use involves searching, merging and creating
(semi-)independent (relatively small) ontologies or semi-formal documents. The
article lists elements required to achieve this and describes the main one: a
KB editing protocol that keeps the KB free of automatically/manually detected
inconsistencies while not forcing them to discuss or agree on terminology and
beliefs nor requiring a selection committee.
