The electromagnetic emission rates at SPS energies satisfy spectral
constraints in leading order in the pion and nucleon densities. These
constraints follow from the strictures of broken chiral symmetry. We saturate
these constraints using available data, leading to model independent emission
rates from a hadronic gas. With a simple fire-ball scenario, only large nucleon
densities may account for the present CERES data.
