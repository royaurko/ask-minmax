A fractal, as originally described by Mandelbrot, is a set with an irregular
and fragmented shape. Many fractals that have been extensively studied, such as
self-similar sets, have the same degree of irregularity and fragmentation at
all length scales. In contrast to this, an equi-homogeneous set is an irregular
and fragmented shape that at each fixed scale is identical at every point.
  We show that self-similar sets that arise from iterated function systems
satisfying the Moran open set condition, canonical examples of `fractal sets',
are also equi-homogeneous. Such self-similar sets are also notable in that
their Assouad and upper box-counting dimensions are equal. More generally, we
show that the Assouad and upper box-counting dimensions are equal for
equi-homogeneous sets, provided that the upper and lower box-counting
dimensions are equal and are `attained'. However, the concept of
equi-homogeneity is distinct from any previously defined notion of dimensional
equivalence.
  Using this new theory, we analyse the geometry of a large class of pullback
attractors of non-autonomous iterated function systems. These attractors are
related to sets that satisfy the Moran structure conditions, include
generalized Cantor sets, and possess different dimensional behavior at
different length scales. We provide conditions under which the pullback
attractor is equi-homogeneous, and use this to compute the Assouad dimension of
a certain class of these highly non-trivial sets.
