In this paper we study satisfiability of random equations in an infinite
finitely generated nilpotent group G. We show that the set SAT(G,k) of all
equations in k > 1 variables over G which are satisfiable in G has an
intermediate asymptotic density in the space of all equations in k variables
over G. When G is a free abelian group of finite rank, we compute this density
precisely; otherwise we give some non-trivial upper and lower bounds. For k = 1
the set SAT(G,k) is negligible. Usually the asymptotic densities of interesting
sets in groups are either zero or one. The results of this paper provide new
examples of algebraically significant sets of intermediate asymptotic density.
