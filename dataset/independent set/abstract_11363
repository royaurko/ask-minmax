A class of nonlinear ARCH processes is introduced and studied. The existence
of a strictly stationary and $\beta$-mixing solution is established under a
mild assumption on the density of the underlying independent process. We give
sufficient conditions for the existence of moments. The analysis relies on
Markov chain theory. The model generalizes some important features of standard
ARCH models and is amenable to further analysis.
