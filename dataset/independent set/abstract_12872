We study general properties the family of stochastic processes with
polynomial regression property. That is under assumption that every conditional
moment of the process is a polynomial. It turns out that then there exists a
family of polynomial martingales $\left\{ M_{n}(X_{t},t)\right\} _{n\geq 1}$
that contains complete information on the distribution (both marginal and
transitional) of the process.
  We specify conditions expressed in terms of $M_{n}^{\prime }s$ under which
given process has independent increments, is a Levy process, contains reversed
martingales is a harness or quadratic harness .
