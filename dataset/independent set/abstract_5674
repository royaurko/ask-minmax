Dielectric beta-relaxation in a pyridine-toluene solution is studied close to
the glass transition. In the equilibrium liquid state the beta loss peak
frequency is not Arrhenius (as in the glass) but virtually
temperature-independent, while the maximum loss is strongly
temperature-dependent. Both loss peak frequency and maximum loss exhibit
thermal hysteresis. A new annealing-state independent parameter involving loss
and loss peak frequency is identified. This parameter has a simple Arrhenius
temperature-dependence and is unaffected by the glass transition.
