In this paper, we build up two observability inequalities from measurable
sets in time for some evolution equations in Hilbert spaces from two different
settings. The equation reads: $u'=Au,\; t>0$, and the observation operator is
denoted by $B$. In the first setting, we assume that $A$ generates an analytic
semigroup, $B$ is an admissible observation operator for this semigroup (cf.
\cite{TG}), and the pair $(A,B)$ verifies some observability inequality from
time intervals. With the help of the propagation estimate of analytic functions
(cf. \cite{V}) and a telescoping series method provided in the current paper,
we establish an observability inequality from measurable sets in time. In the
second setting, we suppose that $A$ generates a $C_0$ semigroup, $B$ is a
linear and bounded operator, and the pair $(A, B)$ verifies some spectral-like
condition. With the aid of methods developed in \cite{AEWZ} and \cite{PW2}
respectively, we first obtain an interpolation inequality at one time, and then
derive an observability inequality from measurable sets in time. These two
observability inequalities are applied to get the bang-bang property for some
time optimal control problems.
