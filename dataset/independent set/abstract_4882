Background independence of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb R^n$
is discussed. The quantity $\theta \hat F \theta - \theta$ is found to be
background dependent at subleading order, and it becomes background independent
only when the ordinary gauge field strength $F$ is constant. It is shown that,
at small values of $B$, the noncommutative Dirac-Born-Infeld action possesses
$\Lambda$-symmetry at least to subleading order in $\theta$ if $F$ damps fast
enough at infinity.
