Any description of gluons requires a well-defined gauge. This is complicated
non-perturbatively by Gribov copies. A possible method-independent gauge
definition to resolve this problem is presented and afterwards used to study
the properties of gluons at any temperature. It is found that only
chromo-electric properties reflect the phase transition. From these the
gauge-invariant phase transition temperature is determined for SU(2) and SU(3)
Yang-Mills theory independently.
