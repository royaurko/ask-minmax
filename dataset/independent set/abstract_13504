We study the temporal and energy spectral properties of the unique neutron
star low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1701-462. After assuming the HB/NB vertex as a
reference position of accretion rate, the horizontal branch oscillation (HBO)
of the HB/NB vertex is roughly 50 Hz. It indicates that the HBO is independent
with the accretion rate or the source intensity. The spectral analysis shows
$R_{\rm{in}}\propto\dot{M}_{\rm{Disk}}^{2.9\pm0.09}$ in the HB/NB vertex and
$R_{\rm{in}}\propto\dot{M}_{\rm{Disk}}^{1.7\pm0.06}$ in the NB/FB vertex, which
implies that different accretion rate may be produced in the HB/NB vertex and
the NB/FB vertex. The Comptonization component could be fitted by constrained
broken power law (CBPL) or nthComp. Different with GX 17+2, the frequencies of
HBO positively correlate with the inner disk radius, which contradict with the
prediction of Lense-Thirring precession model. XTE J1701-462, both in the
Cyg-like phase and in the Sco-like phase, follows a positive correlation
between the break frequency of broad band noise and the characteristic
frequency of HBO, which is called the W-K relation. An anticorrelation between
the frequency of HBO and photon energy is observed. Moreover, the rms of HBO
increases with photon energy till ~10 keV. We discuss the possible origin of
HBO from corona in XTE J1701-462.
