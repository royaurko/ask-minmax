For a map $T \colon [0,1] \to [0,1]$ with an invariant measure $\mu$, we
study, for a $\mu$-typical $x$, the set of points $y$ such that the inequality
$|T^n x - y| < r_n$ is satisfied for infinitely many $n$. We give a formula for
the Hausdorff dimension of this set, under the assumption that $T$ is piecewise
expanding and $\mu_\phi$ is a Gibbs measure. In some cases we also show that
the set has a large intersection property.
