Some claim that there are two independent mixing angles ($\theta =
35.3^\circ$, $-54.7^\circ$) between $^3P_1$ and $^1P_1$ states of heavy-light
mesons in heavy quark symmetric limit, and others claim there is only one
($\theta = 35.3^\circ$). We clarify the difference between these two and
suggest which should be adopted. General arguments on the mixing angle between
$^3L_L$ and $^1L_L$ of heavy-light mesons are given in HQET and a general
relation is derived in heavy quark mass limit as well as that including the
first order correction in $1/m_Q$.
