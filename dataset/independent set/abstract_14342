We prove that the boundary action of a sofic random subgroup of a finitely
generated free group is conservative. This addresses a question asked by
Grigorchuk, Kaimanovich, and Nagnibeda, who studied the boundary actions of
individual subgroups of the free group. Following their work, we also
investigate the cogrowth and various limit sets associated to sofic random
subgroups. We make heavy use of the correspondence between subgroups and their
Schreier graphs, and central to our approach is an investigation of the
asymptotic density of a given set inside of large neighborhoods of the root of
a sofic random Schreier graph.
