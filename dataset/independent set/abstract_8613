We study generating functions for the number of permutations in $S_n$ subject
to set of restrictions. One of the restrictions belongs to $S_3$, while the
others to $S_k$. It turns out that in a large variety of cases the answer can
be expressed via continued fractions, and Chebyshev polynomials of the second
kind.
