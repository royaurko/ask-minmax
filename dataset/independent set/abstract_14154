Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph. A subset $D\subseteq V$ is a dominating set if
every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to a vertex in $D$. The domination number
of $G$ is the smallest cardinality of a dominating set of $G$. The bondage
number of a nonempty graph $G$ is the smallest number of edges whose removal
from $G$ results in a graph with larger domination number of $G$. In this
paper, we determine that the exact value of the bondage number of
$(n-3)$-regular graph $G$ of order $n$ is $n-3$.
