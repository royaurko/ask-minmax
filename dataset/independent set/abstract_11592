We study the light scalar mesons in the QCD sum rule. We find that there are
five independent scalar tetraquark currents in the local form, and we perform
QCD sum rule analysis using both these currents and their combinations.
Compared with the sum rules by conventional \bar{q} q currents, our result
supports a tetraquark structure for low-lying scalar mesons.
