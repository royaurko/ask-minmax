We introduce a model-independent strategy to study narrow resonances which we
apply to a heavy vector triplet of the Standard Model (SM) group for
illustration. The method is based on a simplified phenomenological Lagrangian
which reproduces a large class of explicit models. Firstly, this allows us to
derive robust model-independent phenomenological features and, conversely, to
identify the peculiarities of different explicit realizations. Secondly, limits
on cross-section times BR can be converted into bounds on a few relevant
parameters in a fully analytic way, allowing for an interpretation in any given
explicit model. Based on the available 8 TeV LHC analyses, we derive current
limits and interpret them for vector triplets arising in weakly coupled (gauge)
and strongly coupled (composite) extensions of the SM. We point out that a
model-independent limit setting procedure must be based on purely on-shell
quantities, like a cross-section times BR. Finite width effects altering the
limits can be considerably reduced by focusing on the on-shell signal region.
We illustrate this aspect with a study of the invariant mass distribution in
di-lepton searches and the transverse mass distribution in lepton-neutrino
final states. In addition to this paper we provide a set of online tools
available at a dedicated webpage.
