The fluid dynamics video shows the acoustophoretic handling of a metal sodium
chunks and a water droplets before, during and after mixing. The violent
exothermal reaction between solid and liquid introduces an additional phase
(hydrogen gas). We developed a unique concept for using ultrasound to stably
levitated and move along a plane multiple objects in air, independently from
their electromagnetic nature and aspect ratio. This contactless material
handling can be extended to hazardous, chemical or radioactive samples.
