The semiclassical limit of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz method is used to solve
the theory of Gaudin models for the $sl(2|1)^{(2)}$ R-matrix. We find the
spectra and eigenvectors of the $N-1$ independents Gaudin Hamiltonians. We also
use the off-shell Bethe Ansatz method to show how the off-shell Gaudin equation
solves the associated trigonometric system of Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations.
