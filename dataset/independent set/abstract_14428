Consider an $n\times n$ matrix polynomial $P(\lambda)$ and a set $\Sigma$
consisting of $k \le n$ distinct complex numbers. In this paper, a (weighted)
spectral norm distance from $P(\lambda)$ to the matrix polynomials whose
spectra include the specified set $\Sigma$, is defined and studied. An upper
and a lower bounds for this distance are obtained, and an optimal perturbation
of $P(\lambda)$ associated to the upper bound is constructed. Numerical
examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed bounds.
