A strong negative dependence property for measures on {0,1}^n - stability -
was recently developed in [5], by considering the zero set of the probability
generating function. We extend this property to the more general setting of
reaction-diffusion processes and collections of independent Markov chains. In
one dimension the generalized stability property is now independently
interesting, and we characterize the birth-death chains preserving it.
