Ludics is peculiar in the panorama of game semantics: we first have the
definition of interaction-composition and then we have semantical types, as a
set of strategies which "behave well" and react in the same way to a set of
tests. The semantical types which are interpretations of logical formulas enjoy
a fundamental property, called internal completeness, which characterizes
ludics and sets it apart also from realizability. Internal completeness entails
standard full completeness as a consequence. A growing body of work start to
explore the potential of this specific interactive approach. However, ludics
has some limitations, which are consequence of the fact that in the original
formulation, strategies are abstractions of MALL proofs. On one side, no
repetitions are allowed. On the other side, the proofs tend to rely on the very
specific properties of the MALL proof-like strategies, making it difficult to
transfer the approach to semantical types into different settings. In this
paper, we provide an extension of ludics which allows repetitions and show that
one can still have interactive types and internal completeness. From this, we
obtain full completeness w.r.t. a polarized version of MELL. In our extension,
we use less properties than in the original formulation, which we believe is of
independent interest. We hope this may open the way to applications of ludics
approach to larger domains and different settings.
