We construct a basis set of infra-red and/or collinearly divergent scalar
one-loop integrals and give analytic formulas, for tadpole, bubble, triangle
and box integrals, regulating the divergences (ultra-violet, infra-red or
collinear) by regularization in $D=4-2\epsilon$ dimensions. For scalar triangle
integrals we give results for our basis set containing 6 divergent integrals.
For scalar box integrals we give results for our basis set containing 16
divergent integrals. We provide analytic results for the 5 divergent box
integrals in the basis set which are missing in the literature. Building on the
work of van Oldenborgh, a general, publicly available code has been
constructed, which calculates both finite and divergent one-loop integrals. The
code returns the coefficients of $1/\epsilon^2,1/\epsilon^1$ and $1/\epsilon^0$
as complex numbers for an arbitrary tadpole, bubble, triangle or box integral.
