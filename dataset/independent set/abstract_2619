Let $X_N$ be an $N\ts N$ random symmetric matrix with independent
equidistributed entries. If the law $P$ of the entries has a finite second
moment, it was shown by Wigner \cite{wigner} that the empirical distribution of
the eigenvalues of $X_N$, once renormalized by $\sqrt{N}$, converges almost
surely and in expectation to the so-called semicircular distribution as $N$
goes to infinity. In this paper we study the same question when $P$ is in the
domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law. We prove that if we renormalize
the eigenvalues by a constant $a_N$ of order $N^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}$, the
corresponding spectral distribution converges in expectation towards a law
$\mu_\alpha$ which only depends on $\alpha$. We characterize $\mu_\alpha$ and
study some of its properties; it is a heavy-tailed probability measure which is
absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure except possibly on a
compact set of capacity zero.
