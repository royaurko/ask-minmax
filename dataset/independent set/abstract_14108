We prove that the Frobenius algebra of the injective hull of a complete
Stanley-Reisner ring as well as its Matlis dual notion of Cartier algebra can
be only principally generated or infinitely generated. As a consequence we are
able to show that the set of F-jumping numbers of generalized test ideals
associated to complete Stanley-Reisner rings form a discrete set.
