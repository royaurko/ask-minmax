A bounded measurable set $\Omega$, of Lebesgue measure 1, in the real line is
called spectral if there is a set $\Lambda$ of real numbers ("frequencies")
such that the exponential functions $e_\lambda(x) = \exp(2\pi i \lambda x)$,
$\lambda\in\Lambda$, form a complete orthonormal system of $L^2(\Omega)$. Such
a set $\Lambda$ is called a {\em spectrum} of $\Omega$. In this note we prove
that any spectrum $\Lambda$ of a bounded measurable set $\Omega\subseteq\RR$
must be periodic.
