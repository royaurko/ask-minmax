The generalized Maxwell equations are considered which include an additional
gradient term. Such equations describe massless particles possessing spins one
and zero. We find and investigate the matrix formulation of the first order of
equations under consideration. All the linearly independent solutions of the
equations for a free particle are obtained in terms of the projection
matrix-dyads (density matrices).
