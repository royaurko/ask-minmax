Let a(z) be a meromorphic function having in the disk |z|<R precisely \lambda
poles. In this work for the (\lambda-1)th row of the Pad\'e table of a(z) the
set of uniform convergence is explicitly obtained. The present note is a
supplement to the previous work of the contributor (J. Approx. Theory, 123(2003),
160-207).
