We present a systematic study of the B meson light-cone wavefunctions in QCD
in the heavy-quark limit. We construct model-independent formulae for the
light-cone wavefunctions in terms of independent dynamical degrees of freedom,
which exactly satisfy the QCD equations of motion and constraints from
heavy-quark symmetry. The results demonstrate novel behaviors of longitudinal
as well as transverse momentum distribution in the B mesons.
