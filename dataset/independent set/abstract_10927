Model independent constraints on supersymmetric models emerge when certain
couplings are drawn towards their infra-red (quasi) fixed points in the course
of their renormalization group evolution. The general principles are first
reviewed and the conclusions for some recent studies of theories with R-parity
and baryon and lepton number violations are summarized.
