Using a non-local Monte Carlo algorithm, we study the aging of a fragile
glass, being able to follow it up to equilibibrium down to 0.89 Tmc (Tmc is the
Mode-Coupling temperature) and up to unprecedentedly large waiting times at
lower temperatures. We show that the fluctuation-dissipation ratio is
independent of the dynamics chosen and is compatible with a phase transition,
and that the scaling behaviour of the aging part of the correlation supports
the full-aging scenario.
