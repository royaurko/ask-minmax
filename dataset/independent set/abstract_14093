We present a method for estimating the edge of a two-dimensional bounded set,
given a finite random set of points drawn from the interior. The estimator is
based both on a Parzen-Rosenblatt kernel and extreme values of point processes.
We give conditions for various kinds of convergence and asymptotic normality.
We propose a method of reducing the negative bias and edge effects, illustrated
by a simulation.
