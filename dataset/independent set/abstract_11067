The soft-pion theorem for pion production in deeply virtual Compton
scattering, derived by Guichon, Mosse and Vanderhaegen, is shown to be
consistent with chiral perturbation theory. Chiral symmetry requires that the
nonsinglet operators corresponding to spin-independent and spin-dependent
parton distributions have the same anomalous dimensions in cases where those
operators are related by chiral transformations. In chiral perturbation theory,
their scale-dependences can thus be absorbed in the coefficents of the
corresponding effective operators, without affecting their chiral structures.
