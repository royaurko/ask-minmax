We present a method for the Hamiltonian formulation of field theories that
are based on Lagrangians containing second derivatives. The new feature of our
formalism is that all four partial derivatives of the field variables are
initially considered as independent fields, in contrast to the conventional
Ostrogradski method, where only the velocity is turned into an independent
field variable. The consistency of the formalism is demonstrated by simple
unconstrained and constrained second order scalar field theories. Its
application to General Relativity is briefly outlined.
