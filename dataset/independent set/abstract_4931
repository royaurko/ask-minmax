We review the halo-independent formalism, that allows to compare data from
different direct dark matter detection experiments without making assumptions
on the properties of the dark matter halo. We apply this method to
spin-independent WIMP-nuclei interactions, for both isospin-conserving and
isospin-violating couplings, and to WIMPs interacting through an anomalous
magnetic moment.
