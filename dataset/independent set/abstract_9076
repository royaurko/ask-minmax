Motivated by the possibility of experimental determination of top quark form
factors in upcoming e+ e- experiments, as recently discussed by Atwood and
Soni, we show at the one loop level that the conventionally defined magnetic
dipole moment (MDM) form factor of the top quark is gauge dependent, in the
class of renormalizable ($R_{\xi}$) gauges. We explicitly calculate its gauge
dependence, which, due to the massiveness of the top quark, turns out to be
numerically very sizable. We show how to use the S-matrix pinch technique in
order to define gauge independent form factors. The real and imaginary parts of
the gauge independent MDM form factor are calculated and their dependence on
the top quark and Higgs boson masses is discussed. Most noticeably, the
dependence on the Higgs mass turns out to be stronger than that of the cross
section as a whole.
