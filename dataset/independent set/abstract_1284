This paper investigates the space $C_k(\omega^*,\omega^*)$, the space of
continuous self-maps on the Stone-\v{C}ech remainder of the integers,
$\omega^*$, equipped with the compact-open topology. Our main results are that
(1) $C_k(\omega^*,\omega^*)$ is Baire, (2) Stone-\v{C}ech extensions of
injective maps on $\omega$ form a dense set of weak $P$-points in
$C_k(\omega^*,\omega^*)$, (3) it is independent of ZFC whether
$C_k(\omega^*,\omega^*)$ contains $P$-points, and that (4)
$C_k(\omega^*,\omega^*)$ is not an $F$-space, but contains, as $\omega^*$, no
non-trivial convergent sequences.
