We classify 2-center extremal black hole charge configurations through
duality-invariant homogeneous polynomials, which are the generalization of the
unique invariant quartic polynomial for single-center black holes based on
homogeneous symmetric cubic special Kaehler geometries. A crucial role is
played by an horizontal SL(p,R) symmetry group, which classifies invariants for
p-center black holes. For p = 2, a (spin 2) quintet of quartic invariants
emerge. We provide the minimal set of independent invariants for the rank-3 N =
2, d = 4 stu model, and for its lower-rank descendants, namely the rank-2 st^2
and rank-1 t^3 models; these models respectively exhibit seven, six and five
independent invariants. We also derive the polynomial relations among these and
other duality invariants. In particular, the symplectic product of two charge
vectors is not independent from the quartic quintet in the t^3 model, but
rather it satisfies a degree-16 relation, corresponding to a quartic equation
for the square of the symplectic product itself.
