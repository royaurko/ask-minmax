We discuss a robust and fairly model-independent upper bound on the possible
neutrino flux produced by neutralino annihilation in the center of our galaxy,
and show that its detection with present or future neutrino telescopes is
highly improbable. This bound is obtained by relating the neutrino flux to the
gamma flux that would be produced in the same annihilation processes, for which
measurements do exist.
