The family omega1-Borel sets is the smallest family of subsets of the real
line which contains the family of open sets and is closed under complementation
and omega1 unions. We show:
  Theorem 1. MA+notCH implies this hierarchy has length omega2.
  Theorem 2. In the Cohen real model it has length either omega1+1 or omega1+2.
