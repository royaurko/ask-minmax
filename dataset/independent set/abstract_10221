The 3x+1 Conjecture asserts that the T-orbit of every positive integer
contains 1, where T maps x\mapsto x/2 for x even and x\mapsto (3x+1)/2 for x
odd. A set S of positive integers is sufficient if the orbit of each positive
integer intersects the orbit of some member of S. In a previous paper it was
shown that every arithmetic sequence is sufficient.
  In this paper we further investigate the concept of sufficiency. We construct
sufficient sets of arbitrarily low asymptotic density in the natural numbers.
We determine the structure of the groups generated by the maps x\mapsto x/2 and
x\mapsto (3x+1)/2 modulo b for b relatively prime to 6, and study the action of
these groups on the directed graph associated to the 3x+1 dynamical system.
From this we obtain information about the distribution of arithmetic sequences
and obtain surprising new results about certain arithmetic sequences. For
example, we show that the forward T-orbit of every positive integer contains an
element congruent to 2 mod 9, and every non-trivial cycle and divergent orbit
contains an element congruent to 20 mod 27. We generalize these results to find
many other sets that are strongly sufficient in this way.
  Finally, we show that the 3x+1 digraph exhibits a surprising and beautiful
self-duality modulo 2^n for any n, and prove that it does not have this
property for any other modulus. We then use deeper previous results to
construct additional families of nontrivial strongly sufficient sets by showing
that for any k<n, one can "fold" the digraph modulo 2^n onto the digraph modulo
2^k in a natural way.
