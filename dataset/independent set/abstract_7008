We study connections between classical asymptotic density and c.e. sets. We
prove that a c.e. Turing degree d is not low if and only if d contains a c.e.
set A of density 1 which has no computable subsets of density 1, giving a
natural characterization of non-low c.e. degrees. In contrast, we prove that
every nonzero c.e. degree contains a set which is generically computable but
not coarsely computable. There is a very close connection between the
computational complexity of a set and the computational complexity of its
density as a real number where we measure complexity of real numbers as the
position of their left Dedekind cuts in the Arithmetic Hierarchy. We
characterize the lower densities, upper densities and densities of both
computable and computably enumerable sets. We also study "computable at density
r" where r is an arbitrary real number in the unit interval. Finally, we study
connections between density and classical smallness notions such as immunity
and cohesiveness.
