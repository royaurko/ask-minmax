In this paper it is shown that a generalized circulant matrix underlies every
weakly Coupled Map Lattice (CML), independently of the form of the coupling
term. Therefore, this matrix will appear always perturbative methods are used
to get the analytical solutions. In fact, the inverse of this matrix provides
the analytical solution of the CML after using first order approximation
methods. This inverse matrix, of arbitrary order, is explicitly calculated,
thus providing the analytical expression for the temporal evolution of the CML.
