I study the product of independent identically distributed $D\times D$ random
probability matrices. Some exact asymptotic results are obtained. I find that
both the left and the right products approach exponentially to a probability
matrix(asymptotic matrix) in which any two rows are the same. A parameter
$\lambda$ is introduced for the exponential coefficient which can be used to
describe the convergent rate of the products. $\lambda$ depends on the
distribution of individual random matrices. I find $\lambda = 3/2$ for D=2 when
each element of individual random probability matrices is uniformly distributed
in [0,1]. In this case, each element of the asymptotic matrix follows a
parabolic distribution function. The distribution function of the asymptotic
matrix elements can be numerically shown to be non-universal. Numerical tests
are carried out for a set of random probability matrices with a particular
distribution function. I find that $\lambda$ increases monotonically from
$\simeq 1.5$ to $\simeq 3$ as D increases from 3 to 99, and the distribution of
random elements in the asymptotic products can be described by a Gaussian
function with its mean to be 1/D.
