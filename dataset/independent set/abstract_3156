Let $\mathcal J$ be a coherent ideal sheaf on a complex manifold $X$ with
zero set $Z$, and let $G$ be a plurisubharmonic function such that
$G=\log|f|+\mathcal O(1)$ locally at $Z$, where $f$ is a tuple of holomorphic
functions that defines $\mathcal J$. We give a meaning to the Monge-Amp\`{e}re
products $(dd^c G)^k$ for $k=0,1,2,...$, and prove that the Lelong numbers of
the currents $M_k^{\mathcal J}:=\mathbf 1_Z(dd^c G)^k$ at $x$ coincide with the
so-called Segre numbers of $\mathcal J$ at $x$, introduced independently by
Tworzewski, Gaffney-Gassler, and Achilles-Manaresi. More generally, we show
that $M_k^{\mathcal J}$ satisfy a certain generalization of the classical King
formula.
