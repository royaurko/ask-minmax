A closed-form solution to the energy-based stochastic Schrodinger equation
with a time-dependent coupling is obtained. The solution is algebraic in
character, and is expressed directly in terms of independent random data. The
data consist of (i) a random variable H which has the distribution P(H=E_i) =
pi_i, where pi_i is the transition probability from the initial state to the
Luders state with energy E_i; and (ii) an independent P-Brownian motion, where
P is the physical probability measure associated with the dynamics of the
reduction process. When the coupling is time-independent, it is known that
state reduction occurs asymptotically--that is to say, over an infinite time
horizon. In the case of a time-dependent coupling, we show that if the
magnitude of the coupling decreases sufficiently rapidly, then the energy
variance will be reduced under the dynamics, but the state need not reach an
energy eigenstate. This situation corresponds to the case of a ``partial'' or
``incomplete'' measurement of the energy. We also construct an example of a
model where the opposite situation prevails, in which complete state reduction
is achieved after the passage of a finite period of time.
