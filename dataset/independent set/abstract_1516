Ages of extragalactic globular clusters can provide valuable insights into
the formation and evolution of galaxies. In this contribution the photometric
methods of age dating old globular cluster systems are summarised. The
spectroscopic approach is reviewed with an emphasis of the right choice of age
diagnostics. We present a new method of quantifying the relatively best
age-sensitive spectroscopic index given the quality of a data set and a certain
theoretical stellar synthesis model. The relatively best diagnostic plot is
constructed from the set of Lick indices and used to age date globular clusters
in several early-type galaxies which are part of a large spectroscopic survey
of extragalactic globular cluster systems. We find that, independently of host
galaxy, metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -0.8) globular clusters appear to be old (t > 8
Gyr) and coeval. Metal-rich clusters show a wide range of ages from ~15 down to
a few Gyr.
