Critical phenomena in real fluids demonstrate a combination of universal
features caused by the divergence of long-range fluctuations of density and
nonuniversal (system-dependent) features associated with specific
intermolecular interactions. Asymptotically, all fluids belong to the
Ising-model class of universality. The asymptotic power laws for the
thermodynamic properties are described by two independent universal critical
exponents and by two independent nonuniversal critical amplitudes; other
critical amplitudes can be obtained by universal relations. The nonuniversal
critical parameters (critical temperature, pressure, and density) can be
absorbed in the property units. Nonasymptotic critical behavior of fluids can
be divided into two parts, symmetric ("Ising-like") and asymmetric
("fluid-like"). The symmetric nonasymptotic behavior contains a new universal
exponent (Wegner exponent) and the system-dependent crossover scale (Ginzburg
number) associated with the range of intermolecular interactions, while the
asymmetric features are generally described by an additional universal exponent
and by three nonasymptotic amplitudes associated with mixing of the physical
fields into the scaling fields.
