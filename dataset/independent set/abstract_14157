We show that any grafting ray in Teichm\"{u}ller space determined by an
arational lamination or a multi-curve is (strongly) asymptotic to a
Teichm\"{u}ller geodesic ray. As a consequence the projection of a generic
grafting ray to moduli space is dense. We also show that the set of points in
Teichm\"{u}ller space obtained by integer (2\pi-) graftings on any hyperbolic
surface projects to a dense set, which implies that complex projective surfaces
with any fixed Fuchsian holonomy are dense in moduli space.
