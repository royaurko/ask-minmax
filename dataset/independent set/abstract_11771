An extreme mass ratio inspiral consists of two parts: adiabatic inspiral and
plunge. The plunge trajectory from the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)
is special (somewhat independent of initial conditions). We write an expression
for its solution in closed-form and for the emitted waveform. In particular we
extract an expression for the associated black-hole ringdown amplitudes, and
evaluate them numerically.
