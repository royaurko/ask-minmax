We discuss the recent interpretation of quark distribution functions in the
plane transverse to the light-cone direction. Such a mapping is model
independent and allows one to build multidimensional pictures of the hadron and
to develop a semi-classical intuition of the quark dynamics. We comment briefly
the results obtained from the Form Factors of the nucleon. A generalization to
a target with arbitrary spin led to a set of preferred values for the
electromagnetic coupling characterizing structureless particles. Generalized
polarizabilities can also be interpreted in that frame as the distortion of the
charge densities due to an external electromagnetic field. Finally, we present
preliminary results for the Generalized Transverse-Momentum dependent
Distributions which encode in principle the most complete information about
quark distributions.
