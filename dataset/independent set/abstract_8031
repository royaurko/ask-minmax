We classify finite posets with a particular sorting property, generalizing a
result for rectangular arrays. Each poset is covered by two sets of disjoint
saturated chains such that, for any original labeling, after sorting the labels
along both sets of chains, the labels of the chains in the first set remain
sorted. We also characterize posets with more restrictive sorting properties.
