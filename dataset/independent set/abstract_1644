Before we can get the whole potential of employing computers in the process
of managing mathematical `knowledge', we have to convert informal knowledge
into machine-oriented representations. How exactly to support this process so
that it becomes as effortless as possible is one of the main unsolved problems
of Mathematical Knowledge Management.
  Two independent projects in formalization of mathematical content showed that
many of the time consuming tasks could be significantly reduced if adequate
tool support were available. It was also established that similar tasks are
typical for object oriented languages and that they are to a large extent
solved by Integrated Development Environments (IDE).
  This thesis starts by analyzing the opportunities where formalization process
can benefit from software support. A list of research questions is compiled
along with a set of software requirements which are then used for developing a
new IDE for the semantic \TeX{} (\stex{}) format. The result of the current
research is that, indeed, IDEs can be very useful in the process of
formalization and presents a set of best practices for implementing such IDEs.
