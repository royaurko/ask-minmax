The principle of Generalized Natural Selection (GNS) states that in nature,
computational processes of high computational sophistication are more likely to
maintain/abide than processes of lower computational sophistication provided
that sufficiently many resources are around to sustain the processes. In this
paper we give a concrete set-up how to test GNS in a weak sense. In particular,
we work in the setting of Cellular Automata and see how GNS can manifest itself
in this setting.
