The mass of the charm quark is analyzed in the context of QCD finite energy
sum rules using recent BESII e+e- annihilation data and a large momentum
expansion of the QCD correlator which incorporates terms to order (alpha_s)^2
(m_c^2/q^2)^6. Using various versions of duality, we obtain the consistent
result m_c(m_c)=(1.37 +- 0.09)GeV. Our result is quite independent of the ones
based on the inverse moment analysis.
