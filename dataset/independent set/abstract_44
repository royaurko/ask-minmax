A set S is independent in a graph G if no two vertices from S are adjacent.
By core(G) we mean the intersection of all maximum independent sets. The
independence number alpha(G) is the cardinality of a maximum independent set,
while mu(G) is the size of a maximum matching in G. A connected graph having
only one cycle, say C, is a unicyclic graph. In this paper we prove that if G
is a unicyclic graph of order n and n-1 = alpha(G) + mu(G), then core(G)
coincides with the union of cores of all trees in G-C.
