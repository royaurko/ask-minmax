The Hausdorff dimension of a conformal repeller or conformal hyperbolic set
is well understood. For non-conformal maps, the Hausdorff dimension is only
known in some special cases. Ban, Cao and Hu defined the concept of an average
conformal repeller which generalises conformal, quasi-conformal and weakly
conformal repellers, and they found an equation for the Hausdorff dimension for
an average conformal repeller. In this paper we generalise this concept to
average conformal hyperbolic sets, and obtain a similar equation for the
Hausdorff dimension.
