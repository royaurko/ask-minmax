We study a reduct L\ast of the ring language where multiplication is
restricted to a neighbourhood of zero. The language is chosen such that for
p-adically closed fields K, the L\ast-definable subsets of K coincide with the
semi-algebraic subsets of K. Hence structures (K,L\ast) can be seen as the
p-adic counterpart of the o-minimal structure of semibounded sets. We show that
in this language, p-adically closed fields admit cell decomposition, using
cells similar to p-adic semi-algebraic cells. From this we can derive
quantifier-elimination, and give a characterization of definable functions. In
particular, we conclude that multi- plication can only be defined on bounded
sets, and we consider the existence of definable Skolem functions.
