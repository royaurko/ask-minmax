We effect a multifractal analysis for a strongly dissipative H\'enon-like map
at the first bifurcation parameter at which the uniform hyperbolicity is
destroyed by the formation of tangencies inside the limit set. We decompose the
set of non wandering points on the unstable manifold into level sets of
Birkhoff averages of continuous functions, and derive a formula for the
Hausdorff dimension of the level sets in terms of the entropy and unstable
Lyapunov exponent of invariant probability measures.
