Measuring conditional dependence is an important topic in statistics with
broad applications including graphical models. Under a factor model setting, a
new conditional dependence measure is proposed. The measure is derived by using
distance covariance after adjusting the common observable factors or
covariates. The corresponding conditional independence test is given with the
asymptotic null distribution unveiled. The latter gives a somewhat surprising
result: the estimating errors in factor loading matrices, while of root$-n$
order, do not have material impact on the asymptotic null distribution of the
test statistic, which is also in the root$-n$ domain. It is also shown that the
new test has strict control over the asymptotic significance level and can be
calculated efficiently. A generic method for building dependency graphs using
the new test is elaborated. Numerical results and real data analysis show the
superiority of the new method.
