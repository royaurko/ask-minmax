The testability of the Kochen-Specker theorem is a subject of ongoing
controversy. A central issue is that experimental implementations relying on
sequential measurements cannot achieve perfect compatibility between the
measurements and that therefore the notion of noncontextuality is not well
defined. We demonstrate by an explicit model that such compatibility violations
may yield a violation of noncontextuality inequalities, even if we assume that
the incompatibilities merely originate from context-independent noise. We show,
however, that this problem can be circumvented by combining the ideas behind
Leggett-Garg inequalities with those of the Kochen-Specker theorem.
