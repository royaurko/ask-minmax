We derive model-independent bounds on production and detection non-standard
neutrino interactions (NSI). We find that the constraints for NSI parameters
are around O(10^{-2}) to O(10^{-1}). Furthermore, we review and update the
constraints on matter NSI. We conclude that the bounds on production and
detection NSI are generally one order of magnitude stronger than their matter
counterparts.
