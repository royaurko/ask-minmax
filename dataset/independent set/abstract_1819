To ensure the privacy of users in transport systems, researchers are working
on new protocols providing the best security guarantees while respecting
functional requirements of transport operators. In this paper, we design a
secure NFC m-ticketing protocol for public transport that preserves users'
anonymity and prevents transport operators from tracing their customers' trips.
To this end, we introduce a new practical set-membership proof that does not
require provers nor verifiers (but in a specific scenario for verifiers) to
perform pairing computations. It is therefore particularly suitable for our
(ticketing) setting where provers hold SIM/UICC cards that do not support such
costly computations. We also propose several optimizations of Boneh-Boyen type
signature schemes, which are of independent interest, increasing their
performance and efficiency during NFC transactions. Our m-ticketing protocol
offers greater flexibility compared to previous solutions as it enables the
post-payment and the off-line validation of m-tickets. By implementing a
prototype using a standard NFC SIM card, we show that it fulfils the stringent
functional requirement imposed by transport operators whilst using strong
security parameters. In particular, a validation can be completed in 184.25 ms
when the mobile is switched on, and in 266.52 ms when the mobile is switched
off or its battery is flat.
