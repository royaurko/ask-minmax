We investigate the dimension of intersections of the Sierpi\'nski gasket with
lines. Our first main result describes a countable, dense set of angles that
are exceptional for Marstrand's theorem. We then provide a multifractal
analysis for the set of points in the projection for which the associated slice
has a prescribed dimension.
