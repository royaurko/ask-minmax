Recently, uniqueness theorems were constructed for the representation used in
Loop Quantum Gravity. We explore the existence of alternate representations by
weakening the assumptions of the so called LOST uniqueness theorem. The
weakened assumptions seem physically reasonable and retain the key requirement
of explicit background independence. For simplicity, we restrict attention to
the case of gauge group U(1).
