Given two sets of data which lead to a similar statistical conclusion, the
Simpson Paradox describes the tactic of combining these two sets and achieving
the opposite conclusion. Depending upon the given data, this may or may not
succeed. Inverse Simpson is a method of decomposing a given set of comparison
data into two disjoint sets and achieving the opposite conclusion for each one.
This is always possible; however, the statistical significance of the
conclusions does depend upon the details of the given data.
