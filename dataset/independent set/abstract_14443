We apply analytic perturbation theory to the QCD analysis of the xF_3(x,Q^2)
structure function considering a combined set of deep inelastic scattering data
presented by several collaborations, and extract values of the scale parameter
Lambda_{QCD}, the parameters of the form of the xF_3 structure function, and
the x-shape of the higher twist contribution. We study the difference between
the results obtained within the standard perturbative and analytic approaches
in comparison with the experimental errors and state that the greatest
difference occurs for large x.
