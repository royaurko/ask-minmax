We prove that the upper bound for the van der Corput property of the set of
shifted primes is O((log n)^{-1+o(1)}), giving an answer to a problem
considered by Ruzsa and Montgomery for the set of shifted primes p-1. We
construct normed non-negative valued cosine polynomials with the spectrum in
the set p-1, p<=n, and a small free coefficient a_0=O((log n)^{-1+o(1)}). This
implies the same bound for the Poincar\'e property of the set p-1, and also
bounds for several properties related to uniform distribution of related sets.
