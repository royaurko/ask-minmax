We formulate and prove in this report some sufficient conditions for
exponential tightness (ET) of a family of independent identical distributed
(i.i.d.) random fields (r.f.) (processes) in the space of continuous functions
defined on certain metric compact set.
  We will use the entropic method as well as too modern approach through the
majorizing measures (generic chaining).
