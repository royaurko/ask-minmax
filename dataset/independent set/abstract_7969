We prove that every finite idempotent semigroup (band) is finitely related,
which means that the clone of its term operations (i.e. operations induced by
words) is determined by finitely many relations. In this way, we solve an open
problem independently posed by Peter Mayr and the contributor in a couple of
previous papers on the topic of finitely related semigroups.
