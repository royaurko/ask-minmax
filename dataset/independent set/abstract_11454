Role of the Landau-Migdal parameters with the pseudovector ($g_a$) and the
tensor coupling ($g_t$) is examined for the giant Gamow-Teller (GT) states in
the relativistic random phase approximation (RPA). The excitation energy is
dominated by both $g_a$ and $g_t$ in a similar way, while the GT strength is
independent of $g_a$ and $g_t$ in the RPA of the nucleon space, and is
quenched, compared with that in non-relativistic one. The coupling of the
particle-hole states with nucleon-antinucleon states is expected to quench the
GT strength further through $g_a$.
