This paper studies the connection between probabilistic conditional
independence in uncertain reasoning and data dependency in relational
databases. As a demonstration of the usefulness of this preliminary
investigation, an alternate proof is presented for refuting the conjecture
suggested by Pearl and Paz that probabilistic conditional independencies have a
complete axiomatization.
