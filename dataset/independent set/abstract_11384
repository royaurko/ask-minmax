H\"older continuity, $|N_\lambda(E)-N_\lambda(E')|\le C |E-E'|^\alpha$, with
a constant $C$ independent of the disorder strength $\lambda$ is proved for the
integrated density of states $N_\lambda(E)$ associated to a discrete random
operator $H = H_o + \lambda V$ consisting of a translation invariant hopping
matrix $H_o$ and i.i.d. single site potentials $V$ with an absolutely
continuous distribution, under a regularity assumption for the hopping term.
