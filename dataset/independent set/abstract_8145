If a discrete subset S of a topological group G with the identity 1 generates
a dense subgroup of G and S \cup {1} is closed in G, then S is called a
suitable set for G. We apply Michael's selection theorem to offer a direct,
self-contained, purely topological proof of the result of Hofmann and Morris on
the existence of suitable sets in locally compact groups. Our approach uses
only elementary facts from (topological) group theory.
