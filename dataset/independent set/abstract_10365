Previous work on English determiners has primarily concentrated on their
semantics or scoping properties rather than their complex ordering behavior.
The little work that has been done on determiner ordering generally splits
determiners into three subcategories. However, this small number of categories
does not capture the finer distinctions necessary to correctly order
determiners. This paper presents a syntactic account of determiner sequencing
based on eight independently identified semantic features. Complex determiners,
such as genitives, partitives, and determiner modifying adverbials, are also
presented. This work has been implemented as part of XTAG, a wide-coverage
grammar for English based in the Feature-Based, Lexicalized Tree Adjoining
Grammar (FB-LTAG) formalism.
