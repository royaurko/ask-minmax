We compute the O(\alpha_s^2) contributions to the photon energy spectrum of
the inclusive decay \bar{B} -> X_s \gamma associated with the magnetic penguin
operator O_7. They are an essential part of the ongoing NNLO calculation of
this important decay. We use two different methods to evaluate the master
integrals, one based on the differential equation approach and the other on
sector decomposition, leading to identical results which in turn agree with
those of a recent independent calculation by Melnikov and Mitov. We study the
numerical relevance of this set of NNLO contributions in the photon energy
spectrum and discuss the change of bottom quark mass scheme.
