In this note, we study inequality and limit theory under sublinear
expectations. We mainly prove Doob's inequality for submartingale and
Kolmogrov's inequality. By Kolmogrov's inequality, we obtain a special version
of Kolmogrov's law of large numbers. Finally, we present a strong law of large
numbers for independent and identically distributed random variables under
one-order type moment condition.
