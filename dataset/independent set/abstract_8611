In this paper we fix a set \Lambda^* of positive elements of the free group
F_n (e.g. the set of finite words occurring in a Markov subshift) as well as n
partial isometries on a Hilbert space H. Based on these we define a map S:F_n
--> L(H) which we prove to be a partial representation of F_n on H under
certain conditions studied by Matsumoto.
