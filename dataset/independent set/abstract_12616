We employ a dressed state approach to perform a study on the behavior of the
uncertainty principle for a system in a heated cavity. We find, in a small
cavity for a given temperature, an oscillatory behavior of the
momentum--coordinate product, $(\Delta\,p)\,(\Delta\,q)$, which attains
periodically finite absolute minimum (maximum) values, no matter large is the
elapsed time. This behavior is in a sharp contrast with what happens in free
space, in which case, the product $(\Delta\,p)\,(\Delta\,q)$ tends
asymptotically, for each temperature, to a constant value, independent of time.
