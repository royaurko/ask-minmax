We show that the high temperature behavior of non-commutative QED may be
simply obtained from Boltzmann transport equations for classical particles. The
transport equation for the charge neutral particle is shown to be
characteristically different from that for the charged particle. These
equations correctly generate, for arbitrary values of the non-commutative
parameter theta, the leading, gauge independent hard thermal loops, arising
from the fermion and the gauge sectors. We briefly discuss the generating
functional of hard thermal amplitudes.
