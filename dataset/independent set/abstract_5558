We study some generalized notions of cohesiveness which arise
naturally in connection with effective versions of Ramsey's Theorem.
An infinite set $A$ of natural numbers is $n$--cohesive (respectively,
$n$--r--cohesive) if $A$ is almost homogeneous for every computably
enumerable (respectively, computable) $2$--coloring of the
$n$--element sets of natural numbers.  (Thus the $1$--cohesive and
$1$--r--cohesive sets coincide with the cohesive and r--cohesive sets,
respectively.)  We consider the degrees of unsolvability and
arithmetical definability levels of $n$--cohesive and $n$--r--cohesive
sets.  For example, we show that for all $n \ge 2$, there exists a
$\Delta^0_{n+1}$ $n$--cohesive set.  We improve this result for $n =
2$ by showing that there is a $\Pi^0_2$ $2$--cohesive set.  We show
that the $n$--cohesive and $n$--r--cohesive degrees together form a
linear, non--collapsing hierarchy of degrees for $n
\geq 2$.  In addition, for $n \geq 2$ we characterize the jumps of
$n$--cohesive degrees as exactly the degrees ${\bf \geq
\jump{0}{(n+1)}}$ and show that each $n$--r--cohesive degree has jump
${\bf > \jump{0}{(n)}}$.
