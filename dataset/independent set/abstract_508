For a random field on a general discrete set, we introduce a condition that
the range of the correlation from each site is within a predefined compact set
D. For such a random field omega defined on the model set Lambda that satisfies
a natural geometric condition, we develop a method to calculate the diffraction
measure of the random field. The method partitions the random field into a
finite number of random fields, each being independent and admitting the law of
large numbers. The diffraction measure of omega consists almost surely of a
pure-point component and an absolutely continuous component. The former is the
diffraction measure of the expectation E[omega], while the inverse Fourier
transform of the absolutely continuous component of omega turns out to be a
weighted Dirac comb which satisfies a simple formula. Moreover, the pure-point
component will be understood quantitatively in a simple exact formula if the
weights are continuous over the internal space of Lambda Then we provide a
sufficient condition that the diffraction measure of a random field on a model
set is still pure-point.
