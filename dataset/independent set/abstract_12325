We consider a left-transient random walk in a random environment on Z that
will be disturbed by cookies inducing a drift to the right of strength 1. The
number of cookies per site is i.i.d. and independent of the environment.
Criteria for recurrence and transience of the random walk are obtained. For
this purpose we use subcritical branching processes in random environments with
immigration and formulate criteria for recurrence and transience for these
processes.
