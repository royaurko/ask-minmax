Simple nonlinear dynamical systems with multiple stable stationary states are
often taken as models for switchlike biological systems. This paper considers
the interaction of multiple such simple multistable systems when they are
embedded together into a larger dynamical "supersystem." Attention is focused
on the network structure of the resulting set of coupled differential
equations, and the consequences of this structure on the propensity of the
embedded switches to act independently versus cooperatively. Specifically, it
is argued that both larger average and larger variance of the node degree
distribution lead to increased switch independence. Given the frequency of
empirical observations of high variance degree distributions (e.g., power-law)
in biological networks, it is suggested that the results presented here may aid
in identifying switch-integrating subnetworks as comparatively homogenous,
low-degree, substructures. Potential applications to ecological problems such
as the relationship of stability and complexity are also briefly discussed.
