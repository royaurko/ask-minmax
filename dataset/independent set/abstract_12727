We argue that the chiral conductivities of generic s-wave holographic
superfluids, whose broken U(1) symmetry is anomalous, exhibit universal
behavior at low temperatures. The universal behavior we argue for is
independent of the details of the bulk action and on the emergent geometry deep
in the bulk interior at low temperatures. Our results are contrasted against
general expectations based on an analysis of the entropy current in
superfluids.
