We find the one-way mode can be well-confined at the magnetic domain wall by
the photonic bandgap of gyromagnetic bulk material. Utilizing the well-confined
one-way mode at the domain wall, we demonstrate the photonic one-way waveguide,
splitter and bender can be realized with simple structures, which are predicted
to be high-efficiency, broadband, frequency-independent, reflection-free,
crosstalk-proof and robustness against disorder. Additionally, we find that the
splitter and bender in our proposal can be transformed into each other with
magnetic control, which may have great potential applications in all photonic
integrated circuit.
