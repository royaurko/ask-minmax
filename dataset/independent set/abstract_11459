The compatibility of the QCD sum rules and effective hadronic models
predictions are examined. For this purpose we have considered the results for
the nucleon self-energy in a dense hadronic environment provided by two
independent QCD sum-rules calculations. They are immersed in a theory of
hadronic fields giving rise to non-linear interactions, whose vertices are
parameterized in different ways. Although all of them reproduce the self-energy
used as input, very different descriptions of nuclear observables are obtained.
Only under very definite circumstances we have found an acceptable agreement
with the nuclear matter properties. To achieve this, phenomenological
parameters are not required at all.
