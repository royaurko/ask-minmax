The local conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the Local
Lorentz invariance symmetry through the approach of nonlinear realization. The
resulting effective Lagrangian, in the unitary gauge, describes a cosmological
vector field non-minimally coupling to the gravitational field. As a result of
the Higgs mechanism, the vector field absorbs the dilaton and becomes massive,
but with an independent energy scale. The Proca type vector field can be
modelled as dark energy candidate. The possibility that it further triggers
Lorentz symmetry violation is also pointed out.
