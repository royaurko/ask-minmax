We present results from a Monte Carlo investigation of a simple bilayer model
with geometrically frustrated interactions similar to those found in the mixed
layer pnictide oxides $(Sr_{2}Mn_{3}Pn_{2}O_{2}, Pn=As,Sb).$ Our model is
composed of two inequivalent square lattices with nearest neighbor intra- and
interlayer interactions. We find a ground state composed of two independent
N\'{e}el ordered layers when the interlayer exchange is an order of magnitude
weaker than the intralayer exchange, as suggested by experiment. We observe
this result independent of the number of layers in our model. We find evidence
for local orthogonal order between the layers, but it occurs in regions of
parameter space that are not experimentally realized. We conclude that
frustration caused by nearest neighbor interactions in the mixed layer pnictide
oxides is not sufficient to explain the long--range orthogonal order that is
observed experimentally, and that it is likely that other terms (e.g., local
anisotropies) in the Hamiltonian are required to explain the magnetic behavior.
