The random triangular group $\Gamma(n,p)$ is the group given by a random
group presentation with $n$ generators in which every relator of length three
is present independently with probability $p$. We show that in the evolution of
$\Gamma(n,p)$ the property of collapsing to the trivial group admits a very
sharp threshold.
