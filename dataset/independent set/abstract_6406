The scale of neutrino mass generation may be too large to explore directly,
but useful information may still be extracted from independent experimental
channels. Here I survey various model independent probes of Majorana neutrino
mass origins. An introduction to the concepts relevant to the analysis is
followed by a discussion of the physical ranges of neutrino parameters within
the context of standard and non-standard interactions. Armed with this, I move
on to systematically analyze the properties of radiatively generated neutrino
masses induced by nonrenormalizable lepton number violating effective operators
of mass dimensions five through eleven. By fitting these to the observed light
mass scale, I extract predictions for neutrino mixing as well as neutrinoless
double beta decay, rare meson/tau decays and collider phenomenology. I find
that many such models are already constrained by current data and many more
will be probed in the near future. I then move on demonstrate the utility of a
low scale seesaw mechanism via a viable sterile neutrino model that satisfies
all oscillation data as well as solves problems associated with supernova kicks
and heavy element nucleosynthesis. From this I extract predictions for tritium
and neutrinoless double beta decay searches.
