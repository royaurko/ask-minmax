To control supersymmetry and gauge invariance in super-Yang-Mills theories we
introduce new fields, called shadow fields, which enable us to enlarge the
conventional Faddeev-Popov framework and write down a set of useful
Slavnov-Taylor identities. These identities allow us to address and answer the
issue of the supersymmetric Yang-Mills anomalies, and to perform the
conventional renormalization programme in a fully regularization-independent
way.
