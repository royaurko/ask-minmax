We investigate how the lensing potential can be constrained with future
galaxy surveys using their number counts. Such a measurement is an independent
test of the standard LCDM framework and can be used to discern modified gravity
models. We perform a Fisher matrix forecast based on galaxy angular power
spectra, assuming specifications consistent with future photometric Euclid-like
surveys, for which we provide a computation and fitting formula of
magnification bias, and spectroscopic SKA-like surveys. The analysis suggests
that the amplitude of the lensing potential can be constrained at the same
level as other standard LCDM cosmological parameters.
