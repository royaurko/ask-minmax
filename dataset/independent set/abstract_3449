Consider $n$ mobile sensors placed independently at random with the uniform
distribution on a barrier represented as the unit line segment $[0,1]$. The
sensors have identical sensing radius, say $r$. When a sensor is displaced on
the line a distance equal to $d$ it consumes energy (in movement) which is
proportional to some (fixed) power $a > 0$ of the distance $d$ traveled. The
energy consumption of a system of $n$ sensors thus displaced is defined as the
sum of the energy consumptions for the displacement of the individual sensors.
  We focus on the problem of energy efficient displacement of the sensors so
that in their final placement the sensor system ensures coverage of the barrier
and the energy consumed for the displacement of the sensors to these final
positions is minimized in expectation. In particular, we analyze the problem of
displacing the sensors from their initial positions so as to attain coverage of
the unit interval and derive trade-offs for this displacement as a function of
the sensor range. We obtain several tight bounds in this setting thus
generalizing several of the results of [8] to any power $a >0$.
