We give three families of parabolic rational maps and show that every Cantor
set of circles as the Julia set of a non-hyperbolic rational map must be
quasisymmetrically equivalent to the Julia set of one map in these families for
suitable parameters. Combine a result obtained before, we give a complete
classification of the Cantor circles Julia sets in the sense of quasisymmetric
equivalence. Moreover, we study the regularity of the components of the Cantor
circles Julia sets and establish a sufficient and necessary condition when a
component of a Cantor circles Julia set is a quasicircle.
