We study the dynamics of a polymer when it is quenched from a $\theta$
solvent into a good or bad solvent by means of a Langevin equation. The
variation of the radius of gyration is studied as a function of time. For the
first stage of collapse or swelling, the characteristic time-scale is found to
be independent of the number of monomers. Other scaling laws are derived for
the diffusion regime at larger times. Although the present model is solved only
for homopolymers and doesn't include hydrodynamic interactions, these results
may be a first step towards the understanding of the early stages of protein
folding.
