In this paper we consider some families of random Cantor sets on the line and
investigate the question whether the condition that the sum of Hausdorff
dimension is larger than one implies the existence of interior points in the
difference set of two independent copies. We prove that this is the case for
the so called Mandelbrot percolation. On the other hand the same is not always
true if we apply a slightly more general construction of random Cantor sets. We
also present a complete solution for the deterministic case.
