We present a simple model of the emergence of the division of labor and the
development of a system of resource subsidy from an agent-based model of
directed resource production with variable degrees of trust between the agents.
The model has three distinct phases, corresponding to different forms of
societal organization: disconnected (independent agents), homogeneous
cooperative (collective state), and inhomogeneous cooperative (collective state
with a leader). Our results indicate that such levels of organization arise
generically as a collective effect from interacting agent dynamics, and may
have applications in a variety of systems including social insects and
microbial communities.
