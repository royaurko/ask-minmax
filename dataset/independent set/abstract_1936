A search for variable stars in the globular cluster NGC 288 was carried out
using a time-series of CCD images in the $V$ and $I$ filters. The photometry of
all stellar sources in the field of view of our images, down to $V\approx19$
mag, was performed using difference image analysis (DIA). For stars of
$\approx15$ mag, measurement accuracies of $\approx8$ mmag and $\approx10$ mmag
were achieved for $V$ and $I$ respectively. Three independent search strategies
were applied to the 5525 light curves but no new variables were found above the
threshold limits characteristic of our data set. The use of older data from the
literature combined with the present data allowed the refinement of the periods
of all known variables. Fourier light curve decomposition was performed for the
RRab and the RRc stars to obtain an estimate of ${\rm
[Fe/H]}_{ZW}=-1.62\pm0.02$ (statistical) $\pm0.14$ (systematic). A true
distance modulus of $14.768\pm0.003$ mag (statistical) $\pm0.042$ mag
(systematic), or a distance of $8.99\pm0.01$ kpc (statistical) $\pm0.17$ kpc
(systematic) was calculated from the RRab star. The RRc star predicts a
discrepant distance about one kiloparsec shorter but it is possibly a Blazhko
variable. An independent distance from the P--L relationship for SX Phe stars
leads to a distance of $8.9\pm0.3$ kpc. The SX Phe stars V5 and V9 are found to
be double mode pulsators.
