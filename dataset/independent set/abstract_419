In this article we define Kober fractional integral operators in the
multivariable case. First we consider one sequence of independent random
variables and an arbitrary function, which can act as the joint density of
another sequence of random variables. Then we define a concept, analogous to
the concept of Kober operators in the scalar variable case. This extension is
achieved by using statistical techniques and the representation gives an
interpretation in terms of a joint statistical density. Then we look at two
sets of random variables where between the sets they are independently
distributed but within each set they are dependent. Again extensions of Kober
fractional integral operator are considered. Several such statistical
interpretations are given for Kober operators in the multivariable case.
