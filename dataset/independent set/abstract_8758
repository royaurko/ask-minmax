In Telatar 1999, it is conjectured that the covariance matrices minimizing
the outage probability for MIMO channels with Gaussian fading are diagonal with
either zeros or constant values on the diagonal. In the MISO setting, this is
equivalent to conjecture that the Gaussian quadratic forms having largest tale
probability correspond to such diagonal matrices. We prove here the conjecture
in the MISO setting.
