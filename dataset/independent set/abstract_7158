Undirected graphical models are used extensively in the biological and social
sciences to encode a pattern of conditional independences between variables,
where the absence of an edge between two nodes $a$ and $b$ indicates that the
corresponding two variables $X_a$ and $X_b$ are believed to be conditionally
independent, after controlling for all other measured variables. In the
Gaussian case, conditional independence corresponds to a zero entry in the
precision matrix $\Omega$ (the inverse of the covariance matrix $\Sigma$). Real
data often exhibits heavy tail dependence between variables, which cannot be
captured by the commonly-used Gaussian or nonparanormal (Gaussian copula)
graphical models. In this paper, we study the transelliptical model, an
elliptical copula model that generalizes Gaussian and nonparanormal models to a
broader family of distributions. We propose the ROCKET method, which constructs
an estimator of $\Omega_{ab}$ that we prove to be asymptotically normal under
mild assumptions. Empirically, ROCKET outperforms the nonparanormal and
Gaussian models in terms of achieving accurate inference on simulated data. We
also compare the three methods on real data (daily stock returns), and find
that the ROCKET estimator is the only method whose behavior across subsamples
agrees with the distribution predicted by the theory.
