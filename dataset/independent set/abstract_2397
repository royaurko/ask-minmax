The infra-red fixed points are determined for all the parameters of the MSSM.
They dominate the renormalisation group running when the top-Yukawa is in the
quasi-fixed point regime (i.e. large at the GUT scale). We examine this
behaviour analytically, by solving the full set of one-loop renormalisation
group equations in the approximation that the electroweak contributions are
negligible, and also numerically. We find the quasi-fixed points for the
top-quark trilinear couplings; A_{U_{\alpha 3}} = A_{U_{3\alpha}}=-0.59 m_g
independently of the input parameters at the unification scale. All the
remaining parameters are significantly focused towards their true fixed points
at the weak scale. We examine how this increases the predictivity of the MSSM
in this regime.
