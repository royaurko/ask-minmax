We employ the Union compilation of Type Ia supernovae with a maximum
likelihood analysis to search for a dark energy dipole. To approach this
problem, we present a simple, computationally efficient, and largely model
independent method. We opted to weight each SN by its observed error estimate,
so poorly measured SNe that deviate substantially from the Hubble law do not
produce spurious results. We find, with very low significance, a dipole in the
cosmic acceleration directed roughly towards the cosmic microwave background
dipole, but this is almost certainly coincidental.
