We consider Casimir elements for the orthogonal and symplectic Lie algebras
constructed with the use of the Brauer algebra. We calculate the images of
these elements under the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and thus show that they
(together with the Pfaffian-type element in the even orthogonal case) are
algebraically independent generators of the centers of the corresponding
universal enveloping algebras.
