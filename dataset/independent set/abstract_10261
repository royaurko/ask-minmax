We consider directly the equations by which matter imposes anisotropies on
freely propagating background radiation, leading to a new way of using
anisotropy measurements to limit the deviations of the Universe from a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) geometry. This approach is complementary to
the usual Sachs-Wolfe approach: the limits obtained are not as detailed, but
they are more model-independent. We also give new results about combined
matter-radiation perturbations in an almost-FRW universe, and a new exact
solution of the linearised equations.
