We present entanglement witnesses for detecting genuine multi-qubit
entanglement. Our constructions are robust against noise and require only two
local measurement settings, independent of the number of qubits. Thus they
allow to verify entanglement of many qubits in experiments while requiring only
a small effort. In contrast, usual methods need an effort which increases
exponentially with the number of qubits. The witnesses detect states close to
GHZ states and cluster states.
