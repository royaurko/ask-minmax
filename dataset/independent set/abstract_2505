Let G be a group and S a subset of G that generates G. For each x in G define
the length l_S(x) of x relative to S to be the minimal k such that x is a
product of k elements of S. The supremum of the values l_S(x), x \in G, is
called the width of G with respect to S. Here we focus on a free group F. The
width of F relative to the set of all primitive (respectively palindromic)
elements is called the primitive (respectively palindromic) width of F. We
prove that for a free group F_n of finite rank n, both widths are infinite. A
result of independent interest is that every primitive element of F_2 is a
product of at most two palindromes.
