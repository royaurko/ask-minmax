From the preliminary data of PHENIX on the centrality dependence of the
$\pi^0$ spectrum in $p_T$ at midrapidity in heavy-ion collisions, we show that
a scaling behavior exists that is independent of the centrality. It is then
shown that $<p_T>$ degrades with increasing $N_{\rm part}$ exponentially with a
decay constant that can be quantified. A scaling distribution in terms of an
intuitive scaling variable is derived that is analogous to the KNO scaling. No
theoretical models are used in any part of this phenomenological analysis.
