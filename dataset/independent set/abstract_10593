We calculate the optical sum (OS) and the kinetic energy (KE) for a tight
binding band in the Nearly Antiferromagnetic Fermi Liquid (NAFFL) model which
has had some success in describing the electronic structure of the high $T_c$
cuprates. The interactions among electrons due to the exchange of spin
fluctuations profoundly change the probability of occupation $(n_{{\bf
k},\sigma})$ of states of momentum {\bf k} and spin $\sigma$ which is the
central quantity in the calculations of OS and KE. Normal and superconducting
states are considered as a function of temperature. Both integrals are found to
depend importantly on interactions and an independent electron model is
inadequate.
