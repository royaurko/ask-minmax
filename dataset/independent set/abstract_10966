We calculate the time independent four-point function in high temperature (T)
QCD and obtain the leading momentum dependent terms. Furthermore, we relate
these derivative interactions to derivative terms in a recently proposed finite
T effective action based on the SU(3) Wilson Line and its trace, the Polyakov
Loop. By this procedure we thus obtain a perturbative matching at finite T
between QCD and the effective model. In particular, we calculate the leading
perturbative QCD-correction to the kinetic term for the Polyakov Loop.
