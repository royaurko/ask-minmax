We prove that adding upwards closed first-order dependency atoms to
first-order logic with team semantics does not increase its expressive power
(with respect to sentences), and that the same remains true if we also add
constancy atoms. As a consequence, the negations of functional dependence,
conditional independence, inclusion and exclusion atoms can all be added to
first-order logic without increasing its expressive power.
  Furthermore, we define a class of bounded upwards closed dependencies and we
prove that unbounded dependencies cannot be defined in terms of bounded ones.
