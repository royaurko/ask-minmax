Let $A$ be an absolutely simple abelian surface without (potential) complex
multiplication, defined over the number field $K$. We explicitly give a bound
$\ell_0(A,K)$ such that, for every prime $\ell>\ell_0(A,K)$, the image of
$\operatorname{Gal}\left(\overline{K}/K\right)$ in
$\operatorname{Aut}(T_\ell(A))$ is as large as it is allowed to be by
endomorphisms and polarizations.
