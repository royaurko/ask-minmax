This paper proposes a method for abstracting control systems by timed game
automata, and is aimed at obtaining automatic controller synthesis.
  The proposed abstraction is based on partitioning the state space of a
control system using positive and negative invariant sets, generated by
Lyapunov functions. This partitioning ensures that the vector field of the
control system is transversal to the facets of the cells, which induces some
desirable properties of the abstraction. To allow a rich class of control
systems to be abstracted, the update maps of the timed game automaton are
extended.
  Conditions on the partitioning of the state space and the control are set up
to obtain sound abstractions. Finally, an example is provided to demonstrate
the method applied to a control problem related to navigation.
