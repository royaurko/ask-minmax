We review the available near- and mid- infrared photometry data sets for
white dwarfs from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) Point Source Catalog
and the Spitzer Space Telescope. These data sets have been widely used to
search for white dwarfs with an infrared excess as well as to characterize the
atmosphere of cool white dwarfs. We evaluate the reliability of the 2MASS
photometry by performing a statistical comparison with published JHK CIT
magnitudes, and by carrying out a detailed model atmosphere analysis of the
available photometry. We then present a critical examination of various results
published in the literature including data from the Spitzer Space Telescope.
