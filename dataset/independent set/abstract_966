We present a simple interpretation of the recently observed near-threshold
proton-antiproton enhancement. It is described by a set of low-energy
parameters deduced from the analysis of NantiN experiments at LEAR. We predict
a related effect in photoproduction reaction under study by CLAS collaboration.
