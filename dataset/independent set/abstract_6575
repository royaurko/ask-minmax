We study moduli of ``self-associated'' sets of points in ${\bf P}^n$ for
small $n$. In particular, we show that for $n=5$ a general such set arises as a
hyperplane section of the Lagrangean Grassmanian $LG(5,10) \subset {\bf
P}^{15}$ (this was conjectured by Eisenbud-Popescu in {\it Geometry of the Gale
transform}, J. Algebra 230); for $n=6$, a general such set arises as a
hyperplane section of the Grassmanian $G(2,6) \subset {\bf P}^{14}$. We also
make a conjecture for the next case $n=7$. Our results are analogues of Mukai's
characterization of general canonically embedded curves in ${\bf P}^6$ and
${\bf P}^7$, resp.
