A method is described which, under the assumption of SU(3) symmetry, allows
one to determine the angle gamma=Arg(Vub^*) of the unitarity triangle from
time-independent measurements of the branching ratios for the decays B^+ ->
pi^0 K^+ and B^- -> pi^0 K^-, as well as of the CP-averaged branching ratios
for the decays B^+- -> pi^+- K^0 and B^+- -> pi^+- pi^0. The effects of
electroweak penguin operators are included in a model-independent way, and
SU(3)-breaking corrections are accounted for in the factorization
approximation.
