In this review we compare the three existing sets of theoretical yields of
zero metal massive stars available in the literature. We also show how each of
these three different sets of yields fits the element abundance ratios observed
in the extremely metal poor star CD 38245. We find that, at present, no
theoretical set of yields of zero metal massive stars is able to satisfactorily
reproduce the elemental ratios [X/Fe] of this star.
