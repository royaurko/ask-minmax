Multipole expansion of spatial three-point statistics is introduced as a tool
for investigating and displaying configuration dependence. The novel
parametrization renders the relation between bi-spectrum and three-point
correlation function especially transparent as a set of two-dimensional Hankel
transforms. It is expected on theoretical grounds, that three-point statistics
can be described accurately with only a few multipoles. In particular, we show
that in the weakly non-linear regime, the multipoles of the reduced bispectrum,
$Q_l$, are significant only up to quadrupole. Moreover, the non-linear bias in
the weakly non-linear regime only affects the monopole order of these
statistics. As a consequence, a simple, novel set of estimators can be
constructed to constrain galaxy bias. In addition, the quadrupole to dipole
ratio is independent of the bias, thus it becomes a novel diagnostic of the
underlying theoretical assumptions: weakly non-linear gravity and perturbative
local bias. To illustrate the use of our approach, we present predictions based
on both power law, and CDM models. We show that the presently favoured
SDSS-WMAP concordance model displays strong ``baryon bumps'' in the $Q_l$'s.
Finally, we sketch out three practical techniques estimate these novel
quantities: they amount to new, and for the first time edge corrected,
estimators for the bispectrum.
