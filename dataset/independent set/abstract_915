We describe the morphological composition of a sample of 518 galaxies in the
field of CL1358+62 at z=0.33, drawn from a large HST mosaic covering 53 sq.
arcmin. The sample is complete to I=22, corresponding to M_V=-18.5 in the rest
frame. The galaxies have been independently classified by the contributors of this
paper and by Alan Dressler. For galaxies with I<21, the two sets of classifiers
agree on the total early-type population, but disagree on the S0/E ratio. We
discuss the constraints on morphological evolution and the implication of the
differing S0/E ratios. We use our large body of spectra to make the
correspondence between morphological and spectral type.
