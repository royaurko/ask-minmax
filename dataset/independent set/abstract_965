We carry out an analysis of the non-universal supersymmetry breaking scalar
masses arising in SO(10) supersymmetric unification. By considering patterns of
squark and slepton masses, we derive a set of sum rules for the sfermion masses
which are independent of the manner in which SO(10) breaks to the Standard
Model gauge group via its SU(5) subgroups. The phenomenology arising from such
non-universality is unaffected by the symmetry breaking pattern, so long as the
breaking occurs via any of the SU(5) subgroups of the SO(10) group.
