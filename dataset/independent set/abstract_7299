In this article we investigate the natural domain of definition of a holonomy
map associated to a singular holomorphic foliation of the complex projective
plane. We prove that germs of holonomy between algebraic curves can have large
sets of singularities for the analytic continuation. In the Riccati context we
provide examples with natural boundary and maximal sets of singularities. In
the generic case we provide examples having at least a Cantor set of
singularities and even a nonempty open set of singularities. The examples
provided are based on the presence of sufficiently rich contracting dynamics in
the holonomy pseudogroup of the foliation.
