The basic principles of General Theory of Relativity historically have been
tested in gedanken experiments in rotating frame of references. One of the key
issues, which still evokes a lot of controversy, is the centrifugal
acceleration. Machabeli & Rogava (1994) argued that centrifugal acceleration
reverse direction for particles moving radially with relativistic velocities
within a "bead on a wire" approximation. We show that this result is
frame-dependent and reflects a special relativistic dilution of time (as
correctly argued by de Felice (1995)) and is analogous to freezing of motion on
the black hole horizon as seen by a remote observer. It is a reversal of
coordinate acceleration; there is no such effect as measured by a defined set
of observers, e.g., proper and/or comoving. Frame-independent velocity of a
"bead" with respect to stationary rotating observers increases and formally
reaches the speed of light on the light cylinder. In general relativity,
centrifugal force does reverse its direction at photon circular orbit, r=3M in
Schwarzschild metric, as argued by Abramowicz (1990).
