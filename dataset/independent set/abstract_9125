We obtain a model-independent expression for the complete Dalitz plot of
semileptonic decays of polarized hyperons, which includes both the three-body
and the four-body regions. We calculate radiative corrections to order alpha,
neglecting terms of order alpha q/(pi M_1), where q is the four-momentum
transfer and M_1 is the mass of the decaying hyperon. Our results exhibit
explicitly the correlation between the emitted hyperon three-momentum and the
spin of the decaying hyperon. This allows us to obtain the corresponding
radiative corrections to the integrated emitted hyperon spin-asymmetry
coefficient. Our formulas are valid for charged as well as for neutral decaying
hyperons and are appropriate for model-independent experimental analysis
whether the real photon is discriminated or not.
