Statistical data is often analyzed as a contingency table, sometimes with
empty cells called zeros. Such sparse tables can be due to scarse observations
classified in numerous categories, as for example in genetic association
studies. Thus, classical independence tests involving Pearson's chi-square
statistic Q or Kullback's minimum discrimination information statistic G cannot
be applied because some of the expected frequencies are too small. More
generally, we consider goodness of fit tests with composite hypotheses for
sparse multinomial vectors and suggest simple corrections for Q and G that
improve and generalize known procedures such as Ku's. We show that the
corrected statistics share the same asymptotic distribution as the initial
statistics. We produce Monte Carlo estimations for the type I and type II
errors on a toy example. Finally, we apply the corrected statistics to
independence tests on epidemiologic and ecological data.
