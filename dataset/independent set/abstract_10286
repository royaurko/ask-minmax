We find that in the kinematic limit the ensemble averaged square of the
curvature of magnetic field lines is exponentially amplified in time by the
turbulent motions in a highly conductive plasma. At the same time, the ensemble
averaged curvature vector exponentially decays to zero. Thus, independently of
the initial conditions, the fluctuation field becomes very curved, and the
curvature vector becomes highly isotropic.
