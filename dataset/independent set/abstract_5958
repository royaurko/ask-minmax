Kaleu is an independent, true phase space generator. After providing it with
some information about the field theory and the particular multi-particle
scattering process under consideration, it returns importance sampled random
phase space points. Providing it also with the total weight of each generated
phase space point, it further adapts to the integration problem on the fly. It
is written in Fortran, such that it can independently deal with several
scattering processes in parallel.
