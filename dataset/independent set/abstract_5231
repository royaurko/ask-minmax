In this paper targetability of chaotic sets with small controls is discussed
by virtue of some results of geometric control theory. It is proved that given
a chaotic set {\Lambda}, it is possible to steer a orbit in to every final
state in some neighborhood of the chaotic set by suitable small perturbations
to the parameters of the system under the Lie rank condition.
