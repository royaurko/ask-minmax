An imperfect cosmic fluid with energy flux is analyzed. Even though its
energy density $\rho$ is positive, the pressure $p = -\rho$ due to the fact
that the metric is asymptotically de Sitter. The kinematical quantities for a
nongeodesic congruence are computed. The scalar expansion is time independent
but divergent at the singularity $r = 2m$. Far from the central mass $m$ and
for a cosmic time $\bar{t} << H^{-1}$, the heat flux $q$ does not depend on
Newton's constant $G$.
