We propose a cooperative asymmetry-induced transparency, CAIT, formed by
collective excitations in metamaterial arrays of discrete resonators. CAIT can
display a sharp transmission resonance even when the constituent resonators
individually exhibit broad resonances. We further show how dynamically
reconfiguring the metamaterial allows one to actively control the transparency.
While reminiscent of electromagnetically induced transparency, which can be
described by independent emitters, CAIT relies on a cooperative response
resulting from strong radiative couplings between the resonators.
