We establish a duality result between linear index coding and Locally
Repairable Codes (LRCs). Specifically, we show that a natural extension of LRCs
we call Generalized Locally Repairable Codes (GLCRs) are exactly dual to linear
index codes. In a GLRC, every node is decodable from a specific set of other
nodes and these sets induce a recoverability directed graph. We show that the
dual linear subspace of a GLRC is a solution to an index coding instance where
the side information graph is this GLRC recoverability graph. We show that the
GLRC rate is equivalent to the complementary index coding rate, i.e. the number
of transmissions saved by coding. Our second result uses this duality to
establish a new upper bound for the multiple unicast network coding problem. In
multiple unicast network coding, we are given a directed acyclic graph and r
sources that want to send independent messages to r corresponding destinations.
Our new upper bound is efficiently computable and relies on a strong
approximation result for complementary index coding. We believe that our bound
could lead to a logarithmic approximation factor for multiple unicast network
coding if a plausible connection we state is verified.
