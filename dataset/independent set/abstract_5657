We consider the depletion of primordial deuterium in the interior of
substellar objects as a function of mass, age and absolute magnitude in several
photometric passbands. We characterize potential spectroscopic signatures of
deuterium in the lines of deuterated water HDO. These results will serve as a
useful, independent diagnostic to characterize the mass and/or the age of young
substellar objects, and to provide an independent age determination of very
young clusters. These results can serve to identify objects at the
deuterium-burning limit and to confront the theoretical prediction that
D-burning is a necessary condition to form star-like objects.
