Let $\eta^*_n$ denote the maximum, at time $n$, of a nonlattice
one-dimensional branching random walk $\eta_n$ possessing (enough) exponential
moments. In a seminal paper, Aidekon demonstrated convergence of $\eta^*_n$ in
law, after recentering, and gave a representation of the limit. We give here a
shorter proof of this convergence by employing reasoning motivated by Bramson,
Ding and Zeitouni. Instead of spine methods and a careful analysis of the
renewal measure for killed random walks, our approach employs a modified
version of the second moment method that may be of independent interest.
