In this talk I have presented the data analysis results of extracting
properties of halo WIMPs: the mass and the (ratios between the)
spin-independent and spin-dependent couplings/cross sections on nucleons by the
AMIDAS website. Although non-standard astronomical setup has been used to
generate pseudodata sets for our analyses, it has been found that, without
prior information/assumption about the local density and velocity distribution
of halo Dark Matter, these WIMP properties have been reconstructed with ~5% to
< ~40% deviations from the input values.
