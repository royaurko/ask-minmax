We consider the length L of the longest common subsequence of two randomly
uniformly and independently chosen n character words over a k-ary alphabet.
Subadditivity arguments yield that the expected value of L, when normalized by
n, converges to a constant C_k. We prove a conjecture of Sankoff and Mainville
from the early 80's claiming that C_k\sqrt{k} goes to 2 as k goes to infinity.
