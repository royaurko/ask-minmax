In the two-Higgs doublet extension of the standard model, flavor-changing
neutral couplings arise naturally. In the lepton sector, the largest such
coupling is expected to be $\mu-\tau-\phi#. We consider the effects of this
coupling on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. The resulting bound on
the coupling, unlike previous bounds, is independent of the value of other
unknown couplings. It will be significantly improved by the upcoming E821
experiment at Brookhaven National Lab.
