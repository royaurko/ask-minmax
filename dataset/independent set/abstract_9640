We consider the relativistic scattering of unequal-mass scalar particles
through graviton exchange in the small-angle high-energy regime and calculate
the scattering amplitude up to the next-to-leading eikonal correction,
including gravitational effects of the same order. We find that these power
corrections are consistent with the exponentiation of a corrected phase in
impact parameter space, once all possible graviton exchanges are summed. The
leading power correction is suppressed by a single power of the ratio of
momentum transfer to the energy of the light particle in the rest frame of the
heavy particle, independent of the heavy particle mass. For large enough
heavy-particle mass, the saddle point for the impact parameter is modified
compared to the leading order by a multiple of the Schwarzschild radius
determined by the mass of the heavy particle, independent of the energy of the
light particle.
