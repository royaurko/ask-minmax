Let R be a Dedekind domain. Enochs' solution of the Flat Cover Conjecture was
extended as follows:
  (*) If C is a cotorsion pair generated by a class of cotorsion modules, then
C is cogenerated by a set.
  We show that (*) is the best result provable in ZFC in case R has a countable
spectrum: the Uniformization Principle UP^+ implies that C is not cogenerated
by a set whenever C is a cotorsion pair generated by a set which contains a
non-cotorsion module.
