This paper proposes a codebook for jointly quantizing channel direction
information (CDI) of spatially correlated three-dimensional (3D)
multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) channels. To reduce the dimension for
quantizing the CDI of large antenna arrays, we introduce a special structure to
the codewords by using Tucker decomposition to exploit the unique features of
3D MIMO channels. Specifically, the codeword consists of four parts each with
low dimension individually targeting at a different type of information:
statistical CDIs in horizontal direction and in vertical direction, statistical
power coupling, and instantaneous CDI. The proposed codebook avoids the
redundancy led by existing independent CDI quantization. Analytical results
provide a sufficient condition on 3D MIMO channels to show that the proposed
codebook can achieve the same quantization performance as the well-known
rotated codebook applied to the global channel CDI, but with significant
reduction in the required statistical channel information. Simulation results
validate our analysis and demonstrate that the proposed joint CDI quantization
provides substantial performance gain over independent CDI quantization.
