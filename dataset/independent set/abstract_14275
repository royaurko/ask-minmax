In this paper we define a sequence of monads $\mathbb{T}^(\infty;n)$
$(n\in\mathbb{N})$ on $\infty$-$\mathbb{G}\text{r}$, the category of the
$\infty$-graphs. We conjecture that algebras for $\mathbb{T}^(0;n)$ which are
defined in a purely algebraic setting, are models of weak $\infty$-groupoids.
And for all $n>1$ we conjecture that algebras for $\mathbb{T}^(\infty;n)$ which
are defined in a purely algebraic setting, are models of weak $(\infty;
n)$-categories.
