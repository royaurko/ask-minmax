Inclusive studies of nuclear photoabsorption have provided clear evidence of
medium modifications but the results have not yet been explained in a model
independent way. A deeper understanding of the situation is anticipated from a
detailed experimental study of meson photoproduction from nuclei in exclusive
reactions. Recent results on meson production in photonuclear experiments
indicate a large difference between quasifree meson production from the nuclear
surface and non-quasifree components.
