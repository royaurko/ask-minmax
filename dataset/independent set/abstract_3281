We consider the estimation of joint causal effects from observational data.
In particular, we propose new methods to estimate the effect of multiple
simultaneous interventions (e.g., multiple gene knockouts), under the
assumption that the observational data come from an unknown linear structural
equation model (with independent errors). We derive asymptotic variances of our
estimators when the underlying causal structure is partly known, as well as
high-dimensional consistency when the causal structure is fully unknown and the
joint distribution is multivariate Gaussian. We compare the estimators in
simulation studies and also illustrate them on data from the DREAM4 challenge.
