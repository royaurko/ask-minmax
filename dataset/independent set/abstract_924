We investigate the suggestion that there are stellar populations in some
globular clusters with enhanced helium (Y from 0.28 to 0.40) compared to the
primordial value. We assume that a previous generation of massive Asymptotic
Giant Branch (AGB) stars have polluted the cluster. Two independent sets of AGB
yields are used to follow the evolution of helium and CNO using a Salpeter
initial mass function (IMF) and two top-heavy IMFs. In no case are we able to
produce the postulated large Y ~ 0.35 without violating the observational
constraint that the CNO content is nearly constant.
