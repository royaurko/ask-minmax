A search for the Higgsstrahlung process e+e- -> hZ is described, where the
neutral Higgs boson h is assumed to decay into hadronic final states. In order
to be sensitive to a broad range of models, the search is performed independent
of the flavour content of the Higgs boson decay. The analysis is based on e+e-
collision data collected by the OPAL detector at energies between 192 GeV and
209 GeV. The search does not reveal any significant excess over the Standard
Model background prediction. Results are combined with previous searches at
energies around 91 GeV and at 189 GeV. A limit is set on the product of the
cross-section and the hadronic branching ration of the Higgs boson, as a
function of the Higgs boson mass. Assuming the hZ coupling predicted by the
Standard Model, and a Higgs boson decaying only into hadronic final states, a
lower bound of 104 GeV/c2 is set on the mass at the 95% confidence level.
