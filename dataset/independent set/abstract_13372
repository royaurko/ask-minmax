We propose a framework for quantitative evaluation of dynamical tendency for
polarization in arbitrary random variable that can be decomposed into a pair of
orthogonal subspaces. The method uses measures based on comparisons of given
dynamics to its counterpart with statistically independent components. The
formalism of previously considered X-distributions is used to express the
aforementioned comparisons, in effect putting the former approach on solid
footing. Our analysis leads to definition of a suitable correlation coefficient
with clear statistical meaning. We apply the method to the dynamics induced by
pure-glue lattice QCD in local left-right components of overlap Dirac
eigenmodes. It is found that, in finite physical volume, there exists a
non-zero physical scale in the spectrum of eigenvalues such that eigenmodes at
smaller (fixed) eigenvalues exhibit convex X-distribution (positive
correlation), while at larger eigenvalues the distribution is concave (negative
correlation). This chiral polarization scale thus separates a regime where
dynamics enhances chirality relative to statistical independence from a regime
where it suppresses it, and gives an objective definition to the notion of
"low" and "high" Dirac eigenmode. We propose to investigate whether the
polarization scale remains non-zero in the infinite volume limit, in which case
it would represent a new kind of low energy scale in QCD.
