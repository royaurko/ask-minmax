This paper is devoted to study the symmetries of the energy-momentum tensor
for the static spacetimes with maximal symmetric transverse spaces. We solve
matter collineation equations for the four main cases by taking one, two, three
and four non-zero components of the vector $\xi^a$. For one component non-zero,
we obtain only one matter collineation for the non-degenerate case and for two
components non-zero, the non-degenerate case yields maximum three matter
collineations. When we take three components non-zero, we obtain three, four
and five independent matter collineations for the non-degenerate and for the
degenerate cases respectively. This case generalizes the degenerate case of the
static spherically symmetric spacetimes. The last case (when all the four
components are non-zero) provides the generalization of the non-degenerate case
of the static spherically symmetric spacetimes. This gives either four, five,
six, seven or ten independent matter collineations in which four are the usual
Killing vectors and rest are the proper matter collineations. It is mentioned
here that we obtain different constraint equations which, on solving, may
provide some new exact solutions of the Einstein field equations.
