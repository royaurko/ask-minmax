The non-leptonic hyperon decays are analyzed up to one-loop order including
all counterterms in the framework of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory.
We use the exchange of the spin-3/2 decuplet resonances as an indication of
which low-energy constants contribute significantly to these investigated
processes . We choose four independent decay amplitudes that are not related by
isospin relations in order to perform a fit for the pertinent low-energy
constants and find a satisfactory fit both for s- and p-waves. The chiral
corrections to the lowest order forms for the s-waves are moderate whereas
there are significant modifications of the p-wave amplitudes.
