R. Duncan Luce once mentioned in a private conversation that he did not
consider Kolmogorov's probability theory well-constructed because it treats
stochastic independence as a "numerical accident," while it should be treated
as a fundamental relation, more basic than the assignment of numerical
probabilities. I argue here that stochastic independence is indeed a "numerical
accident," a special form of stochastic dependence between random variables
(most broadly defined). The idea that it is fundamental may owe its
attractiveness to the confusion of stochastic independence with stochastic
unrelatedness, the situation when two or more random variables have no joint
distribution, "have nothing to do with each other." Kolmogorov's probability
theory cannot be consistently constructed without allowing for stochastic
unrelatedness, in fact making it a default situation: any two random variables
recorded under mutually incompatible conditions are stochastically unrelated.
However, stochastically unrelated random variables can always be
probabilistically coupled, i.e., imposed a joint distribution upon, and this
generally can be done in an infinity of ways, independent coupling being merely
one of them. The notions of stochastic unrelatedness and all possible couplings
play a central role in the foundation of probability theory and, especially, in
the theory of probabilistic contextuality.
