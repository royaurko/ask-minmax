In an effective theory approach, the full minimal set of leading
contributions to anomalous charged-current top couplings comprises various new
trilinear tbW as well as quartic tbff' interaction vertices, some of which are
related to one another by equations of motion. While much effort in earlier
work has gone into the extraction of the trilinear couplings from single top
measurements, we argue in this article that these structures can be assessed
independently by other observables, while single top production forms a unique
window to the four-fermion sector. An effective theory approach is employed to
infer and classify the minimal set of such couplings from dimension six
operators in the minimal flavor violation scheme. In the phenomenological
analysis, we present a Monte Carlo study at detector level to quantify the
expected performance of the next LHC run to bound as well as distinguish the
various contact couplings. Special attention is directed toward differential
final state distributions including detector effects as a means to optimize the
signal sensitivity as well as the discriminative power with respect to the
possible coupling structures.
