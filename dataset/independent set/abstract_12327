A closed Teichmuller geodesic in the moduli space M_g of Riemann surfaces of
genus g is called L-short if it has length at most L/g. We show that, for any L
> 0, there exist e_2 > e_1 > 0, independent of g, so that the L-short geodesics
in M_g all lie in the intersection of the e_1-thick part and the e_2-thin part.
We also estimate the number of L-short geodesics in M_g, bounding this from
above and below by polynomials in g whose degrees depend on L and tend to
infinity as L does.
