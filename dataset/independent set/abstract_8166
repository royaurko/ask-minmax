Jin proved that whenever $A$ and $B$ are sets of positive upper density in
$\Z$, $A+B$ is piecewise syndetic. Jin's theorem was subsequently generalized
by Jin and Keisler to a certain family of abelian groups, which in particular
contains $\Z^d$. Answering a question of Jin and Keisler, we show that this
result can be extended to countable amenable groups.
  Moreover we establish that such sumsets (or -- depending on the notation --
"productsets") are piecewise Bohr, a result which for $G=\Z$ was proved by
Bergelson, Furstenberg and Weiss. In the case of an abelian group $G$, we show
that a set is piecewise Bohr if and only if it contains a sumset of two sets of
positive upper Banach density.
