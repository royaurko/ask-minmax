We study the Collins effect in the azimuthal asymmetric distribution of
hadrons inside a high energy jet in the single transverse polarized proton
proton scattering. From the detailed analysis of one-gluon and two-gluon
exchange diagrams contributions, the Collins function is found the same as that
in the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and e^+e^- annihilations. The
eikonal propagators in these diagrams do not contribute to the phase needed for
the Collins-type single spin asymmetry, and the universality is derived as a
result of the Ward identity. We argue that this conclusion depends on the
momentum flow of the exchanged gluon and the kinematic constraints in the
fragmentation process, and is generic and model-independent.
