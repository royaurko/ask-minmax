We construct a "higher dimensional" version 2V of Thompson's group V. Like V
it is an infinite, finitely presented, simple subgroup of the homeomorphism
group of the Cantor set, but we show that it is not isomorphic to V by showing
that the actions on the Cantor set are not topologically conjugate: 2V has an
element with "chaotic" action, while V cannot have such an element. A theorem
of Rubin is then applied which shows that for these two groups, isomorphism
would imply topological conjugacy.
