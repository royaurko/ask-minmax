We present a new linear scaling method for the energy minimization step of
semiempirical and first-principles Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham calculations. It
is based on the self-consistent calculation of the optimum localized orbitals
of any localization method of choice and on the use of orbital-specific basis
sets. The full set of localized orbitals of a large molecule is seen as an
orbital mosaic where each tessera is made of only a few of them. The orbital
tesserae are computed out of a set of embedded cluster pseudoeigenvalue coupled
equations which are solved in a building-block self-consistent fashion. In each
iteration, the embedded cluster equations are solved independently of each
other and, as a result, the method is parallel at a high level of the
calculation. In addition to full system calculations, the method enables to
perform simpler, much less demanding embedded cluster calculations, where only
a fraction of the localized molecular orbitals are variational while the rest
are frozen, taking advantage of the transferability of the localized orbitals
of a given localization method between similar molecules. Monitoring single
point energy calculations of large poly(ethylene oxide) molecules and three
dimensional carbon monoxide clusters using an extended Huckel Hamiltonian are
presented.
