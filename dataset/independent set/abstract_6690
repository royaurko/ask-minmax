We consider a reconciliation problem, where two hosts wish to synchronize
their respective sets. Efficient solutions for minimizing the communication
cost between the two hosts have been previously proposed in the literature.
However, they rely on prior knowledge about the size of the set differences
between the two sets to be reconciled. In this paper, we propose a method which
can achieve comparable efficiency without assuming this prior knowledge. Our
method uses compressive sensing techniques which can leverage the expected
sparsity in set differences. We study the performance of the method via
theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.
