Recent measurements of cosmological parameters from the microwave background
radiation, type Ia supernovae, and the age of globular clusters help determine
the relic matter density in the universe. It is first shown with mild
cosmological assumptions that the relic matter density satisfies $\Omega_M h^2
< 0.6$ independent of the cosmological constant and independent of the SNIa
data. Including the SNIa data, the constraint becomes $\Omega_M h^2 < 0.35$.
This result is then applied to supersymmetric models motivated by generic
features in supergravity mediated supersymmetry breaking. The result is an
upper bound on gaugino masses within reach of the LHC and a 1.5 TeV lepton
collider. Thus, cosmological considerations are beginning to limit the
supersymmetric mass spectra in the experimentally verifiable range without
recourse to finetuning arguments, and without assuming a zero cosmological
constant.
