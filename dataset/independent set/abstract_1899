We trace with analytical methods and in a model parameter independent manner
the independent bits of Fisher information of each of the moments of the
lognormal distribution, as a now standard prescription for the distribution of
the cosmological matter density field, as it departs from Gaussian initial
conditions. We show that, when entering the regime of large fluctuations, only
a tiny, dramatically decaying fraction of the total information content remains
accessible through the extraction of the full series of moments of the field.
This is due to a known peculiarity of highly tailed distributions, that they
cannot be uniquely recovered given the values of all of their moments. This
renders under this lognormal assumption cosmological probes such as the
correlation function hierarchy or equivalently their Fourier transforms
fundamentally limited once the field becomes non linear, for any parameter of
interest. We show that the fraction of the information accessible from
two-point correlations decays to zero following the inverse squared variance of
the field. We discuss what general properties of a random field's probability
density function are making the correlation function hierarchy an efficient or
inefficient, complete or incomplete set of probes of any model parameter.
