We study the pathology that causes tropical eigenspaces of distinct
supertropical eigenvalues of a non-singular matrix $A$, to be dependent. We
show that in lower dimensions the eigenvectors of distinct eigenvalues are
independent, as desired. The index set that differentiates between subsequent
essential monomials of the characteristic polynomial, yields an eigenvalue
$\lambda$, and corresponds to the columns of $adj(A+\lambda I)$ from which the
eigenvectors are taken. We ascertain the cause for failure in higher
dimensions, and prove that independence of the eigenvectors is recovered in
case the "difference criterion" holds, defined in terms of disjoint differences
between index sets of subsequent coefficients. We conclude by considering the
eigenvectors of the matrix $A^\nabla:=\frac{1}{det(A)}adj(A)$ and the
connection of the independence question to generalized eigenvectors.
