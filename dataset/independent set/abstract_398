In one dimension, the theory of the $G$-normal distribution is
well-developed, and many results from the classical setting have a nonlinear
counterpart. Significant challenges remain in multiple dimensions, and some of
what has already been discovered is quite nonintuitive. By answering several
classically-inspired questions concerning independence, covariance uncertainty,
and behavior under certain linear operations, we continue to highlight the
fascinating range of unexpected attributes of the multidimensional $G$-normal
distribution.
