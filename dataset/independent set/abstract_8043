Using a strong version of the Curve Selection Lemma for real semianalytic
sets, we prove that for an arbitrary connected Lie group $G$, each connected
component of the set $E_n(G)$ of all elements of order $n$ in $G$ is a
conjugacy class in $G$. In particular, all conjugacy classes of finite order in
$G$ are closed. Some properties of connected components of $E_n(G)$ are also
given.
