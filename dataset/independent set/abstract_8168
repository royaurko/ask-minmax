We prove that for any germ of complex analytic set in $\CC^n$ there exists a
hypersurface singularity whose Milnor fibration has trivial geometric monodromy
and fibre homotopic to the complement of the germ of complex analytic set. As
an application we show an example of a quasi-homogeneous hypersurface
singularity, with trivial geometric monodromy and simply connected and
non-formal Milnor fibre.
