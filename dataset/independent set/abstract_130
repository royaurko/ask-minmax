In this paper we consider an isotropic variant of the $BMO$-type norm
recently introduced by Bourgain, Brezis and Mironescu. We prove that, when
considering characteristic functions of sets, this norm is related to the
perimeter. A byproduct of our analysis is a new characterization of the
perimeter of sets in terms of this norm, independent of the theory of
distributions.
