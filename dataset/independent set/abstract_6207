We prove a strong law of large numbers for random sets with bounded and
closed values contained in an arbitrary (not necessarily separable) Banach
space. We make use of a notion of convergence of sets introduced by Fisher,
which is stronger than Wijsman's convergence but in general not comparable with
Mosco's convergence.
