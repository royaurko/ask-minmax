Geomagnetic effects distort the zenith angle distribution of sub--GeV and
few--GeV atmospheric neutrinos, breaking the up--down symmetry that would be
present in the absence of neutrino oscillations and without a geomagnetic
field. The geomagnetic effects also produce a characteristic azimuthal
dependence of the $\nu$--fluxes, related to the well known east--west effect,
that should be detectable in neutrino experiments of sufficiently large mass.
We discuss these effects quantitatively. Because the azimuthal dependence is in
first order independent of any oscillation effect, it is a useful diagnostic
tool for studying possible systematic effects in the search for neutrino
oscillations.
