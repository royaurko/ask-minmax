We present a new concept for a plasma wakefield accelerator driven by
magnetowaves (MPWA). This concept was originally proposed as a viable mechanism
for the "cosmic accelerator" that would accelerate cosmic particles to ultra
high energies in the astrophysical setting. Unlike the more familiar Plasma
Wakefield Accelerator (PWFA) and the Laser Wakefield Accelerator (LWFA) where
the drivers, the charged-particle beam and the laser, are independently
existing entities, MPWA invokes the high-frequency and high-speed whistler mode
as the driver, which is a medium wave that cannot exist outside of the plasma.
Aside from the difference in drivers, the underlying mechanism that excites the
plasma wakefield via the ponderomotive potential is common. Our computer
simulations show that under appropriate conditions, the plasma wakefield
maintains very high coherence and can sustain high-gradient acceleration over
many plasma wavelengths. We suggest that in addition to its celestial
application, the MPWA concept can also be of terrestrial utility. A
proof-of-principle experiment on MPWA would benefit both terrestrial and
celestial accelerator concepts.
