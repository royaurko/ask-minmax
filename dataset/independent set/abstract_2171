In this paper, we propose algorithms which preserve energy in empirical mode
decomposition (EMD), generating finite $n$ number of band limited Intrinsic
Mode Functions (IMFs). In the first energy preserving EMD (EPEMD) algorithm, a
signal is decomposed into linearly independent (LI), non orthogonal yet energy
preserving (LINOEP) IMFs and residue (EPIMFs). It is shown that a vector in an
inner product space can be represented as a sum of LI and non orthogonal
vectors in such a way that Parseval's type property is satisfied. From the set
of $n$ IMFs, through Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method (GSOM), $n!$ set of
orthogonal functions can be obtained. In the second algorithm, we show that if
the orthogonalization process proceeds from lowest frequency IMF to highest
frequency IMF, then the GSOM yields functions which preserve the properties of
IMFs and the energy of a signal. With the Hilbert transform, these IMFs yield
instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes as functions of time that reveal the
imbedded structures of a signal. The instantaneous frequencies and square of
amplitudes as functions of time produce a time-frequency-energy distribution,
referred as the Hilbert spectrum, of a signal. Simulations have been carried
out for the analysis of various time series and real life signals to show
comparison among IMFs produced by EMD, EPEMD, ensemble EMD and multivariate EMD
algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate the power of this proposed method.
