We show that D=4 Schwarzschild black holes can arise from a doublet of
Euclidean D3-antiD3 pairs embedded in D=10 Lorentzian spacetime. By starting
from a D=10 type IIB supergravity description for the D3-antiD3 pairs and
wrapping one of them over an external 2-sphere, we derive all vacuum solutions
compatible with the symmetry of the problem. Analysing under what condition a
Euclidean brane configuration embedded in a Lorentzian spacetime can lead to a
time-independent spacetime, enables us to single out the embedded D=4
Schwarzschild spacetime as the unique solution generated by the D3-antiD3
pairs. In particular we argue on account of energy-conservation that
time-independent solutions arising from isolated Euclidean branes require those
branes to sit at event horizons. In combination with previous work this
self-dual brane-antibrane origin of the black hole allows for a microscopic
counting of its Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Finally we indicate how
Hawking-radiation can be understood from the associated tachyon condensation
process.
