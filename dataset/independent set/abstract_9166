The NA60 experiment has studied low-mass muon pair production in In-In
collisions at 158 AGeV with unprecedented precision. Thus, there is hope that
the in-medium modifications of the vector meson spectral function can be
constrained more thoroughly than from previous experiments. Towards this goal,
we present a study comparing different models for the in-medium modification of
vector mesons. In particular, we investigate what can be learned about
collisional broadening by a medium at finite temperature and baryon density and
what model independent constraints can be obtained from the data. Of special
relevance is a comparison to $p_T$-cuts of the dilepton spectra. Those not only
provide independent tests of the evolution model and $p_T$-dependence of the
spectral function but also unambiguously decide if the observed yield in the
higher mass spectrum $M > 1 {\rm GeV}$ is mainly due to the hot phase of the
evolution or four pion annihilation processes.
