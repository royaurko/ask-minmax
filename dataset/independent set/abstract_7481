We study charge transfer between donor-acceptor molecules subject to a mirror
symmetry constraint in the presence of a dissipative environment. The symmetry
requirement leads to the breakdown of the standard single reaction coordinate
description, and to a new charge transfer theory, in the limit of low
temperature, based on two independent reaction coordinates of equal relevance.
We discuss implications of these results to charge transfer in DNA.
