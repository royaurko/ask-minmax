In a previous paper, the contributor constructed frames and oversampling formulas
for band-limited functions, in the framework of the theory of shift-invariant
spaces. In this article we study the problem of recovering missing samples.
  We find a sufficient condition for the recovery of a finite set of missing
samples. The condition is expressed as a linear independence of the components
of a vector W over the space of trigonometric polynomials determined by the
frequencies of the missing samples. We apply the theory to the derivative
sampling of any order and we illustrate our results with a numerical
experiment.
