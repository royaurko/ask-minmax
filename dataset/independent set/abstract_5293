We construct Feigenbaum quadratic polynomials whose Julia sets have positive
Lebesgue measure. They provide first examples of rational maps for which the
hyperbolic dimension is different from the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia
set. The corresponding set of parameters has positive Hausdorff dimension.
