It is consistent for every (1 <= n< omega) that (2^omega = omega_n) and
there is a function (F:[omega_n]^{< omega}-> omega) such that every finite set
can be written at most (2^n-1) ways as the union of two distinct monocolored
sets. If GCH holds, for every such coloring there is a finite set that can be
written at least (sum^n_{i=1}{n+i choose n}{n choose i}) ways as the union of
two sets with the same color.
