We will analyze the constraint structure of the Einstein-Hilbert first-order
action in two dimensions using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. We will be able to
find a set of involutive, as well as a set of non-involutive constraints. Using
generalized brackets we will show how to assure integrability of the theory, to
eliminate the set of non-involutive constraints, and to build the field
equations.
