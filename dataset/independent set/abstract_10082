We present a short tutorial and introduction to using the R package TDA,
which provides some tools for Topological Data Analysis. In particular, it
includes implementations of functions that, given some data, provide
topological information about the underlying space, such as the distance
function, the distance to a measure, the kNN density estimator, the kernel
density estimator, and the kernel distance. The salient topological features of
the sublevel sets (or superlevel sets) of these functions can be quantified
with persistent homology. We provide an R interface for the efficient
algorithms of the C++ libraries GUDHI, Dionysus and PHAT, including a function
for the persistent homology of the Rips filtration, and one for the persistent
homology of sublevel sets (or superlevel sets) of arbitrary functions evaluated
over a grid of points. The significance of the features in the resulting
persistence diagrams can be analyzed with functions that implement recently
developed statistical methods. The R package TDA also includes the
implementation of an algorithm for density clustering, which allows us to
identify the spatial organization of the probability mass associated to a
density function and visualize it by means of a dendrogram, the cluster tree.
