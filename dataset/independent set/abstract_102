We study average-case complexity of branch-and-bound for maximum independent
set in random graphs under the $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$ distribution. In this model
every pair $(u,v)$ of vertices belongs to $E$ with probability $p$
independently on the existence of any other edge. We make a precise case
analysis, providing phase transitions between subexponential and exponential
complexities depending on the probability $p$ of the random model.
