Broad Absorption Line Regions - BALR are composed of a number of successive
independent absorbing density layers. Using the GR model, we analyze the UV Si
IV ({\lambda}{\lambda}1393.755 - 1402.770), O IV ({\lambda}1401.156) and C IV
({\lambda}{\lambda}1548.187 - 1550.772) resonance lines in the spectra of a
certain QSO and discuss the results concerning its kinematic properties
(rotational, radial and random velocities).
