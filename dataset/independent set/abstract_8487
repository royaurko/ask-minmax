Point sets matching method is very important in computer vision, feature
extraction, fingerprint matching, motion estimation and so on. This paper
proposes a robust point sets matching method. We present an iterative algorithm
that is robust to noise case. Firstly, we calculate all transformations between
two points. Then similarity matrix are computed to measure the possibility that
two transformation are both true. We iteratively update the matching score
matrix by using the similarity matrix. By using matching algorithm on graph, we
obtain the matching result. Experimental results obtained by our approach show
robustness to outlier and jitter.
