Strong embeddings, that is, couplings between a partial sum process of a
sequence of random variables and a Brownian motion, have found numerous
applications in probability and statistics. We extend Chatterjee's novel use of
Stein's method for $\{-1,+1\}$ valued variables to a general class of discrete
distributions, and provide $\log n$ rates for the coupling of partial sums of
independent variables to a Brownian motion, and results for coupling sums of
suitably standardized exchangeable variables to a Brownian bridge
