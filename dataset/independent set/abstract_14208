We present some first steps in the more general setting of the interpretation
of dependent type theory in Ludics. The framework is the following: a
(Martin-Lof) type A is represented by a behaviour (which corresponds to a
formula) in such a way that canonical elements of A are interpreted in a set
that is principal for the behaviour, where principal means in some way a
minimal generator. We introduce some notions on Ludics and the interpretation
of Martin-Lof rules. Then we propose a representation for simple types in
Ludics, i.e., natural numbers, lists, the arrow construction and the usual
constructors.
