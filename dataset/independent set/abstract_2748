We explore the relationship between radio-loud (RL) and radio-quiet (RQ)
quasars using a set of optical/UV/X-ray measures that are quite independent of
radio measures. We find RL sources to show larger average FWHM H-beta, weaker
FeII emission, no soft X-ray excess and no CIV blueshift - all characteristics
manifested by a large fraction of RQ quasars (that we call Population A). We
find that log L (1.4Ghz) = 31.6 [ergs/s/Hz] (or R=70) is the lower limit for RL
quasars showing FRII morphology. We find no evidence for a hidden FRII
population below this level. We conclude that RL sources are a distinct quasar
population that may also include 30-40 percent of RQ sources which apparently
show similar geometry and kinematics (what we call Population B). This RQ
overlap, if not coincidental, may include inactive RL quasars as well as
quasars with geometry/kinematics similar to RL sources but where RL activity is
inhibited in some way (e.g. host morphology, BH spin).
