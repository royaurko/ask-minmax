The paper addresses distributed multi-object tracking over a network of
heterogeneous and geographically dispersed nodes with sensing, communication
and processing capabilities. The main contribution is an information-theoretic
approach to distributed estimation based on labeled Random Finite Sets (RFSs)
and dynamic Bayesian inference, which enables the development of two novel
consensus tracking filters, namely a Consensus Marginalized
$\delta$-Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (CM$\delta$GLMB) and consensus
Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (CLMB) tracking filter. The proposed algorithms provide
fully distributed, scalable and computationally efficient solutions for
multi-object tracking. Simulation experiments via Gaussian mixture
implementations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach on
challenging scenarios.
