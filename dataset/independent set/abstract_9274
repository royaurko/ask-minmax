The present study gives a detailed analysis of the black-body radiation based
on classical random variables. It is shown that the energy of a mode of a
chaotic radiation field (Gauss variable) can be uniquely decomposed into a sum
of a discrete variable (Planck variable having the Planck-Bose distribution)
and a continuous dark variable (with a truncated exponential distribution of
finite support). The Planck variable is decomposed, on one hand, into a sum of
binary variables representing the binary photons of energies 2^s*h*nu with
s=0,1,2,etc. In this way the black-body radiation can be viewed as a mixture of
thermodinamically independent fermion gases. The Planck variable can also be
decomposed into a sum of independent Poisson components representing the
classical photo-molecules of energies m*h*nu with m=1,2,3,etc. These classical
photons have only particle-like fluctuations, on the other hand, the binary
photons have wave-particle fluctuations of fermionic character.
