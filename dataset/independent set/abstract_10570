It is shown that earthquakes do not know how large they will become, at least
from the information collected at seismic catalogs. In other words, the
magnitude is independent on previous magnitudes as well as on the waiting time
between previous earthquakes. In contrast, the time to the next event does
depend on the magnitude. Also it is argued that SOC systems do not necessarily
shown a Poisson-type behavior in time, and SOC does not exclude the possibility
of some degree of prediction.
