Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra with
highest root $\theta$ and let $\mathfrak{g}[t]$ be the corresponding current
algebra. In this paper, we consider $\mathfrak{g}[t]$-stable Demazure modules
of integrable highest weight representations of the affine Lie algebra
$\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. We prove that the fusion product of Demazure modules
of a given level with a single Demazure module of a different level and with
highest weight a multiple of $\theta$ is a generalized Demazure module, and
also give explicit defining relations. This also proves that the fusion product
of such Demazure modules is independent of the parameters. As a consequence, we
obtain the defining relations for a special family of generalized Demazure
modules.
