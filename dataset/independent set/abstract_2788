The Large Area Telescope on board the \textit{Fermi} satellite
(\textit{Fermi}-LAT) detected more than 1.6 million cosmic-ray
electrons/positrons with energies above 60 GeV during its first year of
operation. The arrival directions of these events were searched for
anisotropies of angular scale extending from $\sim$ 10 $^\circ$ up to
90$^\circ$, and of minimum energy extending from 60 GeV up to 480 GeV. Two
independent techniques were used to search for anisotropies, both resulting in
null results. Upper limits on the degree of the anisotropy were set that
depended on the analyzed energy range and on the anisotropy's angular scale.
The upper limits for a dipole anisotropy ranged from $\sim0.5%$ to $\sim10%$.
