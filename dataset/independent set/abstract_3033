The first comprehensive high-resolution photoabsorption spectrum of 14N15N
has been recorded using the Fourier-transform spectrometer attached to the
Desirs beamline at the Soleil synchrotron. Observations are made in the extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) and span 100,000-109,000 cm-1 (100-91.7 nm). The observed
absorption lines have been assigned to 25 bands and reduced to a set of
transition energies, f values, and linewidths. This analysis has verified the
predictions of a theoretical model of N2 that simulates its photoabsorption and
photodissociation cross section by solution of an isotopomer independent
formulation of the coupled-channel Schroedinger equation. The mass dependence
of predissociation linewidths and oscillator strengths is clearly evident and
many local perturbations of transition energies, strengths, and widths within
individual rotational series have been observed.
