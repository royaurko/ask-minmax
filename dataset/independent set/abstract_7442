Given a finite-to-one map acting on a compact metric space, one classically
constructs for each potential in an appropriate Banach space of functionsa
transfer operator acting on functions. Under suitable condition, the
Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius enable to define for each potential an invariant
measure called the Gibbs measure. The set of potential giving birth to the same
Gibbs measure is a linear subspace containing one distinguished potential, said
to be normalized.The goal of the present article is to study the geometry of
the set of normalized potentials, of the normalization map, and of the Gibbs
map sending potentials to Gibbs measures. We give an easy proof of the fact
that the set of normalized potentials is an analytic submanifold and that the
normalization map is analytic; we compute the derivative of the Gibbs map; last
we endow the set of normalized potential with a natural weakRiemannian metric
(derived from the asymptotic variance) with respect to which we compute the
gradient flow induced by the pressure with respect to a given potential, e.g.
the metric entropy functional.We also apply these ideas to recover in a wide
setting existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states, possibly under
constraints.
