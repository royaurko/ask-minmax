We give examples of stochastic processes in the Gelfand Tsetlin cone in which
each component evolves independently apart from a blocking and pushing
interaction. The processes give couplings to certain conditioned Markov
processes, last passage times and asymetric exclusion processes. An example of
a cone valued process whose components cannot escape past a wall at the origin
is also considered.
