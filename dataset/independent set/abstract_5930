We calculate the Casimir interaction between two parallel wires and between a
wire and a metall plate. The dielectric properties of the objects are described
by the plasma, Drude and perfect metal models. We find that at asymptotically
large separation interactions involving plasma wires and/or plates are
independent of the material properties, but depend on the dc conductivity
$\sigma$ for Drude wires. Counterintuitively, at intermediate separations the
interaction involving Drude wires can become independent of $\sigma$. At
smaller separations, we compute the interaction numerically and observe an
approach to the proximity approximation.
