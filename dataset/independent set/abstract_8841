We give some general theorems on free algebras of varieties of Boolean
algebras with operators; a hitherto new result is obtained for Pinter's
substitution algebras. For n\geq 3, and m>1, there is a generating set of the
free algebra freely generated by m elements, which is not a free set of
generators.
