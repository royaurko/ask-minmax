We prove that a transversely holomorphic foliation which is transverse to the
fibers of a fibration, is a Seifert fibration if the set of compact leaves is
not of zero measure. Similarly, we prove that a finitely generated subgroup of
holomorphic diffeomorphisms of a connected complex manifold, is finite provided
that the set of periodic orbits is not of zero measure.
