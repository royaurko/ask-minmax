We study measures on the configuration spaces of two type particles. Gibbs
measures on the such spaces are described. Main properties of corresponding
relative energies densities and correlation functions are considered. In
particular, we show that a support set for the such Gibbs measure is the set of
pairs of non-intersected configurations.
