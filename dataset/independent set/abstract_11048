We investigate the current renormalization prescriptions of quark mixing
matrix and found that there is gauge dependence in the imaginary part of
physical amplitude $W^{+}\to u_i \bar{d}_j$ in two main renormalization
prescriptions. Our conclusion may affect the renormalization of the quark
mixing matrix and indicates that it needs more investigation about the gauge
independence in quark mixing matrix renormalization.
