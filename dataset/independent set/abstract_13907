Time series prediction covers a vast field of every-day statistical
applications in medical, environmental and economic domains. In this paper we
develop nonparametric prediction strategies based on the combination of a set
of 'experts' and show the universal consistency of these strategies under a
minimum of conditions. We perform an in-depth analysis of real-world data sets
and show that these nonparametric strategies are more flexible, faster and
generally outperform ARMA methods in terms of normalized cumulative prediction
error.
