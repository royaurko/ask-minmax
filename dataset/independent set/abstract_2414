We consider the cosmology and hierarchy of scales in models with branes
immersed in a five-dimensional curved spacetime subject to radion
stabilization. The universe naturally find itself in the radiation-dominated
epoch when the inter-brane spacing is static and stable, independent of the
form of the stabilizing potential. We recover the standard Friedmann equations
without assuming a specific form for the bulk energy-momentum tensor. We
address the hierarchy problem in the context of a quartic and exponential
stabilizing potential, and find that in either case the presence of a negative
tension brane is required and that the string scale can be as low as the
electroweak scale. In the situation of self-tuning branes (corresponding to an
exponential potential) where the bulk cosmological constant is set to zero, the
brane tensions have hierarchical values.
