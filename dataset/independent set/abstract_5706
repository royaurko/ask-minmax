The dynamical equivalence between modified and scalar-tensor gravity theories
is revisited and it is concluded that it breaks down in the limit to general
relativity. A gauge-independent analysis of cosmological perturbations in both
classes of theories lends independent support to this conclusion. As a
consequence, the PPN formalism of scalar-tensor gravity and Solar System
experiments do not veto modified gravity, as previously thought.
