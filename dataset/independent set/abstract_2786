This paper is a continuation of [8], in the direction of proving the
conjecture that the spherical transform on a nilpotent Gelfand pair (N,K)
establishes an isomorphism between the space of K-invariant Schwartz functions
on N and the space of Schwartz functions restricted to the Gelfand spectrum
properly embedded in a Euclidean space. We prove a result, of independent
interest for the representation theoretical problems that are involved, which
can be viewed as a generalised Hadamard lemma for K-invariant functions on N.
The context is that of nilpotent Gelfand pairs satisfying Vinberg's condition.
This means that the Lie algebra n of N (which is step 2) decomposes as a direct
sum of [n,n] and a K-invariant irreducible subspace.
