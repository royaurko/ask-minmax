In this paper we introduce complicated oscillating system, namely quotient of
two multiforms based on Riemann-Siegel formula. We prove that there is an
infinite set of metamorphoses of this system (=chrysalis) on critical line
$\sigma=\frac 12$ into a butterfly (=infinite series of M\" obius functions in
the region of absolute convergence $\sigma>1$).
