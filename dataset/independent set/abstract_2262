Direct imaging of exoplanets is limited by bright quasi-static speckles in
the point spread function (PSF) of the central star. This limitation can be
reduced by subtraction of reference PSF images. We have developed an algorithm
to construct an optimized reference PSF image from a set of reference images.
This image is built as a linear combination of the reference images available
and the coefficients of the combination are optimized inside multiple
subsections of the image independently to minimize the residual noise within
each subsection. The algorithm developed can be used with many high-contrast
imaging observing strategies relying on PSF subtraction, such as angular
differential imaging (ADI), roll subtraction, spectral differential imaging,
reference star observations, etc. The performance of the algorithm is
demonstrated for ADI data. It is shown that for this type of data the new
algorithm provides a gain in sensitivity by up to a factor 3 at small
separation over the algorithm used in Marois et al. (2006).
