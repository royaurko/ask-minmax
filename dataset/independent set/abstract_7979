We present valence electron Compton profiles calculated within the
density-functional theory using the all-electron full-potential projector
augmented-wave method (PAW). Our results for covalent (Si), metallic (Li, Al)
and hydrogen-bonded ((H_2O)_2) systems agree well with experiments and
computational results obtained with other band-structure and basis set schemes.
The PAW basis set describes the high-momentum Fourier components of the valence
wave functions accurately when compared with other basis set schemes and
previous all-electron calculations.
