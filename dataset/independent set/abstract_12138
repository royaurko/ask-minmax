This is the first part in a series in which sofic entropy theory is
generalized to class-bijective extensions of sofic groupoids. Here we define
topological and measure entropy and prove invariance. We also establish the
variational principle, compute the entropy of Bernoulli shift actions and
answer a question of Benjy Weiss pertaining to the isomorphism problem for
non-free Bernoulli shifts. The proofs are independent of previous literature.
