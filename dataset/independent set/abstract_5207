Let $a$, $b$ be two fixed non-zero constants. A measurable set $E\subset
\mathbb{R}$ is called a Weyl-Heisenberg frame set for $(a, b)$ if the function
$g=\chi_{E}$ generates a Weyl-Heisenberg frame for $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ under
modulates by $b$ and translates by $a$, i.e.,
$\{e^{imbt}g(t-na\}_{m,n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ is a frame for $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. It is
an open question on how to characterize all frame sets for a given pair $(a,b)$
in general. In the case that $a=2\pi$ and $b=1$, a result due to Casazza and
Kalton shows that the condition that the set
$F=\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}([0,2\pi)+2n_{j}\pi)$ (where $\{n_{1}<n_{2}<...<n_{k}\}$
are integers) is a Weyl-Heisenberg frame set for $(2\pi,1)$ is equivalent to
the condition that the polynomial $f(z)=\sum_{j=1}^{k}z^{n_{j}}$ does not have
any unit roots in the complex plane. In this paper, we show that this result
can be generalized to a class of more general measurable sets (called basic
support sets) and to set theoretical functions and continuous functions defined
on such sets.
