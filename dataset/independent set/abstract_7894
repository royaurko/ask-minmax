We consider the classical Wright-Fisher model with mutation and selection.
Mutations occur independently in each locus, and selection is performed
according to the sharp peak landscape. In the asymptotic regime studied in [3],
a quasispecies is formed. We find explicitly the distribution of this
quasispecies, which turns out to be the same distribution as for the Moran
model.
