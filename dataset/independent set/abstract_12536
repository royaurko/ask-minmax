Transport currents in solids decay through collisions of quasiparticles with
each other and with defects or boundaries. Since information about collisional
lifetimes is difficult to obtain, most calculations of transport properties
rely on parameters that are not known independently. Here, we use magnon
lifetime data for the two-dimensional antiferromagnet Rb2MnF4 to calculate the
magnon-mediated thermal conductivity without any adjustable parameters, thereby
quantifying the influence of scattering from domain boundaries on transport.
Related strategies have the potential to enhance our understanding of thermal
transport by electronic and phononic quasiparticles greatly.
