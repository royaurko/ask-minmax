The search for patterns or motifs in data represents an area of key interest
to many researchers. In this paper we present the Motif Tracking Algorithm, a
novel immune inspired pattern identification tool that is able to identify
unknown motifs which repeat within time series data. The power of the algorithm
is derived from its use of a small number of parameters with minimal
assumptions. The algorithm searches from a completely neutral perspective that
is independent of the data being analysed, and the underlying motifs. In this
paper the motif tracking algorithm is applied to the search for patterns within
sequences of low level system calls between the Linux kernel and the operating
system's user space. The MTA is able to compress data found in large system
call data sets to a limited number of motifs which summarise that data. The
motifs provide a resource from which a profile of executed processes can be
built. The potential for these profiles and new implications for security
research are highlighted. A higher level call system language for measuring
similarity between patterns of such calls is also suggested.
