We show that in the setting of fair-coin measure on the power set of the
natural numbers, each sufficiently random set has an infinite subset that
computes no random set. That is, there is an almost sure event $\mathcal A$
such that if $X\in\mathcal A$ then $X$ has an infinite subset $Y$ such that no
element of $\mathcal A$ is Turing computable from $Y$.
