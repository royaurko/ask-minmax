We analyze the effects of the background velocity and the initial magnetic
field correlations, and viscosities on the turbulent dynamo and the
\alpha-effect. We calculate the \alpha-coefficients for arbitrary magnetic and
fluid viscosities, background velocity and the initial magnetic field
correlations. We explicitly demonstrate that the general features of the
initial growth and late-time saturation of the magnetic fields due to the
non-linear feedback are qualitatively independent of these correlations. We
also examine the hydrodynamic limit of the magnetic field growth in a
renormalization group framework and discuss the possibilities of suppression of
the dynamo growth below a critical rotation. We demonstrate that for
Kolmogorov- (K41) type of spectra the Ekman number M >1/2 for dynamo growth to
occur.
