This is an informal set of lecture notes on moduli spaces of curves based on
a set of lectures given at the ICTP last summer. It begins at an elementary
level and discusses the genus 1 case in detail. The notes then give an informal
treatement of Teichmuller space and higher genus moduli spaces. The point of
view is generally topological and analytical.
