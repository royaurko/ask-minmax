We report a first search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs)
using the background rejection capabilities of SuperCDMS. An exposure of 577
kg-days was analyzed for WIMPs with mass < 30 GeV/c2, with the signal region
blinded. Eleven events were observed after unblinding. We set an upper limit on
the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section of 1.2e-42 cm2 at 8 GeV/c2.
This result is in tension with WIMP interpretations of recent experiments and
probes new parameter space for WIMP-nucleon scattering for WIMP masses < 6
GeV/c2.
