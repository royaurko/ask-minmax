It is shown that the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund strong law of large numbers holds
for pairwise independent identically distributed random variables. It is proved
that if $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots$ are pairwise independent identically distributed
random variables such that $E|X_{1}|^p < \infty$ for some $1 < p < 2$, then
$(S_{n}-ES_{n})/n^{1/p} \to 0$ a.s. where $S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}$.
