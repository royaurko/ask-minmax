We consider a Hubbard-Anderson model which describes localized orbitals in
five different sites hybridized both among themselves and with a continuum of
extended states. A square planar geometry with an atom at the center is used to
represent TBrPP-Co molecules. When the renormalized effective hopping between
sites is small compared with a Kondo energy scale determined by the
sitecontinuum hybridization, the system can be described as a set of
independent Kondo resonances, rather than molecular states. We study the
crossover between both regimes and analyze the spectral density of conduction
electrons as a function of position. The results are in qualitative agreement
with measurements of the differential conductance in a system with TBrPP-Co
molecules adsorbed on a Cu(111) surface.
