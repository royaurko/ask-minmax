The aim of this paper is to describe algebraic K3 surfaces with an even set
of rational curves or of nodes. Their minimal possible Picard number is nine.
We completely classify these K3 surfaces and after a carefull analysis of the
divisors contained in the Picard lattice we study their projective models,
giving necessary and sufficient conditions to have an even set. Moreover we
investigate their relation with K3 surfaces with a Nikulin involution.
