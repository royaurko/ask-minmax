Let F: P^N_K --> P^N_K be a morphism of degree d > 1 defined over a field K
that is algebraically closed and complete with respect to a nonarchimedean
absolute value. We prove that a modified Green function G_F associated to F is
Holder continuous on P^N(K) and that the Fatou set F is equal to the set of
points at which G_F is locally constant. Further, G_F vanishes precisely on the
set of points P such that F has good reduction at every point in the forward
orbit of P. We also prove that the iterates of F are locally uniformly
Lipschitz on the Fatou set of F.
