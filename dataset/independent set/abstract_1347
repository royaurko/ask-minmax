Following our long-term work on development of model-independent data
analysis methods for reconstructing the one-dimensional velocity distribution
function of halo WIMPs as well as for determining their mass and couplings on
nucleons by using data from direct Dark Matter detection experiments directly,
we combined the simulation programs to a compact system: AMIDAS (A
Model-Independent Data Analysis System). For users' convenience an online
system has also been established at the same time. AMIDAS has the ability to do
full Monte Carlo simulations, faster theoretical estimations, as well as to
analyze (real) data sets recorded in direct detection experiments without
modifying the source code. In this article, I give an overview of functions of
the AMIDAS code based on the use of its website.
