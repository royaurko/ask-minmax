We examine electronic states of antiferromagnetic phase in iron pnictides by
mean-field calculations of the optical conductivity. We find that a five-band
model exhibiting a small magnetic moment, inconsistent with the
first-principles calculations, reproduces well the excitation spectra
characterized by a multi-peak structure emerging below the N\'{e}el temperature
at low energy, together with an almost temperature-independent structure at
high energy. Investigating the interlayer magnetoresistance for this model, we
also predict its characteristic field dependence reflecting the Fermi surface.
