The forward-backward long-range multiplicity correlations in proton-proton
collisions are investigated in the model with two independent sources of
particles: one left- and one right-moving wounded nucleon. A good agreement
with the UA5 collaboration proton-antiproton data at the c.m. energy of 200 GeV
is observed. For comparison the model with only one source of particles is also
discussed.
