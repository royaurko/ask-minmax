We provide elementary and uniform proofs of order independence for various
strategy elimination procedures for finite strategic games, both for dominance
by pure and by mixed strategies. The proofs follow the same pattern and focus
on the structural properties of the dominance relations. They rely on Newman's
Lemma established in 1942 and related results on the abstract reduction
systems.
