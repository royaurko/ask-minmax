We present measurements of the dimensionless spin parameters and inner-disk
inclination of two stellar mass black holes. The spin parameter of SWIFT
J1753.5-0127 and GRO J1655-40 are estimated by modelling the strong reflection
signatures present in their XMM-Newton observations. Using a newly developed,
self-consistent reflection model which includes the blackbody radiation of the
disk as well as the effect of Comptonisation, blurred with a relativistic line
function, we infer the spin parameter of SWIFT J1753.5-0127 to be 0.76
+0.11-0.15. The inclination of this system is estimated at 55+2-7 degrees. For
GRO J1655-40 we find that the disk is significantly misaligned to the orbital
plane, with an innermost inclination of 30+5-10 degrees. Allowing the
inclination to be a free parameter we find a lower limit for the spin of 0.90,
this value increases to that of a maximal rotating black hole when the
inclination is set to that of the orbital plane of J1655-40. Our technique is
independent of the black hole mass and distance, uncertainties in which are
among the main contributors to the spin uncertainty in previous works.
