We consider a notion of "numerosity" for sets of tuples of natural numbers,
that satisfies the five common notions of Euclid's Elements, so it can agree
with cardinality only for finite sets. By suitably axiomatizing such a notion,
we show that, contrasting to cardinal arithmetic, the natural "Cantorian"
definitions of order relation and arithmetical operations provide a very good
algebraic structure. In fact, numerosities can be taken as the non-negative
part of a discretely ordered ring, namely the quotient of a formal power series
ring modulo a suitable ("gauge") ideal. In particular, special numerosities,
called "natural", can be identified with the semiring of hypernatural numbers
of appropriate ultrapowers of N.
