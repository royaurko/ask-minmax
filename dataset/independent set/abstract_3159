The exclusive decay mode B ->K*ll has become one of the key players in the
search for New Physics in flavor. An increasing number of observables are being
studied experimentally, and with increasing precision. Its theoretical
description is well under control, and an interesting set of clean observables
have been identified, reducing further the theoretical uncertainties.
Model-independent analyses show that in the near future this mode will either
reveal NP through a pattern of correlated deviations from the SM, or pose very
stringent constraints on radiative and semileptonic operators.
