The SPTpol camera is a dichroic polarimetric receiver at 90 and 150 GHz.
Deployed in January 2012 on the South Pole Telescope (SPT), SPTpol is looking
for faint polarization signals in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The
camera consists of 180 individual Transition Edge Sensor (TES) polarimeters at
90 GHz and seven 84-polarimeter camera modules (a total of 588 polarimeters) at
150 GHz. We present the design, dark characterization, and in-lab optical
properties of the 150 GHz camera modules. The modules consist of
photolithographed arrays of TES polarimeters coupled to silicon platelet arrays
of corrugated feedhorns, both of which are fabricated at NIST-Boulder. In
addition to mounting hardware and RF shielding, each module also contains a set
of passive readout electronics for digital frequency-domain multiplexing. A
single module, therefore, is fully functional as a miniature focal plane and
can be tested independently. Across the modules tested before deployment, the
detectors average a critical temperature of 478 mK, normal resistance R_N of
1.2 Ohm, unloaded saturation power of 22.5 pW, (detector-only) optical
efficiency of ~ 90%, and have electrothermal time constants < 1 ms in
transition.
