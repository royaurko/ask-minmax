We propose and study algorithms to compute minimal models, stable models and
answer sets of t-CNF theories, and normal and disjunctive t-programs. We are
especially interested in algorithms with non-trivial worst-case performance
bounds. The bulk of the paper is concerned with the classes of 2- and 3-CNF
theories, and normal and disjunctive 2- and 3-programs, for which we obtain
significantly stronger results than those implied by our general
considerations. We show that one can find all minimal models of 2-CNF theories
and all answer sets of disjunctive 2-programs in time O(m 1.4422..^n). Our main
results concern computing stable models of normal 3-programs, minimal models of
3-CNF theories and answer sets of disjunctive 3-programs. We design algorithms
that run in time O(m 1.6701..^n), in the case of the first problem, and in time
O(mn^2 2.2782..^n), in the case of the latter two. All these bounds improve by
exponential factors the best algorithms known previously. We also obtain
closely related upper bounds on the number of minimal models, stable models and
answer sets a t-CNF theory, a normal t-program or a disjunctive t-program may
have.
