Rough sets over generalized transitive relations like proto-transitive ones
had been initiated by the present contributor in the year 2012. Subsequently,
approximation of proto-transitive relations by other relations was investigated
and the relation with rough approximations was developed towards constructing
semantics that can handle fragments of structure. It was also proved that
difference of approximations induced by some approximate relations need not
induce rough structures. In this research we develop different semantics of
proto transitive rough sets (PRAX) after characterizing the structure of rough
objects and also develop a theory of dependence for general rough sets and use
it to internalize the Nelson-algebra based approximate semantics developed
earlier. The theory of rough dependence initiated later by the present contributor
is extended in the process. This monograph is reasonably self-contained and
includes proofs and extensions of representation of objects that were not part
of earlier papers.
