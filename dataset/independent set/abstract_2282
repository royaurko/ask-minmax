The reliability of the mean-field approach to polymer statistical mechanics
is investigated by comparing results from a recently developed lattice
mean-field theory (LMFT) method to statistically exact results from two
independent numerical Monte Carlo simulations for the problems of a polymer
chain moving in a spherical cavity and a polymer chain partitioning between two
confining spheres of different radii. It is shown that in some cases the
agreement between the LMFT and the simulation results is excellent, while in
others, such as the case of strongly fluctuating monomer repulsion fields, the
LMFT results agree with the simulations only qualitatively. Various
approximations of the LMFT method are systematically estimated, and the
quantitative discrepancy between the two sets of results is explained with the
diminished accuracy of the saddle-point approximation, implicit in the
mean-field method, in the case of strongly fluctuating fields.
