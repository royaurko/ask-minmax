A finite semifield is a finite nonassociative ring with identity such that
the set of its nonzero elements is closed under the product. From any finite
semifield a projective plane can be constructed. In this paper we obtain new
semifield planes of orders 81 by means of computational methods. These
computer-assisted results yield to a complete classification (up to isotopy) of
81-element finite semifields.
