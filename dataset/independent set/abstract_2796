We revisit the derivation of hybrid nonlinear integral equations of the XXX
model starting from the linearization of the T-system related to spinon
variables. We obtain two sets of equations, corresponding to two linearly
independent solutions of A_1 TQ-relation. Recalling that the TQ-relations in
the horizontal strips of the su(2|4|2)-hook is of A_1 type, we replace the
corresponding Y-functions by a finite number of auxiliary variables.
