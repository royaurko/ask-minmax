We discuss the longitudinal structure function in nuclear DIS at small $x$.
We work within the framework of universal parton densities obtained in DGLAP
analyses at NLO. We show that the nuclear effects on the longitudinal structure
function closely follow those on the gluon distribution. The error analyses
available from newest sets of nuclear PDFs also allow to propagate the
uncertainties from present data. In this way, we evaluate the minimal
sensitivity required in future experiments for this observable to improve the
knowledge of the nuclear glue. We further discuss the uncertainties on the
extraction of $F_2$ off nuclear targets, introduced by the usual assumption
that the ratio $F_L/F_2$ is independent of the nuclear size. We focus on the
kinematical regions relevant for future lepton-ion colliders.
