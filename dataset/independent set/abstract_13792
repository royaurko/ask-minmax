In this paper, locally Lipschitz functions acting between infinite
dimensional normed spaces are considered. When the range is a dual space and
satisfies the Radon--Nikod\'ym property, Clarke's generalized Jacobian will be
extended to this setting. Characterization and fundamental properties of the
extended generalized Jacobian are established including the nonemptiness, the
$\beta$-compactness, the $\beta$-upper semicontinuity, and a mean-value
theorem. A connection with known notions is provided and chain rules are proved
using key results developed. This included the vectorization and restriction
theorem, and the extension theorem. Therefore, the generalized Jacobian
introduced in this paper is proved to enjoy all the properties required of a
derivative like-set.
