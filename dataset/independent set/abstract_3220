For the integrable system on $e(3,2)$ found by Sokolov and Tsiganov we obtain
explicit equations of some invariant 4-dimensional manifolds on which the
induced systems are almost everywhere Hamiltonian with two degrees of freedom.
These subsystems generalize the famous Appelrot classes of critical motions of
the Kowalevski top. For each subsystem we point out a commutative pair of
independent integrals, describe the sets of degeneration of the induced
symplectic structure. With the help of the obtained invariant relations, for
each subsystem we calculate the outer type of its points considered as critical
points of the initial system with three degrees of freedom.
