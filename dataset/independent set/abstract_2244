We present a list of 130 Galactic Open Clusters, found in the All-Sky
Compiled Catalogue of 2.5 Million Stars (ASCC-2.5). For these clusters we
determined and publish a homogeneous set of astrophysical parameters such as
size, membership, motion, distance and age. In a previous work 520 already
known open clusters out of the sample of 1700 clusters from the literature were
confirmed in the ASCC-2.5 using independent, objective methods. Using these
methods the whole sky was systematically screened for the search of new
clusters. The newly detected clusters show the same distribution over the sky
as the known ones. It is found, that without the {\em a-priori} knowledge about
existing clusters our search lead to clusters which are, {\em on average},
brighter, have more members and cover larger angular radii than the 520
previously known ones.
