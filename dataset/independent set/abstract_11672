We report measurements of the non-equilibrium electron energy distribution in
carbon nanotubes. Using tunneling spectroscopy via a superconducting probe, we
study the shape of the local electron distribution functions, and hence energy
relaxation rates, in nanotubes that have bias voltages applied between their
ends. At low temperatures, electrons interact weakly in nanotubes of a few
microns channel length, independent of end-to-end conductance values.
Surprisingly, the energy relaxation rate can increase substantially when the
temperature is raised to only 1.5 K.
