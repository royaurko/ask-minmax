Artificial spike-based computation, inspired by models of computations in the
central nervous system, may present significant performance advantages over
traditional methods for specific types of large scale problems. In this paper,
we study new models for two common instances of such computation,
winner-take-all and coincidence detection. In both cases, very fast convergence
is achieved independent of initial conditions, and network complexity is linear
in the number of inputs.
