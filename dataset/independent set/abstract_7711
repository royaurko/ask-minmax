A {\it heuristic} approach is proposed to estimate the average speed of
particles during binary encounters by using the macroscopic variables with
their extended gradient-type which are the fundamental independent variables in
{\it extended thermodynamics} theory. We also address the missing contribution
(say, due to creation of new particles : {\it Acoustons}) in conventional
Bremsstrahlung.
