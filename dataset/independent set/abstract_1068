Using condition of relativistic invariance, group theory and Clifford algebra
the component Lorentz invariance generalized Dirac equation for a particle with
arbitrary mass and spin is suggested, where In the case of half-integral spin
particles, this equation is reduced to the sets of two-component independent
matrix equations. It is shown that the relativistic scalar and integral spin
particles are described by component equation.
