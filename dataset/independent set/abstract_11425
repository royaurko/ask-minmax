As it was argued by Anderson [Science 177, 393 (1972)], the "reductionist"
hypothesis does not by any means imply a "constructionist" one. Hence, in
general, the behavior of large and complex aggregates of elementary components
can not be understood nor extrapolated from the properties of a few components.
Following this insight, we have simulated different "aggregates" of logistic
maps according to a particular coupling scheme. All these aggregates show a
similar pattern of dynamical properties, concretely a bistable behavior, that
is also found in a network of many units of the same type, independently of the
number of components and of the interconnection topology. A qualitative
relationship with brain-like systems is suggested.
