Searches for charginos, neutralinos and sleptons at LEP2 centre-of-mass
energies from 130 GeV to 189 GeV have been used to set lower limits on the mass
of the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle and other supersymmetric particles
within the MSSM framework. R-parity conservation has been assumed. The lightest
neutralino was found to be heavier than 32.3 GeV/c^2 independent of the m_0
value. The lightest chargino, the second-to-lightest neutralino, the
next-to-heaviest neutralino, the heaviest neutralino, the sneutrino and the
right-handed selectron were found to be heavier than 62.4 GeV/c^2, 62.4
GeV/c^2, 99.9 GeV/c^2, 116.0 GeV/c^2, 61.0 GeV/c^2, and 87.0 GeV/c^2,
respectively. These limits do not depend on m_0 or M_2 and are valid for 1 \leq
tan(beta) \leq 40, in the mu region where the lightest neutralino is the LSP.
If the sneutrino is heavier than the chargino the lightest neutralino has to be
heavier than 32.4 GeV/c^2. The effects of mixings in the third family of
sfermions on these limits are discussed. The confidence level of all limits
given is 95%.
