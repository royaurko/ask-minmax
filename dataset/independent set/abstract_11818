This paper is divided into two independent parts. The first part presents new
integral and series representations of the Riemaan zeta function. An equivalent
formulation of the Riemann hypothesis is given and few results on this
formulation are briefly outlined. The second part exposes a totally different
approach. Using the new series representation of the zeta function of the first
part, exact information on its zeros is provided.
