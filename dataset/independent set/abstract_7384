When the initial and transition probabilities of a finite Markov chain in
discrete time are not well known, we should perform a sensitivity analysis.
This is done by considering as basic uncertainty models the so-called credal
sets that these probabilities are known or believed to belong to, and by
allowing the probabilities to vary over such sets. This leads to the definition
of an imprecise Markov chain. We show that the time evolution of such a system
can be studied very efficiently using so-called lower and upper expectations.
We also study how the inferred credal set about the state at time n evolves as
n->infinity: under quite unrestrictive conditions, it converges to a uniquely
invariant credal set, regardless of the credal set given for the initial state.
This leads to a non-trivial generalisation of the classical Perron-Frobenius
Theorem to imprecise Markov chains.
