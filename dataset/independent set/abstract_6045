Regularizing volume preserving diffeomorphism (VPD) is equivalent to a long
standing problem, namely regularizing Nambu-Poisson bracket. In this paper, as
a first step to regularizing VPD, we find general complete independent basis of
VPD algebra. Especially, we find complete independent basis that give simple
structure constants, where three area preserving diffeomorphism (APD) algebras
are manifest. This implies that an algebra that regularizes VPD algebra should
include three u(N) Lie algebras.
