We show that coupling together two closed thermodynamic systems that
independently attain equilibrium may give rise to a nonequilibrium stationary
state (NESS) with a persistent, non-vanishing current. We study a simple
example that is exactly soluble, consisting of random walkers with different
biases towards a reflecting boundary, modelling, for example, Brownian
particles with different charge states in an electric field. We obtain exact
analytical expressions for the (generating functions of) concentrations and
currents in the NESS for this model, and exhibit the main features by numerical
simulation.
