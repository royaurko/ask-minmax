Translational invariance requires that physical predictions are independent
of the choice of spatial coordinate system used. The time dilatation effect of
special relativity is shown to manifestly respect this invariance.
Consideration of the space-time Lorentz transformation with arbitrary spatial
coordinates shows that the spurious `length contraction' and `relativity of
simultaneity' effects --the latter violating translational invariance-- result
from the use of a different spatial coordinate system to describe each of two
spatially separated clocks at rest in a common inertial frame
