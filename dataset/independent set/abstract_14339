A recent study reported that there is evidence life may have originated prior
to the formation of the Earth. That conclusion was based on a regression
analysis of a certain data set involving evolution of functional genome size
across major phyla. Here it is shown that if measurement errors and
"confidence" intervals are taken into account, then the regression analysis of
the same data set leads to conclusions that allow for life to have appeared
after the formation of the Earth.
