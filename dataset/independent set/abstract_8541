Tarski gave a general semantics for deductive reasoning: a formula a may be
deduced from a set A of formulas iff a holds in all models in which each of the
elements of A holds. A more liberal semantics has been considered: a formula a
may be deduced from a set A of formulas iff a holds in all of the "preferred"
models in which all the elements of A hold. Shoham proposed that the notion of
"preferred" models be defined by a partial ordering on the models of the
underlying language. A more general semantics is described in this paper, based
on a set of natural properties of choice functions. This semantics is here
shown to be equivalent to a semantics based on comparing the relative
"importance" of sets of models, by what amounts to a qualitative probability
measure. The consequence operations defined by the equivalent semantics are
then characterized by a weakening of Tarski's properties in which the
monotonicity requirement is replaced by three weaker conditions. Classical
propositional connectives are characterized by natural introduction-elimination
rules in a nonmonotonic setting. Even in the nonmonotonic setting, one obtains
classical propositional logic, thus showing that monotonicity is not required
to justify classical propositional connectives.
