Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) light curves have been used to prove the universe is
expanding. As standard candles, SNe Ia appear to indicate the rate of expansion
has increased in the past and is now decreasing. This independent evaluation of
SNe Ia light curves demonstrates a Malmquist Type II bias exists in the body of
supernova data. If this bias is properly addressed, there is very little budget
for time dilation in the light curves of supernova. A non-relativistic distance
modulus is proposed, which is based on the predictable attenuation of light by
an intergalactic CREIL (Coherent Raman Effects on Incoherent Light) radiation
transfer functions.
