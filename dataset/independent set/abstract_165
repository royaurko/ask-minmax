After a brief historical survey, the paper introduces the notion of entropic
model sets (cut and project sets), and, more generally, the notion of
diffractive point sets with entropy. Such sets may be thought of as
generalizations of lattice gases. We show that taking the site occupation of a
model set stochastically results, with probabilistic certainty, in well-defined
diffractive properties augmented by a constant diffuse background. We discuss
both the case of independent, but identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
variables and that of independent, but different (i.e., site dependent) random
variables. Several examples are shown.
