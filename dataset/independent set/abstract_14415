Let $H$ be a group, $m$ be a positive integer, $Ext_m H$ be the set of all
isomorphic in $G$ classes of group monomorphisms $\varphi: H \rightarrow G$
such that index of $\varphi(H)$ in $G$ is $m$. The main goal of this paper is
to describe the elements of $Ext_m H$ in terms of a new concept of hypergroups
over the group. The obtained result is a very broad generalization of the
Schreier theorem (1926). As an application, a series of intermediate
generalizations is obtained; particularly, a description of the set $Ext (H,
Q)$ of isomorphic classes of all extensions of a noncommutative group $H$ by
$Q$.
