We introduce a model for nucleons with correlators that include the
propagation of pseudo Goldstone bosons as well as the standard correlators for
nucleons used in QCD sum rules. From the comparison with experimental nucleon
magnetic dipole moments we estimate the probability of a pion cloud in a
nucleon. The masses obtained from the sum rules are almost independent of the
cloud contributions. We show that the model is consistent with chiral
perturbation theory, and solves a long-standing problem on obtaining the
leading non-analytic correction to the nucleon mass in QCD sum rules.
