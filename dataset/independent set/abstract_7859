The norm of Cartan torsion plays an important role for studying of immersion
theory in Finsler geometry. Indeed, Finsler manifold with unbounded Cartan
torsion can not be isometrically imbedded into any Minkowski space. In this
paper, we find two subclasses of (?, ?)-metrics which have bounded Cartan
torsion. Then, we give two subclasses of (?, ?)-metrics whose bound on the
Cartan torsions are independent of the norm of ?.
