A procedure to obtain the dynamics of $N$ independent qudits ($d$-level
systems) each interacting with its own reservoir, for any arbitrary initial
state, is presented. This is then applied to study the dynamics of the
entanglement of two qubits, initially in an extended Werner-like mixed state
with each of them in a zero temperature non-Markovian environment. The
dependence of the entanglement dynamics on the purity and degree of
entanglement of the initial states and on the amount of non-Markovianity is
also given. This extends the previous work about non-Markovian effects on the
two-qubit entanglement dynamics for initial Bell-like states [B. Bellomo
\textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{99}, 160502 (2007)]. The effect of
temperature on the two-qubit entanglement dynamics in a Markovian environment
is finally obtained.
