We organize the effective (self)interaction terms for complex scalar dark
matter candidates which are either an isosinglet, isodoublet or an isotriplet
with respect to the weak interactions. The classification has been performed
ordering the operators in inverse powers of the dark matter cutoff scale. We
assume Lorentz invariance, color and charge neutrality. We also introduce
potentially interesting dark matter induced flavor-changing operators. Our
general framework allows for model independent investigations of dark matter
properties.
