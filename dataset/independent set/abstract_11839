Topological degrees of continuous mappings between manifolds of even
dimension are studied in terms of index theory of pseudo-differential
operators. The index formalism of non-commutative geometry is used to derive
analytic integral formulas for the index of a 0:th order pseudo-differential
operator twisted by a H\"older continuous vector bundle. The index formula
gives an analytic formula for the degree of a H\"older continuous mapping
between even-dimensional manifolds. The paper is an independent continuation of
the paper "Analytic formulas for topological degree of non-smooth mappings: the
odd-dimensional case".
