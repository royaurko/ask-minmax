Let $G$ be a finite group, let $\pi(G)$ be the set of prime divisors of $|G|$
and let $\Gamma(G)$ be the prime graph of $G$. This graph has vertex set
$\pi(G)$, and two vertices $r$ and $s$ are adjacent if and only if $G$ contains
an element of order $rs$. Many properties of these graphs have been studied in
recent years, with a particular focus on the prime graphs of finite simple
groups. In this note, we determine the pairs $(G,H)$, where $G$ is simple and
$H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$ such that $\Gamma(G) = \Gamma(H)$.
