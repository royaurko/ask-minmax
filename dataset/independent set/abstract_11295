We prove that the logarithmic-Sobolev constant for Zero-Range Processes in a
box of diameter L may depend on L but not on the number of particles. This is a
first, but relevant and quite technical step, in the proof that this
logarithmic-Sobolev constant grows as L^2, that will be presented in a
forthcoming paper.
