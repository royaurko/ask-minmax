Accurate forecasting of risk is the key to successful risk management
techniques. Using the largest stock index futures from twelve European bourses,
this paper presents VaR measures based on their unconditional and conditional
distributions for single and multi-period settings. These measures underpinned
by extreme value theory are statistically robust explicitly allowing for
fat-tailed densities. Conditional tail estimates are obtained by adjusting the
unconditional extreme value procedure with GARCH filtered returns. The
conditional modelling results in iid returns allowing for the use of a simple
and efficient multi-period extreme value scaling law. The paper examines the
properties of these distinct conditional and unconditional trading models. The
paper finds that the biases inherent in unconditional single and multi-period
estimates assuming normality extend to the conditional setting.
