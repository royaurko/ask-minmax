We study $C^1$-interiors of sets of vector fields with various shadowing
properties. For the case of Lipschitz shadowing property the $C^1$-interior
equals the set of structurally stable vector fields. If the dimension of the
manifold does not exceed 3 a similar result holds for the oriented shadowing
property.
