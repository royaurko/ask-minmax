In this note, we point out an error in the proof of Theorem 4.7 of [P. Achar
and A.~Henderson, `Orbit closures in the enhanced nilpotent cone', Adv. Math.
219 (2008), 27-62], a statement about the existence of affine pavings for
fibres of a certain resolution of singularities of an enhanced nilpotent orbit
closure. We also give independent proofs of later results that depend on that
statement, so all other results of that paper remain valid.
