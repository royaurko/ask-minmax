We propose a purely extensional semantics for higher-order logic programming.
In this semantics program predicates denote sets of ordered tuples, and two
predicates are equal iff they are equal as sets. Moreover, every program has a
unique minimum Herbrand model which is the greatest lower bound of all Herbrand
models of the program and the least fixed-point of an immediate consequence
operator. We also propose an SLD-resolution proof procedure which is proven
sound and complete with respect to the minimum model semantics. In other words,
we provide a purely extensional theoretical framework for higher-order logic
programming which generalizes the familiar theory of classical (first-order)
logic programming.
