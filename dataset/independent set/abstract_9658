We determine the non-perturbative gluon condensate of four-dimensional SU(3)
gauge theory in a model independent way. This is achieved by carefully
subtracting high order perturbation theory results from non-perturbative
lattice QCD determinations of the average plaquette. No indications of
dimension two condensates are found. The value of the gluon condensate turns
out to be of a similar size as the intrinsic ambiguity inherent to its
definition.
