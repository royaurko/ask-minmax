For five different Heisenberg spin glass systems, torque experiments were
performed in applied magnetic fields up to $4 T$. The Dzyaloshinski-Moriya
random anisotropy strengths, the in-field torque onset temperatures, and the
torque relaxation were measured. Critical exponents were estimated
independently using a standard protocol. The data are strong evidence for a
true spin glass ordered state which survives under high applied magnetic
fields; they can be interpreted consistently in terms of a chiral ordering
model with replica symmetry breaking as proposed by Kawamura and coworkers.
