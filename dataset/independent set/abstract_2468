The labelling of states of irreducible representations of GL(3) in an O(3)
basis is well known to require the addition of a single O(3)-invariant
operator, to the standard diagonalisable set of Casimir operators in the
subgroup chain GL(3) - O(3) - O(2). Moreover, this `missing label' operator
must be a function of the two independent cubic and quartic invariants which
can be constructed in terms of the angular momentum vector and the quadrupole
tensor. It is pointed out that there is a unique (in a well-defined sense)
combination of these which belongs to the O(3) invariant Bethe subalgebra of
the twisted Yangian Y(GL(3);O(3)) in the enveloping algebra of GL(3).
