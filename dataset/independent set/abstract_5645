Background: The idea that autocatalytic sets played an important role in the
origin of life is not new. However, the likelihood of autocatalytic sets
emerging spontaneously has long been debated. Recently, progress has been made
along two different lines. Experimental results have shown that autocatalytic
sets can indeed emerge in real chemical systems, and theoretical work has shown
that the existence of such self-sustaining sets is highly likely in formal
models of chemical systems. Here, we take a first step towards merging these
two lines of work by constructing and investigating a formal model of a real
chemical system of RNA replicators exhibiting autocatalytic sets.
  Results: We show that the formal model accurately reproduces recent
experimental results on an RNA replicator system, in particular how the system
goes through a sequence of larger and larger autocatalytic sets, and how a
cooperative (autocatalytic) system can outcompete an equivalent selfish system.
Moreover, the model provides additional insights that could not be obtained
from experiments alone, and it suggests several experimentally testable
hypotheses.
  Conclusions: Given these additional insights and predictions, the modeling
framework provides a better and more detailed understanding of the nature of
chemical systems in general and the emergence of autocatalytic sets in
particular. This provides an important first step in combining experimental and
theoretical work on autocatalytic sets in the context of the orgin of life.
