Recent CDF results on inclusive momentum distributions and multiplicities of
particles in restricted cones around jets are compared to predictions using the
Modified Leading Log Approximation. We found that MLLA gives a very reasonable
description of jet fragmentation for a wide range of energies. Model parameters
are extracted separately from the multiplicity and from the shape of the
momentum distributions and are found to agree. The ratio of charged particle
multiplicities in gluon and quark jets measured in the context of MLLA is
compared to the model-independent result and also found to agree.
