The results of the Higgs boson searches performed by the four LEP experiments
at centre-of-mass energies between 189 GeV and 209 GeV corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 2461 pb$^{-1}$ are presented here. Searches have been
performed for Higgs in the Standard Model (SM), in 2 Higgs Doublet Models
(2HDM's), for doubly charged, fermiophobic and invisible Higgs as well as a
decay mode independent search. Most of the results of the four experiments have
been combined by the LEP Higgs working group.
