Before a quantum-mechanical calculation involving electromagnetic
interactions is performed, a choice must be made of the gauge to be used in
expressing the potentials. If the calculation is done exactly, the observable
results it predicts will be independent of the choice of gauge. However, in
most practical calculations approximations are made, which can destroy the
gauge invariance of the predictions. We compare here the results of
coupled-channel time-dependent relativistic Coulomb excitation calculations, as
performed in either Lorentz or Coulomb gauges. We find significant differences
when the bombarding energy per nucleon is $\geq$ 2 GeV, which indicates that
the common practice of relying completely on the Lorentz gauge can be
dangerous.
