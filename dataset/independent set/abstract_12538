With the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we
have detected molecular hydrogen in the atmospheres of three white dwarfs with
effective temperatures below 14,000 K, G29-38, GD 133 and GD 31. This discovery
provides new independent constraints on the stellar temperature and surface
gravity of white dwarfs.
