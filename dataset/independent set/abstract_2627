We study a fairly general class of time-homogeneous stochastic evolutions
driven by noises that are not white in time. As a consequence, the resulting
processes do not have the Markov property. In this setting, we obtain
constructive criteria for the uniqueness of stationary solutions that are very
close in spirit to the existing criteria for Markov processes.
  In the case of discrete time, where the driving noise consists of a
stationary sequence of Gaussian random variables, we give optimal conditions on
the spectral measure for our criteria to be applicable. In particular, we show
that under a certain assumption on the spectral density, our assumptions can be
checked in virtually the same way as one would check that the Markov process
obtained by replacing the driving sequence by a sequence of independent
identically distributed Gaussian random variables is strong Feller and
topologically irreducible. The results of the present article are based on
those obtained previously in the continuous time context of diffusions driven
by fractional Brownian motion.
