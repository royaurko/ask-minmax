Recently Ould Houcine-Tent (see arXiv:1205.0929v2 [math.GR]) proved that the
theory of non abelian free groups is $n$-ample for any $n<\omega$. We give a
sequence of single elements in $F_{\omega}$ witnessing the above mentioned
result. Our proof is not independent from the one given in arXiv:1205.0929v2
[math.GR], as we essentially use some theorems from there. On the other hand
our witnessing sequence is much simpler.
