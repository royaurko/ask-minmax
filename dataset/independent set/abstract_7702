The Faddeev equations for the three-body bound state are solved directly as
thre e-dimensional integral equations without employing partial wave
decomposition. Two-body forces of the Malfliet-Tjon type and simple spin
independent genuine three-body forces are considered for the calculation of the
three-body binding energy.
