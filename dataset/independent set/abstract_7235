An Al-AlO_x-Al single-electron transistor (SET) acting as the gate of a
narrow (~ 100 nm) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET)
can induce a vertically aligned Si SET at the Si/SiO_2 interface near the
MOSFET channel conductance threshold. By using such a vertically coupled Al and
Si SET system, we have detected a single-charge defect which is tunnel-coupled
to the Si SET. By solving a simple electrostatic model, the fractions of each
coupling capacitance associated with the defect are extracted. The results
reveal that the defect is not a large puddle or metal island, but its size is
rather small, corresponding to a sphere with a radius less than 1 nm. The small
size of the defect suggests it is most likely a single-charge trap at the
Si/SiO_2 interface. Based on the ratios of the coupling capacitances, the
interface trap is estimated to be about 20 nm away from the Si SET.
