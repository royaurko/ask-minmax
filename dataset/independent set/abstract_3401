The Morton- or z-curve is one example for a space filling curve: Given a
level of refinement L, it maps the interval [0, 2**dL) one-to-one to a set of
d-dimensional cubes of edge length 2**-L that form a subdivision of the unit
cube. In contrast to the Hilbert curve that is continuous, the Morton curve
produces jumps. We prove that any contiguous subinterval of the curve divides
the unit cube into no more than two face-connected, star-shaped subdomains, for
arbitrary dimensions d > 0. In other words, there can be at most one jump in
the curve that creates a new subdomain. We provide an algorithm for enumerating
how many segments of a given length are continuous and prove a lower bound on
the fraction of segments of a given length that are continuous. This result
should eliminate concerns that the Morton curve may lead to an uncontrolled
fragmentation of the domain.
