We introduce a multipartite extension of an information-theoretic distance
first introduced in [Nature 341, 119 (1989)]. We use this new distance to
derive entropic tests of multipartite nonlocality for three and for an
arbitrary even number of qubits as well as a test of state-independent
contextuality. In addition, we re-derive the tripartite Mermin inequality and a
state-independent non-contextuality inequality by Cabello [Phys. Rev. Lett.
101, 210401 (2008)]. This suggests that the information-theoretic distance
approach to multipartite nonlocality and state-independent contextuality can
provide a more general treatment of nonclassical correlations than the orthodox
approach based on correlation functions.
