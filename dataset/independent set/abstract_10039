Given a linear semi-bounded symmetric operator $S\ge -\omega$, we explicitly
define, and provide their nonlinear resolvents, nonlinear maximal monotone
operators $A_\Theta$ of type $\lambda>\omega$ (i.e. generators of one-parameter
continuous nonlinear semi-groups of contractions of type $\lambda$) which
coincide with the Friedrichs extension of $S$ on a convex set containing
${\mathscr D}(S)$. The extension parameter $\Theta\subset{\mathfrak
h}\times{\mathfrak h}$ ranges over the set of nonlinear maximal monotone
relations on an auxiliary Hilbert space $\mathfrak h$ isomorphic to the
deficiency subspace of $S$. Moreover $A_\Theta+\lambda$ is a sub-potential
operator (i.e. is the sub-differential of a lower semicontinuos convex
function) whenever $\Theta$ is sub-potential. Examples describing Laplacians
with nonlinear singular perturbations supported on null sets and Laplacians
with nonlinear boundary conditions on a bounded set are given.
