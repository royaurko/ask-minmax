Electronic structure codes usually allow to calculate the work function as a
part of the theoretical description of surfaces and processes such as
adsorption thereon. This requires a proper calculation of the electrostatic
potential in all regions of space, which is apparently straightforward to
achieve with plane wave basis sets, but more difficult with local basis sets.
To overcome this, a relatively simple scheme is proposed to accurately compute
the work function when a local basis set is used, by having some additional
basis functions in the vacuum. Tests on various surfaces demonstrate that a
very good agreement with experimental and other theoretical data can be
achieved.
