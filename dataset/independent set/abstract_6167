We classify affine varieties with an action of a connected, reductive
algebraic group such that the group is isomorphic to an open orbit in the
variety. This is accomplished by associating a set of one-parameter subgroups
of the group to the variety, characterizing such sets, and proving that sets of
this type correspond to affine embeddings of the group. Applications of this
classification to the existence of morphisms are then given.
