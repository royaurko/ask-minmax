The NAIAD experiment (NaI Advanced Detector) for WIMP dark matter searches at
the Boulby Underground Laboratory (North Yorkshire, UK) ran from 2000 until
2003. A total of 44.9 kg x years of data collected with 2 encapsulated and 4
unencapsulated NaI(Tl) crystals with high light yield were included in the
analysis. We present final results of this analysis carried out using pulse
shape discrimination. No signal associated with nuclear recoils from WIMP
interactions was observed in any run with any crystal. This allowed us to set
upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent and WIMP-proton
spin-dependent cross-sections. The NAIAD experiment has so far imposed the most
stringent constraints on the spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross-section.
