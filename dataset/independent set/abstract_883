Ramanujacharyulu's (1964) Power-Weakness Ratio (PWR) measures impact by
recursively multiplying the citation matrix by itself until convergence is
reached in both the cited and citing dimensions; the quotient of these values
is defined as PWR, whereby "cited" is considered as power and "citing" as
weakness. In this study, PWR is explained in relation to other size-independent
recursive metrics such as Pinski & Narin's (1976) influence weights,
Bergstrom's (2007) Eigenfactor, Brin & Page's (2001) PageRank, and Kleinberg's
(1999) Hubs-and-Authorities from the HITS algorithm. A test using the set of 83
journals in "information and library science" (according to the Web-of-Science
categorization) converged, but did not provide interpretable results. Further
decomposition of this set into homogeneous sub-graphs shows that--like most
other journal indicators--PWR can perhaps be used within homogeneous sets, but
not across citation communities.
