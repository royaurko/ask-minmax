For 0 < c < 1/e the Julia set of f(z) = c exp(z) is an uncountable union of
pairwise disjoint simple curves tending to infinity [Devaney and Krych 1984],
the Hausdorff dimension of this set is two [McMullen 1987], but the set of
curves without endpoints has Hausdorff dimension one [Karpinska 1999]. We show
that these results have three-dimensional analogues when the exponential
function is replaced by a quasiregular self-map of three-space introduced by
Zorich.
