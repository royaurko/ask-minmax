Pseudoexponential fields are exponential fields similar to complex
exponentiation satisfying the Schanuel Property, which is the abstract
statement of Schanuel's Conjecture, and an adapted form of existential closure.
  Here we show that if we remove the Schanuel Property and just care about
existential closure, it is possible to create several existentially closed
exponential functions on the algebraic numbers that still have similarities
with complex exponentiation. The main difficulties are related to the
arithmetic of algebraic numbers, and they can be overcome with known results
about specialisations of multiplicatively independent functions on algebraic
varieties.
