Certain (non polymeric) fluids show an anomalously low friction when flowing
against well chosen solid walls. We discuss here one possible explanation,
postulating that a gaseous film of small thickness h is present between fluid
and wall. When h is smaller than the mean free path l of the gas (Knudsen
regime) the Navier length b is expected to be independent of h and very large
(microns).
