Let $\Sigma_{2n}$ be the set of all partitions of the even integers from the
interval $(4,2n], n>2,$ into two odd prime parts. We select a partition from
the set $\Sigma_{2n}$ uniformly at random. Let $2G_n$ be the number partitioned
by this selection. $2G_n$ is sometimes called a Goldbach number. In [6] we
showed that $G_n/n$ converges weakly to the maximum $T$ of two random variables
which are independent copies of a uniformly distributed random variable in the
interval $(0,1)$. In this note we show that the mean and the variance of
$G_n/n$ tend to the mean $\mu_T=2/3$ and variance $\sigma_T^2=1/18$ of $T$,
respectively. Our method of proof is based on generating functions and on a
Tauberian theorem due to Hardy-Littlewood-Karamata.
