A systematic mathematical methodology for derivation of boundary layer
expansions is presented. An explicit calculation of boundary layer sizes is
given and proved to be coordinates system independent. It relies on asymptotic
properties of symbols of operators. Several examples, including the
quasigeostrophic model, are discussed.
