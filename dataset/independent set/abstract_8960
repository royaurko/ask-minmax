In this paper we consider diagonally affine, planar IFS
$\Phi=\left\{S_i(x,y)=(\alpha_ix+t_{i,1},\beta_iy+t_{i,2})\right\}_{i=1}^m$.
Combining the techniques of Hochman and Feng, Hu we compute the Hausdorff
dimension of the self-affine attractor and measures and we give an upper bound
for the dimension of the exceptional set of parameters.
