Since Self-Describing Data Sets (SDDS) were first introduced, the source code
has been ported to many different operating systems and various languages. SDDS
is now available in C, Tcl, Java, Fortran, and Python. All of these versions
are supported on Solaris, Linux, and Windows. The C version of SDDS is also
supported on VxWorks. With the recent addition of the Java port, SDDS can now
be deployed on virtually any operating system. Due to this proliferation, SDDS
files serve to link not only a collection of C programs, but programs and
scripts in many languages on different operating systems. The platform
independent binary feature of SDDS also facilitates portability among operating
systems. This paper presents an overview of various benefits of SDDS platform
interoperability.
