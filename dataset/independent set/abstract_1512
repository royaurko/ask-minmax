One of the best ways of spotting previously undetected systematic errors in
CMB experiments is to compare two independent observations of the same region.
We derive a set of tools for comparing and combining CMB data sets, applicable
also in the common case where the two have different resolution or beam shape
and therefore do not measure the same signal. We present a consistency test
that is better than a chi-squared test at detecting systematic errors. We show
how two maps of different angular resolution can be combined without smoothing
the higher resolution down to the lower one, and generalize this to arbitrary
beam configurations. We also show how lossless foreground removal can be
performed even for foreground models involving scale dependence, latitude
dependence and spectral index variations in combination.
