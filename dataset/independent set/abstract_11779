An analysis of Wolfenstein parametrization for the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix
shows that it has a serious flaw: it depends on {\em three} independent
parameters instead of {\em four} as it should be. Because this approximation is
currently used in phenomenological analyzes from the quark sector, the
reliability of almost all phenomenological results is called in question. Such
an example is the latest PDG fit from \cite{CA}, p. 150. The parametrization
cannot be fixed since even when it is brought to an exact form it has the same
flaw and its use lead to many inconsistencies.
