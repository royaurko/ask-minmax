We present transformations relating the third transcendent of Painlev\'e with
parameter sets located at the corners of the Weyl chamber for the symmetry
group of the system, the affine Weyl group of the root system $ B^{(1)}_2 $, to
those at the origin. This transformation entails a scaling of the independent
variable, and implies additive identities for the canonical Hamiltonians and
product identities for the $\tau$-functions with these parameter sets.
