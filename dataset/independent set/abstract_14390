In a recent paper D. D. Hai showed that the equation $ -\Delta_{p} u =
\lambda f(u) \mbox{in} \Omega$, under Dirichlet boundary condition, where
$\Omega \subset {\bf R^N}$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary
$\partial\Omega$, $\Delta_{p}$ is the p-Laplacian, $f : (0,\infty) \rightarrow
{\bf R} $ is a continuous function which may blow up to $\pm \infty$ at the
origin, admits a solution if $\lambda > \lambda_0$ and has no solution if $0 <
\lambda < \lambda_0$. In this paper we show that the solution set $\mathcal{S}$
of the equation above, which is not empty by Hai's results, actually admits a
continuum of positive solutions.
