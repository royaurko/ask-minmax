Given a group action, known by its infinitesimal generators, we exhibit a
complete set of syzygies on a generating set of differential invariants. For
that we elaborate on the reinterpretation of Cartan's moving frame by Fels and
Olver (1999). This provides constructive tools for exploring algebras of
differential invariants.
