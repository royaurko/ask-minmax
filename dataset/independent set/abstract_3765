We reanalyze B -> D pi and B -> K J/psi data to extract a set of parameters
which give the relevant hadronic matrix elements in terms of factorized
amplitudes. Various sources of theoretical uncertainties are studied, in
particular those depending on the model adopted for the form factors. We find
that the fit to the B -> D pi branching ratios substantially depends on the
model describing the Isgur-Wise function and on the value of its slope. This
dependence can be reduced by substituting the BR(B -> D pi) with suitable
ratios of non-leptonic to differential semileptonic BRs. In this way, we obtain
a model-independent determination of these parameters. Using these results, the
B -> D form factors at q^2=M_pi^2 can be extracted from a fit of the BR(B -> D
pi). The comparison between the form factors obtained in this way and the
corresponding measurements in semileptonic decays can be used as a test of
(generalized) factorization free from the uncertainties due to heavy-heavy form
factor modeling. Finally, we present predictions for yet-unmeasured D pi and D
K branching ratios and extract f_{D_s} and f_{D_s^*} from B -> DD_s decays. We
find f_{D_s} = 270 +- 45 MeV and f_{D_s^*}=260 +- 40 MeV, in good agreement
with recent measurements and lattice calculations.
