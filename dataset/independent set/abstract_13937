In this article, we analyze the propagation of Wigner measures of a family of
solutions to a system of semi-classical pseudodifferential equations presenting
eigenvalues crossings on hypersurfaces. We prove the propagation along
classical trajectories under a geometric condition which is satisfied for
example as soon as the Hamiltonian vector fields are transverse or tangent at
finite order to the crossing set. We derive resolvent estimates for
semi-classical Schr\"odinger operator with matrix-valued potential under a
geometric condition of the same type on the crossing set and we analyze
examples of degenerate situations where one can prove transfers between the
modes.
