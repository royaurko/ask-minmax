We consider statistical attractors of locally typical dynamical systems and
their "e-invisible" subsets: parts of the attractors whose neighborhoods are
visited by orbits with an average frequency of less than e << 1. For
extraordinarily small values of e (say, smaller than 2^(-10^6)), an observer
virtually never sees these parts when following a generic orbit.
  A trivial reason for e-invisibility in a generic dynamical system may be
either a high Lipshitz constant (~1/e) of the mapping (i.e. it badly distorts
the metric) or its proximity (~e) to the structurally unstable dynamical
systems. However Ilyashenko and Negut [IN] provided a locally typical example
of dynamical systems with an e-invisible set and a uniform moderate (<100)
Lipshitz constant independent on e. These dynamical systems from [IN] are also
|log e|^{-1}-distant from structurally unstable dynamical systems (in the class
S of skew products).
  We further develop the example of [IN] to provide a better rate of
invisibility while staying at the same distance away from the structurally
unstable dynamical systems. We give an explicit example of C^1-balls in the
space of "step" skew products over the Bernoulli shift such that for each
dynamical system from this ball a large portion of the statistical attractor is
invisible. Systems that are c/n-distant from structurally unstable ones (in the
class S) have rate of invisibility e = 2^(-n^k) where 3k is the Hausdorff
dimension of the phase space.
