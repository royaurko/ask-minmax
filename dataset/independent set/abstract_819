A unit disk graph is the intersection graph of n congruent disks in the
plane. Dominating sets in unit disk graphs are widely studied due to their
application in wireless ad-hoc networks. Because the minimum dominating set
problem for unit disk graphs is NP-hard, numerous approximation algorithms have
been proposed in the literature, including some PTAS. However, since the
proposal of a linear-time 5-approximation algorithm in 1995, the lack of
efficient algorithms attaining better approximation factors has aroused
attention. We introduce a linear-time O(n+m) approximation algorithm that takes
the usual adjacency representation of the graph as input and outputs a
44/9-approximation. This approximation factor is also attained by a second
algorithm, which takes the geometric representation of the graph as input and
runs in O(n log n) time regardless of the number of edges. Additionally, we
propose a 43/9-approximation which can be obtained in O(n^2 m) time given only
the graph's adjacency representation. It is noteworthy that the dominating sets
obtained by our algorithms are also independent sets.
