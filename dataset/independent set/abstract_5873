We introduce new estimates and tests of independence in copula models with
unknown margins using $\phi$-divergences and the duality technique. The
asymptotic laws of the estimates and the test statistics are established both
when the parameter is an interior or a boundary value of the parameter space.
Simulation results show that the choice of $\chi^2$-divergence has good
properties in terms of efficiency-robustness.
