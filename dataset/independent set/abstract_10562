We give statistical definitions of the length, l, of a loose prime knot tied
into a long, fluctuating ring macromolecule. Monte Carlo results for the
equilibrium, good solvent regime show that < l > ~ N^t, where N is the ring
length and t ~ 0.75 is independent of the knot topology. In the collapsed
regime below the theta temperature, length determinations based on the entropic
competition of different knots within the same ring show delocalization (t~1).
