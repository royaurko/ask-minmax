We present a quantitative analysis of the Boltzmann-Grad (low-density) limit
of a hard sphere system. We introduce and study a set of functions (correlation
errors) measuring the deviations in time from the statistical independence of
particles (propagation of chaos). In the context of the BBGKY hierarchy, a
correlation error of order $k$ measures the event where $k$ tagged particles
are connected by a chain of interactions preventing the factorization. We prove
that, provided $k$ is not too large, such an error flows to zero with the hard
spheres diameter $\varepsilon$, for short times, as $\varepsilon^{\gamma k}$,
for some $\gamma>0$. This requires a new analysis of many-recollision events,
and improves previous estimates of high order correlation functions.
