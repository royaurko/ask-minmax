A super-symmetric coherent state path integral on the Keldysh time contour is
considered for bosonic and fermionic atoms which interact among each other with
a common short-ranged two-body potential. We investigate the symmetries of
Bose-Einstein condensation for the equivalent bosonic and fermionic
constituents and specialize on the examination of super-symmetries for pair
condensate terms. A Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation from 'Nambu'-doubled
super-fields leads to a generating function with super-matrices for the
self-energy whose manifold is given by the ortho-symplectic super-group
Osp(S,S|2L). Effective equations are derived for anomalous terms which are
related to the molecular- and BCS- condensate pairs. A change of integration
measure for the coset decomposition Osp(S,S|2L)/U(L|S)xU(L|S) is performed,
including a separation of density and anomalous parts of the self-energy with a
gradient expansion for the Goldstone modes. The independent anomalous fields in
the actions can be transformed by the inverse square root of the metric tensor
of Osp(S,S|2L)/U(L|S) so that the coset integration measure with the
super-Jacobi-determinant can be removed from the coherent state path integral
and Gaussian-like integrations remain. The variations of the independent coset
fields in the effective actions result in classical field equations for a
nonlinear sigma model with the anomalous terms.
