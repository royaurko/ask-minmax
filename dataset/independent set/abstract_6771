A mode of a probability vector is a local maximum with respect to some
vicinity structure on the set of elementary events. The mode inequalities cut
out a polytope from the simplex of probability vectors. Related to this is the
concept of strong modes. A strong mode of a distribution is an elementary event
that has more probability mass than all its direct neighbors together. The set
of probability distributions with a given set of strong modes is again a
polytope. We study the vertices, the facets, and the volume of such polytopes
depending on the sets of (strong) modes and the vicinity structures.
