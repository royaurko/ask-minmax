In this paper we give a partial shift version of user-irrepressible sequence
sets and conflict-avoiding codes. By means of disjoint difference sets, we
obtain an infinite number of such user-irrepressible sequence sets whose
lengths are shorter than known results in general. Subsequently, the newly
defined partially conflict-avoiding codes are discussed.
