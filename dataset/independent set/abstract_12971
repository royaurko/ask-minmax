Let $\mathbb{A}_n^m$ be an arbitrary $n$-dimensional commutative associative
algebra over the field of complex numbers with $m$ idempotents. Let
$e_1=1,e_2,\ldots,e_k$ with $2\leq k\leq 2n$ be elements of $\mathbb{A}_n^m$
which are linearly independent over the field of real numbers. We consider
monogenic (i.e. continuous and differentiable in the sense of Gateaux)
functions of the variable $\sum_{j=1}^k x_j\,e_j$, where $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k$
are real, and we prove curvilinear analogues of the Cauchy integral theorem,
the Morera theorem and the Cauchy integral formula in $k$-dimensional ($2\leq
k\leq 2n$) real subset of the algebra $\mathbb{A}_n^m$. The present article is
generalized of the contributor's paper [1], where mentioned results are obtained for
$k=3$.
