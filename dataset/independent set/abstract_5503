In this paper, we propose a novel, unified, general approach to investigate
sufficient and necessary conditions under which four types of convex sets,
polyhedra, polyhedral cones, ellipsoids and Lorenz cones, are invariant sets
for a linear continuous or discrete dynamical system. In proving invariance of
ellipsoids and Lorenz cones for discrete systems, instead of the traditional
Lyapunov method, our novel proofs are based on the S-lemma, which enables us to
extend invariance conditions to any set represented by a quadratic inequality.
Such sets include nonconvex and unbounded sets. Finally, according to the
framework of our novel method, sufficient and necessary conditions for
continuous systems are derived from the sufficient and necessary conditions for
the corresponding discrete systems that are obtained by Euler methods.
