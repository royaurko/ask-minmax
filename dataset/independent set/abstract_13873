This is to present work on modifying the Aleph ILP system so that it
evaluates the hypothesised clauses in parallel by distributing the data-set
among the nodes of a parallel or distributed machine. The paper briefly
discusses MPI, the interface used to access message- passing libraries for
parallel computers and clusters. It then proceeds to describe an extension of
YAP Prolog with an MPI interface and an implementation of data-parallel clause
evaluation for Aleph through this interface. The paper concludes by testing the
data-parallel Aleph on artificially constructed data-sets.
