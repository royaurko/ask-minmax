In the present paper we examine gravitational wave asteroseismology relations
for f-modes of rapidly rotating neutron stars. An approach different to the
previous studies is employed - first, the moment of inertia is used instead of
the stellar radius, and second, the normalization of the oscillation
frequencies and damping times is different. It was shown that in the
non-rotating case this can lead to a much stronger equation of state
independence and our goal is to generalize the static relations to the rapidly
rotating case and values of the spherical mode number $l\ge2$. We employ
realistic equations of state that cover a very large range of stiffness in
order to check better the universality of the relations. At the end we explore
the inverse problem, i.e. obtain the neutron star parameters from the observed
gravitational frequencies and damping times. It turns out that with this new
set of relations we can solve the inverse problem with a very good accuracy
using three frequencies that was not possible in the previous studies where one
needs also the damping times. The asteroseismology relations are also
particularly good for the massive rapidly rotating models that are subject to
secular instabilities.
