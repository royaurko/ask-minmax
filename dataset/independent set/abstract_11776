We consider discrete one-dimensional random Schroedinger operators with
decaying matrix-valued, independent potentials. We show that if the l^2-norm of
this potential has finite expectation value with respect to the product measure
then almost surely the Schroedinger operator has an interval of purely
absolutely continuous (ac) spectrum. We apply this result to Schroedinger
operators on a strip. This work provides a new proof and generalizes a result
obtained by Delyon, Simon, and Souillard.
