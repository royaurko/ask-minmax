In this note we prove a large deviation bound on the sum of random variables
with the following dependency structure: there is a dependency graph $G$ with a
bounded chromatic number, in which each vertex represents a random variable.
Variables that are represented by neighboring vertices may be arbitrarily
dependent, but collections of variables that form an independent set in $G$ are
$t$-wise independent.
