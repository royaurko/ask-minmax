We describe the modular operad structure on the moduli spaces of pointed
stable curves equipped with an admissible $G$-cover. To do this we are forced
to introduce the notion of an operad colored not by a set but by the objects of
a category. This construction interpolates in a sense between `framed' and
`colored' versions of operads; we hope that it will be of independent interest.
An algebra over this operad is the same thing as a $G$-equivariant CohFT, as
defined by Jarvis, Kaufmann and Kimura. We prove that the (orbifold)
Gromov--Witten invariants of global quotients $[X/G]$ give examples of
$G$-CohFTs.
