Mark Kac gave one of the first results analyzing random polynomial zeros. He
considered the case of independent standard normal coefficients and was able to
show that the expected number of real zeros for a degree n polynomial is on the
order of (2/pi)log(n), as n goes to infinity. Several years later, Sambandham
considered two cases with some dependence assumed among the coefficients. The
first case looked at coefficients with an exponentially decaying covariance
function, while the second assumed a constant covariance. He showed that the
expectation of the number of real zeros for an exponentially decaying
covariance matches the independent case, while having a constant covariance
reduces the expected number of zeros in half. In this paper we will apply
techniques similar to Sambandham's and extend his results to a wider class of
covariance functions. Under certain restrictions on the spectral density, we
will show that the order of the expected number of real zeros remains the same
as in the independent case.
