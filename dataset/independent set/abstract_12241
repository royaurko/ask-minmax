We study, and illustrate with numerical calculations, transmission
enhancement by subwavelength 2D slits due to the dominant role played by the
excitation of the eigenmodes of plasmonic cylinders when they are placed at the
aperture entrance; and also due to reinforced and highly localized energy in
the slit as a consequence of the formation of a nanojet. We show that,
providing the illumination is chosen such that an aperture transmitting
eigenmode is generated, the phenomenon is independent of whether or not the
slit alone produces extraordinary transmission; although in the former case
this enhancement will add to this slit supertransmission. We address several
particle sizes, and emphasize the universality of this phenomenon with
different materials.
