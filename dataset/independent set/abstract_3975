This paper addresses the isomorphism problem for the universal
(nonself-adjoint) operator algebras generated by a row contraction subject to
homogeneous polynomial relations. We find that two such algebras are
isometrically isomorphic if and only if the defining polynomial relations are
the same up to a unitary change of variables, and that this happens if and only
if the associated subproduct systems are isomorphic. The proof makes use of the
complex analytic structure of the character space, together with some recent
results on subproduct systems. Restricting attention to commutative operator
algebras defined by radical relations yields strong resemblances with classical
algebraic geometry. These commutative operator algebras turn out to be algebras
of analytic functions on algebraic varieties. We prove a projective
Nullstellensatz connecting closed ideals and their zero sets. Under some
technical assumptions, we find that two such algebras are isomorphic as
algebras if and only if they are similar, and we obtain a clear geometrical
picture of when this happens. This result is obtained with tools from algebraic
geometry, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and some new complex-geometric
rigidity results of independent interest. The C*-envelopes of these algebras
are also determined. The Banach-algebraic and the algebraic classification
results are shown to hold for the weak-operator closures of these algebras as
well.
