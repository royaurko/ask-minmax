We prove the following two results.
  Theorem A: Let alpha be a limit ordinal. Suppose that 2^{|alpha|}<aleph_alpha
and 2^{|alpha|^+}<aleph_{|alpha|^+}, whereas
aleph_alpha^{|alpha|}>aleph_{|alpha|^+}. Then for all n< omega and for all
bounded X subset aleph_{|alpha|^+}, M_n^#(X) exists.
  Theorem B: Let kappa be a singular cardinal of uncountable cofinality. If
{alpha<kappa| 2^alpha=alpha^+} is stationary as well as co-stationary then for
all n< omega and for all bounded X subset kappa, M_n^#(X) exists.
  Theorem A answers a question of Gitik and Mitchell, and Theorem B yields a
lower bound for an assertion discussed in Gitik, M., Introduction to Prikry
type forcing notions, in: Handbook of set theory, Foreman, Kanamori, Magidor
(see Problem 4 there). The proofs of these theorems combine pcf theory with
core model theory. Along the way we establish some ZFC results in cardinal
arithmetic, motivated by Silver's theorem and we obtain results of core model
theory, motivated by the task of building a ``stable core model.'' Both sets of
results are of independent interest.
