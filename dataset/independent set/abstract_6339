We use the S-matrix pinch technique to derive to one loop-order gauge
independent $\gamma W^{+} W^{-} $ and Z $W^{+} W^{-}$ vertices in the context
of the Standard Model,with all three incoming momenta off-shell. We show that
the $\gamma W^{+} W^{-}$ vertex so constructed is related to the
gauge-independent W self-energy,derived by Degrassi and Sirlin,by a very simple
QED-like Ward identity.The same results are obtained by the pinch technique
applied directly to the process $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow W^{+}W^{-}$. Explicit
calculations give rise to expressions for the static properties of the
  W gauge bosons like magnetic dipole and electric quadruple moments which
being gauge independent satisfy such crucial properties as infrared finiteness
and perturbative unitarity.
