It is shown in this paper that there is a fine correlation of the fourth
order between the functions $Z^2[\vp_1(t)]$ and $\tilde{Z}^2(t)$, respectively.
This correlation is with respect to two collections of disconnected sets.
Corresponding new asymptotic formulae cannot be obtained within known theories
of Balasubramanian, Heath-Brown and Ivic.
