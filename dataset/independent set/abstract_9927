Link prediction is pervasively employed to uncover the missing links in the
snapshots of real-world networks, which are usually obtained from kinds of
sampling methods. Contrarily, in the previous literature, in order to evaluate
the performance of the prediction, the known edges in the sampled snapshot are
divided into the training set and the probe set randomly, without considering
the diverse sampling approaches beyond. However, different sampling methods
might lead to different missing links, especially for the biased ones. For this
reason, random partition based evaluation of performance is no longer
convincing if we take the sampling method into account. Hence, in this paper,
aim at filling this void, we try to reevaluate the performance of local
information based link predictions through sampling methods governed division
of the training set and the probe set. It is interesting that we find for
different sampling methods, each prediction approach performs unevenly.
Moreover, most of these predictions perform weakly when the sampling method is
biased, which indicates that the performance of these methods is overestimated
in the prior works.
