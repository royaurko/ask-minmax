Marginal log-linear (MLL) models provide a flexible approach to multivariate
discrete data. MLL parametrizations under linear constraints induce a wide
variety of models, including models defined by conditional independences. We
introduce a sub-class of MLL models which correspond to Acyclic Directed Mixed
Graphs (ADMGs) under the usual global Markov property. We characterize for
precisely which graphs the resulting parametrization is variation independent.
The MLL approach provides the first description of ADMG models in terms of a
minimal list of constraints. The parametrization is also easily adapted to
sparse modelling techniques, which we illustrate using several examples of real
data.
