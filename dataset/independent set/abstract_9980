We show that a normalized alignment free similarity measure, called D2z, can
be used to detect potential regulatory relations for gene sets when little is
known about the regulatory elements involved. One scenario where such gene sets
arise is genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this work we consider a
gene set from a GWAS on childhood general cognitive ability. We build a
co-regulation network for the GWAS genes based on the D2z scores, which shows
potential co-regulatory relationships between the genes as well as predict
additional genes that are likely to be part of the network. We found that the
set of the predicted genes is enriched in genes associated with mental
retardation and GO terms such as synapse and neuron development. In particular,
we found strong evidence of regulatory connection between the GWAS genes and
CHL1, a gene known to be involved in mental retardation.
