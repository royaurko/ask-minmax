The broadcast nature of radio propagation makes wireless networks vulnerable
to eavesdropping attacks. To enhance authentication strength in wireless
networks, various physical layer authentication schemes were proposed by
exploiting physical layer characteristics. Recently, we proposed a novel
PHYsical layer Phase Challenge-Response Authentication Scheme (PHY PCRAS),
which exploits both the reciprocity and randomness of the phase responses over
independent parallel multicarrier channels. In this paper, we first extend it
to more practical Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
transmission. Then, security analysis is provided, and information-theoretic
security is formulated for PHY-PCRAS over both independent and correlated
subchannels. Finally, we propose a practical framework for incorporating the
mechanism of physical layer authentication into the current Third Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol.
Compared to the conventional 3GPP AKA protocol, the PHY-PCRAS assisted
authentication process can ensure some degree of information-theoretic
security. It is also possible to further protect the subsequent classic AKA
process on the air through the physical layer secure information transmission
technique.
