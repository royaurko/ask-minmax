Using the multiple stochastic integrals we prove an existence and uniqueness
result for a linear stochastic equation driven by the fractional Brownian
motion with any Hurst parameter. We study both the one parameter and two
parameter cases. When the drift is zero, we show that in the one-parameter case
the solution in an exponential, thus positive, function while in the
two-parameter settings the solution is negative on a non-negligible set.
