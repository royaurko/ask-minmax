For many large undirected models that arise in real-world applications, exact
maximumlikelihood training is intractable, because it requires computing
marginal distributions of the model. Conditional training is even more
difficult, because the partition function depends not only on the parameters,
but also on the observed input, requiring repeated inference over each training
example. An appealing idea for such models is to independently train a local
undirected classifier over each clique, afterwards combining the learned
weights into a single global model. In this paper, we show that this piecewise
method can be justified as minimizing a new family of upper bounds on the log
partition function. On three natural-language data sets, piecewise training is
more accurate than pseudolikelihood, and often performs comparably to global
training using belief propagation.
