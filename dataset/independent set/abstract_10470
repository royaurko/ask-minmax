The magnetic characteristics for superconducting samples of different
geometries (plates and films of various widths) and orientation with respect to
external field are compared. A similarity is established between the
magnetization curves M(H) and the corresponding susceptibilities. A sign
reversal is predicted for the 3rd harmonic of the ac susceptibillity when the
irreversibility mechanism changes from bulk pinning to edge barrier. A mutual
influence of the edge barrier and bulk pinning on the magnetization curves and
field-dependent ac susceptibility is studied on the basis of an exactly
solvable model (narrow plate in a parallel field and/or narrow film in a
perpendicular magnetic field).
