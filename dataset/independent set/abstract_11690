Interplay between the dependence of symmetry energy on density and the
variation of nucleonic densities across nuclear surface is discussed. That
interplay gives rise to the mass dependence of the symmetry coefficient in an
energy formula. Charge symmetry of the nuclear interactions allows to introduce
isoscalar and isovector densities that are approximately independent of the
magnitude of neutron-proton asymmetry.
