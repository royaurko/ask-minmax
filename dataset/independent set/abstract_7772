We consider one-frequency analytic SL(2,R) cocycles. Our main result
establishes the Almost Reducibility Conjecture in the case of exponentially
Liouville frequencies. Together with our earlier work, this implies that all
cocycles close to constant are almost reducible, independent of the frequency.
In our forthcoming work, we discuss applications to the analysis of the
absolutely continuous spectrum of one-frequency Schrodinger operators.
