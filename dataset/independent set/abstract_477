We study stable like behaviour in first order theories without the
independence property. We introduce generically stable measures, give
characterizatiions, and show their ubiquity. We also introduce generic compact
domination. We also prove the approximate definability of arbitrary Borel
probability measures on definable sets in the real and p-adic fields.
