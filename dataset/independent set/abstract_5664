We measured the current induced loss of vortex correlation in YBCO crystals
using the pseudo DC flux transformer geometry. We find that the current
$I_{cut}$ at which the top and bottom voltage differ is a linear function of
temperature independent of pinning. Although the vortex correlation length at
$I_{cut}$ coincides with the sample thickness, the experimental data show that
$I_{cut}$ is sample thickness independent. The observed behavior with
temperature, magnetic field and thickness is described by a phenomenological
model.
