Contact interactions are the low-energy footprints of New Physics, so
ideally, constraints upon them should be as generic and model independent as
possible. Hadron colliders search for four-quark contact interactions with
incident valence quarks, and the LHC currently sets limits on a flavour sum
(over uu,dd and ud) of selected interactions. We approximately translate these
bounds to a more complete (and larger) set of dimension-six interactions of
specified flavours. These estimates are obtained at the parton level, are
mostly analytic and are less restrictive than the experimental bounds on
flavour-summed interactions. The estimates may scale in a simple way to higher
energy and luminosity.
