Within the NRQCD factorization approach the production of heavy quarkonia can
be calculated in perturbative QCD in terms of a few
production-process-independent NRQCD matrix elements. We test the universality
of these long-distance matrix elements by comparing their values as determined
from charmonium production at p pbar, e p, and e+ e- colliders, and in Z^0,
Upsilon, and B decays.
