This is the third article in a series of four articles dealing with the P vs.
NP question. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that the methods used
in the first two articles of this series are not affected by oracle
relativizations. Furthermore, the solution to the P vs. NP problem is actually
independent of oracle relativizations.
