This note addresses a three-dimensional model for isothermal stress-induced
transformation in shape-memory polycrystalline materials. We treat the problem
within the framework of the energetic formulation of rate-independent processes
and investigate existence and continuous dependence issues at both the
constitutive relation and quasi-static evolution level. Moreover, we focus on
time and space approximation as well as on regularization and parameter
asymptotics.
