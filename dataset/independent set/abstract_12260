We introduced a method to obtain the continuum description of the elastic
properties of mono- layer h-BN through ab initio density functional theory.
This thermodynamically rigorous contin- uum description of the elastic response
is formulated by expanding the elastic strain energy density in a Taylor series
in strain truncated after the fifth-order term. we obtained a total of fourteen
nonzero independent elastic constants for the up to tenth-order tensor. We
predicted the pressure dependent second-order elastic moduli. This continuum
formulation is suitable for incorporation into the finite element method.
