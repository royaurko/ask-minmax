We present nonperturbative, model-independent parametrizations of the
individual QCD form factors relevant to B -> D* l nu and B -> D l nu decays.
These results follow from dispersion relations and analyticity, without
recourse to heavy quark symmetry. To describe a form factor with two percent
accuracy, three parameters are necessary, one of which is its normalization at
zero recoil, F(1). We combine the individual form factors using heavy quark
symmetry to extract values for the product |V_{cb}| F(1) from B -> D* l nu data
with negligible extrapolation uncertainty.
