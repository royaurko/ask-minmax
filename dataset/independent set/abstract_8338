We represent agents as sets of strings. Each string encodes a potential
interaction with another agent or environment. We represent the total set of
dynamics between two agents as the intersection of their respective strings, we
prove complexity properties of player interactions using Algorithmic
Information Theory. We show how the proposed construction is compatible with
Universal Artificial Intelligence, in that the AIXI model can be seen as
universal with respect to interaction.
