We consider flocks of artificial birds and study the emergence of V-like
formations during flight. We introduce a small set of fully distributed
positioning rules to guide the birds' movements and demonstrate, by means of
simulations, that they tend to lead to stabilization into several of the
well-known V-like formations that have been observed in nature. We also provide
quantitative indicators that we believe are closely related to achieving V-like
formations, and study their behavior over a large set of independent
simulations.
