In graphical modelling, a bi-directed graph encodes marginal independences
among random variables that are identified with the vertices of the graph. We
show how to transform a bi-directed graph into a maximal ancestral graph that
(i) represents the same independence structure as the original bi-directed
graph, and (ii) minimizes the number of arrowheads among all ancestral graphs
satisfying (i). Here the number of arrowheads of an ancestral graph is the
number of directed edges plus twice the number of bi-directed edges. In
Gaussian models, this construction can be used for more efficient iterative
maximization of the likelihood function and to determine when maximum
likelihood estimates are equal to empirical counterparts.
