We describe an algorithm for the numerical solution of second order linear
differential equations in the highly-oscillatory regime. It is founded on the
recent observation that the solutions of equations of this type can be
accurately represented using nonoscillatory phase functions. Unlike standard
solvers for ordinary differential equations, the running time of our algorithm
is independent of the frequency of oscillation of the solutions. We illustrate
the performance of the method with several numerical experiments.
