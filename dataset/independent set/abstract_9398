Microstrip ferromagnetic resonance and Brillouin scattering are used to
provide a comparative determination of the magnetic parameters of thin
permalloy layers interfaced with a non-magnetic (Al2O3) or with an
antiferromagnetic oxide (NiO). It is shown that the perpendicular anisotropy is
monitored by an interfacial surface energy term which is practically
independent of the nature of the interface. In the investigated interval of
thicknesses (5-25 nm) the saturation magnetisation does not significantly
differ from the reported one in bulk permalloy. In-plane uniaxial anisotropy
and exchange-bias anisotropy are also derived from this study of the dynamic
magnetic excitations and compared to our independent evaluations using
conventional magnetometry
