We introduce a quantile-adaptive framework for nonlinear variable screening
with high-dimensional heterogeneous data. This framework has two distinctive
features: (1) it allows the set of active variables to vary across quantiles,
thus making it more flexible to accommodate heterogeneity; (2) it is model-free
and avoids the difficult task of specifying the form of a statistical model in
a high dimensional space. Our nonlinear independence screening procedure
employs spline approximations to model the marginal effects at a quantile level
of interest. Under appropriate conditions on the quantile functions without
requiring the existence of any moments, the new procedure is shown to enjoy the
sure screening property in ultra-high dimensions. Furthermore, the
quantile-adaptive framework can naturally handle censored data arising in
survival analysis. We prove that the sure screening property remains valid when
the response variable is subject to random right censoring. Numerical studies
confirm the fine performance of the proposed method for various semiparametric
models and its effectiveness to extract quantile-specific information from
heteroscedastic data.
