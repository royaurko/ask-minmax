Two subanalytic subsets of R^n are called s-equivalent at a common point P if
the Hausdorff distance between their intersections with the sphere centered at
P of radius r vanishes of order greater than s when r tends to 0. In this paper
we prove that every s-equivalence class of a closed semianalytic set contains a
semialgebraic representative of the same dimension. In other words any
semianalytic set can be locally approximated of any order s by means of a
semialgebraic set and hence, by previous results, also by means of an algebraic
one (so long as the semianalytic set has codimension at least 1).
