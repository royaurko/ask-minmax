Given linearly independent holomorphic functions $f_0,...,f_n$ on a planar
domain $\Omega$, let $\mathcal E$ be the set of those points $z\in\Omega$ where
a nontrivial linear combination $\sum_{j=0}^n\lambda_jf_j$ may have a zero of
multiplicity greater than $n$, once the coefficients $\lambda_j=\lambda_j(z)$
are chosen appropriately. An elementary argument involving the Wronskian $W$ of
the $f_j$'s shows that $\mathcal E$ is a discrete subset of $\Omega$ (and is
actually the zero set of $W$); thus "deep" zeros are rare. We elaborate on this
by studying similar phenomena in various function spaces on the unit disk, with
more sophisticated boundary smallness conditions playing the role of deep
zeros.
