Simple minimal but informationally complete positive operator-valued measures
are constructed out of the expectation-value representation for qudits. Upon
suitable modification, the procedure transforms any set of d^2 linearly
independent hermitean operators into such an observable. Minor changes in the
construction lead to closed-form expressions for informationally complete
positive measures in d-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
