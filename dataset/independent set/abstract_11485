We suggest a novel type of photonic structures where the strength of
diffraction can be managed in a very broad frequency range. We introduce
optimized arrays of curved waveguides where light beams experience
wavelength-independent normal, anomalous, or zero diffraction. Our results
suggest novel opportunities for efficient self-collimation, focusing, and
reshaping of beams produced by white-light and super-continuum sources. We also
show how to manipulate light patterns through multicolor Talbot effect, which
is possible neither in free space nor in conventional photonic lattices.
