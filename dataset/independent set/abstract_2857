We establish an exact asymptotic formula for the square variation of certain
partial sum processes. Let $\{X_{i}\}$ be a sequence of independent,
identically distributed mean zero random variables with finite variance
$\sigma$ and satisfying a moment condition $\mathbb{E}[|X_{i}|^{2+\delta} ] <
\infty$ for some $\delta > 0$. If we let $\mathcal{P}_{N}$ denote the set of
all possible partitions of the interval $[N]$ into subintervals, then we have
that $\max_{\pi \in \mathcal{P}_{N}} \sum_{I \in \pi} | \sum_{i\in I} X_{i}|^2
\sim 2 \sigma^2N \ln \ln(N)$ holds almost surely. This can be viewed as a
variational strengthening of the law of the iterated logarithm and refines
results of J. Qian on partial sum and empirical processes. When $\delta = 0$,
we obtain a weaker `in probability' version of the result.
