We report on the optoelectronic properties of thin films of Bi2Se3 grown by
molecular beam epitaxy. The films are patterned into circuits with typical
extensions of tens of microns. In spatially resolved experiments, we observe
submicron photocurrent patterns with positive and negative amplitude. The
patterns are independent of the applied bias voltage, but they depend on the
width of the circuits. We interpret the patterns to originate from a local
photocurrent generation due to potential fluctuations.
