A sharp bound is derived for the nilpotency class of a regular p-group in
terms of its coexponent, and is used to show that the number of groups of order
p^n with a given fixed coexponent, is independent of n, for p and n
sufficiently large. Explicit formulae are calculated in the case of coexponent
3.
