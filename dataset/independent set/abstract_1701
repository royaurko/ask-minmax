Jech proved that every partially ordered set can be embedded into the
cardinals of some model of $ZF$. We extend this result to show that every
partially ordered set can be embedded into the cardinals of some model of
$ZF+DC_{<\kappa}$ for any regular $\kappa$. We use this theorem to show that
for all $\kappa$, the assumption of $DC_\kappa$ does not entail that there are
no decreasing chains of cardinals. We also show how to extend the result to and
embed into the cardinals a proper class which is definable over the ground
model. We use this extension to give a large cardinals-free proof of
independence of the weak choice principle known as $WISC$.
