In 2+1 dimensions, Dirac fermions in reducible, i.e. four-component
representations of the spinor algebra form the basis of many interesting model
field theories and effective descriptions of condensed matter phenomena. This
paper explores lattice formulations which preserve the global U(2N ) symmetry
present in the massless limit, and its breakdown to U(N)xU(N) implemented by
three independent and parity-invariant fermion mass terms. I set out
generalisations of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, leading to a formulation of an
overlap operator, and explore the remnants of the global symmetries which
depart from the continuum form by terms of order of the lattice spacing. I also
define a domain wall formulation in 2+1+1d, and present numerical evidence, in
the form of bilinear condensate and meson correlator calculations in quenched
non-compact QED using reformulations of all three mass terms, to show that
U(2N) symmetry is recovered in the limit that the domain-wall separation tends
to infinity. The possibility that overlap and domain wall formulations of
reducible fermions may coincide only in the continuum limit is discussed.
