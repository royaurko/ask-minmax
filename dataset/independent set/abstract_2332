In the (3+1)D Hamiltonian Regge calculus (one of the coordinates, $ t$, is
continuous) conjugate variables are (defined on triangles of discrete 3D
section $ t=const$) finite connections and antisymmetric area bivectors. The
latter, however, are not independent, since triangles may have common edges.
This circumstance can be taken into account with the help of the set of
kinematical (that is, required to hold by definition of Regge manifold)
bilinear constraints on bivectors. Some of these contain derivatives over $ t$,
and taking them into account with the help of Lagrange multipliers would result
in the new dynamical variables not having analogs in the continuum theory. It
is shown that kinematical constraints with derivatives are consequences of eqs.
of motion for Regge action supplemented with the rest of these constraints
without derivatives and can be omitted; so the new dynamical variables do not
appear.
