We consider nonnegative integer matrices with specified row and column sums
and upper bounds on the entries. We show that the logarithm of the number of
such matrices is approximated by a concave function of the row and column sums.
We give efficiently computable estimators for this function, including one
suggested by a maximum-entropy random model; we show that these estimators are
asymptotically exact as the dimension of the matrices goes to infinity. We
finish by showing that, for kappa >= 2 and for sufficiently small row and
column sums, the number of matrices with these row and column sums and with
entries <= kappa is greater by an exponential factor than predicted by a
heuristic of independence.
