We consider two order relations: that induced by the m-ary reflected Gray
code and a suffix partitioned variation of it. We show that both of them when
applied to some sets of restricted growth sequences still yield Gray codes.
These sets of sequences are: subexcedant or ascent sequences, restricted growth
functions, and staircase words. In each case we give efficient exhaustive
generating algorithms and compare the obtained results.
