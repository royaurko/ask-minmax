Within the asymptotic safety scenario for gravity various conceptual issues
related to the scale dependence of the metric are analyzed. The running
effective field equations implied by the effective average action of Quantum
Einstein Gravity (QEG) and the resulting families of resolution dependent
metrics are discussed. The status of scale dependent vs. scale independent
diffeomorphisms is clarified, and the difference between isometries implemented
by scale dependent and independent Killing vectors is explained. A concept of
scale dependent causality is proposed and illustrated by various simple
examples. The possibility of assigning an "intrinsic length" to objects in a
QEG spacetime is also discussed.
