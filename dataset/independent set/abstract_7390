Among the various critical systems that worth to be formally analyzed, a wide
set consists of controllers for dynamical systems. Those programs typically
execute an infinite loop in which simple com putations update internal states
and produce commands to update the system state. Those systems are yet hardly
analyzable by available static analysis method, since, even if performing
mainly linear computations, the computation of a safe set of reachable states
often requires quadratic invariants. In this paper we consider the general
setting of a piecewise affine program; that is a program performing different
affine updates on the system depending on some conditions. This typically
encompasses linear controllers with saturations or controllers with different
behaviors and performances activated on some safety conditions. Our analysis is
inspired by works performed a decade ago by Johansson et al, and Morari et al,
in the control community. We adapted their method focused on the analysis of
stability in continuous-time or discrete-time settings to fit the static
analysis paradigm and the computation of invariants, that is over-approximation
of reachable sets using piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions.
