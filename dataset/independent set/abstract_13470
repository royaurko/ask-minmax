This paper examines three independent explanatory variables and their
relation with cost overrun in order to decide whether this is different for
Dutch infrastructure projects compared to worldwide findings. The three
independent variables are project type (road, rail, and fixed link projects),
project size (measured in terms of estimated costs) and the length of the
project implementation phase. For Dutch projects, average cost overrun is 10.6%
for rail, 18.6% for roads and 21.7% for fixed links. For project size, small
Dutch projects have the largest average percentage cost overruns but in terms
of total overrun, large projects have a larger share. The length of the
implementation phase and especially the length of the pre-construction phase
are important determinants of cost overruns in the Netherlands. With each
additional year of pre-construction, percentage cost overrun increases by five
percentage points. In contrast, the length of the construction phase has hardly
any influence on cost overruns. This is an important contribution to current
knowledge about cost overruns, because the period in which projects are most
prone to cost overruns is narrowed down considerably, at least in the
Netherlands. This means that period can be focused on to determine the causes
and cures of overruns.
