This paper presents Clustering based on Near Neighbor Influence (CNNI), a new
clustering algorithm which is inspired by the idea of near neighbor and the
superposition principle of influence. In order to clearly describe this
algorithm, it introduces some important concepts, such as near neighbor point
set, near neighbor influence, and similarity measure. By simulated experiments
of some artificial data sets and seven real data sets, we observe that this
algorithm can often get good clustering quality when making proper value of
some parameters. At last, it gives some research expectations to popularize
this algorithm.
