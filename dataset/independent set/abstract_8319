In this paper, we study direct and inverse images for fractional stochastic
tangent sets and we establish the deterministic necessary and sufficient
conditions that guarantee that the solution of a given stochastic differential
equation driven by the fractional Brownian motion evolves in some particular
sets $K$. A comparison theorem is derived.
