The Hamiltonian formulation of the tetrad gravity in any dimension higher
than two, using its first order form when tetrads and spin connections are
treated as independent variables, is discussed and the complete solution of the
three dimensional case is given. For the first time, applying the methods of
constrained dynamics, the Hamiltonian and constraints are explicitly derived
and the algebra of the Poisson brackets among all constraints is calculated.
The algebra of the Poisson brackets among first class secondary constraints
locally coincides with Lie algebra of the ISO(2,1) Poincare group. All the
first class constraints of this formulation, according to the Dirac conjecture
and using the Castellani procedure, allow us to unambiguously derive the
generator of gauge transformations and find the gauge transformations of the
tetrads and spin connections which turn out to be the same found by Witten
without recourse to the Hamiltonian methods [\textit{Nucl. Phys. B 311 (1988)
46}]. The gauge symmetry of the tetrad gravity generated by Lie algebra of
constraints is compared with another invariance, diffeomorphism. Some
conclusions about the Hamiltonian formulation in higher dimensions are briefly
discussed; in particular, that diffeomorphism invariance is \textit{not
derivable} as a \textit{gauge symmetry} from the Hamiltonian formulation of
tetrad gravity in any dimension when tetrads and spin connections are used as
independent variables.
