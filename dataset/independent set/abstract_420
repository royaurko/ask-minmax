We study the time evolution of the amount of entanglement generated by one
dimensional spin-1/2 Ising-type Hamiltonians composed of many-body
interactions. We investigate sets of states randomly selected during the time
evolution generated by several types of time-independent Hamiltonians by
analyzing the distributions of the amount of entanglement of the sets. We
compare such entanglement distributions with that of typical entanglement,
entanglement of a set of states randomly selected from a Hilbert space with
respect to the unitarily invariant measure. We show that the entanglement
distribution obtained by a time-independent Hamiltonian can simulate the
average and standard deviation of the typical entanglement, if the Hamiltonian
contains suitable many-body interactions. We also show that the time required
to achieve such a distribution is polynomial in the system size for certain
types of Hamiltonians.
