The dynamics of the transverse magnetization in the zero-temperature XX chain
is studied with emphasis on fronts emerging from steplike initial magnetization
profiles. The fronts move with fixed velocity and display a staircase like
internal structure whose dynamic scaling is explored both analytically and
numerically. The front region is found to spread with time sub-diffusively with
the height and the width of the staircase steps scaling as t^(-1/3) and t^1/3,
respectively. The areas under the steps are independent of time, thus the
magnetization relaxes in quantized "steps" of spin-flips.
