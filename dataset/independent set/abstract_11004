We perform a careful study on the effect of the Pauli blocking to the light
antiquark structure of the proton sea. We develop the formal expressions for
the antiquark distributions, highlighting the role played by quark statistics
and the vacuum structure. Ratios involving the antiquarks are calculated. In
particular, it is found that $\Delta\bar{d}(x)/\Delta\bar{u}(x)$ should be
negative and x independent.
