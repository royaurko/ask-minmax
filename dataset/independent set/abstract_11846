In a recent paper, Roland Bacher conjectured three identities concerning
Stern's sequence and its twist. In this paper we prove Bacher's conjectures.
Possibly of independent interest, we also give a way to compute the Stern value
(or twisted Stern value) of a number based solely on its binary expansion.
