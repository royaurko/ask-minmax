Anomalous Hall effect arising from non-trivial spin configuration (chirality)
is studied based on the $s$-$d$ model. Considering a weak coupling case, the
interaction is treated perturbatively. Scattering by normal impurities is
included. Chirality is shown to drive locally Hall current and leads to overall
Hall effect if there is a finite uniform chirality. This contribution is
independent of the conventional spin-orbit contribution and shows distinct low
temperature behavior. In mesoscopic spin glasses, chirality-induced anomalous
Hall effect is expected below the spin-glass transition temperature.
Measurement of Hall coefficient would be useful in experimentally confirming
the chirality ordering.
