In this paper, we establish some weighted fractional inequalities for
differentiable mappings whose derivatives in absolute value are convex. These
results are connected with the celebrated Hermite-Hadamard-Fejer type integral
inequality. The results presented here would provide extensions of those given
in earlier works.
