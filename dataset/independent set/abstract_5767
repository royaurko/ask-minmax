We demonstrate the existence of model independent one-to-one correspondence
relations between different lepton flavor violating processes (LFV). Applying
the criterion of naturalness, based on the idea of "custodial symmetry", we
show that all the LFV processes, independently of specific mechanisms behind
them, but with the same external leptons, have a priori comparable amplitudes
modulo their kinematics and involved form factors.
