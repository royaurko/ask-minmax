MACHO-97-BLG-41 is a gravitational microlensing event produced by a lens
composed of multiple masses detected by the first-generation lensing
experiment. For the event, there exist two different interpretations of the
lens from independent analyses based on two different data sets: one
interpreted the event as produced by a circumbinary planetary system while the
other explained the light curve with only a binary system by introducing
orbital motion of the lens. According to the former interpretation, the lens
would be not only the first planet detected via microlensing but also the first
circumbinary planet ever detected. To resolve the issue using state-of-the-art
analysis methods, we reanalyze the event based on the combined data used
separately by the previous analyses. By considering various higher-order
effects, we find that the orbiting binary-lens model provides a better fit than
the circumbinary planet model with \Delta\chi^2 ~166. The result signifies the
importance of even and dense coverage of lensing light curves in the
interpretation of events.
