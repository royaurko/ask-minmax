We re-analyse meson sector data from the CP-PACS collaboration's dynamical
simulations. Our analysis uses several different approaches, and compares the
standard naive linear fit with the Adelaide Anzatz. We find that setting the
scale using the J parameter gives remarkable agreement among data sets. Our
predictions for the rho and phi masses have very small statistical errors, ~ 3
MeV, but the discrepancy between the different fitting approaches is ~ 40 MeV.
