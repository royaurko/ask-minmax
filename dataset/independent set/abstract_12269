We prove part of a higher rank analogue of the Mazur-Gouvea Conjecture. More
precisely, let $\tilde{\bf G}$ be a connected, reductive ${\Bbb Q}$-split group
and let $\Gamma$ be an arithmetic subgroup of $\tilde{\bf G}$. We show that the
dimension of the slope $\alpha$ subspace of the cohomology of $\Gamma$ with
values in an irreducible $\tilde{\bf G}$-module $L$ is bounded independently of
$L$. The proof is elementary making only use of general principles of the
representation theory of algebraic groups; it is based on consideration of
certain truncations of irreducible representations of Chevalley groups.
