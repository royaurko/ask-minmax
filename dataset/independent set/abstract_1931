We develop a dependent Dirichlet process (DDP) model for repeated measures
multiple membership (MM) data. This data structure arises in studies under
which an intervention is delivered to each client through a sequence of
elements which overlap with those of other clients on different occasions. Our
interest concentrates on study designs for which the overlaps of sequences
occur for clients who receive an intervention in a shared or grouped fashion
whose memberships may change over multiple treatment events. Our motivating
application focuses on evaluation of the effectiveness of a group therapy
intervention with treatment delivered through a sequence of cognitive
behavioral therapy session blocks, called modules. An open-enrollment protocol
permits entry of clients at the beginning of any new module in a manner that
may produce unique MM sequences across clients. We begin with a model that
composes an addition of client and multiple membership module random effect
terms, which are assumed independent. Our MM DDP model relaxes the assumption
of conditionally independent client and module random effects by specifying a
collection of random distributions for the client effect parameters that are
indexed by the unique set of module attendances. We demonstrate how this
construction facilitates examining heterogeneity in the relative effectiveness
of group therapy modules over repeated measurement occasions.
