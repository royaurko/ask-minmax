We provide a data set of emission and recombination coefficients of hydrogen
using a kappa-distribution of electron energies rather than the more
traditional Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution. The data are mainly relevant
to thin and relatively cold plasma found in planetary nebulae and H II regions.
The data set extends the previous data sets provided by Storey and Hummer which
were computed using a MB distribution. The data set, which is placed in the
public domain, is structured as a function of electron number density,
temperature and kappa. Interactive fortran 77 and C++ data servers are also
provided as an accessory to probe the data and obtain Lagrange-interpolated
values for any choice of all three variables between the explicitly computed
values.
