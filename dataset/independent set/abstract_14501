We consider the construction of the stochastic moment matrices that appear in
the typical elliptic diffusion problem considered in the setting of stochastic
Galerkin finite element method (sGFEM). Algorithms for the efficient
construction of the stochastic moment matrices are presented for certain
combinations of affine/non-affine diffusion coefficients and multivariate
polynomial spaces. We report the performance of various standard polynomial
spaces for three different non-affine diffusion coefficients in a
one-dimensional spatial setting and compare observed Legendre coefficient
convergence rates to theoretical results.
