I give an interpretation of the fundamental theorem of algebra based on
supersymmetry and the Witten index. The argument gives a physical explanation
of why a real polynomial of degree $n$ need not have $n$ real zeroes, while a
complex polynomial of degree $n$ must have $n$ complex zeroes. This paper also
addresses in a general and model-independent way the statistics of the
perturbative ground states (the states which correspond to classical vacua) in
supersymmetric theories with complex and with real superfields.
