In the framework of extended gravity theories, we discuss the meaning of a
time dependent "cosmological constant" and give a set of conditions to recover
asymptotic de Sitter behaviour for a class of cosmological models independently
of initial data. To this purpose we introduce a time-dependent (effective)
quantity which asymptotically becomes the true cosmological constant. We will
deal with scalar-tensor, fourth and higher than fourth-order theories.
