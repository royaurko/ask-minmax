For mixing~$\mathbb Z^d$-actions generated by commuting automorphisms of a
compact abelian group, we investigate the directional uniformity of the rate of
periodic point distribution and mixing. When each of these automorphisms has
finite entropy, it is shown that directional mixing and directional convergence
of the uniform measure supported on periodic points to Haar measure occurs at a
uniform rate independent of the direction.
