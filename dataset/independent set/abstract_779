Perhaps the best known kernelization result is the kernel of size 335k for
the Planar Dominating Set problem by Alber et al. [JACM 2004], later improved
to 67k by Chen et al. [SICOMP 2007]. This result means roughly, that the
problem of finding the smallest dominating set in a planar graph is easy when
the optimal solution is small. On the other hand, it is known that Planar
Dominating Set parameterized by k'=|V|-k (also known as Planar Nonblocker) has
a kernel of size 2k'. This means that Planar Dominating Set is easy when the
optimal solution is very large. We improve the kernel for Planar Nonblocker to
7/4k'. This also implies that Planar Dominating Set has no kernel of size at
most (7/3-epsilon)k, for any epsilon>0, unless P=NP. This improves the previous
lower bound of (2-epsilon)k of Chen et al. Both of these results immediately
generalize to H-minor free graphs (without changing the constants). In our
proof of the bound on the kernel size we use a variant of the discharging
method (used e.g. in the proof of the four color theorem). We give some
arguments that this method is natural in the context of kernelization and we
hope it will be applied to get improved kernel size bounds for other problems
as well. As a by-product we show a result which might be of independent
interest: every n-vertex graph with no isolated vertices and such that every
pair of degree 1 vertices is at distance at least 5 and every pair of degree 2
vertices is at distance at least 2 has a dominating set of size at most 3/7n.
