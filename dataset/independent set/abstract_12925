In this paper, we consider filtration-consistent nonlinear expectations which
satisfy a general domination condition (dominated by ${\cal{E}}^{\phi}$). We
show that this kind of nonlinear expectations can be represented by
$g$-expectations defined by the solutions of backward stochastic differential
equations, whose generators are independent on $y$ and uniformly continuous in
$z$.
