The notion of limit roots of a Coxeter group W was recently introduced (see
arXiv:1112.5415 and arXiv:1303.6710): they are the accumulation points of
directions of roots of a root system for W. In the case where the root system
lives in a Lorentzian space W admits a faithful representation as a discrete
reflection group of isometries on a hyperbolic space; the accumulation set of
any of its orbits is then classically called the limit set of W. In this
article we show that the limit roots of a Coxeter group W acting on a
Lorentzian space is equal to the limit set of W seen as a discrete reflection
group of hyperbolic isometries. We aim for this article to be as self-contained
as possible in order to be accessible to the community familiar with reflection
groups and root systems and to the community familiar with discrete subgroups
of isometries in hyperbolic geometry.
