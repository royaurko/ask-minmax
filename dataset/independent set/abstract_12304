We consider asymptotically AdS, non-extremal, charged and rotating black
holes with rotation in a single 2-plane and two independent U(1) charge
parameters. Using a common ansatz, solutions are found for 5-dimensional U(1)^3
gauged supergravity, 7-dimensional U(1)^2 gauged supergravity, and
6-dimensional U(1) gauged supergravity coupled to matter. We also find static
AdS black holes with two U(1) charges of a certain theory in arbitrary
dimensions. Some basic properties of the solutions are studied.
