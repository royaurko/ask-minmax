We consider a differential system of neutral type with distributed delay. We
obtain a precise norm estimation of solutions of the system in question on some
nonclosed set. Our result is based on a spectral analysis of the operator and
Riesz basis theory. We also discuss the stability properties of corresponding
solutions.
