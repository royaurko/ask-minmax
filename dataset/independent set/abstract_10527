We report tensile failure experiments on paper sheets. The acoustic emission
energy and the waiting times between acoustic events follow power-law
distributions. This remains true while the strain rate is varied by more than
two orders of magnitude. The energy statistics has the exponent $\beta \sim
1.25 \pm 0.10$ and the waiting times the exponent $\tau \sim 1.0 \pm 0.1$, in
particular for the energy roughly independent of the strain rate. These results
do not compare well with fracture models, for (brittle) disordered media, which
as such exhibit criticality. One reason may be residual stresses, neglected in
most theories.
