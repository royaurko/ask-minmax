In this paper we propose an approach to build a decision support system that
can help emergency planners and responders to detect and manage emergency
situations. The internal mechanism of the system is independent from the
treated application. Therefore, we think the system may be used or adapted
easily to different case studies. We focus here on a first step in the
decision-support process which concerns the modeling of information issued from
the perceived environment and their representation dynamically using a
multiagent system. This modeling was applied on the RoboCupRescue Simulation
System. An implementation and some results are presented here.
