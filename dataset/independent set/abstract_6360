By analogy with an effective model of charged-lepton mass matrix that, with
the inputs of $m^{exp}_e $ and $m^{exp}_\mu$, predicts (in a perturbative zero
order) $m_\tau = 1776.80 $ MeV close to $m^{exp}_\tau =
1777.03^{+0.30}_{-0.26}$ MeV, we construct such a model for quark mass matrices
reproducing consistently the bulk of experimental information on quark masses
and mixings. In particular, the model predicts $|V_{u b}| = 0.00313$, $\gamma =
- \arg V_{u b} = 63.8^\circ$ and $|V_{t d}| = 0.00785$, $\beta = - \arg V_{t d}
= 20.7^\circ$ (i.e., $\sin 2\beta = 0.661$ to be compared with the BaBar value
$\sin 2\beta^{exp} = 0.59 \pm 0.14$), if the figures $|V^{exp}_{u s}| =
0.2196$, $|V^{exp}_{c b}| = 0.0402$ and $m^{exp}_{s} = 123$ MeV, $m^{exp}_{c} =
1.25$ GeV, $m^{exp}_{b} = 4.2$ GeV are used as inputs. Also the rest of CKM
matrix elements is predicted consistently by the experimental data. Here, quark
masses and CKM matrix elements (ten independent quantities) are parametrized by
eight independent model constants, what gives two independent predictions, e.g.
for $|V_{ub}|$ and $\beta$. The considered model deals with the
fundamental-fermion Dirac mass matrices, so that the neutrino Majorana mass
matrix is outside the scheme. Some foundations of the model are collected in
Appendix.
