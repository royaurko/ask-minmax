We calculate thermal production of u, d, s, c and b quarks in
ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The following processes are taken into
account: thermal gluon decay (g to ibar i), gluon fusion (g g to ibar i), and
quark-antiquark annihilation (jbar j to ibar i), where i and j represent quark
species. We use the thermal quark masses, $m_i^2(T)\simeq m_i^2 + (2g^2/9)T^2$,
in all the rates. At small mass ($m_i(T)<2T$), the production is largely
dominated by the thermal gluon decay channel. We obtain numerical and analytic
solutions of one-dimensional hydrodynamic expansion of an initially pure glue
plasma. Our results show that even in a quite optimistic scenario, all quarks
are far from chemical equilibrium throughout the expansion. Thermal production
of light quarks (u, d and s) is nearly independent of species. Heavy quark (c
and b) production is quite independent of the transition temperature and could
serve as a very good probe of the initial temperature. Thermal quark production
measurements could also be used to determine the gluon damping rate, or
equivalently the magnetic mass.
