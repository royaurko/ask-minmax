Let $f$ be a $C^{1+\alpha}$ nonuniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphism. We use a
a nonadditive version of the topological pressure of a class of admissible,
possibly noncontinuous potentials $P^*(\Phi)$ to prove the following
variational equation: $P^*(\Phi) = \sup_{\Omega \in {\mathcal
H}}P^*(f|\Omega,\Phi)$ supremum taken over the set ${\mathcal H}$ of basic
subsets in $M$. As a consequence we find a lower bound for the Cantor dimension
of the stable and unstable Cantor sets of a non trivial conformal nonuniformly
hyperbolic isolated sets.
