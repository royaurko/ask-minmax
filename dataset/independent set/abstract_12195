In this letter, we analytically describe the typical solution time needed by
a backtracking algorithm to solve the vertex-cover problem on
finite-connectivity random graphs. We find two different transitions: The first
one is algorithm-dependent and marks the dynamical transition from linear to
exponential solution times. The second one gives the maximum computational
complexity, and is found exactly at the threshold where the system undergoes an
algorithm-independent phase transition in its solvability. Analytical results
are corroborated by numerical simulations.
