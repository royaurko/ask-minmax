This paper considers the problem of defining distributions over graphical
structures. We propose an extension of the hyper Markov properties of Dawid and
Lauritzen [Ann. Statist. 21 (1993) 1272-1317], which we term structural Markov
properties, for both undirected decomposable and directed acyclic graphs, which
requires that the structure of distinct components of the graph be
conditionally independent given the existence of a separating component. This
allows the analysis and comparison of multiple graphical structures, while
being able to take advantage of the common conditional independence
constraints. Moreover, we show that these properties characterise exponential
families, which form conjugate priors under sampling from compatible Markov
distributions.
