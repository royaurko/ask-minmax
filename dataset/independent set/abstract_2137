We compare the results from several sets of cosmological simulations of
cosmic reionization, produced under Cosmic Reionization On Computers (CROC)
project, with existing observational data on the high-redshift Ly-alpha forest
and the abundance of Ly-alpha emitters. We find good consistency with the
observational measurements and the previous simulation work. By virtue of
having several independent realizations for each set of numerical parameters,
we are able to explore the effect of cosmic variance on observable quantities.
One unexpected conclusion we are forced into is that cosmic variance is
unusually large at z>6, with both our simulations and, most likely,
observational measurements are still not fully converged for even such basic
quantities as the average Gunn-Peterson optical depth or the volume-weighted
neutral fraction. We also find that reionization has little effect on the early
galaxies or on global cosmic star formation history, because galaxies whose gas
content is affected by photoionization contain no molecular (i.e. star-forming)
gas in the first place. In particular, measurements of the faint end of the
galaxy luminosity function by JWST are unlikely to provide a useful constraint
on reionization.
