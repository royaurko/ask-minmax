Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015a) find that the incidence of a set of cancer
types is correlated with the total number of normal stem cell divisions. Here,
we separate the effects of standing stem cell number (i.e., organ or tissue
size) and per stem cell lifetime replication rate. We show that each has a
statistically significant and independent effect on explaining variation in
cancer incidence over the 31 cases considered by Tomasetti and Vogelstein. When
considering the total number of stem cell divisions and when removing cases
associated with disease or carcinogens, we find that cancer incidence attains a
plateau of approximately 0.6% incidence for the cases considered by these
contributors. We further demonstrate that grouping by anatomical site explains most
of the remaining variation in risk between cancer types. This new analysis
suggests that cancer risk depends not only on the number of stem cell divisions
but varies enormously ($\sim$10,000 times) depending on the stem cell's
environment. Future research should investigate how tissue characteristics
(anatomical site, type, size, stem cell divisions) explain cancer incidence
over a wider range of cancers, to what extent different tissues express
specific protective mechanisms, and whether any differential protection can be
attributed to natural selection.
