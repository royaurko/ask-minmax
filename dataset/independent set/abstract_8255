We give a criterion when an expansion of the ordered set of real numbers
defines the image of the expansion of the real field by the set of natural
numbers under a semialgebraic injection. In particular, we show that for a
non-quadratic irrational number a, the expansion of the ordered Q(a)-vector
space of real numbers by the set of natural numbers defines multiplication on
the real numbers.
