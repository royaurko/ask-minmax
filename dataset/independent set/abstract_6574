There is a well-known global equivalence between \Sigma^1_2 sets having the
Universal Baire property, two-step \Sigma^1_3 generic absoluteness, and the
closure of the universe under the sharp operation. In this note, we determine
the exact consistency strength of \Sigma^1_2 sets being (2^{\omega})^{+}-cc
Universally Baire, which is below 0^{#}. In a model obtained, there is a
\Sigma^1_2 set which is weakly \omega_2-Universally Baire but not
\omega_2-Universally Baire.
