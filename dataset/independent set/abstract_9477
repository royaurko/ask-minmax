I use quaternion free probability calculus - an extension of free probability
to non-Hermitian matrices (which is introduced in a succinct but self-contained
way) - to derive in the large-size limit the mean densities of the eigenvalues
and singular values of sums of independent unitary random matrices, weighted by
complex numbers. In the case of CUE summands, I write them in terms of two
"master equations," which I then solve and numerically test in four specific
cases. I conjecture a finite-size extension of these results, exploiting the
complementary error function. I prove a central limit theorem, and its first
sub-leading correction, for independent identically-distributed zero-drift
unitary random matrices.
