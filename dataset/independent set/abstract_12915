We use a stochastic model and direct numerical simulation to study the impact
of turbulence on cloud droplet growth by condensation. We show that the
variance of the droplet size distribution increases in time as $t^{1/2}$, with
growth rate proportional the large-to-small turbulent scale separation and to
the turbulence integral scales but independent of the smallest turbulence
scale. Direct numerical simulations confirm this result and produce
realistically broad droplet size spectra over time intervals of 20 minutes,
comparable with the time of rain formation.
