Determinations of the strong coupling constant alpha_S at centre-of-mass
energies of 192 through 202 GeV at LEP are presented. The energy evolution of
alpha_S is in agreement with the prediction of QCD. The combined investigation
of
 OPAL and JADE data in the energy range of 35 through 189 GeV yields
alpha_S(m_Z)=0.1187^{+0.0034}_{-0.0019}. The strenght of the strong coupling is
flavour independent if quark mass effects are taken into account.
