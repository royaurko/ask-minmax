We summarise a selection of results on the inviscid limit of the stochastic
Burgers equation emphasising geometric properties of the caustic, Maxwell set
and Hamilton-Jacobi level surfaces and relating these results to a discussion
of stochastic turbulence. We show that for small viscosities there exists a
vortex filament structure near to the Maxwell set. We discuss how this
vorticity is directly related to the adhesion model for the evolution of the
early universe and include new explicit formulas for the distribution of mass
within the shock.
