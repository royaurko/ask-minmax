Let $\mathcal{C}=\{C_1,\ldots,C_n\}$ be a set of $n$ pairwise-disjoint convex
sets of constant description complexity, and let $\pi$ be a probability density
function (pdf for short) over the non-negative reals. For each $i$, let $K_i$
be the Minkowski sum of $C_i$ with a disk of radius $r_i$, where each $r_i$ is
a random non-negative number drawn independently from the distribution
determined by $\pi$. We show that the expected complexity of the union of $K_1,
\ldots, K_n$ is $O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$; here the
constant of proportionality depends on $\varepsilon$ and on the description
complexity of the sets in $\mathcal{C}$, but not on $\pi$. If each $C_i$ is a
convex polygon with at most $s$ vertices, then we show that the expected
complexity of the union is $O(s^2n\log n)$.
  Our bounds hold in the stronger model in which we are given an arbitrary
multi-set $R=\{r_1,\ldots,r_n\}$ of expansion radii, each a non-negative real
number. We assign them to the members of $\mathcal{C}$ by a random permutation,
where all permutations are equally likely to be chosen; the expectations are
now with respect to these permutations.
  We also present an application of our results to a problem that arises in
analyzing the vulnerability of a network to a physical attack. %
