Leaky radiation microscopy (LRM) is used to directly image the surface
plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE). When compared with the prism based set-up
commonly used in SPCE research, LRM has the advantages of directly giving out
the emitting angle without scanning and the image of generated surface plasmons
polaritons (SPPs) propagation, which help to understand the optical process of
SPCE. LRM also can give out clearer SPCE image than that by prism-based set-up.
Based on the LRM, we find that the SPCE pattern and propagation of SPPs can be
modified by the shape of samples fabricated on the thin metallic films.
