Given an one-dimensional positive recurrent diffusion governed by the
Stratonovich SDE \[ X_t=x+\int_0^t\sigma(X_s)\strat db(s)+\int_0^t m(X_s) ds,
\] we show that the associated stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms focuses as
fast as $ \mathrm{exp}(-2t\int_{R}\frac{m^2}{\sigma^2} d\Pi)$, where $d\Pi$ is
the finite stationary measure. Moreover, if the drift is reversed and the
diffeomorphism is inverted, then the path function so produced tends,
independently of its starting point, to a single (random) point whose
distribution is $d\Pi$. Applications to stationary solutions of $X_t$,
asymptotic behavior of solutions of SPDEs and random attractors are offered.
