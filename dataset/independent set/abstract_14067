We formulate a resolution of singularities algorithm for analyzing the zero
sets of real-analytic functions in dimensions $\geq 3$. Rather than using the
celebrated result of Hironaka, the algorithm is modeled on a more explicit and
elementary approach used in the contemporary algebraic geometry literature. As
an application, we define a new notion of the height of real-analytic
functions, compute the critical integrability index and obtain the sharp growth
rate of sublevel sets. This also leads to a characterization of the oscillation
index of scalar oscillatory integrals with real-analytic phases in all
dimensions.
