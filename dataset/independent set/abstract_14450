I review recent work in the statistics literature on instrumental variables
methods from an econometrics perspective. I discuss some of the older,
economic, applications including supply and demand models and relate them to
the recent applications in settings of randomized experiments with
noncompliance. I discuss the assumptions underlying instrumental variables
methods and in what settings these may be plausible. By providing context to
the current applications, a better understanding of the applicability of these
methods may arise.
