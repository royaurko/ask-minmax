In this paper, we take an arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) approach to
examine the problem of writing on a dirty paper in the presence of an
adversary. We consider an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with an
additive white Gaussian state, where the state is known non-causally to the
encoder and the adversary, but not the decoder. We determine the randomized
coding capacity of this AVC under the maximal probability of error criterion.
Interestingly, it is shown that the jamming adversary disregards the state
knowledge to choose a white Gaussian channel input which is independent of the
state.
