We show that the magnetic Raman response of a spin-liquid is independent of
the polarizations of the light for triangular symmetries. In contrast, a
ground-state that has a broken symmetry shows characteristic oscillations when
the polarizations are rotated. This would allow to detect weak broken
symmetries and emergent order-parameters. We focus on the Kagome
antiferromagnet where no conventional long-range order has been found so far,
and present the Raman cross-section of a spin-liquid and a valence bond crystal
(VBC) using a random phase approximation.
