A simple extension of the standard model (SM) providing transient magnetic
moments to right-handed neutrinos is presented. In this model, the decay of
next-to-lightest right-handed heavy neutrino to the lightest one and a photon
(N 2 -> N 1 + gamma) can explain the 3.5 keV X-ray line signal observed by
XMM-Newton X-ray observatory. Beside the SM particles and heavy right-handed
Majorana neutrinos, the model contains a singly charged scalar (H) and an extra
Higgs doublet (Sigma). Within this minimal set of extra fields the sub-eV
masses of left-handed neutrinos are also explained. Moreover, we show that the
spin-independent DM-nucleon cross-section is compatible with latest LUX data.
