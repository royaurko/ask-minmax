Using a simple cellular automaton with stochastic rules we show the possible
emergence of thermally activated avalanches (power law distributed) in type-II
superconductors. Scaling relations between the exponents characterizing these
distributions and those obtained from field driven experiments are derived and
proved through simulations. It is also shown that the conditions for the
appearance of these avalanches are independent of the pinning mechanism. The
relevance of our simulations for recently reported experimental results is also
outlined.
