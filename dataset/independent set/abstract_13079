We establish the rate of convergence of distributions of sums of independent
identically distributed random variables to the Gaussian distribution in terms
of truncated pseudomoments by implementing the idea of Yu. Studnyev for getting
estimates of the rate of convergence of the order higher than $n^{-1/2}$.
