We classify minimal complex surfaces of general type with $p_g=q=3$. More
precisely, we show that such a surface is either the symmetric product of a
curve of genus 3 or a free $\Z_2-$quotient of the product of a curve of genus 2
and a curve of genus 3. Our main tools are the generic vanishing theorems of
Green and Lazarsfeld and Fourier--Mukai transforms. The same result has been
obtained independently at the same time by G. Pirola using different methods.
