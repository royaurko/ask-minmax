A $\Sigma$-construction of Solovay is extended to the case of intermediate
sets which are not necessarily subsets of the ground model, with a more
transparent description of the resulting forcing notion than in the classical
paper of Grigorieff. As an application, we prove that, for a given name $t$
(not necessarily a name of a subset of the ground model), the set of all sets
of the form $t[G]$ (the $G$-interpretation of $t$), $G$ being generic over the
ground model, is Borel. This result was first established by Zapletal by a
descriptive set theoretic argument.
