We present here a new parameterization for the bulk motions of galaxies and
clusters (in the linear regime) that can be measured statistically from the
shape and amplitude of the two-dimensional two-point correlation function. We
further propose the one-dimensional velocity dispersion (v_p) of the bulk flow
as a complementary measure of redshift-space distortions, which is
model-independent and not dependent on the normalisation method. As a
demonstration, we have applied our new methodology to the C4 cluster catalogue
constructed from Data Release Three (DR3) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
find v_p=270^{+433}km/s (also consistent with v_p=0) for this cluster sample
(at z=0.1), which is in agreement with that predicted for a WMAP5-normalised
LCDM model (i.e., v_p(LCDM=203km/s). This measurement does not lend support to
recent claims of excessive bulk motions (\simeq1000 km/s) which appear in
conflict with LCDM, although our large statistical error cannot rule them out.
  From the measured coherent evolution of v_p, we develop a technique to
re-construct the perturbed potential, as well as estimating the unbiased matter
density fluctuations and scale--independent bias.
