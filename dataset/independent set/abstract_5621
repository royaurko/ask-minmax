A Kakeya set is a subset of ${\mathbb R}^d$ that contains a unit line segment
in every direction. Let $\mathring S^{d-1}$ denote the unit sphere in ${\mathbb
R}^d$ with antipodal points identified. We encode a Kakeya set in ${\mathbb
R}^d$ as a bounded map $f:\mathring S^{d-1}\to{\mathbb R}^d$, where $f(x)$
gives the centre of the unit line segment orientated in the $x$ direction.
Denoting by $B(\mathring S^{d-1})$ the collection of all such maps equipped
with the supremum norm, we show that (i) for a dense set of $f$ the
corresponding Kakeya set has positive Lebesgue measure and (ii) the set of
those $f$ for which the corresponding Kakeya set has maximal upper box-counting
(Minkowski) dimension $d$ is a residual subset of $B(\mathring S^{d-1})$. We
also give a very simple proof that the lower box-counting dimension of any
Kakeya set is at least $d/2$.
