We report on a search for right-handed $W$ bosons ($W_R$). We used data
collected with the D{\O} detector at the Fermilab Tevatron $p\bar p$ collider
at $\sqrt{s}=$1.8 TeV to search for $W_R$ decays into an electron and a massive
right-handed neutrino $W_R^\pm \to e^\pm N_R$. Using the inclusive electron
data, we set mass limits independent of the $N_R$ decay: $m_{W_R}>650$
GeV/c$^2$ and $m_{W_R}>720$ GeV/c$^2$ at the 95% confidence level, valid for
$m_{N_R}<{1/2}m_{W_R}$ and $m_{N_R} \ll m_{W_R}$ respectively. The latter also
represents a new lower limit on the mass of a heavy left-handed $W$ boson
($W^\prime$) decaying into $e \nu$. In addition, limits on $m_{W_R}$ valid for
larger values of the $N_R$ mass are obtained assuming that $N_R$ decays to an
electron and two jets.
