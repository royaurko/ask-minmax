In this article, we define some types of distances between two intuitionistic
fuzzy soft (IFS) sets and proposed similarity measures of two IFS-sets. We then
construct a decision method which is applied to a medical diagnosis problem
that is based on similarity measures of IFS-sets. Finally we give two simple
example to show the possibility of using this method for diagnosis of diseases
which could be improved by incorporating clinical results and other competing
diagnosis.
