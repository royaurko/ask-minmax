We analyze a connection between neutralino mass sign, parity and structure of
the neutralino-boson interaction. Correct calculation of spin-dependent and
spin-independent contributions to neutralino-nuclear scattering should consider
this connection. A convenient diagonalization procedure, based on the
exponetial parametrization of unitary matrix, is suggested.
