This article is concerned with the fluctuations and the concentration
properties of a general class of discrete generation and mean field particle
interpretations of nonlinear measure valued processes. We combine an original
stochastic perturbation analysis with a concentration analysis for triangular
arrays of conditionally independent random sequences, which may be of
independent interest. Under some additional stability properties of the
limiting measure valued processes, uniform concentration properties, with
respect to the time parameter, are also derived. The concentration inequalities
presented here generalize the classical Hoeffding, Bernstein and Bennett
inequalities for independent random sequences to interacting particle systems,
yielding very new results for this class of models. We illustrate these results
in the context of McKean-Vlasov-type diffusion models, McKean collision-type
models of gases and of a class of Feynman-Kac distribution flows arising in
stochastic engineering sciences and in molecular chemistry.
