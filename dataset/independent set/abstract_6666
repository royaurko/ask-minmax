Based on a refinement of the notion of internal sets in Colombeau's theory,
so-called strongly internal sets, we introduce the space of generalized smooth
functions, a maximal extension of Colombeau generalized functions. Generalized
smooth functions as morphisms between sets of generalized points form a
sub-category of the category of topological spaces. In particular, they can be
composed unrestrictedly.
