We obtain nonasymptotic bounds on the spectral norm of random matrices with
independent entries that improve significantly on earlier results. If $X$ is
the $n\times n$ symmetric matrix with $X_{ij}\sim N(0,b_{ij}^2)$, we show that
$$\mathbf{E}\|X\|\lesssim \max_i\sqrt{\sum_{j}b_{ij}^2}
+\max_{ij}|b_{ij}|\sqrt{\log n}. $$ This bound is optimal in the sense that a
matching lower bound holds under mild assumptions, and the constants are
sufficiently sharp that we can often capture the precise edge of the spectrum.
Analogous results are obtained for rectangular matrices and for more general
subgaussian or heavy-tailed distributions of the entries, and we derive tail
bounds in addition to bounds on the expected norm. The proofs are based on a
combination of the moment method and geometric functional analysis techniques.
As an application, we show that our bounds immediately yield the correct phase
transition behavior of the spectral edge of random band matrices and of sparse
Wigner matrices. We also recover a result of Seginer on the norm of Rademacher
matrices.
