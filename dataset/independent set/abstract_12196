A simple model is outlined to describe the collision of cast
phenol-formaldehyde resin spheres such as the balls used in the parlor game of
pocket billiards, based in part on the famous analysis of elastic collisions
developed by Heinrich Hertz over 100 years ago. The analysis treats the normal
and tangential components of the initial sphere's velocity independently as it
collides with a stationary identical second sphere. The collective effects of
these and other parameters on the trajectory of the second sphere are provided
in the conclusions.
