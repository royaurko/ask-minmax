We prove that for any $K$ and $d$, there exist, for all sufficiently large
admissible $v$, a pairwise balanced design PBD$(v,K)$ of dimension $d$ for
which all $d$-point-generated flats are bounded by a constant independent of
$v$. We also tighten a prior upper bound for $K = \{3,4,5\}$, in which case
there are no divisibility restrictions on the number of points. One consequence
of this latter result is the construction of latin squares `covered' by small
subsquares.
