In the paper the generalisation of classical rate independent plasticity
using fractional calculus is presented. This new formulation is non-local due
to properties of applied fractional differential operator during definition of
kinematics. In the description small fractional strains assumption is hold
together with additive decomposition of total fractional strains into elastic
and plastic parts. Classical local rate independent plasticity is recovered as
a special case.
