We prove analytically that both fermionic and bosonic uniform d-dimensional
lattices can be reduced to a set of independent one-dimensional modes. This
reduction leads to the conclusion that the dynamics in uniform fermionic and
bosonic lattices is always ballistic. By the use of the Jordan-Wigner
transformation we extend our analysis to spin lattices, proving the existence
of both ballistic and non-ballistic subspaces in any dimension and for any
system size. We then relate the nature of transport with the number of
excitations in the spin lattice, indicating that a single excitation propagates
always ballistically and that the non-ballistic behavior of uniform spin
lattices is a consequence of the interaction between different excitations.
