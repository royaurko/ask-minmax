Circular permutation connects the N and C termini of a protein and
concurrently cleaves elsewhere in the chain, providing an important mechanism
for generating novel protein fold and functions. However, their in genomes is
unknown because current detection methods can miss many occurances, mistaking
random repeats as circular permutation. Here we develop a method for detecting
circularly permuted proteins from structural comparison. Sequence order
independent alignment of protein structures can be regarded as a special case
of the maximum-weight independent set problem, which is known to be
computationally hard. We develop an efficient approximation algorithm by
repeatedly solving relaxations of an appropriate intermediate integer
programming formulation, we show that the approximation ratio is much better
then the theoretical worst case ratio of $r = 1/4$. Circularly permuted
proteins reported in literature can be identified rapidly with our method,
while they escape the detection by publicly available servers for structural
alignment.
