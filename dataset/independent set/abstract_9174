We consider one-loop effective action of SU(3) QCD with a most general
constant chromomagnetic (chromoelectric) background which has two independent
Abelian field components. The effective potential with a pure magnetic
background has a local minimum only when two Abelian components H_{\mu\nu}^3
and H_{\mu\nu}^8 of color magnetic field are orthogonal to each other. The
non-trivial structure of the effective action has important implication in
estimating quark-gluon production rate and p_T-distribution in quark-gluon
plasma. In general the production rate depends on three independent Casimir
invariants, in particular, it depends on the relative orientation between
chromoelectric fields.
