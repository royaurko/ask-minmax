This paper gives an overview of the theory of dynamic convex risk measures
for random variables in discrete time setting. We summarize robust
representation results of conditional convex risk measures, and we characterize
various time consistency properties of dynamic risk measures in terms of
acceptance sets, penalty functions, and by supermartingale properties of risk
processes and penalty functions.
