Let T be a compact complex torus, dim T>2. We show that the category of
coherent sheaves on T is independent of the choice of the complex structure, if
this complex structure is generic. The proof is independent of math.AG/0205210,
where the same result was proven for K3 surfaces and even-dimensional tori.
