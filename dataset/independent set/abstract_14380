It has been recently shown that $|| F_n(A) ||\leq 2$, where $A$ is a linear
continuous operator acting in a Hilbert space, and $F_n$ is the Faber
polynomial of degree $n$ corresponding to some convex compact $E\subset \mathbb
C$ containing the numerical range of $A$. Such an inequality is useful in
numerical linear algebra, it allows for instance to derive error bounds for
Krylov subspace methods. In the present paper we extend this result to not
necessary convex sets $E$.
