Let $a_n$ be the random increasing sequence of natural numbers which takes
each value independently with probability $n^{-a}$, $0 < a < 1/2$, and let
$p(n) = n^{1+\epsilon}$, $0 < \epsilon < 1$. We prove that, almost surely, the
modulated, random averages \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n = 1}^N e(p(n))
T^{a_n(\omega)} f \to 0 \] pointwise almost everywhere for $f \in L^1(X)$.
