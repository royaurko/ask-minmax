We introduce the concept of the primitivity of independent set in
vertex-transitive graphs, and investigate the relationship between the
primitivity and the structure of maximum independent sets in direct products of
vertex-transitive graphs. As a consequence of our main results, we positively
solve an open problem related to the structure of independent sets in powers of
vertex-transitive graphs.
