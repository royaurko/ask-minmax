In this paper it is shown that the wave front set of a direct integral of
singular, irreducible representations of a real, reductive algebraic group is
contained in the singular set. Combining this result with the results of the
first paper in this series, the contributor obtains asymptotic results on the
occurrence of tempered representations in induction and restriction problems
for real, reductive algebraic groups.
