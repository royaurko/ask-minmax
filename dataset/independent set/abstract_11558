A theory of vector gravitational waves is presented on the basis of an
additional gravitational field, recovering ideas that go back to H. A. Lorentz,
field that A. Wheeler called ``gravitomagnetism''. The theory is independent of
Einstein's General Relativity Theory, but is consistent with the
Einstein-Lorentz framework of Special Relativity, so that the resulting
equations are considered exact from the start, and not approximations valid for
velocities small compared with the speed of light. A simple model of mass
formation and presence of angular momentum started with a new type of
singularity, ``trio-holes'', is exhibited.
