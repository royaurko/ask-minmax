This is a survey on the ongoing development of a descriptive theory of
represented spaces, which is intended as an extension of both classical and
effective descriptive set theory to deal with both sets and functions between
represented spaces. Most material is from work-in-progress, and thus there may
be a stronger focus on projects involving the contributor than an objective survey
would merit.
