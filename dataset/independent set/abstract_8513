We consider the logic MSO+U, which is monadic second-order logic extended
with the unbounding quantifier. The unbounding quantifier is used to say that a
property of finite sets holds for sets of arbitrarily large size. We prove that
the logic is undecidable on infinite words, i.e. the MSO+U theory of (N,<) is
undecidable. This settles an open problem about the logic, and improves a
previous undecidability result, which used infinite trees and additional axioms
from set theory.
