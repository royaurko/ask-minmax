We prove that a temperature independent mass distribution is identically zero
below a mass threshold (mass gap) value, if the pressure satisfies certain
inequalities. This supports the finding of a minimal mass in quark matter
equation of state by numerical estimates and by substitution of analytic
formulas. We present a few inequalities for the mass distribution based on the
Markov inequality.
