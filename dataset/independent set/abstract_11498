We conjecture an exact formula for the Kontsevich integral of the unknot, and
also conjecture a formula (also conjectured independently by Deligne) for the
relation between the two natural products on the space of Chinese characters.
The two formulas use the related notions of "Wheels" and "Wheeling". We prove
these formulas "on the level of Lie algebras" using standard techniques from
the theory of Vassiliev invariants and the theory of Lie algebras.
