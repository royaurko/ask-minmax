Mahler's conjecture asks whether the cube is a minimizer for the volume
product of a body and its polar in the class of symmetric convex bodies in R^n.
The corresponding inequality to the conjecture is sometimes called the the
reverse Blaschke-Santalo inequality. The conjecture is known in dimension two
and in several special cases. In the class of unconditional convex bodies,
Saint Raymond confirmed the conjecture, and Meyer and Reisner, independently,
characterized the equality case. In this paper we present a stability version
of these results and also show that any symmetric convex body, which is
sufficiently close to an unconditional body, satisfies the the reverse
Blaschke-Santalo inequality.
