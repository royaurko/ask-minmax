We prove the spacetime positive mass theorem in dimensions less than eight.
This theorem states that for any asymptotically flat initial data set
satisfying the dominant energy condition, the inequality $E\ge |P|$ holds,
where $(E,P)$ is the ADM energy-momentum vector of the initial data set.
Previously, this theorem was proven only for spin manifolds by E. Witten. Our
proof is a modification of the minimal hypersurface technique that was used by
the last contributor and S.-T. Yau to establish the time-symmetric case. Instead of
minimal hypersurfaces, we use marginally outer trapped hypersurfaces (MOTS)
whose existence is guaranteed by earlier work of the first contributor. Since MOTS
do not arise from a variational principle, an important part of our proof to
introduce an appropriate substitute for the area functional used in the
time-symmetric case. As part of our proof, we establish a density theorem of
independent interest that allows us to reduce the general case of our theorem
to the case of initial data that has harmonic asymptotics and satisfies the
strict dominant energy condition. A refinement of the density argument allows
us to approximate any given data set by one which is identical with a Kerr
slice outside a compact set preserving the dominant energy condition. This
enables us to give an alternative proof of the main theorem by reducing it to
the positive energy theorem.
