We show how a conditional displacement of the vibrational mode of trapped
ions can be used to simulate nonlinear collective and interacting spin systems
including nonlinear tops and Ising models (a universal two qubit gate),
independent of the vibrational state of the ion. Thus cooling to the
vibrational ground state is unnecessary provided the heating rate is not too
large.
