We discuss the problem of tachyon condensation in the framework of background
independent open string field theory. We show, in particular, that the
computation of the string field theory action simplifies considerably if one
looks at closed string backgrounds with a large B field, and can be carried out
exactly for a generic tachyon profile. We confirm previous results on the form
of the exact tachyon potential, and we find, within this framework, solitonic
solutions which correspond to lower dimensional unstable branes.
