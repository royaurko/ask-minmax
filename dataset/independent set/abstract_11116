We investigate the divergence structure of one-loop corrections to S and T
parameteres in gauge-Higgs unification. We show that these parameters are
finite in five dimensions, but divergent in more than five dimensions.
Remarkably, a particular linear combination of S and T parameters becomes
finite in six dimension case, which is indicated from the operator analysis in
a model independent way.
