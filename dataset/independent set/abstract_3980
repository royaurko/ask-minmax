We study numerically statistical distributions of sums of orbit coordinates,
viewed as independent random variables in the spirit of the Central Limit
Theorem, in weakly chaotic regimes associated with the excitation of the first
($k=1$) and last ($k=N$) linear normal modes of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-$\alpha$
system under fixed boundary conditions. We show that at low energies
($E=0.19$), when the $k=1$ linear mode is excited, chaotic diffusion occurs
characterized by distributions that are well approximated for long times
($t>10^9$) by a $q$-Gaussian Quasi-Stationary State (QSS) with $q\approx1.4$.
On the other hand, when the $k=N$ mode is excited at the same energy, diffusive
phenomena are \textit{absent} and the motion is quasi-periodic. In fact, as the
energy increases to $E=0.3$, the distributions in the former case pass through
\textit{shorter} $q$-Gaussian states and tend rapidly to a Gaussian (i.e.
$q\rightarrow 1$) where equipartition sets in, while in the latter we need to
reach to E=4 to see a \textit{sudden transition} to Gaussian statistics,
without any passage through an intermediate QSS. This may be explained by
different energy localization properties and recurrence phenomena in the two
cases, supporting the view that when the energy is placed in the first mode
weak chaos and "sticky" dynamics lead to a more gradual process of energy
sharing, while strong chaos and equipartition appear abruptly when only the
last mode is initially excited.
