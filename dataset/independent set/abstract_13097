This paper addresses the task of community detection and proposes a local
approach based on a distributed list building, where each vertex broadcasts
basic information that only depends on its degree and that of its neighbours. A
decentralised external process then unveils the community structure. The
relevance of the proposed method is experimentally shown on both artificial and
real data.
