I discuss the structure of current-induced bottom baryon to charm baryon
transitions, and the structure of pion and photon transitions between heavy
charm or bottom baryons in the Heavy Quark Symmetry (HQS) limit as
$m_Q\rightarrow\infty$. By doing a spin-parity analysis I derive a general
formula which allows one to enumerate the independent HQS amplitudes in the
three types of transitions. I go on to show that use of the constituent quark
model for the light-side diquark transitions leads to a considerable reduction
in the number of independent amplitudes derived in the HQS limit. The
discussion includes the ground state $s$-wave as well as the $p$-wave heavy
baryons.
