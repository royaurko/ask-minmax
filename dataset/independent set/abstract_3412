Recent developments in big data and analytics research have produced an
abundance of large data sets that are too big to be analyzed in their entirety,
due to limits on computer memory or storage capacity. To address these issues,
communication-free parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been
developed for Bayesian analysis of big data. These methods partition data into
manageable subsets, perform independent Bayesian MCMC analysis on each subset,
and combine the subset posterior samples to estimate the full data posterior.
Current approaches to combining subset posterior samples include sample
averaging, weighted averaging, and kernel smoothing techniques. Although these
methods work well for Gaussian posteriors, they are not well-suited to
non-Gaussian posterior distributions. Here, we develop a new direct density
product method for combining subset marginal posterior samples to estimate full
data marginal posterior densities. Using a commonly-implemented distance
metric, we show in simulation studies of Bayesian models with non-Gaussian
posteriors that our method outperforms the existing methods in approximating
the full data marginal posteriors. Since our method estimates only marginal
densities, there is no limitation on the number of model parameters analyzed.
Our procedure is suitable for Bayesian models with unknown parameters with
fixed dimension in continuous parameter spaces.
