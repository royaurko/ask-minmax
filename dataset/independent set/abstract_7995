It is known that the volume function for hyperbolic manifolds of dimension
$\geq 3$ is finite-to-one. We show that the number of nonhomeomorphic
hyperbolic 4-manifolds with the same volume can be made arbitrarily large.
This is done by constructing a sequence of finite-sided finite-volume
polyhedra with side-pairings that yield manifolds. In fact, we show that
arbitrarily many nonhomeomorphic hyperbolic 4-manifolds may share a
fundamental polyhedron. As a by-product of our examples, we also show in a
constructive way that the set of volumes of hyperbolic 4-manifolds contains
the set of even integral multiples of $4\pi^2/3$. This is ``half'' the set of
possible values for volumes, which is the integral multiples of $4\pi^2/3$ due
to the Gauss-Bonnet formula.
