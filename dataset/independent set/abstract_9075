Possibilities of a model independent treatment of the data from future
real-time solar neutrino experiments (SNO, Super-Kamiokande and others) are
discussed. It is shown that in the general case of transitions of the initial
solar $\nu_e$'s into $\nu_\mu$ and/or $\nu_\tau$ the total flux of initial
$^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrinos and the $\nu_e$ survival probability can be determined
directly from the experimental data. Relations between observable quantities
are derived, which, if confronted with the experimental data, would allow to
reveal the presence of sterile neutrinos in the solar neutrino flux on the
earth. Neutrino transitions due to spin and resonant spin-flavour precession in
the magnetic field of the sun are shortly discussed.
