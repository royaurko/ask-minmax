An interesting and satisfactory fluid model has been proposed in literature
for the the description of relativistic electron beams. It was obtained with 14
independent variables by imposing the entropy principle and the relativity
principle. Here the case is considered with an arbitrary number of independent
variables, still satisfying the above mentioned two principles; these lead to
conditions whose general solution is here found. We think that the results
satisfy also a certain ordering with respect to a smallness parameter
$\epsilon$ measuring the dispersion of the velocity about the mean; this
ordering generalizes that appearing in literature for the 14 moments case.
