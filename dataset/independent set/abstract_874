In some reinforcement learning problems an agent may be provided with a set
of input policies, perhaps learned from prior experience or provided by
advisors. We present a reinforcement learning with policy advice (RLPA)
algorithm which leverages this input set and learns to use the best policy in
the set for the reinforcement learning task at hand. We prove that RLPA has a
sub-linear regret of \tilde O(\sqrt{T}) relative to the best input policy, and
that both this regret and its computational complexity are independent of the
size of the state and action space. Our empirical simulations support our
theoretical analysis. This suggests RLPA may offer significant advantages in
large domains where some prior good policies are provided.
