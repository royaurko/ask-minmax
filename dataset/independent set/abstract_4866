When investigating the distribution of the Euler totient function, one
encounters sets of primes P where if p is in P then r is in P for all r|(p-1).
While it is easy to construct finite sets of such primes, the only infinite set
known is the set of all primes. We translate this problem into the function
field setting and construct an infinite such set in F_p[x] whenever p is
equivalent to 2 or 5 modulo 9.
