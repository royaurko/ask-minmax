In this paper for a class of symmetric multiparty pure states we consider a
conjecture related to the geometric measure of entanglement: 'for a symmetric
pure state, the closest product state in terms of the fidelity can be chosen as
a symmetric product state'. We show that this conjecture is true for symmetric
pure states whose amplitudes are all non-negative in a computational basis. The
more general conjecture is still open.
