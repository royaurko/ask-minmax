We report the observation of quasi-particles with a charge q=e/5 detected by
shot noise measurements in the 2/5 conducting channel (filling factor 2/5).
This is in agreement with previous measurements that showed that the current in
the lower, 1/3, channel is carried by quasiparticles with a charge q=e/3. These
results demonstrate that the actual fraction of the charge can be different
from the filling factor. Moreover, we show that there is no strong interaction
between the channels, which can be considered as conducting the current
independently.
