We present angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) data from insulating
A_2CuO_2X_2 (A=Sr, Ca; X=Cl, Br), Sr_2Cu_3O_4Cl_2, and Bi_2Sr_2MCu_2O_8 (M=Er,
Dy) single crystals which illustrate that the low energy electronic structure
of the half-filled cuprates are independent of the apical atom. By performing a
photon energy dependent study on Ca_2CuO_2Cl_2 we are able to distinguish
between features which are intrinsic and those which are a result of the
photoemission matrix elements. We find that the dispersion is independent of
photon energy, while an asymmetry in the electron occupation probability across
the antiferromagnetic zone boundary is robust to variations in photon energy.
Finally, we show that the d-wave-like dispersion which exists in the insulator
along the antiferromagnetic zone boundary does not precisely fit the simple
d-wave functional form near the nodal direction.
