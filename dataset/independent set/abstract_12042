We consider the velocity dependence arising from scattering through dark
multipole moments, and its effects on the consistency of the signals observed
by DAMA and CoGeNT with the dark matter hypothesis. We focus on the effects of
the experimental uncertainties on the fits, and show that the two experiments
combined favor dark matter scattering with a velocity-dependent cross-section
over standard velocity and spin-independent scattering. When appropriate
uncertainties are taken into account, we show that agreement of the two signals
with each other and with the results of null experiments can be obtained.
