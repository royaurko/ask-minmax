We analyze the efficiency of available algorithms for the simulation of
classical fidelity and show that their computational costs increase
exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom for almost all initial
states. Then we present an algorithm whose cost is independent of the system's
dimensionality and show that, within a continuous family of algorithms, our
algorithm is the only one with this property. Simultaneously we propose a
general analytical approach to estimate efficiency of trajectory-based methods.
