Charged massive matter fields of spin 0 and 1/2 are quantized in the presence
of an external uniform magnetic field in a spatial region bounded by two
parallel plates. The most general set of boundary conditions at the plates,
that is required by mathematical consistency and the self-adjointness of the
Hamiltonian operator, is employed. The vacuum fluctuations of the matter field
in the case of the magnetic field orthogonal to the plates are analyzed, and it
is shown that the pressure from the vacuum onto the plates is positive and
independent of the boundary condition, as well as of the distance between the
plates. Possibilities of the detection of this new-type Casimir effect are
discussed.
