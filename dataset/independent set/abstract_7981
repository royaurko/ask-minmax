Propagation of waves in the Cantor-set media is investigated by a
renormalization-group type method. We find fixed points for complete
reflection, $T^*=0$, and for complete transmission, $T^*=1$. In addition, the
wave numbers for which transmission coefficients show chaotic behaviors are
reported. The results obtained are for optical waves, and they can be tested in
optical experiments. Our method could be applied to any wave propagation
through the Cantor set.
