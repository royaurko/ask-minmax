Thermally induced conductance jumps of metal nanowires are modeled using
stochastic Ginzburg-Landau field theories. Changes in radius are predicted to
occur via the nucleation of surface kinks at the wire ends, consistent with
recent electron microscopy studies. The activation rate displays nontrivial
dependence on nanowire length, and undergoes first- or second-order-like
transitions as a function of length. The activation barriers of the most stable
structures are predicted to be universal, i.e., independent of the radius of
the wire, and proportional to the square root of the surface tension. The
reduction of the activation barrier under strain is also determined.
