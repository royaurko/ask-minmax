We use a statistically significant set of measurements to show that the
field-aligned electron heat flux $q_\parallel$ in the solar wind at 1 AU is
consistent with the Spitzer-H\"{a}rm collisional heat flux $q_{sh}$ for
temperature gradient scales larger than a few mean free paths $L_T \gtrsim 3.5
~\lambda_{fp}$. This represents about 65% of the measured data and corresponds
primarily to high $\beta$, weakly collisional plasma ('slow solar wind'). In
the more collisionless regime $\lambda_{fp}/L_T \gtrsim 0.28$, the electron
heat flux is limited to $q_\parallel/q_0 \sim 0.3$, independent of mean free
path, where $q_0$ is the 'free-streaming' value; the measured $q_\parallel$
does not achieve the full $q_0$. This constraint $q_\parallel/q_0 \sim 0.3$
might be attributed to wave-particle interactions, an interplanetary electric
potential, or inherent flux limitation. We also show a $\beta_e$ dependence to
these results that is consistent with a local radial electron temperature
profile $T_e \sim r^{-\alpha}$ that is a function of the thermal electron beta
$\alpha = \alpha(\beta_e)$ and that the $\beta$ dependence of the collisionless
regulation constraint is not obviously consistent with a whistler heat flux
instability. We discuss the results in a broader astrophysical context.
