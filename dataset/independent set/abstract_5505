Molodtsov \cite{molodtsov-1999} proposed the concept of soft set theory in
1999, which can be used as a mathematical tool for dealing with problems that
contain uncertainty. Sabir and Naz \cite{shabir-2013} defined notion of bipolar
soft set in 2013. In this paper, we redefine concept of bipolar soft set and
bipolar soft set operations as more functional than former. Also we study on
their basic properties and we present a decision making method with
application.
