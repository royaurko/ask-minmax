In the electricity grid, networked sensors which record and transmit
increasingly high-granularity data are being deployed. In such a setting,
privacy concerns are a natural consideration. We present an attack model for
privacy breaches, and, using results from estimation theory, derive theoretical
results ensuring that an adversary will fail to infer private information with
a certain probability, independent of the algorithm used. We show utility
companies would benefit from less noisy, higher frequency data, as it would
improve various smart grid operations such as load prediction. We provide a
method to quantify how smart grid operations improve as a function of higher
frequency data. In order to obtain the consumer's valuation of privacy, we
design a screening mechanism consisting of a menu of contracts to the energy
consumer with varying guarantees of privacy. The screening process is a means
to segment customers. Finally, we design insurance contracts using the
probability of a privacy breach to be offered by third-party insurance
companies.
