The breakage of a polymer chain of segments, coupled by anharmonic bonds with
applied constant external tensile force is studied by means of Molecular
Dynamics simulation. We show that the mean life time of the chain becomes
progressively independent of the number of bonds as the pulling force grows.
The latter affects also the rupture rates of individual bonds along the polymer
backbone manifesting the essential role of inertial effects in the
fragmentation process. The role of local defects, temperature and friction in
the scission kinetics is also examined.
