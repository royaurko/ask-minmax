We investigate the prevalence of Li-Yorke pairs for $C^2$ and $C^3$
multimodal maps $f$ with non-flat critical points. We show that every
measurable scrambled set has zero Lebesgue measure and that all strongly
wandering sets have zero Lebesgue measure, as does the set of pairs of
asymptotic (but not asymptotically periodic) points.
  If $f$ is topologically mixing and has no Cantor attractor, then typical
(w.r.t. two-dimensional Lebesgue measure) pairs are Li-Yorke; if additionally
$f$ admits an absolutely continuous invariant probability measure (acip), then
typical pairs have a dense orbit for $f \times f$. These results make use of
so-called nice neighborhoods of the critical set of general multimodal maps,
and hence uniformly expanding Markov induced maps, the existence of either is
proved in this paper as well.
  For the setting where $f$ has a Cantor attractor, we present a trichotomy
explaining when the set of Li-Yorke pairs and distal pairs have positive
two-dimensional Lebesgue measure.
