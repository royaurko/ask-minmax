For a strongly dissipative H\'enon-like map at the first bifurcation
parameter at which the uniform hyperbolicity is destroyed by the formation of
tangencies inside the limit set, we effect a multifractal analysis, i.e.,
decompose the set of non wandering points on the unstable manifold into level
sets of an unstable Lyapunov exponent, and give a partial description of the
Lyapunov spectrum which encodes this decomposition. We derive a formula for the
Hausdorff dimension of the level sets in terms of the entropy and unstable
Lyapunov exponent of invariant probability measures, and show the continuity of
the Lyapunov spectrum. We also show that the set of points for which the
unstable Lyapunov exponents do not exist carries a full Hausdorff dimension.
