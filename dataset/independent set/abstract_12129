A parameter-independent notion of stationary slow motion is formulated then
applied to the case of stationary rotation of massless trapped ghosts. The
excitations correspond to a rotation mode with angular momentum $J\neq 0$ and
twist modes. It is found that the rotation mode, which has no parity, causes
excess in the angular velocity of dragged distant coordinate frames in one
sheet of the wormhole while in the other sheet the angular velocity of the
ghosts is that of rotating stars: $2J/r^3$. As to the twist modes, which all
have parity, they cause excess in the angular velocity of one of the throat's
poles with respect to the other.
