Theoretical investigations are presented, and their results are discussed, of
the laser acceleration of a single electron by a chirped pulse. Fields of the
pulse are modeled by simple plane-wave oscillations and a $\cos^2$ envelope.
The dynamics emerge from analytic and numerical solutions to the relativistic
Lorentz-Newton equations of motion of the electron in the fields of the pulse.
All simulations have been carried out by independent Mathematica and Python
codes, with identical results. Configurations of acceleration from a position
of rest as well as from injection, axially and sideways, at initial
relativistic speeds are studied.
