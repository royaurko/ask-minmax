We give a necessary condition for a Riemannian manifold to admit limiting
Carleman weights in terms of the Weyl tensor (in dimensions 4 and higher) and
the Cotton-York tensor in dimension 3. As an application we provide explicit
examples of manifolds without limiting Carleman weights and show that the set
of such metrics on a given manifold contains an open and dense set.
