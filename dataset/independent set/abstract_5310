In the context of SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x [U(1)]^n, SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x
[U(1)]^n' and SU(3)_c x SU(3)_L x[U(1)]^n'', we analyze the possible values for
n, n' and n''. That is, we look for the number of family-independent,
independent abelian hypercharges that can be gauged in each one of those
models. We find that n=n'=1 for the minimal fermion content, but n can take any
value if we add the right-handed neutrino field to each family in the Standard
Model.
