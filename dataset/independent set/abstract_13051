We discuss the so-called two-temperature model in linear thermoelasticity and
provide a Hilbert space framework for proving well-posedness of the equations
under consideration. With the abstract perspective of evolutionary equations,
the two-temperature model turns out to be a coupled system of the elastic
equations and an abstract ode. Following this line of reasoning, we propose
another model being entirely an abstract ode. We highlight also an alternative
way for a two-temperature model, which might be of independent interest.
