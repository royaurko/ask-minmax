The permutation associated with the decimal expression of the binary
reflected Gray code with $N$ bits is considered. Its cycle structure is
studied. Considered as a set of points, its self-similarity is pointed out. As
a fractal, it is shown to be the attractor of a IFS. For large values of $N$
the set is examined from the point of view of time series analysis
