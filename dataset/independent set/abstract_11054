We show how the crucial gauge cancellations leading to a physical definition
of the neutrino charge radius persist in the presence of non-vanishing fermion
masses. An explicit one-loop calculation demonstrates that, as happens in the
massless case, the pinch technique rearrangement of the Feynman amplitudes,
together with the judicious exploitation of a fundamental current relation
leads to a completely gauge independent definition of the effective neutrino
charge radius. Using the formalism of the Nielsen identities it is further
proved that the same cancellation mechanism operates unaltered to all orders in
perturbation theory.
