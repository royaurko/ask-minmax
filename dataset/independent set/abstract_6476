Recently, the use of Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) has been increasing to
study the uncertainty in mathematical models for a wide range of applications
and several extensions of the original PCE technique have been developed to
deal with some of its limitations. But as of to date PCE methods still have the
restriction that the random variables have to be statistically independent.
This paper presents a method to construct a basis of the probability space of
orthogonal polynomials for general multivariate distributions with correlations
between the random input variables. We show that, as for the current PCE
methods, the statistics like mean, variance and Sobol' indices can be obtained
at no significant extra postprocessing costs. We study the behavior of the
proposed method for a range of correlation coefficients for an ODE with model
parameters that follow a bivariate normal distribution. In all cases the
convergence rate of the proposed method is analogous to that for the
independent case. Finally, we show, for a canonical enzymatic reaction, how to
propagate experimental errors through the process of fitting parameters to a
probabilistic distribution of the quantities of interest, and we demonstrate
the significant difference in the results assuming independence or full
correlation compared to taking into account the true correlation.
