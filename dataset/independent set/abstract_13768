We describe the results of some computational explorations in Thompson's
group F. We describe experiments to estimate the cogrowth of F with respect to
its standard finite generating set, designed to address the subtle and
difficult question whether or not Thompson's group is amenable. We also
describe experiments to estimate the exponential growth rate of F and the rate
of escape of symmetric random walks with respect to the standard generating
set.
