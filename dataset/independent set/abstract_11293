This paper presents expressions for gamma values at rational points with the
denominator dividing 24 or 60. These gamma values are expressed in terms of 10
distinct gamma values and rational powers of $\pi$ and a few real algebraic
numbers. Our elementary list of formulas can be conveniently used to evaluate,
for example, algebraic Gauss hypergeometric functions by the Gauss identity.
Also, algebraic independence of gamma values and their relation to the elliptic
K-function are briefly discussed.
