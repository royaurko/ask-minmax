We show that every knot has a checkerbord diagram and that every knot is the
closure of a rosette braid. We define Fourier knots of type (n_1, n_2, n_3) as
knots which have parametrizations where each coordinate function x_i(t) is a
finite Fourier series of length n_i, and conclude that every knot is a Fourier
knot of type (1, 1, n) for some natural number n.
