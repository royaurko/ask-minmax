Let $\alpha$ be a quadratic Poisson bivector on a vector space $V$. Then one
can also consider $\alpha$ as a quadratic Poisson bivector on the vector space
$V^*[1]$. Fixed a universal deformation quantization (prediction some weights
to all Kontsevich graphs [K97]), we have deformation quantization of the both
algebras $S(V^*)$ and $\Lambda(V)$. These are graded quadratic algebras, and
therefore Koszul algebras. We prove that for some universal deformation
quantization, independent on $\alpha$, these two algebras are Koszul dual. We
characterize some deformation quantizations for which this theorem is true in
the framework of the Tamarkin's theory [T1].
