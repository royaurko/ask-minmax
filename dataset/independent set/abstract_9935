This article is about estimation and inference methods for high dimensional
sparse (HDS) regression models in econometrics. High dimensional sparse models
arise in situations where many regressors (or series terms) are available and
the regression function is well-approximated by a parsimonious, yet unknown set
of regressors. The latter condition makes it possible to estimate the entire
regression function effectively by searching for approximately the right set of
regressors. We discuss methods for identifying this set of regressors and
estimating their coefficients based on $\ell_1$-penalization and describe key
theoretical results. In order to capture realistic practical situations, we
expressly allow for imperfect selection of regressors and study the impact of
this imperfect selection on estimation and inference results. We focus the main
part of the article on the use of HDS models and methods in the instrumental
variables model and the partially linear model. We present a set of novel
inference results for these models and illustrate their use with applications
to returns to schooling and growth regression.
