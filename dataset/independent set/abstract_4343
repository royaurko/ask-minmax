We derive a non-asymptotic expression for the moments of traces of monomials
in several independent complex Wishart matrices, extending some explicit
formulas available in the literature. We then deduce the explicit expression
for the cumulants. From the latter, we read out the multivariate normal
approximation to the traces of finite families of polynomials in independent
complex Wishart matrices.
