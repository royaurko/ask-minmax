Ten values of 12-j symbols of the first kind published earlier are challenged
by values calculated with an independent Python program. The program first
implements a narrow class of square roots of rational numbers, utilizing
Python's unlimited representation of big integers. Wigner's 3jm symbols, 6-j,
9-j, 12-j and 15-j symbols are then calculated by their familiar
representations as sums over products of these.
