Derivation of the full set of Bell inequalities involving correlation
functions, for two parties, with binary observables, and N possible local
settings is not as easy as it seemed. The proof of v1 is wrong. Additionaly one
can find a counterexample, which will be presented soon. Thus our thesis is
dead. Still the series of Bell inequalities discussed in the manuscript (v1)
form a necessary condition for local realism, and are tight. They are tight and
complete (sufficient) only for N=3 settings per observer (as shown in
quant-ph/0611086, fortunately using an entirely different approach).
