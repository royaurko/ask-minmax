We consider a possibility to explain the observed suppression of the second
acoustic peak in the anisotropy spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) by interaction between a fraction of non-baryonic Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
and normal baryonic matter. This scenario does not require any modifications in
the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We estimate the required values of
the cross-section-to-mass ratio for elastic scattering of CDM particles off
baryons. In case of velocity-independent elastic scattering (in the velocity
interval 10^{-5}--10^{-3}) we find that such particles do not contradict
observational limits if they are heavier than \sim 10^5 GeV or lighter than
\sim 0.5 GeV. Another candidate, which may appear in the models with infinite
extra dimensions, is a quasistable charged particle decaying through tunneling
into extra dimensions. Finally a millicharged particle with the electric charge
ranging from \sim 10^{-4} to \sim 10^{-1} and with mass M\sim 0.1 GeV--1 TeV
also may be responsible for the suppression of the second acoustic peak. As a
byproduct we point out that CMB measurements set new limits on the allowed
parameter space for the millicharged particles.
