We obtain some optimal inequalities on tail probabilities for sums of
independent bounded random variables. Our main result completes an upper bound
on tail probabilities due to Talagrand by giving a one-term asymptotic
expansion for large deviations. This result can also be regarded as sharp large
deviations of types of Cram\'er and Bahadur-Ranga Rao.
