This paper studies the Seshadri constant of an ample line bundle at a very
general point, seeking a very slight improvement on the result of Ein, Kuchle,
and Lazarsfeld. The main point is that couting jets more carefully yields a
better result. We hope that with some further innovations some type of bound,
independent of the dimension, will ultimately be found.
