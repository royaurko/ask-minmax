The magnetic switching of ferromagnetic nanotubes is investigated as a
function of their geometry. Two independent methods are used: Numerical
simulations and analytical calculations. It is found that for long tubes the
reversal of magnetization is achieved by two mechanism: The propagation of a
transverse or a vortex domain wall depending on the internal and external radii
of the tube.
