A famous theorem of Kuratowski states that in a topological space, at most 14
distinct sets can be produced by repeatedly applying the operations of closure
and complement to a given set. We re-examine this theorem in the setting of
formal languages, where closure is either Kleene closure or positive closure.
We classify languages according to the structure of the algebra they generate
under iterations of complement and closure. We show that there are precisely 9
such algebras in the case of positive closure, and 12 in the case of Kleene
closure.
