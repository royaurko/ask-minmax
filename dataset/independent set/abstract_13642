For a given attractor black hole with generic D6-D4-D2-D0-charges in four
dimensions we identify the set of supersymmetric branes, static or stationary
in global coordinates, of the corresponding eleven-dimensional near horizon
geometry. The set of these BPS states, which includes branes which partially or
fully wrap the horizon, should play a role in understanding the partition
function of black holes with D6-charges.
