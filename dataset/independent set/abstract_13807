A vertex subset $S$ of a graph $G$ is a dominating set if every vertex of $G$
either belongs to $S$ or is adjacent to a vertex of $S$. The cardinality of a
smallest dominating set is called the dominating number of $G$ and is denoted
by $\gamma(G)$. A graph $G$ is said to be $\gamma$- vertex-critical if
$\gamma(G-v)< \gamma(G)$, for every vertex $v$ in $G$. Let $G$ be a 2-connected
$K_{1,5}$-free 3-vertex-critical graph. For any vertex $v \in V(G)$, we show
that $G-v$ has a perfect matching (except two graphs), which is a conjecture
posed by Ananchuen and Plummer.
