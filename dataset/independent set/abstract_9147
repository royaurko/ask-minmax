We derive model independent lower bounds on the CKM parameters (1-rhobar) and
etabar as functions of the mixing-induced CP asymmetry S in B-> pi+ pi- and
sin(2 beta) from B->psi K_S. The bounds do not depend on specific results of
theoretical calculations for the penguin contribution to B-> pi+ pi-. They
require only the very conservative condition that a hadronic phase, which
vanishes in the heavy-quark limit, does not exceed 90 degrees in magnitude. The
bounds are effective if -sin(2 beta) < S < 1. Dynamical calculations indicate
that the limits on rhobar and etabar are close to their actual values.
