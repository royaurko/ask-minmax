Let $(Y_i,Z_i)_{i\geq 1}$ be a sequence of independent, identically
distributed (i.i.d.) random vectors taking values in $\RRR^k\times\RRR^d$, for
some integers $k$ and $d$. Given $z\in \RRR^d$, we provide a nonstandard
functional limit law for the sequence of functional increments of the compound
empirical process, namely $$\mathbf{\Delta}_{n,\cc}(h_n,z,\cdot):=
\frac{1}{nh_n}\sliin 1_{[0,\cdot)}\poo \frac{Z_i-z}{{h_n}^{1/d}}\pff Y_i.$$
Provided that $nh_n\sim c\log n $ as $\nif$, we obtain, under some natural
conditions on the conditional exponential moments of $Y\mid Z=z$, that
$$\mathbf{\Delta}_{n,\cc}(h_n,z,\cdot)\leadsto \Gam\text{almost surely},$$
where $\leadsto$ denotes the clustering process under the sup norm on $\Idd$.
Here, $\Gam$ is a compact set that is related to the large deviations of
certain compound Poisson processes.
