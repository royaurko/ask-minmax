Answering a question of Kalai and Meshulam, we prove that graphs without
induced cycles of length $3k$ have bounded chromatic number. This implies the
very first case of a much broader question asserting that every graph with
large chromatic number induces a graph $H$ such that the sum of the Betti
numbers of the independence complex of $H$ is also large.
