We consider sets of positive integers containing no sum of two elements in
the set and also no product of two elements. We show that the upper density of
such a set is strictly smaller than 1/2 and that this is best possible.
Further, we also find the maximal order for the density of such sets that are
also periodic modulo some positive integer.
