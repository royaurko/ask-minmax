We study the weighted Bochner-Martinelli residue current R^p(f) associated
with a sequence f=(f_1,...,f_m) of holomorphic germs at the origin in C^n,
whose common zero set equals the origin, and p=(p_1,..., p_m)\in N^n. Our main
results are a description of R^p(f) and its annihilator ideal in terms of the
Rees valuations of the ideal generated by (f_1^{p_1},..., f_m^{p_m}) and an
explicit description of R^p(f) when f is monomial. For a monomial sequence f we
show that R^p(f) is independent of p if and only if f is a regular sequence.
