We introduce and analyse a new class of monotone stochastic recursions in a
regenerative environment which is essentially broader than that of Markov
chains. We prove stability theorems and apply our results to two canonical
models in recursive economics, generalising some known stability results to the
cases when driving sequences are not independent and identically distributed.
We also revisit the case of monotone Markovian models (or, equivalently,
stochastic recursions with i.i.d. drivers) and provide a simplified version of
the proof of a stability result given originally in Dubins and Freedman [11];
see also Bhattacharya and Majumdar [5].
