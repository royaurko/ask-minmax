We introduce the matrix sums that represent a discrete analog of the matrix
models with quartic potential. The probability space is given by the set of all
simple n-vertex graphs with the Gibbs weight determined by the graph Laplacian.
We study the large-n limit of the free energy per site and show that it is
determined by the number of connected acyclic diagrams on the set of two-valent
vertices.
