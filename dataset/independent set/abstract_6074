Let $G=G_{n,n,p}$ be the random bipartite graph on $n+n$ vertices, where each
$e\in [n]^2$ appears as an edge independently with probability $p$. Suppose
that each edge $e$ is given an independent uniform exponential rate one cost.
Let $C(G)$ denote the expected length of the minimum cost perfect matching. We
show that w.h.p. if $d=np\gg(\log n)^2$ then ${\bf E}(C(G))
=(1+o(1))\frac{\pi^2}{6p}$. This generalizes the well-known result for the case
$G=K_{n,n}$.
