Let A be a finitely generated connected graded k-algebra defined by a finite
number of monomial relations. Then there is a finite directed graph, Q, the
Ufnarovskii graph of A, for which the categories QGr(A) and QGr(kQ) are
equivalent: QGr(A) denotes the quotient category of graded A-modules modulo the
subcategory consisting of those that are the sum of their finite dimensional
submodules; QGr(kQ) has a similar definition. The proof makes use of an algebra
homomorphism A--->kQ that may be of independent interest.
