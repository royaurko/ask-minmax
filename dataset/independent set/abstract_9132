We perform model independent and model dependent analyses of solar neutrino
data including the neutral current event rate from SNO. The inclusion of the
first SNO NC data in the model independent analysis determines the allowed
ranges of $^{8}{B}$ flux normalisation and the $\nu_e$ survival probability
more precisely than what was possible from the SK and SNO CC combination. We
perform global $\nu_e-\nu_{active}$ oscillation analyses of solar neutrino data
using the NC rate instead of the SSM prediction for the $^{8}{B}$ flux, in view
of the large uncertainty in the latter. The LMA gives the best solution, while
the LOW solution is allowed only at the $3\sigma$ level.
