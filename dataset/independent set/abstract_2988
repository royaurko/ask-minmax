We show that the general heavenly equation, suggested recently by Doubrov and
Ferapontov \cite{fer}, governs anti-self-dual (ASD) gravity. We derive ASD
Ricci-flat vacuum metric governed by the general heavenly equation, null tetrad
and basis of 1-forms for this metric. We present algebraic exact solutions of
the general heavenly equation as a set of zeros of homogeneous polynomials in
independent and dependent variables. A real solution is obtained for the case
of neutral signature.
