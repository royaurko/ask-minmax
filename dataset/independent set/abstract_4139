We address the problem of using nonlinear models to design experiments to
characterize the dynamics of cellular processes by using the approach of the
Maximally Informative Next Experiment (MINE), which was introduced in [W. Dong,
et al. Systems biology of the clock in neurospora crassa. {\em PLoS ONE}, page
e3105, 2008] and independently in [M. M. Donahue, et al. Experiment design
through dynamical characterization of non-linear systems biology models
utilising sparse grids. {\em IET System Biology}, 4:249--262, 2010]. In this
approach, existing data is used to define a probability distribution on the
parameters; the next measurement point is the one that yields the largest model
output variance with this distribution. Building upon this approach, we
introduce the Expected Dynamics Estimator (EDE), which is the expected value
using this distribution of the output as a function of time. We prove the
consistency of this estimator (uniform convergence to true dynamics) even when
the chosen experiments cluster in a finite set of points. We extend this proof
of consistency to various practical assumptions on noisy data and moderate
levels of model mismatch. Through the derivation and proof, we develop a
relaxed version of MINE that is more computationally tractable and robust than
the original formulation. The results are illustrated with numerical examples
on two nonlinear ordinary differential equation models of biomolecular and
cellular processes.
