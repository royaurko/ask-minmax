We estimate the variance of weight and stopping set distribution of regular
LDPC ensembles. Using this estimate and the second moment method we obtain
bounds on the probability that a randomly chosen code from regular LDPC
ensemble has its weight distribution and stopping set distribution close to
respective ensemble averages. We are able to show that a large fraction of
total number of codes have their weight and stopping set distribution close to
the average.
