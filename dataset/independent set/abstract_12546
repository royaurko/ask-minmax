In this paper, we provide a simple but powerful module to generate entangled
qudits. This module assisted with cross-Kerr nonlinearity is available to the
entangled qudits generation with arbitrary dimension, and it could work well
even when the two independent qudits lose the same number of single photons.
Moreover, with the cascade uses of modules, the deterministic generation but
with nonidentical forms of entangled qudits is possible.
