Given a countable dense subset $S$ of a finite-dimensional normed space $X$,
and $0<p<1$, we form a random graph on $S$ by joining, independently and with
probability $p$, each pair of points at distance less than $1$. We say that $S$
is `Rado' if any two such random graphs are (almost surely) isomorphic.
  Bonato and Janssen showed that in $l_\infty^d$ almost all $S$ are Rado. Our
main aim in this paper is to show that $l_\infty^d$ is the unique normed space
with this property: indeed, in every other space almost all sets $S$ are
non-Rado. We also determine which spaces admit some Rado set: this turns out to
be the spaces that have an $l_\infty$ direct summand. These results answer
questions of Bonato and Janssen.
  A key role is played by the determination of which finite-dimensional normed
spaces have the property that every bijective step-isometry (meaning that the
integer part of distances is preserved) is in fact an isometry. This result may
be of independent interest.
