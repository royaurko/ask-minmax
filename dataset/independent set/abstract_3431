Fall is one of the major health threats and obstacles to independent living
for elders, timely and reliable fall detection is crucial for mitigating the
effects of falls. In this paper, leveraging the fine-grained Channel State
Information (CSI) and multi-antenna setting in commodity WiFi devices, we
design and implement a real-time, non-intrusive, and low-cost indoor fall
detector, called Anti-Fall. For the first time, the CSI phase difference over
two antennas is identified as the salient feature to reliably segment the fall
and fall-like activities, both phase and amplitude information of CSI is then
exploited to accurately separate the fall from other fall-like activities.
Experimental results in two indoor scenarios demonstrate that Anti-Fall
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach WiFall, with 10% higher
detection rate and 10% less false alarm rate on average.
