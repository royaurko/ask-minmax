We will consider a convex unbounded set and certain group of actions $G$ on
this set. This will substitute the translation (by adding) structure usually
consider in the classical setting of prevalence. In this way we will be able to
define the meaning of $G$-prevalent set.
  In this setting we will show a kind of quantitative Kupka-Smale Theorem and
also a result about rotation numbers which was first consider by J.-C. Yoccoz
(and, also by M. Tsujii).
