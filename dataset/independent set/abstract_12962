We performed an experimental observation on the spontaneous imbibition of
water in a porous media in a radial Hele-Shaw cell and confirmed Washburn's
law, where r is distance and t is time. Spontaneous imbibition with a radial
interface window followed scaling dynamics when the front invaded into the
porous media. We found a growth exponent (\b{eta}=0.6) that was independent of
the pressure applied at the liquid inlet. The roughness exponent decreased with
an increase in pressure. The roughening dynamics of two dimensional spontaneous
radial imbibition obey Family-Vicsek scaling, which is different from that with
a one-dimensional planar interface window.
