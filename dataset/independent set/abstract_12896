We provide linear lower bounds for $f_\rho(L)$, the smallest integer so that
every curve on a fixed hyperbolic surface $(S,\rho)$ of length at most $L$
lifts to a simple curve on a cover of degree at most $f_\rho(L)$. This bound is
independent of hyperbolic structure $\rho$, and improves on a recent bound of
Gupta-Kapovich. When $(S,\rho)$ is without punctures, using work of Patel we
conclude asymptotically linear growth of $f_\rho$. When $(S,\rho)$ has a
puncture, we obtain exponential lower bounds for $f_\rho$.
