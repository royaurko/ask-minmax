In this work we study the behaviour of Wigner phase delay time for tunneling
in the reflection mode. Our system consists of a circular loop connected to a
single wire of semi-infinite length in the presence of Aharonov-Bohm flux. We
calculate the analytical expression for the saturated delay time. This
saturated delay time is independent of Aharonov- Bohm flux and the width of the
opaque barrier thereby generalizing the Hartman effect. This effect implies
superluminal group velocities as a consequence. We also briefly discuss the
concept called "space collapse or space destroyer".
