This study describes application of some approximate reasoning methods to
analysis of hydrocyclone performance. In this manner, using a combining of Self
Organizing Map (SOM), Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS)-SONFIS- and Rough Set
Theory (RST)-SORST-crisp and fuzzy granules are obtained. Balancing of crisp
granules and non-crisp granules can be implemented in close-open iteration.
Using different criteria and based on granulation level balance point
(interval) or a pseudo-balance point is estimated. Validation of the proposed
methods, on the data set of the hydrocyclone is rendered.
