This paper proposes an algorithm to search a family of multiple sets of
minimum correlated one dimensional uni-polar (optical) orthogonal codes
(1-DUOC) or optical orthogonal codes (OOC) with fixed as well as variable code
parameters. The cardinality of each set is equal to upper bound. The codes
within a set can be searched for general values of code length, code weight,
auto-correlation constraint and cross-correlation constraint. Each set forms a
maximal clique of the codes within given range of correlation properties .
These one-dimensional uni-polar orthogonal codes can find their application as
signature sequences for spectral spreading purpose in incoherent optical code
division multiple access (CDMA) systems.
