We construct, in locally compact, second countable, amenable groups, sets
with large density that fail to have certain combinatorial properties. For the
property of being a shift of a set of measurable recurrence we show that this
is possible when the group does not have cocompact von Neumann kernel. For the
stronger property of being piecewise-syndetic we show that this is always
possible.
  For minimally almost periodic, locally compact, second countable, amenable
groups, we prove that any dilation of a positive density set by an open
neighborhood of the identity contains a set of measurable recurrence, and that
the same result holds, up to a shift, when the von Neumann kernel is cocompact.
This leads to a trichotomy for locally compact, second countable, amenable
groups based on combinatorial properties of large sets. We also prove, using a
two-sided Furstenberg correspondence principle, that any two-sided dilation of
a positive density set contains a two-sided finite products set.
