A previous research on multivariate approach to the calculation of
reverberation chamber correlation matrices is used to calculate the number of
independent positions in a mode-stirred reverberation chamber. Anomalies and
counterintuitive behavior are observed in terms of number of correlated matrix
elements with respect to increasing frequency. This is ascribed to the regular
geometry forming the baseline cavity (screened room) of a reverberation
chamber, responsible for localizing energy and preserving regular modes
(bouncing ball modes). Smooth wall deformations are introduced in order to
create underlying Lyapunov instability of rays and then destroy survived
regular modes. Numerical full-wave simulations are performed for a
reverberation chamber with corner hemispheres and (off-)center wall spherical
caps. Field sampling is performed by moving a mechanical carousel stirrer. It
is found that wave-chaos inspired baseline geometries improve chamber
performances in terms of lowest usable frequencies and number of independent
cavity realizations of mechanical stirrers.
