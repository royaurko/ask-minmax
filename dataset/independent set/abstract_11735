We have investigated polyyne and cumulene prototypes based on the
density-functional theory. Our independent-particle spectra show that the
various carbynes can be distinguished by optical properties comparing the
low-energy spectral structure as well as using very general considerations. The
latter conclusion is supported by results based on the random-phase
approximation including local-field effects.
