A construction of the real number system based on almost homomorphisms of the
integers Z was proposed by Schanuel, Arthan, and others. We combine such a
construction with the ultrapower or limit ultrapower construction, to construct
the hyperreals out of integers. In fact, any hyperreal field, whose universe is
a set, can be obtained by such a one-step construction directly out of
integers. Even the maximal (i.e., On-saturated) hyperreal number system
described by Kanovei and Reeken (2004) and independently by Ehrlich (2012) can
be obtained in this fashion, albeit not in NBG. In NBG, it can be obtained via
a one-step construction by means of a definable ultrapower (modulo a suitable
definable class ultrafilter).
