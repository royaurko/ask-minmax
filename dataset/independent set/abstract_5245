Cross-bifix-free sets are sets of words such that no prefix of any word is a
suffix of any other word. In this paper, we introduce a general constructive
method for the sets of cross-bifix-free binary words of fixed length. It
enables us to determine a cross-bifix-free words subset which has the property
to be non-expandable.
