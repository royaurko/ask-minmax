We study graph partitioning problems from a min-max perspective, in which an
input graph on n vertices should be partitioned into k parts, and the objective
is to minimize the maximum number of edges leaving a single part. The two main
versions we consider are where the k parts need to be of equal-size, and where
they must separate a set of k given terminals. We consider a common
generalization of these two problems, and design for it an $O(\sqrt{\log n\log
k})$-approximation algorithm. This improves over an $O(\log^2 n)$ approximation
for the second version, and roughly $O(k\log n)$ approximation for the first
version that follows from other previous work. We also give an improved
O(1)-approximation algorithm for graphs that exclude any fixed minor.
  Our algorithm uses a new procedure for solving the Small-Set Expansion
problem. In this problem, we are given a graph G and the goal is to find a
non-empty set $S\subseteq V$ of size $|S| \leq \rho n$ with minimum
edge-expansion. We give an $O(\sqrt{\log{n}\log{(1/\rho)}})$ bicriteria
approximation algorithm for the general case of Small-Set Expansion, and O(1)
approximation algorithm for graphs that exclude any fixed minor.
