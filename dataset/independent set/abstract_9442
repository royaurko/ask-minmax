We determine and study the steady state of two independent two-level systems
weakly coupled to a stationary non-equilibrium environment. Whereas this
bipartite state is necessarily uncorrelated if the splitting energies of the
two-level systems are different from each other, it can be entangled if they
are equal. For identical two-level systems interacting with two bosonic heat
baths at different temperatures, we discuss the influence of the baths
temperatures and coupling parameters on their entanglement. Geometric
properties, such as the baths dimensionalities and the distance between the
two-level systems, are relevant. A regime is found where the steady state is a
statistical mixture of the product ground state and of the entangled singlet
state with respective weights 2/3 and 1/3.
