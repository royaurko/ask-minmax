We investigate a non-axisymmetric rotating BEC in a limit of rotation
frequency for which the BEC transforms into a quasi-one-dimensional system. We
compute the vortex lattice wavefunction by minimizing the Gross-Pitaevskii
energy functional in the lowest Landau level approximation for different
confinement potentials. The condensate typically presents a changing number of
vortex rows as a function of the interaction strength or rotation-confinement
ratio. More specifically, the vortex lattices can be classified into two
classes according to their symmetry with respect to the longitudinal axis.
These two classes correspond to different local minima of the energy functional
and evolve independently as a function of the various parameters.
