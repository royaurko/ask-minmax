In this paper we present our results concerning the dependence of Wilson loop
expectation values on the size of the lattice and the rank of the SU(N) gauge
group. This allows to test the claims about volume independence in the large N
limit, and the crucial dependence on boundary conditions. Our highly precise
results provide strong support for the validity of the twisted reduction
mechanism and the TEK model, provided the fluxes are chosen within the
appropriate domain.
