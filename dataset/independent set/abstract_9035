A statistical description of static granular material requires ergodic
sampling of the phase space spanned by the different configurations of the
particles. We periodically fluidize a column of glass beads and find that the
sequence of volume fractions phi of post-fluidized states is history
independent and Gaussian distributed about a stationary state. The standard
deviation of phi exhibits, as a function of phi, a minimum corresponding to a
maximum in the number of statistically independent regions. Measurements of the
fluctuations enable us to determine the compactivity X, a temperature-like
state variable introduced in the statistical theory of Edwards and Oakeshott
[Physica A {\bf 157}, 1080 (1989)].
