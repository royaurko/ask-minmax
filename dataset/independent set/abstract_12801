We study the existence of nontrivial bound state solutions to the following
system of coupled nonlinear time-independent Schr\"odinger equations $$ -
\Delta u_j+ \lambda_j u_j =\mu_j u_j^3+ \sum_{k=1;k\neq j}^N\beta_{jk}
u_ju_k^2,\quad u_j\in W^{1,2}(\mathbb{R}^n);\: j=1,\ldots,N $$ where
$n=1,\,2,\, 3; \,\lambda_j,\, \mu_j>0$ for $j=1,\ldots,N$, the coupling
parameters $\beta_{jk}=\beta_{kj}\in \mathbb{R}$ for $j,k=1,\ldots,N$, $j\neq
k$. Precisely, we prove the existence of nonnegative bound state solutions for
suitable conditions on the coupling factors. Additionally, with more
restrictive conditions on the coupled parameters, we show that the bound states
founded are positive.
