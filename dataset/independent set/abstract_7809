We describe the structure of ``K-approximate subgroups'' of torsion-free
nilpotent groups, paying particular attention to Lie groups.
  Three other works, by Fisher-Katz-Peng, Sanders and Tao, have appeared which
independently address related issues. We comment briefly on some of the
connections between these papers.
