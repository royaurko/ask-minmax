In this paper we obtain several extensions to the quaternionic setting of
some results concerning the approximation by polynomials of functions
continuous on a compact set and holomorphic in its interior. The results
include approximation on compact starlike sets and compact axially symmetric
sets. The cases of some concrete particular sets are described in details,
including quantitative estimates too.
