The BBW method remains one of most demanded tool to derive full set of
Cepheid astrophysical parameters. Surface brightness version of the BBW
technique was preferentially used during last decades to calculate Cepheid
radii and to improve PLC relations. Its implementation requires a priory
knowledge of Cepheid reddening value. We propose a new version of the
Baade--Becker--Wesselink technique, which allows one to independently determine
the colour excess and the intrinsic colour of a radially pulsating star, in
addition to its radius, luminosity, and distance. It is considered to be a
generalization of the Balona light curve modelling approach. The method also
allows the function F(CI_0) = BC + 10 log Teff for the class of pulsating stars
considered to be calibrated. We apply this technique to a number of classical
Cepheids with very accurate light and radial-velocity curves. The new technique
can also be applied to other pulsating variables, e.g. RR Lyraes. We discuss
also possible dependence of the projection factor on the pulsation phase.
