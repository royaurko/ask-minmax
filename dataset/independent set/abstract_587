Spiders are arthropods that can be distinguished from their closest
relatives, the insects, by counting their legs. Spiders have 8, insects just 6.
Spider graphs are a very restricted class of graphs that naturally appear in
the context of cograph editing. The vertex set of a spider (or its complement)
is naturally partitioned into a clique (the body), an independent set (the
legs), and a rest (serving as the head). Here we show that spiders can be
recognized directly from their degree sequences through the number of their
legs (vertices with degree 1). Furthermore, we completely characterize the
degree sequences of spiders.
