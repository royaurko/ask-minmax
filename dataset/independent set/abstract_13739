For any 1-reduced simplicial set $K$ we define a canonical, coassociative
coproduct on $\Om C(K)$, the cobar construction applied to the normalized,
integral chains on $K$, such that any canonical quasi-isomorphism of chain
algebras from
 $\Om C(K)$ to the normalized, integral chains on $GK$, the loop group of $K$,
is a coalgebra map up to strong homotopy. Our proof relies on the operadic
description of the category of chain coalgebras and of strongly homotopy
coalgebra maps given in math.AT/0505559.
