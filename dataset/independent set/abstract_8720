It is shown in this paper that there is a fine correlation of the fifth order
between the values $Z[\phi(t)/2+\rho_1]Z[\phi(t)/2+\rho_2]Z[\phi(t)/2+\rho_3]$
and $\hat{Z}^2(t)$ which correspond to two collections of disconnected sets.
This new asymptotic formula cannot be obtained within known theories of
Balasubramanian, Heath-Brown and Ivic.
