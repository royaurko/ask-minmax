The study of charmless hadronic two-body decays of B mesons is one of the
most fascinating topics in B physics. A construction of the unitarity triangle
based on such decays is presented, which is independent of B-B(bar) and
K-K(bar) mixing. It provides stringent tests of the Standard Model with small
theoretical uncertainties.
