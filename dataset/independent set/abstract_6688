We present a model of truthful elicitation which generalizes and extends
mechanisms, scoring rules, and a number of related settings that do not quite
qualify as one or the other. Our main result is a characterization theorem,
yielding characterizations for all of these settings, including a new
characterization of scoring rules for non-convex sets of distributions. We
generalize this model to eliciting some property of the agent's private
information, and provide the first general characterization for this setting.
We also show how this yields a new proof of a result in mechanism design due to
Saks and Yu.
