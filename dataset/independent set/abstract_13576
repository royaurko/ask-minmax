The three invariants of C$^{1/2}$ are key to expressing this tensor and its
inverse as a polynomial in C. Simple and symmetric expressions are presented
connecting the two sets of invariants $I_1, I_2,I_3$ and $i_1, i_2,i_3 $ of C
and C$^{1/2}$, respectively. The first result is a bivariate function relating
$I_1, I_2$ to $i_1, i_2$. The functional form of $i_1$ is the same as that of
$i_2$ when the roles of the C-invariants are reversed. The second result
expresses the invariants using a single call to a single function. The two sets
of expressions emphasize symmetries in the relations among these four
invariants.
