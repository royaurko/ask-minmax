We discuss precision Monte Carlo (MC) calculations for solving the QCD
evolution equations up to the next-to-leading-order (NLO) level. They employ
forward Markovian Monte Carlo algorithms, which provide rigorous solutions of
the above equations. These algorithms are implemented in the form of the Monte
Carlo program EvolFMC. This program has been cross-checked with independent,
non-MC, programs (QCDNum16 and APCheb33) and the numerical agreement at the
level of 0.1% has been found.
