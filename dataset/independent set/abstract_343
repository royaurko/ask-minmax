This paper discusses the possibility of constructing time-independent
solutions to the collisionless Boltzmann equation which depend on quantities
other than global isolating integrals such as energy and angular momentum. The
key point is that, at least in principle, a self-consistent equilibrium can be
constructed from any set of time-independent phase space building blocks which,
when combined, generate the mass distribution associated with an assumed
time-independent potential. This approach provides a way to justify
Schwarzschild's (1979) method for the numerical construction of self-consistent
equilibria with arbitrary time-independent potentials, generalising thereby an
approach developed by Vandervoort (1984) for integrable potentials. As a simple
illustration, Schwarzschild's method is reformulated to allow for a
straightforward computation of equilibria which depend only on one or two
global integrals and no other quantities, as is reasonable, e.g., for modeling
axisymmetric configurations characterised by a nonintegrable potential.
