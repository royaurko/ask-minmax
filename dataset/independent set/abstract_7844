In this paper, we derive higher-order expansions of $L$-statistics of
independent risks $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ under conditions on the underlying
distribution function $F$. The new results are applied to derive the asymptotic
expansions of ratios of two kinds of risk measures, stop-loss premium and
excess return on capital, respectively.
