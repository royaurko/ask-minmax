Protein folding and design are major biophysical problems, the solution of
which would lead to important applications especially in medicine. Here a novel
protein model capable of simultaneously provide quantitative protein design and
folding is introduced. With computer simulations it is shown that, for a large
set of real protein structures, the model produces designed sequences with
similar physical properties to the corresponding natural occurring sequences.
The designed sequences are not yet fully realistic and require further
experimental testing. For an independent set of proteins, notoriously difficult
to fold, the correct folding of both the designed and the natural sequences is
also demonstrated. The folding properties are characterized by free energy
calculations. which not only are consistent among natural and designed
proteins, but we also show a remarkable precision when the folded structures
are compared to the experimentally determined ones. Ultimately, this novel
coarse-grained protein model is unique in the combination of its fundamental
three features: its simplicity, its ability to produce natural foldable
designed sequences, and its structure prediction precision. The latter
demonstrated by free energy calculations. It is also remarkable that low
frustration sequences can be obtained with such a simple and universal design
procedure, and that the folding of natural proteins shows funnelled free energy
landscapes without the need of any potentials based on the native structure.
