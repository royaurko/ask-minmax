The totally nonnegative Grassmannian is the set of $k$-dimensional subspaces
$V$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose nonzero Pl\"ucker coordinates all have the same
sign. Gantmakher and Krein (1950) and Schoenberg and Whitney (1951)
independently showed that $V$ is totally nonnegative iff every vector in $V$,
when viewed as a sequence of $n$ numbers and ignoring any zeros, changes sign
at most $k-1$ times. We generalize this result from the totally nonnegative
Grassmannian to the entire Grassmannian, showing that if $V$ is generic (i.e.
has no zero Pl\"ucker coordinates), then the vectors in $V$ change sign at most
$m$ times iff certain sequences of Pl\"ucker coordinates of $V$ change sign at
most $m-k+1$ times. We also give an algorithm which, given a non-generic $V$
whose vectors change sign at most $m$ times, perturbs $V$ into a generic
subspace whose vectors also change sign at most $m$ times. We deduce that among
all $V$ whose vectors change sign at most $m$ times, the generic subspaces are
dense. These results generalize to oriented matroids. As an application of our
results, we characterize when the amplituhedron map of Arkani-Hamed and Trnka
(2013) is well-defined. We also give two ways of obtaining the positroid cell
of each $V$ in the totally nonnegative Grassmannian from the sign patterns of
vectors in $V$.
