We prove a shape theorem for the internal (graph) distance on the
interlacement set $\mathcal{I}^u$ of the random interlacement model on $\mathbb
Z^d$, $d\ge 3$. We provide large deviation estimates for the internal distance
of distant points in this set, and use these estimates to study the internal
distance on the range of a simple random walk on a discrete torus.
