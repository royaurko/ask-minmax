We show the existence of a bounded Borel measurable saturated compensation
function for a factor map between subshifts. As an application, we find the
Hausdorff dimension and measures of full Hausdorff dimension for a compact
invariant set of an expanding nonconformal map on the torus given by an
integer-valued diagonal matrix. These problems were studied in [19] for a
compact invariant set whose symbolic representation is a shift of finite type
under the condition of the existence of a saturated compensation function. We
extend the results by presenting a formula for the Hausdorff dimension for a
compact invariant set whose symbolic representation is a subshift without the
condition and characterizing the invariant ergodic measures of full dimension
as the ergodic equilibrium states of a constant multiple of a measurable
compensation function. For a compact invariant set whose symbolic
representation is a topologically mixing shift of finite type, we study
uniqueness and the properties for the unique invariant ergodic measure of full
dimension by using a measurable compensation function. Our positive results
narrow the possibility of where an example having more than one measure of full
dimension can be found.
