We reexamine the interpretation of the annual modulation signal observed by
the DAMA experiment as due to WIMPs with a spin-dependent coupling mostly to
protons. We consider both axial-vector and pseudo-scalar couplings, and elastic
as well as endothermic and exothermic inelastic scattering. We conclude that
the DAMA signal is in strong tension with null results of other direct
detection experiments, particularly PICASSO and KIMS.
