We define for any 4-tetrahedron (4-simplex) the simplest finite closed
piecewise flat manifold consisting of this 4-tetrahedron and of the one else
4-tetrahedron identical up to reflection to the present one (call it bisimplex
built on the given 4-simplex, or two-sided 4-simplex). We consider arbitrary
piecewise flat manifold. Gravity action for it can be expressed in terms of sum
of the actions for the bisimplices built on the 4-simplices constituting this
manifold. We use representation of each bisimplex action in terms of rotation
matrices (connections) and area tensors. This gives some representation of any
piecewise flat gravity action in terms of connections. The action is a sum of
terms each depending on the connection variables referring to a single
4-tetrahedron. Application of this representation to the path integral
formalism is considered. Integrations over connections in the path integral
reduce to independent integrations over finite sets of connections on separate
4-simplices. One of the consequences is exponential suppression of the result
at large areas or lengths (compared to Plank scale). It is important for the
consistency of the simplicial description of spacetime.
