We study the Fermi surface of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (Bi2212) using angle resolved
photoemission (ARPES) with a momentum resolution of ~ 0.01 of the Brillouin
zone. We show that, contrary to recent suggestions, the Fermi surface is a
large hole barrel centered at (pi,pi), independent of the incident photon
energy.
