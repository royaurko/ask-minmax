We present observational evidence that supercycle lengths of the most active
SU UMa-type stars are increasing during the past decades. We analysed a large
number of photometric measurements from available archives and found that this
effect is generic for this class of stars, independently of their evolutionary
status. This finding is in agreement with previous predictions and the most
recent work of Patterson et al. (2012) on BK Lyn.
