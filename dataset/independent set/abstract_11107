We study an inflationary model where two decoupled string axions drive
inflation. The number of e-folds is dependent on the energy scale and the decay
constant, but is almost independent of the angular component in spite of the
rich geometry of the moduli space. This suppresses the nearly scale-invariant
spectrum of the isocurvature perturbations, making the power spectrum of the
primordial density perturbations dominated by the adiabatic component. We also
briefly discuss some amendments to improve the situation.
