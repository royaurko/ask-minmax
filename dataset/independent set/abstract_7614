Supersymmetric field theories on noncommutative spaces are constructed. We
present two different representations of noncommutative space, but we can
obtain supersymmetry algebla and supersymmetric Yang-Mills action independent
of its representation. As a result, we will see that the action has a close
relationship with IIB matrix model.
