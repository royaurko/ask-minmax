The set of solutions to the string equation $[P,Q]=1$ where $P$ and $Q$ are
differential operators is described.It is shown that there exists one-to-one
correspondence between this set and the set of pairs of commuting differential
operators.This fact permits us to describe the set of solutions to the string
equation in terms of moduli spa- ces of algebraic curves,however the direct
description is much simpler. Some results are obtained for the superanalog to
the string equation where $P$ and $Q$ are considered as superdifferential
operators. It is proved that this equation is invariant with respect to
Manin-Radul, Mulase-Rabin and Kac-van de Leur KP-hierarchies.
