The relationship between a polynomial's zeros and factors is well known. If a
is a zero of f(x) then (x-a) is a factor of f(x). In this paper, we generalize
this idea to polynomials of two variables and with real coefficients. We
consider the zero sets of two variable polynomials and give criterion to when
two polynomials with the same zero set have a common factor with the same zero
set. When the coefficients of the polynomials are not in a field, but the
division algebra of Quaternions, we provide an example of two polynomials with
the same zero set and no common factor.
