Was the spread of agropastoralism from the Fertile Crescent throughout Europe
influenced by extreme climate events, or was it independent of climate? We here
generate idealized climate events using palaeoclimate records. In a
mathematical model of regional sociocultural development, these events disturb
the subsistence base of simulated forager and farmer societies. We evaluate the
regional simulated transition timings and durations against a published large
set of radiocarbon dates for western Eurasia; the model is able to
realistically hindcast much of the inhomogeneous space-time evolution of
regional Neolithic transitions. Our study shows that the consideration of
climate events improves the simulation of typical lags between cultural
complexes, but that the overall difference to a model without climate events is
not significant. Climate events may not have been as important for early
sociocultural dynamics as endogenous factors.
