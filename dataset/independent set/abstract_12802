Generalized Concatenated (GC), also known as Integrated Interleaved (II)
Codes, are studied from an erasure correction point of view making them useful
for Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID) types of architectures
combining global and local properties. The fundamental erasure-correcting
properties of the codes are proven and efficient encoding and decoding
algorithms are provided. Although less powerful than the recently developed
PMDS codes, this implementation has the advantage of allowing generalization to
any range of parameters while the size of the field is much smaller than the
one required for PMDS codes.
