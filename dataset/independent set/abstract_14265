This paper describes a system to support the visual exploration of Open Data.
During his/her interactive experience with the graphics, the user can easily
store the current complete state of the visualization application (called a
viewpoint). Next, he/she can compose sequences of these viewpoints (called
scenarios) that can easily be reloaded. This feature allows to keep traces of a
former exploration process, which can be useful in single user (to support
investigation carried out in multiple sessions) as well as in collaborative
setting (to share points of interest identified in the data set).
