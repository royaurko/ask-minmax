The paper presents techniques to derive upper bounds for the mean time to
recover from a single fault for self-stabilizing algorithms in the message
passing model. For a new Delta+1-coloring algorithm we analytically derive a
bound for the mean time to recover and show that the variance is bounded by a
small constant independent of the network's size. For the class of
bounded-independence graphs (e.g. unit disc graphs) all containment metrics are
in O(1).
