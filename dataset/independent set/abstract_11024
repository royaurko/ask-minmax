We show two analytical solutions of the tachyon inflation for which the
spectrum of curvature (density) perturbations can be calculated exactly to
linear order, ignoring both gravity and the self-interactions of the tachyon
field . The main feature of these solutions is that the spectral indices are
independent with scale.
