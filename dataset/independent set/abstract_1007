Explicit expressions for restricted partition function $W(s,{\bf d}^m)$ and
its quasiperiodic components $W_j(s,{\bf d}^m)$ (called {\em Sylvester waves})
for a set of positive integers ${\bf d}^m = \{d_1, d_2, ..., d_m\}$ are
derived. The formulas are represented in a form of a finite sum over Bernoulli
and Euler polynomials of higher order with periodic coefficients. A novel
recursive relation for the Sylvester waves is established. Application to
counting algebraically independent homogeneous polynomial invariants of the
finite groups is discussed.
