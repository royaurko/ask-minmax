Many classification problems can be difficult to formulate directly in terms
of the traditional supervised setting, where both training and test samples are
individual feature vectors. There are cases in which samples are better
described by sets of feature vectors, that labels are only available for sets
rather than individual samples, or, if individual labels are available, that
these are not independent. To better deal with such problems, several
extensions of supervised learning have been proposed, where either training
and/or test objects are sets of feature vectors. However, having been proposed
rather independently of each other, their mutual similarities and differences
have hitherto not been mapped out. In this work, we provide an overview of such
learning scenarios, propose a taxonomy to illustrate the relationships between
them, and discuss directions for further research in these areas.
