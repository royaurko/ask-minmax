We present global structural parameter measurements of 109,533 unique,
H_F160W-selected objects from the CANDELS multi-cycle treasury program. Sersic
model fits for these objects are produced with GALFIT in all available
near-infrared filters (H_F160W, J_F125W and, for a subset, Y_F105W). The
parameters of the best-fitting Sersic models (total magnitude, half-light
radius, Sersic index, axis ratio, and position angle) are made public, along
with newly constructed point spread functions for each field and filter. Random
uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated for each individual
object based on a comparison between multiple, independent measurements of the
same set of objects. To quantify systematic uncertainties we create a mosaic
with simulated galaxy images with a realistic distribution of input parameters
and then process and analyze the mosaic in an identical manner as the real
data. We find that accurate and precise measurements -- to 10% or better -- of
all structural parameters can typically be obtained for galaxies with H_F160W <
23, with comparable fidelity for basic size and shape measurements for galaxies
to H_F160W ~ 24.5.
