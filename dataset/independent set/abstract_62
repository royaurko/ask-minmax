This paper describes a new feature set for use in the recognition of on-line
handwritten Devanagari script based on Fuzzy Directional Features. Experiments
are conducted for the automatic recognition of isolated handwritten character
primitives (sub-character units). Initially we describe the proposed feature
set, called the Fuzzy Directional Features (FDF) and then show how these
features can be effectively utilized for writer independent character
recognition. Experimental results show that FDF set perform well for writer
independent data set at stroke level recognition. The main contribution of this
paper is the introduction of a novel feature set and establish experimentally
its ability in recognition of handwritten Devanagari script.
