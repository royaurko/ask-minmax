By means of HFB calculations with independent constraints on axial neutron
and proton quadrupole moments Q_n and Q_p, we investigate the large amplitude
isoscalar and isovector deformation properties of the neutron-rich isotope 20O.
Using the particle-number and angular-momentum projected Generator Coordinate
Method, we analyze the collective dynamics in the {Q_n, Q_p} plane. The
parameterization SLy4 of the Skyrme interaction is used for all calculations in
connection with a density-dependent zero-range pairing interaction. Our results
show that already for this moderately neutron-rich nucleus the transition
moments are modified when independent neutron and proton collective dynamics
are allowed.
