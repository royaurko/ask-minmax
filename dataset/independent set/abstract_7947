The iterative random subdivision of rectangles is used as a generation model
of networks in physics, computer science, and urban planning. However, these
researches were independent. We consider some relations in them, and derive
fundamental properties for the average lifetime depending on birth-time and the
balanced distribution of rectangle faces.
