Let G be the product of an abelian variety and a torus defined over a number
field K. Let R_1,..., R_n be points in G(K). Let l be a rational prime and let
a_1,..., a_n be non-negative integers. Consider the set of primes p of K
satisfying the following condition: the l-adic valuation of the order of (R_i
mod p) equals a_i for every i=1,...,n. We show that this set has a natural
density and we characterize the n-tuples a_1,..., a_n for which the density is
positive. More generally, we study the l-part of the reduction of the points.
