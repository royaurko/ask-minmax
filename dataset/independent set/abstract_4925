Let $F_n = (F_{1,n}, ....,F_{d,n})$, $n\geq 1$, be a sequence of random
vectors such that, for every $j=1,...,d$, the random variable $F_{j,n}$ belongs
to a fixed Wiener chaos of a Gaussian field. We show that, as $n\to\infty$, the
components of $F_n$ are asymptotically independent if and only if ${\rm
Cov}(F_{i,n}^2,F_{j,n}^2)\to 0$ for every $i\neq j$. Our findings are based on
a novel inequality for vectors of multiple Wiener-It\^o integrals, and
represent a substantial refining of criteria for asymptotic independence in the
sense of moments recently established by Nourdin and Rosinski.
