The study of the properties of the scalar boson recently discovered at the
LHC (ATLAS and CMS experiments) may allow us to know whether it is well
described by the Standard Model. In the case where deviations from SM
predictions are present, this would be an evidence for the presence of new
physics. We focus on the study of the Higgs couplings to matter in a
model-independent approach by introducing a dimension-6 effective Lagrangian
that includes both CP-even and CP-odd effective couplings. Constraints are set
on some of these coefficients using experimental data from ATLAS and CMS as
well as electroweak precision measurements from LEP, SLC and Tevatron. These
data meaningfully constrain CP-even and some CP-odd couplings.
