We have constructed a modified BFT method that preserves the chain structure
of constraints. This method has two advantages: first, it leads to less number
of primary constraints such that the remaining constraints emerge
automatically; and second, it gives less number of independent gauge
parameters. We have applied the method for bosonized chiral Schwiger model. We
have constructed a gauge invariant embedded Lagrangian for this model.
