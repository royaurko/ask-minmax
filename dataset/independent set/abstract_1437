We present a model-independent method of quantifying galaxy evolution in
high-resolution images, which we apply to the Hubble Deep Field (HDF). Our
procedure is to k-correct all pixels belonging to the images of a complete set
of bright galaxies and then to replicate each galaxy image to higher redshift
by the product of its space density, 1/V_{max}, and the cosmological volume.
The set of bright galaxies is itself selected from the HDF, because presently
the HDF provides the highest quality UV images of a redshift-complete sample of
galaxies (31 galaxies with I<21.9, \bar{z}=0.5, and for which V/V_{max} is
spread fairly). These galaxies are bright enough to permit accurate
pixel-by-pixel k-corrections into the restframe UV (\sim 2000 A). We match the
shot noise, spatial sampling and PSF smoothing of the HDF data, resulting in
entirely empirical and parameter-free ``no-evolution'' deep fields of galaxies
for direct comparison with the HDF. In addition, the overcounting rate and the
level of incompleteness can be accurately quantified by this procedure. We
obtain the following results. Faint HDF galaxies (I>24) are much smaller, more
numerous, and less regular than our ``no-evolution'' extrapolation, for any
interesting geometry. A higher proportion of HDF galaxies ``dropout'' in both U
and B, indicating that some galaxies were brighter at higher redshifts than our
``cloned'' z\sim0.5 population.
