Consider a presentation $\mathcal{P}=<{\bf x}\mid{\bf \bigcup_{i=1}^n r_i}>$.
  Let ${\bf R_i}$ be the normal closure of the set ${\bf r_i}$ in the free
group ${\bf F}$ with basis ${\bf x}$, $\mathcal{P}_i=<{\bf x}\mid{\bf r_i}>$,
${\bf N_i} = \prod_{j\neq i}{\bf R_j}$. In the present article, using geometric
techniques of pictures, generators for $\frac{{\bf R_i}\cap {\bf N_i}}{[{\bf
R_i}, {\bf N_i}]}$, $i=1,...,n$, are obtained from a set of generators over
$\{\mathcal{P}_i\mid i=1,..., n\}$ for $\pi_2(\mathcal{P})$. As a corollary, we
get a sufficient condition for the family $\{{\bf R_1},...,{\bf R_n}\}$ to be
independent.
