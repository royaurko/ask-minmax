We present results for the b \bar b spectrum obtained using an
O(M_bv^6)-correct non-relativistic lattice QCD action. Propagators are
evaluated on SESAM's three sets of dynamical gauge configurations generated
with two flavours of Wilson fermions at beta = 5.6. Compared to a quenched
simulation at equivalent lattice spacing we find better agreement of our
dynamical data with experimental results in the spin-independent sector but
observe no unquenching effects in hyperfine-splittings. To pin down the
systematic errors we have also compared quenched results in different
``tadpole'' schemes and used a lower order action.
