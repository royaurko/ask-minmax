We report a full self-consistent ab initio calculation of the current-voltage
curve and the conductance of thiolate capped polyynes in contact with gold
electrodes. We find the conductance of polyynes an order of magnitude larger
compared with other conjugated oligomers. The reason lies in the position of
the Fermi level deep in the HOMO related resonance. With the conductance weakly
dependent on the applied bias and almost independent of the length of the
molecular chain, polyynes appear as nearly perfect molecular wires.
