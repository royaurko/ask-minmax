In the paper we give some criterions for a-minimally thin sets and a-rarefied
sets associated with the stationary Schr\"odinger operator at a fixed Martin
boundary point or {\infty} with respect to a cone. Moreover, we show that a
positive superfunction on a cone behaves regularly outside a-rarefied set.
Finally we illustrate the relation between a-minimally thin set and a-rarefied
set in a cone.
