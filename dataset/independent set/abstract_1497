We compare charge transitions on a deterministic single P donor in silicon
using radio frequency reflectometry measurements with a tunnel coupled
reservoir and DC charge sensing using a capacitively coupled single electron
transistor (SET). By measuring the conductance through the SET and comparing
this with the phase shift of the reflected RF excitation from the reservoir, we
can discriminate between charge transfer within the SET channel and tunneling
between the donor and reservoir. The RF measurement allows observation of donor
electron transitions at every charge degeneracy point in contrast to the SET
conductance signal where charge transitions are only observed at triple points.
The tunnel coupled reservoir has the advantage of a large effective lever arm
(~35%) allowing us to independently extract a neutral donor charging energy ~62
+/- 17meV. These results demonstrate that we can replace three terminal
transistors by a single terminal dispersive reservoir, promising for high
bandwidth scalable donor control and readout.
