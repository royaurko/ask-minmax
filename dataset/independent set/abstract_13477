In principle, the angular anisotropy in the extragalactic gamma-ray
background (EGRB) places severe constraints upon putative populations of
unresolved gamma-ray point sources. Existing estimates of the EGRB anisotropy
have been constructed by excising known point sources, e.g., taken from the
First or 2 Year Fermi-LAT Source Catalog (1FGL or 2FGL, respectively) and
statistically analyzing the residual gamma-ray sky maps. We perform an
independent check of the EGRB anisotropy limits by comparing the values
obtained from the 1FGL-masked sky maps to the signal implied by sources that
lie below the 1FGL detection threshold in the more-sensitive 2FGL and 1FHL
(First Fermi-LAT catalog of >10 GeV sources). Based upon this, we find evidence
for substantially larger anisotropies than those previously reported at
energies above 5 GeV, where BL Lacs are likely to provide the bulk of their
contribution to the EGRB. This uncertainty in the EGRB anisotropy cautions
against using it as an independent constraint for the high-redshift gamma-ray
Universe. Moreover, this would suggest that contrary to previous claims, smooth
extensions of the resolved point source population may be able to
simultaneously explain both the isotropic and anisotropic components of the
EGRB.
