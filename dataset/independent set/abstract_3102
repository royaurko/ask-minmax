Magnetic field observations of low-mass stars reveal an increase of magnetic
activity with increasing rotation rate. The so-called activity-rotation
relation is usually attributed to changes in the underlying dynamo processes
generating the magnetic field. We examine the dependence of the field strength
on rotation in global numerical dynamo models and interpret our results on the
basis of energy considerations. In agreement with the scaling law proposed by
Christensen & Aubert (2006), the field strength in our simulations is set by
the fraction of the available power used for the magnetic field generation.
This is controlled by the dynamo efficiency calculated as the ratio of Ohmic to
total dissipation in our models. The dynamo efficiency grows strongly with
increasing rotation rate at a Rossby number of 0.1 until it reaches its upper
bound of one and becomes independent of rotation. This gain in efficiency is
related to the strong rotational dependence of the mean electromotive force in
this parameter regime. For multipolar models at Rossby numbers clearly larger
than 0.1, on the other hand, we do not find a systematic dependence of the
field strength on rotation. Whether the enhancement of the dynamo efficiency
found in our dipolar models explains the observed activity-rotation relation
needs to be further assessed.
