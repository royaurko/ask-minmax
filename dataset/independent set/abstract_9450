We establish an exact formula for the average number of edges appearing on
the boundary of the global convex hull of n independent Brownian paths in the
plane. This requires the introduction of a counting criterion which amounts to
"cutting off" edges that are, in a specific sense, small. The main argument
consists in a mapping between planar Brownian convex hulls and configurations
of constrained, independent linear Brownian motions. This new formula is
confirmed by retrieving an existing exact result on the average perimeter of
the boundary of Brownian convex hulls in the plane.
