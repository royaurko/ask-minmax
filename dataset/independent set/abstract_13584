Wireless technology can provide many benefits to computing including faster
response to queries, reduced time spent on paperwork, increased online time for
users, just-in-time and real time control, tighter communications between
clients and hosts. Wireless Computing is governed by two general forces:
Technology, which provides a set of basic building blocks and User
Applications, which determine a set of operations that must be carried out
efficiently on demand. This paper summarizes technological changes that are
underway and describes their impact on wireless computing development and
implementation. It also describes the applications that influence the
development and implementation of wireless computing and shows what current
systems offer.
