We present a suite of programs to determine the ground state of the
time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, used in the simulation of
Bose-Einstein condensates. The calculation is based on the Optimal Damping
Algorithm, ensuring a fast convergence to the true ground state. Versions are
given for the one-, two-, and three-dimensional equation, using either a
spectral method, well suited for harmonic trapping potentials, or a spatial
grid.
