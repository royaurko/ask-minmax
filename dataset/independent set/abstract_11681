In one-component abelian sandpile models, the toppling probabilities are
independent quantities. This is not the case in multi-component models. The
condition of associativity of the underlying abelian algebras impose nonlinear
relations among the toppling probabilities. These relations are derived for the
case of two-component quadratic abelian algebras. We show that abelian sandpile
models with two conservation laws have only trivial avalanches.
