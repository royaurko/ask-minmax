We show how two-dimensional waveguide arrays can be used to probe the effect
of on-site interaction on Anderson localization of two interacting bosons in
one dimension. It is shown that classical light and linear elements are
sufficient to experimentally probe the interplay between interaction and
disorder in this setting. For experimental relevance, we evaluate the
participation ratio and the intensity correlation function as measures of
localization for two types of disorder (diagonal and off-diagonal), for two
types of interaction (repulsive and attractive), and for a variety of initial
input states. Employing a commonly used set of initial states, we show that the
effect of interaction on Anderson localization is strongly dependent on the
type of disorder and initial conditions, but is independent of whether the
interaction is repulsive or attractive. We then analyze a certain type of
entangled input state where the type of interaction is relevant and discuss how
it can be naturally implemented in waveguide arrays. We conclude by laying out
the details of the two-dimensional photonic lattice implementation including
the required parameter regime.
