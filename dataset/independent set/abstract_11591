A microscopic mean-field description of heavy ions fusion is performed in the
framework of the Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory using a Skyrme
interaction with the SLy4d parametrization. A good agreement with experiments
is obtained on the position of the fusion barriers for various total masses,
mass asymmetries and deformations. The excitation function of the 16O+208Pb is
overestimated by about 16% above the barrier. The restriction to an independent
particles state in the mean-field dynamics prevents the description of
sub-barrier fusion. Effect of transfer on fusion is discussed.
