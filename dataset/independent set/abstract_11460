We investigate Theta^+ production via photon and nucleon induced reactions.
We observe that the positive parity Theta^+ production provides about ten times
larger total cross sections than those of the negative parity one in both
photon and nucleon induced reactions due to P-wave enhancement of the K-N-Theta
vertex. We also consider the model independent method in the nucleon induced
reaction to determine the parity of Theta^+ and show clearly distinguishable
signals for the two parities.
