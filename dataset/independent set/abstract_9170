We study s-wave scattering of a hadron and a Nambu-Goldstone boson induced by
the model-independent low energy interaction in the flavor SU(3) symmetric
limit. Establishing the general structure of the low energy interaction based
on group theoretical arguments, we find that the interaction in the exotic
channels are in most cases repulsive, and that for possible attractive channels
the interaction strengths are weak and uniquely given independent of channel.
Solving the scattering problem with this interaction, we show that the
attraction in the exotic channels is not strong enough to generate a bound
state from the physically known target hadrons. We also find that there are no
attractive interaction in the exotic channels in large Nc limit.
