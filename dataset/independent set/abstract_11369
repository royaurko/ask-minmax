We prove the ionization conjecture within the Hartree-Fock theory of atoms.
More precisely, we prove that, if the nuclear charge is allowed to tend to
infinity, the maximal negative ionization charge and the ionization energy of
atoms nevertheless remain bounded. Moreover, we show that in Hartree-Fock
theory the radius of an atom (properly defined) is bounded independently of its
nuclear charge.
