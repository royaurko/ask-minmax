Relatively independent joinings of W*-dynamical systems are constructed. This
is intimately related to subsystems of W*-dynamical systems, and therefore we
also study general properties of subsystems, in particular fixed point
subsystems and compact subsystems. This allows us to obtain characterizations
of weak mixing and relative ergodicity, as well as of certain compact
subsystems, in terms of joinings.
