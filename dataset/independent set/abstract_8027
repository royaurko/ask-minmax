Consider complex semisimple Lie algebras of a given dimension specified by
their structure constants. We describe a finite collection of rational
functions in the structure constants that form a complete set of invariants:
two sets of structure constants determine isomorphic algebras if and only if
each of these rational functions has the same value on the two sets. This
collection is indexed by all chord diagrams with the number of chords being
bounded by a function of the dimension.
