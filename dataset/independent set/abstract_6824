If and only if each point of a set of the phase-space is in the topological
hull of a trajectory running through any other point of this set, we call this
set a quasiergodic set. But which are these so defined quasiergodic sets in the
case of a given continuous dynamical system, which has piecewise differentiable
trajectories in a finit-dimensional real phase-space, which is compact? Let its
trajectories define a field of normed tangents, which is continuous in almost
each point of the phase-space: Then the topological hulls of all trajectories
of the phase-space form a partition of it. Thus the elements of this partition
are the quasiergodic sets of the given continuous dynamical system. This is the
important but rather trivial statement of the elementary theorem 1.1, which we
present in this tractatus. We call this theorem elementary, because it is
limited to finit-dimensional real phase-spaces. We also find, that there is a
linear homogeneous partial differential equation of first order, describing the
invariants of the system, which allow us the construction of the quasiergodic
sets. Furthermore we show, that any quasiergodic set is a sensitive attractor,
if it is neither a closed trajectory or a fixed point.
