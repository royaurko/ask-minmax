Let G be a connected, complex reductive Lie group with maximal compact
subgroup K, and let X denote the moduli space of G- or K-valued representations
of a rank r free group. Recent work of Biswas and Lawton determined the
fundamental group of X, and we describe the fundamental group of the subspace Y
of irreducible representations. As an application, we obtain results about
centralizers of subgroups of G and K, motivated by a question of Sikora.
Additionally, we use work of Richardson to solve a conjecture of
Florentino--Lawton about the singular locus of X.
  Specializing to the case G = GL(n,C), we explicitly compute the homotopy
groups of the smooth locus of X, which equals Y in this case, in a large range
of dimensions, finding that they exhibit Bott Periodicity. We then show that
the inclusion of Y into X is a 2-connected map, and deduce that the second
homotopy group of X is trivial. Lastly, we give a topological proof that X is
not a rational Poincar\'e Duality Space for r>3 and n=2.
  Several of these results depend on a general position-type argument in a
singular setting. This result is proven in the Appendix and may be of
independent interest.
