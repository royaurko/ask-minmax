In this paper we consider a transformation which converts uncorrelated
networks to correlated ones(here by correlation we mean that coordination
numbers of two neighbors are not independent). We show that this
transformation, which converts edges to nodes and connects them according to a
deterministic rule, nearly preserves the degree distribution of the network and
significantly increases the clustering coefficient. This transformation also
enables us to relate percolation properties of the two networks.
