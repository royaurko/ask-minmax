Several measures for the density of sets of integers have been proposed, such
as the asymptotic density, the Schnirelmann density, and the Dirichlet density.
There has been some work in the literature on extending some of these concepts
of density to higher dimensional sets of integers. In this work, we propose an
extension of the Dirichlet density for sets of Gaussian integers and
investigate some of its properties.
