This paper describes the incorporation of uncertainty in diagnostic reasoning
based on the set covering model of Reggia et. al. extended to what in the
Artificial Intelligence dichotomy between deep and compiled (shallow, surface)
knowledge based diagnosis may be viewed as the generic form at the compiled end
of the spectrum. A major undercurrent in this is advocating the need for a
strong underlying model and an integrated set of support tools for carrying
such a model in order to deal with uncertainty.
