The ESA Packet Telemetry and Telecommand Standards accommodate the
requirements of a great variety of scientific space missions, thus providing a
standard basis for cost-effective and technically compatible developments of
on-board and on-ground data handling systems for a wide range of projects. This
paper describes the design and the implementation of a detector-independent
software, running on Unix platforms, which has been developed for the near real
time acquisition, archiving, and basic processing of the ESA based telemetry
and telecommand data produced during the on ground testing and calibration of
various X- and $\gamma$-ray space borne detectors.
