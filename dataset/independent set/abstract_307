New versions of the set-valued average value at risk for multivariate risks
are introduced by generalizing the well-known certainty equivalent
representation to the set-valued case. The first "regulator" version is
independent from any market model whereas the second version, called the market
extension, takes trading opportunities into account. Essential properties of
both versions are proven and an algorithmic approach is provided which admits
to compute the values of both version over finite probability spaces. Several
examples illustrate various features of the theoretical constructions.
