We review and clarify some cases of geometrical CP violation, the framework
of spontaneous CP violation through complex phases with values that are
independent of parameters of the potential. We present a flavour model based on
Delta(27) featuring spontaneous CP violation, that can reproduce all quark
masses and mixing data. The scalar sector of the model has exotic properties
that can be tested at the LHC.
