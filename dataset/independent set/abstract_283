We construct a "hyperparameter matrix" statistical method for performing the
joint analyses of multiple correlated astronomical data sets, in which the
weights of data sets are determined by their own statistical properties. This
method is a generalization of the hyperparameter method constructed by Lahav et
al. (2000) and Hobson, Bridle, & Lahav (2002) which was designed to combine
independent data sets. The advantage of our method is to treat correlations
between multiple data sets and gives appropriate relevant weights of multiple
data sets with mutual correlations. We define a new "element-wise" product,
which greatly simplifies the likelihood function with hyperparameter matrix. We
rigorously prove the simplified formula of the joint likelihood and show that
it recovers the original hyperparameter method in the limit of no covariance
between data sets. We then illustrate the method by applying it to a
demonstrative toy model of fitting a straight line to two sets of data. We show
that the hyperparameter matrix method can detect unaccounted systematic errors
or underestimated errors in the data sets. Additionally, the ratio of Bayes'
factors provides a distinct indicator of the necessity of including
hyperparameters. Our example shows that the likelihood we construct for joint
analyses of correlated data sets can be widely applied to many astrophysical
systems.
