The multiplicative Newton-like method developed by the contributor et al. is
extended to the situation where the dynamics is restricted to the orthogonal
group. A general framework is constructed without specifying the cost function.
Though the restriction to the orthogonal groups makes the problem somewhat
complicated, an explicit expression for the amount of individual jumps is
obtained. This algorithm is exactly second-order-convergent. The global
instability inherent in the Newton method is remedied by a
Levenberg-Marquardt-type variation. The method thus constructed can readily be
applied to the independent component analysis. Its remarkable performance is
illustrated by a numerical simulation.
