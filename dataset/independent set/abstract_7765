Stability, reactivity and aromaticity of clusters of various noble gas atoms
trapped in aromatic H3+ and Li3+ rings are studied at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d) and
MP2/6-311+G(d) levels of theory. Electrophilicity, gain in energy and nucleus
independent chemical shift values lend additional insights into the overall
behavior of these clusters.
