A set S of vertices is independent in a graph G if no two vertices from S are
adjacent, and alpha(G) is the cardinality of a maximum independent set of G.
  G is called a Konig-Egervary graph if its order equals alpha(G)+mu(G), where
mu(G) denotes the size of a maximum matching. By core(G) we mean the
intersection of all maximum independent sets of G.
  To decide whether core(G) is empty is known to be NP-hard.
  In this paper, we present some polynomial time algorithms finding core(G) of
a Konig-Egervary graph G.
