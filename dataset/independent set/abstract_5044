Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model used to investigate low energy phenomena is
nonrenormalizable, therefore the results depend on the regularization parameter
in general. A possibility of the finite in four-dimensional limit and even the
regularization parameter (this is dimension in the dimensional regularization
scheme) independent analysis is shown in the leading order of the 1/Nc
expansion.
