In this paper, we show that a small minimal k-blocking set in PG(n, q3), q =
p^h, h >= 1, p prime, p >=7, intersecting every (n-k)-space in 1 (mod q)
points, is linear. As a corollary, this result shows that all small minimal
k-blocking sets in PG(n, p^3), p prime, p >=7, are Fp-linear, proving the
linearity conjecture (see [7]) in the case PG(n, p3), p prime, p >= 7.
