We present simple, concrete, two-fermion models that exhibit
thermodynamically stable isotropic translationally-invariant gapless superfluid
states (breached pair superfluidity). The mass ratio between the components and
the momentum structure of the interaction are crucial for determining the
stability of such states: Idealized, momentum-independent (``contact'')
interactions are insufficient.
