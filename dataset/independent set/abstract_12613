Three-dimensional (3D) Faddeev integral equations are solved for three-body
(3B) bound state problem without using the partial wave (PW) form of low
momentum two-body (2B) interaction $V_{low-k}$ which is constructed from spin
independent Malfliet-Tjon V (MT-V) potential. The dependence of 3B binding
energy on the cutoff momentum of $V_{low-k}$ is investigated for a wide range
of $\Lambda$ from $1.0$ to $7.0\, fm^{-1}$. The properties of Faddeev
components and 3B wave function are displayed and the effect of number of grid
points for momentum and angle variables on the accuracy and the stability of
numerical results is studied by calculation of the expectation value of total
Hamiltonian.
