The XXZ open spin chain with general integrable boundary conditions is shown
to possess a q-deformed analogue of the Onsager's algebra as fundamental
non-abelian symmetry which ensures the integrability of the model. This
symmetry implies the existence of a finite set of independent mutually
commuting nonlocal operators which form an abelian subalgebra. The transfer
matrix and local conserved quantities, for instance the Hamiltonian, are
expressed in terms of these nonlocal operators. It follows that Onsager's
original approach of the planar Ising model can be extended to the XXZ open
spin chain.
