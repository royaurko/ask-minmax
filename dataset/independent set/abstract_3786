Most of the known models describing the fundamental interactions have a gauge
freedom. In the standard path integral, it is necessary to "fix the gauge" in
order to avoid integrating over unphysical degrees of freedom. Gauge
independence might then become a tricky issue, especially when the structure of
the gauge symmetries is intricate. In the modern approach to this question, it
is BRST invariance that effectively implements gauge invariance. This set of
lectures briefly reviews some key ideas underlying the BRST-antifield
formalism, which yields a systematic procedure to path-integrate any type of
gauge system, while (usually) manifestly preserving spacetime covariance. The
quantized theory possesses a global invariance under the so-called BRST
transformation, which is nilpotent of order two. The cohomology of the BRST
differential is the central element that controls the physics. Its relationship
with the observables is sketched and explained. How anomalies appear in the
"quantum master equation" of the antifield formalism is also discussed. These
notes are based on lectures given by MH at the 10th Saalburg Summer School on
Modern Theoretical Methods from the 30th of August to the 10th of September,
2004 in Wolfersdorf, Germany and were prepared by AF and AM. The exercises
which were discussed at the school are also included.
