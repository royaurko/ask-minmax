The equations of motion of a secularly precessing ellipse are developed using
time as the independent variable. The equations are useful when integrating
numerically the perturbations about a reference trajectory which is subject to
secular perturbations in the node, the argument of pericenter and the mean
motion. Usually this is done in connection with Encke's method to ensure
minimal rectification frequency. Similar equations are already available in the
literature, but they are either given based on the true anomaly as the
independent variable, or in mixed mode with respect to the time through the use
of a supporting equation to track the anomaly. The equations developed here
form a complete and independent set of six equations in the time.
Reformulations both of Escobal's and Kyner and Bennett's equations are also
provided which lead to a more concise form.
