We separate the $AF$-algebras (correspondingly action of the countable groups
on Cantor sets) onto two classes ---- "completely smooth" for which the set of
all indecomposable traces (correspondingly list of all invariant ergodic
measures) has nice parametrization, and the second class --- "completely
non-smooth" for which the set of all traces (correspondingly set of all
invariant measures) is Poulsen simplex and therefore there is no suitable
parametrization of indecomposable traces, (ergodic measures) e.g.Choquet
boundary.
  Important example of the first type of $AF$-algebra is group algebra of
infinite symmetric group, and of the second type
  --- group algebra of some locally finite solvable group. The questions of
recognition of those cases are closely related to the orbit theory of dynamical
systems and theory of filtrations of sigma-fields in measure spaces and Borel
spaces.
