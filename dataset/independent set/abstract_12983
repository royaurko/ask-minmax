Drag force law acting on a moving circular disk in a two-dimensional granular
medium is analyzed based on the discrete element method (DEM). It is remarkable
that the drag force on the moving disk in moderate dense and pure
two-dimensional granular medium can be well reproduced by a perfect fluid with
separation from the boundary. A yield force, being independent of the moving
speed of the disk, appears if a dry friction between the granular disks and the
bottom plate exists. The perfect fluidity is violated in this case. The yield
force and the drag force diverge at the jamming point.
