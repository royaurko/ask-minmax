Upper bounds for the violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) by the
Fundamental Interactions have been given before. We now recompute the limits on
the parameters measuring the strength of the violation with the whole set of
high accuracy E\"{o}tv\"{o}s experiments. Besides, limits on spatial variation
of the Fundamental Constants \alpha, Weinberg angle \theta, and v, the vacuum
expectation value of the Higgs field, are found in a model independent way.
Limits on other parameters in the gauge sector are also found from the
strucutre of the Standard Model.
