Let $G$ be a finite group acting on vector spaces $V$ and $W$ and consider a
smooth $G$-equivariant mapping $f:V\to W$. This paper addresses the question of
the zero set near a zero $x$ of $f$ with isotropy subgroup $G$. It is known
from results of Bierstone and Field on $G$-transversality theory that the zero
set in a neighborhood of $x$ is a stratified set. The purpose of this paper is
to partially determine the structure of the stratified set near $x$ using only
information from the representations $V$ and $W$. We define an index
$s(\Sigma)$ for isotropy subgroups $\Sigma$ of $G$ which is the difference of
the dimension of the fixed point subspace of $\Sigma$ in $V$ and $W$. Our main
result states that if $V$ contains a subspace $G$-isomorphic to $W$, then for
every maximal isotropy subgroup $\Sigma$ satisfying $s(\Sigma)>s(G)$, the zero
set of $f$ near $x$ contains a smooth manifold of zeros with isotropy subgroup
$\Sigma$ of dimension $s(\Sigma)$. We also present a systematic method to study
the zero sets for group representations $V$ and $W$ which do not satisfy the
conditions of our main theorem. The paper contains many examples and raises
several questions concerning the computation of zero sets of equivariant maps.
These results have application to the bifurcation theory of $G$-reversible
equivariant vector fields.
