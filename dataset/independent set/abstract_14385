In this paper we prove an Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado-type theorem for intersecting
sets of permutations. We show that an intersecting set of maximal size in the
projective general linear group PGL(3,q), in its natural action on the points
of the projective line, is either a coset of the stabilizer of a point or a
coset of the stabilizer of a line.
