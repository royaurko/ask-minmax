We examine the validity of the 1-loop approximation to the effective
potential at finite temperatures and present a simple test for its reliability.
As an application we study the standard electroweak potential, showing that for
a Higgs mass above 70 GeV, and afirly independent of the top mass (with $m_{t}
> 90 GeV$, the 1-loop approximation is no longer valid for temperatures in the
neighborhood of the critical temperature.
