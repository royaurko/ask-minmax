We study the boundary correspondence under $\mu$-homeomorphisms $f$ of the
open upper half-plane onto itself. Sufficient conditions are given for $f$ to
admit a homeomorphic extension to the closed half-plane with prescribed
boundary regularity. The proofs are based on the modulus estimates for
semiannuli in terms of directional dilatations of $f$ which might be of
independent interest.
