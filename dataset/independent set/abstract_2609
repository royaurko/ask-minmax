In the Randall-Sundrum model, setting the ratio of up and down quark masses
$m_u/m_d << 1$, relevant to the strong CP problem, does not require chiral
symmetry or fine-tuning, due to exponential bulk fermion profiles. We point out
that such geometric suppression of the mass of a fermion magnifies the masses
of its corresponding Kaluza-Klein (KK) states. In this sense, these KK states
act as "microscopes" for probing light quark and lepton masses. In simple
realizations, this hypothesis can be testable at future colliders, like the
LHC, by measuring the spectrum of level-1 KK fermions. The microscope can then
provide an experimental test for the vanishing of $m_u$ in the ultraviolet,
independently of non-perturbative determinations, by lattice simulations or
other means, at hadronic scales. We also briefly comment on application of our
microscope idea to other fermions, such as the electron and neutrinos.
