We propose two methods for obtaining the dual of non-linear relativity as
previously formulated in momentum space. In the first we allow for the (dual)
position space to acquire a non-linear representation of the Lorentz group
independently of the chosen representation in momentum space. This requires a
non-linear definition for the invariant contraction between momentum and
position spaces. The second approach, instead, respects the linearity of the
invariant contraction. This fully fixes the dual of momentum space and dictates
a set of energy-dependent space-time Lorentz transformations. We discuss a
variety of physical implications that would distinguish these two strategies.
We also show how they point to two rather distinct formulations of theories of
gravity with an invariant energy and/or length scale.
