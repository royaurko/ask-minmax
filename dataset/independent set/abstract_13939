We tackle the issue of representing infinite sets of real- valued vectors.
This paper introduces an operator for combining integer and real sets. Using
this operator, we decompose three well-known logics extending Presburger with
reals. Our decomposition splits a logic into two parts : one integer, and one
decimal (i.e. on the interval [0,1]). We also give a basis for an
implementation of our representation.
