Matsumoto, Saito, and Matoba recently proposed the Walsh figure of merit
(WAFOM), which is a computable criterion of quasi-Monte Carlo point sets
constructed by digital nets. Matsumoto et al. also showed that the
computational complexity is reduced for a special subclass of digital nets, and
obtained concrete examples of low-WAFOM point sets by random search. In their
framework, the number of points is fixed in advance, but extensible point sets
are preferred for some applications. In this paper, we propose a heuristic
search algorithm for extensible low-WAFOM point sets based on general digital
nets and random search. For this, we alternatively propose a method using
lookup tables to compute WAFOM faster. Numerical results show that the obtained
WAFOM-based point sets are competitive with Niederreiter--Xing points for some
low-dimensional and smooth test functions.
