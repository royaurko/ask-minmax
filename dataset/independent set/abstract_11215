We calculate tree level three and four point scattering amplitudes in type II
string models with matter fields localized at the intersections of D-brane
wrapping cycles. The analysis of the three point amplitude is performed in the
context of Yukawa couplings and it is seen that a natural mechanism for the
generation of a mass hierarchy arises. The four point amplitude for fermions at
the intersection of four independent stacks of D-branes is then determined.
