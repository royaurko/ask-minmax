Two varieties $V, W$ of the same type are independent if there is a binary
term $t(x,y)$ such that $V \models t(x,y) \approx x$ and $W \models t(x,y)
\approx y$. In this note, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for two
finite algebras with a Mal'cev term (or, more generally, with an edge term) to
generate independent varieties. In particular we show that the independence of
finitely generated varieties with edge term can be decided by a polynomial time
algorithm.
