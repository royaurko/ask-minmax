We discuss the origin of "focus points" in the scalar mass RGEs of the MSSM
and their implications for collider searches. We present a new exact analytic
solution to the homogeneous system of scalar mass RGEs in the MSSM for general
$\tan\beta$. This is then used to prove that the focus point for $m^2_{H_u}$
depends only on the value of the top Yukawa coupling at the {\em weak} scale
(not its value at the GUT scale) and is independent of the bottom Yukawa
coupling.
