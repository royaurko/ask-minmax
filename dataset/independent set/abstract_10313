We introduce the concepts of adiabatic (curvature) and isocurvature (entropy)
cosmological perturbations and present their relevance for parameter estimation
from cosmic microwave background anisotropies data. We emphasize that, while
present-day data are in excellent agreement with pure adiabaticity, subdominant
isocurvature contributions cannot be ruled out. We discuss model independent
constraints on the isocurvature contribution. Finally, we argue that the Planck
satellite will be able to do precision cosmology even if the assumption of
adiabaticity is relaxed.
