We introduce a new category of higher-dimensional automata in which the
morphisms are functional homotopy simulations, i.e. functional simulations up
to concurrency of independent events. For this, we use unfoldings of
higher-dimensional automata into higher-dimensional trees. Using a notion of
open maps in this category, we define homotopy bisimilarity. We show that
homotopy bisimilarity is equivalent to a straight-forward generalization of
standard bisimilarity to higher dimensions, and that it is finer than split
bisimilarity and incomparable with history-preserving bisimilarity.
