The physical conditions of the Galactic center (GC) clouds moving with
non-circular velocities are not well-known. We have studied the physical
conditions of these clouds with the aim of better understanding the origin of
the outstanding physical conditions of the GC molecular gas and the possible
effect of the large scale dynamics on these physical conditions.Using published
CO(1-0) data, we have selected a set of clouds belonging to all the kinematical
components seen in the longitude-velocity diagram of the GC. We have done a
survey of dense gas in all the components using the J=2-1 lines of CS and SiO
as tracers of high density gas and shock chemistry. We have detected CS and SiO
emission in all the kinematical components. The gas density and the SiO
abundance of the clouds in non-circular orbits are similar those in the nuclear
ring (GCR). Therefore, in all the kinematical components there are dense clouds
that can withstand the tidal shear. However, there is no evidence of star
formation outside the GCR. The high relative velocity and shear expected in the
dust-lanes along the bar major axis could inhibit the star formation process,
as observed in other galaxies. The high SiO abundances derived in the
non-circular velocity clouds are likely due to the large-scale shocks that
created the dust lanes
