Modern state-of-the-art techniques allow us to explore the magnetic and
electronic structures of cuprates throughout the whole phase diagram, which
defines the central questions on their emergent high temperature
superconductivity. However, a simplified and unified description of the order
parameters in these colorful phases together with their complex relations is
still undetermined. Here we establish this phase diagram and the related
structures based on recent experimental progresses with emphasizing several
essential equations, and we try to understand them under the framework of
antiferromagnetic (AF) correlation using the simplest mathematics. This model
independent description of cuprates phase diagram gives both clues and
constraints to a final microscopic theory of the cuprates superconductivity.
