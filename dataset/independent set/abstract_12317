We compare the Wronskian method (WM) and the Schr\"odinger eigenvalue march
or canonical function method (SEM--CFM) for the calculation of the energies and
eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger equation. The Wronskians between linearly
independent solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation provide a rigorous basis
for some of the assumptions of the SEM-CFM, like, for example, the concept of
"saturation". We compare the performance of both approaches on a simple
one-dimensional model and suggest that taking into account the asymptotic
behaviour of the wavefunction (as is already done in the WM) may make the
SEM-CFM more efficient from a numerical point of view.
