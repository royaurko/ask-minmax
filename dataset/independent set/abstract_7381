Let $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be the unique attractor of an iterated function
system. We consider the case where $K$ is an interval and study those elements
of $K$ with a unique coding. We prove under mild conditions that the set of
points with a unique coding can be identified with a subshift of finite type.
As a consequence of this, we can show that the set of points with a unique
coding is a graph-directed self-similar set in the sense of Mauldin and
Williams \cite{MW}. The theory of Mauldin and Williams then provides a method
by which we can explicitly calculate the Hausdorff dimension of this set. Our
algorithm can be applied generically, and our result generalises the work of
\cite{DKK}, \cite{K1}, \cite{K2}, and \cite{MK}.
