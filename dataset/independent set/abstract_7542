The thermodynamical potential of relativistic gauge theories can be
consistently resummed in terms of HTL propagators, which is, without being
restricted to it, exemplified for the case of hot QED. The nonperturbative
resummation is gauge independent, free of thermal divergences and, in the
weak-coupling limit, compatible with the leading order perturbative result.
