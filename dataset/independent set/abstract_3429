Persistent homology is a method used in topological data analysis to study
qualitative features of data. It is robust to perturbations, independent of
dimensions and scale, and provides a compact representation of the outputs. The
computation of persistent homology, despite recent progress, remains a wide
open area with numerous important and fascinating challenges. We investigate
the challenges of computing persistent homology, and we navigate the various
algorithms that can be used for it. Specifically, we evaluate the (currently
available) open-source implementations of persistent-homology computations on a
range of synthetic and real-world data sets, and we indicate which algorithms
and implementations are best suited to these data. We provide guidelines for
the computation of persistent homology, make our own implementations used in
this study available to the public, and suggest measures to quantify the
challenges of the computation of persistent homology.
