Using a generalization of extended self-similarity we have studied local
scaling properties of 3D turbulence in a direct numerical simulation. We have
found that these properties are consistent with lognormal-like behavior of
energy dissipation fluctuations with moderate amplitudes for space scales $r$
beginning from Kolmogorov length $\eta$ up to the largest scales, and in the
whole range of the Reynolds numbers: $50 \leq R_{\lambda} \leq 459$. The
locally determined intermittency exponent $\mu(r)$ varies with $r$; it has a
maximum at scale $r=14 \eta$, independent of $R_{\lambda}$.
