Relying on the Luttinger-Ward theorem we derive a thermodynamically
selfconsistent and scale independent approximation of the thermodynamic
potential for the scalar $\phi^4$ theory in the tadpole approximation. The
resulting thermodynamic potential as a function of the temperature is similar
to the one of the recently proposed screened perturbation theory.
