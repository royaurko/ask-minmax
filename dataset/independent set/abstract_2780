We apply a model-independent, agnostic approach to the collider phenomenology
of supersymmetry (SUSY), in which all mass parameters are taken as free inputs
at the weak scale. We consider the gauginos, higgsinos, and the first two
generations of sleptons and squarks, and analyze all possible mass hierarchies
among them ($4\times 8!=161,280$ in total) in which the lightest superpartner
is neutral, leading to missing energy. In each case, we identify the full set
of the dominant (i.e. least suppressed by phase space, small mixing angles or
Yukawa couplings) decay chains originating from the lightest colored
superpartner. Our exhaustive search reveals several quite dramatic yet
unexplored multilepton signatures with up to 8 isolated leptons (plus possibly
up to 2 massive gauge or Higgs bosons) in the final state. Such events are
spectacular, background-free for all practical purposes, and may lead to a
discovery of SUSY in the very early stage ($\sim 10\ {\rm pb}^{-1}$) of LHC
operations at 7 TeV.
