We consider pion electroproduction close to threshold for $Q^2$ in the region
1-10 GeV$^2$ on a nucleon target. The momentum transfer dependence of the
S-wave multipoles at threshold, $E_{0+}$ and $L_{0+}$, is calculated in the
chiral limit using light-cone sum rules. Predictions for the cross sections in
the threshold region are given taking into account P-wave contributions that,
as we argue, are model independent to a large extent. The results are compared
with the SLAC E136 data on the structure function $F_2(W,Q^2)$ in the threshold
region.
