Acyclic directed mixed graphs, also known as semi-Markov models represent the
conditional independence structure induced on an observed margin by a DAG model
with latent variables. In this paper we present a factorization criterion for
these models that is equivalent to the global Markov property given by (the
natural extension of) d-separation.
