We study the Brownian force model (BFM), a solvable model of avalanche
statistics for an interface, in a general discrete setting. The BFM describes
the overdamped motion of elastically coupled particles driven by a parabolic
well in independent Brownian force landscapes. Avalanches are defined as the
collective jump of the particles in response to an arbitrary monotonous change
in the well position (i.e. in the applied force). We derive an exact formula
for the joint probability distribution of these jumps. From it we obtain the
joint density of local avalanche sizes for stationary driving in the
quasi-static limit near the depinning threshold. A saddle-point analysis
predicts the spatial shape of avalanches in the limit of large aspect ratios
for the continuum version of the model. We then study fluctuations around this
saddle point, and obtain the leading corrections to the mean shape, the
fluctuations around the mean shape and the shape asymmetry, for finite aspect
ratios. Our results are finally confronted to numerical simulations.
