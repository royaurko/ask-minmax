In this short pedagogical presentation, we introduce the spin groups and the
spinors from the point of view of group theory. We also present, independently,
the construction of the low dimensional Clifford algebras. And we establish the
link between the two approaches. Finally, we give some notions of the
generalisations to arbitrary spacetimes, by the introduction of the spin and
spinor bundles.
