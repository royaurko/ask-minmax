Analytical solutions to the time-dependent Shr\"{o}dinger equation in one
dimension are developed for time-independent potentials, one consisting of an
infinite wall and a repulsive delta function. An exact solution is obtained by
means of a convolution of time-independent solutions spanning the given Hilbert
space with appropriately chosen spectral functions. Square-integrability and
the boundary conditions are satisfied. The probability for the particle to be
found inside the potential well is calculated and shown to exhibit
non-exponential decay decreasing at large times as $t^{-3}$. The result is
generalized for all square-integrable solutions to this problem.
