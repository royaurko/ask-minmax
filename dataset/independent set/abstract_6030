It was recently proposed that all flavor mixing has a single source, namely
the mixing of the three quark and lepton families with "extra" vectorlike
fermions in 5 + 5-bar multiplets of SU(5). This was shown to lead to several
testable predictions including neutrino masses and CP-violating phases. Here it
is shown that the mixing angles within grand unified fermion multiplets are
also predicted. Proton decay branching ratios would thus give several
independent tests of the model. Certain model parameters could be determined
independently from the quark and lepton spectrum and from proton decay.
