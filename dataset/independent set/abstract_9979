We show that if DTIME[2^O(n)] is not included in DSPACE[2^o(n)], then, for
every set B in PSPACE/poly, all strings x in B of length n can be represented
by a string compressed(x) of length at most log(|B^{=n}|)+O(log n), such that a
polynomial-time algorithm, given compressed(x), can distinguish x from all the
other strings in B^{=n}. Modulo the O(log n) additive term, this achieves the
information-theoretic optimum for string compression. We also observe that
optimal compression is not possible for sets more complex than PSPACE/poly
because for any time-constructible superpolynomial function t, there is a set A
computable in space t(n) such that at least one string x of length n requires
compressed(x) to be of length 2 log(|A^=n|).
