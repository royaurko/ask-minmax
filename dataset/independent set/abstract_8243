The rigid relation principle, introduced in this article, asserts that every
set admits a rigid binary relation. This follows from the axiom of choice,
because well-orders are rigid, but we prove that it is neither equivalent to
the axiom of choice nor provable in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the
axiom of choice. Thus, it is a new weak choice principle. Nevertheless, the
restriction of the principle to sets of reals (among other general instances)
is provable without the axiom of choice.
