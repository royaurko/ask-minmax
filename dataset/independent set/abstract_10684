Yang-Mills color fields evolve chaotically in an anisotropically expanding
universe. The chaotic behaviour differs from that found in anisotropic
Mixmaster universes. The universe isotropizes at late times, approaching the
mean expansion rate of a radiation-dominated universe. However, small chaotic
oscillations of the shear and color stresses continue indefinitely. An
invariant, coordinate-independent characterisation of the chaos is provided by
means of fractal basin boundaries.
