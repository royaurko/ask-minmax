We extend the Wald cosmic no-hair theorem to a general class of scalar-tensor
nonminimally coupled theories of gravity where ordinary matter is also present
in the form of a perfect fluid. We give a set of conditions for obtaining a de
Sitter expansion independently of any initial conditions, generalizing the
treatment of such a problem as given by Wald. Finally we apply the results to
some specific models.
