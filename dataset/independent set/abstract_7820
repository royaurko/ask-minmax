The dissipative harmonic oscillator has two representations. In the first
representation the central oscillator couples with its position to an
oscillator bath. In the second one it couples with its momentum to the bath.
Both representations are related by a unitary transformation. If the central
oscillator couples with its position and momentum to two independent baths, no
such unitary transformation exists. We discuss two possible models of this type
and their physical relevance.
