We present specific heat measurements on a series of BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 single
crystals with phosphorous doping ranging from x = 0.3 to 0.55. Our results
reveal that BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 follows the scaling Delta_C/Tc ~ Tc^2 remarkably
well. The clean-limit nature of this material imposes new restraints on
theories aimed at explaining the scaling. Furthermore, we find that the
Ginzburg-Landau parameter decreases significantly with doping whereas the
superconducting anisotropy is gamma~2.6, independent of doping.
