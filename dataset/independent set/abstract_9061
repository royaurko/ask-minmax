We have measured the mechanical loss of a dielectric multilayer reflective
coating (ion-beam sputtered SiO$_2$ and Ta$_2$O$_5$) in cooled mirrors. The
loss was nearly independent of the temperature (4 K $\sim$ 300 K), frequency,
optical loss, and stress caused by the coating, and the details of the
manufacturing processes. The loss angle was $(4 \sim 6) \times 10^{-4}$. The
temperature independence of this loss implies that the amplitude of the coating
thermal noise, which is a severe limit in any precise measurement, is
proportional to the square root of the temperature. Sapphire mirrors at 20 K
satisfy the requirement concerning the thermal noise of even future
interferometric gravitational wave detector projects on the ground, for
example, LCGT.
