In this paper we extend our investigations on noise-assisted storage devices
through the experimental study of a loop composed of a single Schmitt trigger
and an element that introduces a finite delay. We show that such a system
allows the storage of several bits and does so more efficiently for an
intermediate range of noise intensities. Finally, we study the probability of
erroneous information retrieval as a function of elapsed time and show a way
for predicting device performance independently of the number of stored bits.
