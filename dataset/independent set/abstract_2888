Suppose that f is a Lipschitz function on the real numbers with Lipschitz
constant smaller or equal to 1. Let A be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a
Hilbert space H. Let 1<p<infinity and suppose that x in B(H) is an operator
such that the commutator [A, x] is contained in the Schatten class S_p. It is
proved by the last two contributors, that then also [f(A), x] is contained in S_p
and there exists a constant C_p independent of x and f such that || [f(A), x]
||_p <= C_p || [A,x] ||_p.
  The main result of this paper is to give a sharp estimate for C_p in terms of
p. Namely, we show that C_p ~ p^2/(p-1). In particular, this gives the best
estimates for operator Lipschitz inequalities.
  We treat this result in a more general setting. This involves commutators of
n self-adjoint operators, for which we prove the analogous result. The case
described here in the abstract follows as a special case.
