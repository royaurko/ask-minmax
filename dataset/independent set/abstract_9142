We perform a generalized analysis of data from WIMP search experiments for
point-like WIMPs of arbitrary spin and general Lorenz-invariant WIMP-nucleus
interaction. We show that in the non-relativistic limit only spin-independent
(SI) and spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-nucleon interactions survive, which can be
parameterized by only five independent parameters. We explore this
five-dimensional parameter space to determine whether the annual modulation
observed in the DAMA experiment can be consistent with all other experiments.
The pure SI interaction is ruled out except for very small region of parameter
space with the WIMP mass close to 50 GeV and the ratio of the WIMP-neutron to
WIMP-proton SI couplings $-0.77\le f_n/f_p\le -0.75$. For the predominantly SD
interaction, we find an upper limit to the WIMP mass of about 18 GeV, which can
only be weakened if the constraint stemming from null searches for energetic
neutrinos from WIMP annihilation the Sun is evaded. None of the regions of the
parameter space that can reconcile all WIMP search results can be easily
accommodated in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model.
