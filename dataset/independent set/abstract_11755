Using data from FOCUS (E831) experiment at Fermilab, we present a model
independent partial-wave analysis of the $K^-\pi^+$ S-wave amplitude from the
decay $D^+ \to K^-\pi^+\pi^+$. The S-wave is a generic complex function to be
determined directly from the data fit. The P- and D-waves are parameterized by
a sum of Breit-Wigner amplitudes. The measurement of the S-wave amplitude
covers the whole elastic range of the $K^-\pi^+$ system.
