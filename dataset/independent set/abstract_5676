We investigate aspects of universality of Glauber critical dynamics in two
dimensions. We compute the critical exponent $z$ and numerically corroborate
its universality for three different models in the static Ising universality
class and for five independent relaxation modes. We also present evidence for
universality of amplitude ratios, which shows that, as far as dynamic behavior
is concerned, each model in a given universality class is characterized by a
single non-universal metric factor which determines the overall time scale.
This paper also discusses in detail the variational and projection methods that
are used to compute relaxation times with high accuracy.
