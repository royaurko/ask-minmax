It is argued that within the continuum functional formalism, there is no need
to supply a further (spatially independent) gauge constraint to complete the
Coulomb gauge of Yang-Mills theory. It is shown explicitly that a natural
completion of the gauge-fixing leads to a contradiction with the perturbative
renormalizability of the theory.
