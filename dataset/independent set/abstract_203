Several contributors have recently claimed that Bell's inequalities (BI) do not
apply to certain types of generalized local hidden variables (HV) models. These
claims are rejected, by means of a proof of BI valid for a very broad class of
local HV models (deterministic or stochastic, with or without memory, time
dependent or time independent, setting dependent or setting independent, and
even allowing classical communication between the wings of the experiment). The
precise meaning of the locality requirement is clarified during the proof. The
exact roles of the two assumptions that amount to Bell's locality (parameter
independence and outcome independence) are explicitly shown, using each one of
them in a different step of the proof. using each one of them in a different
step of the proof.
