The cube graph Q_n is the skeleton of the n-dimensional cube. It is an
n-regular graph on 2^n vertices. The Ramsey number r(Q_n, K_s) is the minimum N
such that every graph of order N contains the cube graph Q_n or an independent
set of order s. Burr and Erdos in 1983 asked whether the simple lower bound
r(Q_n, K_s) >= (s-1)(2^n - 1)+1 is tight for s fixed and n sufficiently large.
We make progress on this problem, obtaining the first upper bound which is
within a constant factor of the lower bound.
