We report on a state characterized by a zero differential resistance observed
in very high Landau levels of a high-mobility two-dimensional electron system.
Emerging from a minimum of Hall field-induced resistance oscillations at low
temperatures, this state exists over a continuous range of magnetic fields
extending well below the onset of the Shubnikov-de Haas effect. The minimum
current required to support this state is largely independent on the magnetic
field, while the maximum current increases with the magnetic field tracing the
onset of inter-Landau level scattering.
