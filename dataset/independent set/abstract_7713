The aromaticity in the polyacene analogues of several inorganic ring
compounds (BN-acenes, CN-acenes, BO-acenes and Na6-acenes) is reported here for
the first time. Conceptual density functional theory based reactivity
descriptors and the nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) values are used
in this analysis.
