We prove that on the condition of non-trivial solutions, the Euler-Lagrange
and Noether equations are equivalent for the variational problem of nonlinear
Poisson equation and a class of more general Lagrangians, including position
independent and of p-Laplacian type. As applications we prove certain
propositions concerning the nonlinear Poisson equation and its generalisations,
the equivalence of admissible and inner variations and discuss the inverse
problem of determining the Lagrangian from conservation or symmetry laws.
