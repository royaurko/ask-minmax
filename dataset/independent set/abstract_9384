The link between the energy surface of bulk systems and their dynamical
properties is generally difficult to establish. Using the activation-relaxation
technique (ART nouveau), we follow the change in the barrier distribution of a
model of amorphous silicon as a function of the degree of relaxation. We find
that while the barrier-height distribution, calculated from the initial
minimum, is a unique function that depends only on the level of distribution,
the reverse-barrier height distribution, calculated from the final state, is
independent of the relaxation, following a different function. Moreover, the
resulting gained or released energy distribution is a simple convolution of
these two distributions indicating that the activation and relaxation parts of
a the elementary relaxation mechanism are completely independent. This
characterized energy landscape can be used to explain nano-calorimetry
measurements.
