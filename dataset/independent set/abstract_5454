This article concerns the $p$-basic set existence problem in the
representation theory of finite groups. We show that, for any odd prime $p$,
the alternating group $\A_n$ has a $p$-basic set. More precisely, we prove that
the symmetric group $\sym_n$ has a $p$-basic set with some additional
properties, allowing us to deduce a $p$-basic set for $\A_n$. Our main tool is
the generalized perfect isometries introduced by K\"ulshammer, Olsson and
Robinson. As a consequence we obtain some results on the decomposition number
of $\A_n$.
