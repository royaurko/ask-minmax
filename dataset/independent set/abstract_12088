The purpose of this paper is to establish an upper bound on the distance
between two pants decompositions in the pants complex for a closed surface of
genus g >= 2. This is done by use of graph theory. First distance is found in
the pants graph modulo the action of the mapping class group, and then between
pants decompositions within an orbit of this action.
