The standard approach to the numerical evolution of black hole data using the
ADM formulation with maximal slicing and vanishing shift is extended to
non-symmetric black hole data containing black holes with linear momentum and
spin by using a time-independent conformal rescaling based on the puncture
representation of the black holes. We give an example for a concrete three
dimensional numerical implementation. The main result of the simulations is
that this approach allows for the first time to evolve through a brief period
of the merger phase of the black hole inspiral.
