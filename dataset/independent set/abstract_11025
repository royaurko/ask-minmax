We discuss recent HERA results on vector--meson electroproduction gamma*p ->
Vp and demonstrate that universality of the initial and final state
interactions responsible for the transition between the on- and off-mass shell
states allows to explain energy independence of the ratio of exclusive rho
electroproduction cross section to the total cross section. We also predict
explicit mass dependence of this ratio for other vector mesons.
