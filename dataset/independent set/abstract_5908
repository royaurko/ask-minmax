Analysis of fluctuations of hadron production properties in collisions of
relativistic particles profits from use of measurable intensive quantities
which are independent of system size variations. They are referred to as
strongly intensive quantities. The first family of such quantities was proposed
already in 1992. The second is introduced in this paper. We also present a
proof of independence of volume fluctuations for quantities from both families
within the framework of statistical mechanics.
