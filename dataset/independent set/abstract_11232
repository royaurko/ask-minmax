In this paper we analyze the problem of the geodesic connectedness of subsets
of Riemannian manifolds. By using variational methods, the geodesic
connectedness of open domains (whose boundaries can be not differentiable and
not convex) of a smooth Riemannian manifold is proved. In some cases also the
convexity of the domain is obtained. Moreover we present examples of the
applicability and of the independence of the assumptions. Finally we give an
application to the existence of trajectories with fixed energy of dynamical
systems.
