Most cosmological parameter estimations are based on the same set of
observations and are therefore not independent. Here, we test the consistency
of parameter estimations using a combination of large-scale structure and
supernovae data, without cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. We combine
observations from the IRAS 1.2 Jy and Las Campanas redshift surveys, galaxy
peculiar velocities and measurements of type Ia supernovae to obtain
h=0.57_{-0.14}^{+0.15}, Omega_m=0.28+/-0.05 and sigma_8=0.87_{-0.05}^{+0.04} in
agreement with the constraints from observations of the CMB anisotropies by the
WMAP satellite. We also compare results from different subsets of data in order
to investigate the effect of priors and residual errors in the data. We find
that some parameters are consistently well constrained whereas others are
consistently ill-determined, or even yield poorly consistent results, thereby
illustrating the importance of priors and data contributions.
