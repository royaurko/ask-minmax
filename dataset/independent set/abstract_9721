We theoretically investigate the unusual transmission property of in-plane
elastic waves through systems of isotropic elastic zero-index-metamaterials
(ZIM) slab embedded with solid defects. Both double-zero-index-metamaterials
(DZIM) and single-zero-index-metamaterials (SZIM) are examined. Particularly,
mode conversion does not occur when either longitudinal (P) wave or transverse
(S) wave is scattered by the defects in a specific type of DZIM possessing near
zero reciprocal of shear modulus and near zero mass density . Thus, P wave and
S wave can be controlled independently by simply adjusting the parameters of
the defects to achieve high transmission (cloaking) and total reflection
(blocking). And an analytic model is proposed to explain the mechanisms of the
total reflection. On the other hand, enhanced transmission is observed for the
SZIM systems. Our analysis shows that the enhanced transmission is due to
resonant modes arisen in the defects. In addition, we suggest a two-dimensional
(2D) phononic crystal (PC), which has effective double-zero-index, to provide
the possibility of achieving the intriguing transmission properties
experimentally.
