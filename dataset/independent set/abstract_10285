I describe a new class of quintessence+CDM models in which late time scalar
field oscillations can give rise to both quintessence and cold dark matter.
Additionally, a versatile ansatz for the luminosity distance is used to
reconstruct the quintessence equation of state in a model independent manner
from observations of high redshift supernovae.
