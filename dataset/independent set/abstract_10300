We present a new source separation method which maximizes the likelihood of a
model of noisy mixtures of stationary, possibly Gaussian, independent
components. The method has been devised to address the problem of imaging CMB
anisotropies. It works in the spectral domain where, thanks to two simple
approximations, the likelihood assumes a simple form which is easy to handle
(low dimensional sufficient statistics) and to maximize (via the EM algorithm).
