The serial concatenation of a repetition code with two or more accumulators
has the advantage of a simple encoder structure. Furthermore, the resulting
ensemble is asymptotically good and exhibits minimum distance growing linearly
with block length. However, in practice these codes cannot be decoded by a
maximum likelihood decoder, and iterative decoding schemes must be employed.
For low-density parity-check codes, the notion of trapping sets has been
introduced to estimate the performance of these codes under iterative message
passing decoding. In this paper, we present a closed form finite length
ensemble trapping set enumerator for repeat multiple accumulate codes by
creating a trellis representation of trapping sets. We also obtain the
asymptotic expressions when the block length tends to infinity and evaluate
them numerically.
