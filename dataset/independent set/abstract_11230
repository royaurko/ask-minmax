We consider the family of N-dimensional real symmetric matrices H with random
independent entries whose variance is determined by a function U((x-y)/b). In
the limit of (relatively) narrow band width 1<<b<<N, we obtain explicitly first
terms of 1/b-expansion of the resolvent of H. The expressions derived show that
the rate of decay of U(t) determines several scale of the universal form of the
eigenvalue correlation function. In particular, in the case of U(t) = o(1/t^3),
the Altshuller-Shklovski asymptotics with the ratio N/b^2 is obtained.
