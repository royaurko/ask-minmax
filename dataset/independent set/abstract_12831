Let $\{G_n: n\geq 1\}$ be a sequence of simple graphs. Suppose $G_n$ has
$m_n$ edges and each vertex of $G_n$ is colored independently and uniformly at
random with $c_n$ colors. Recently, Bhattacharya, Diaconis and Mukherjee (2013)
proved universal limit theorems for the number of monochromatic edges in $G_n$.
Their proof was by the method of moments, and therefore was not able to produce
rates of convergence. By a non-trivial application of Stein's method, we prove
that there exists a universal error bound for their central limit theorem. The
error bound depends only on $m_n$ and $c_n$, regardless of the graph structure.
