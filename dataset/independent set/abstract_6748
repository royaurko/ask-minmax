In this paper, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
set of compositions (resp. prime compositions) of $n$ and the set of circulant
digraphs (resp. connected circulant digraphs) of order $n$. We also show that
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of palindromes (resp.
aperiodic palindromes) of $n$ and the set of circulant graphs (resp. connected
circulant graphs) of order $n$. As a corollary of this correspondence, we
enumerate the number of connected circulant (di)graphs of order $n$.
