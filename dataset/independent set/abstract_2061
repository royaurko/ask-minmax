The Kuramoto model has been introduced in order to describe synchronization
phenomena observed in groups of cells, individuals, circuits, etc... We look at
the Kuramoto model with white noise forces: in mathematical terms it is a set
of N oscillators, each driven by an independent Brownian motion with a constant
drift, that is each oscillator has its own frequency, which, in general,
changes from one oscillator to another (these frequencies are usually taken to
be random and they may be viewed as a quenched disorder). The interactions
between oscillators are of long range type (mean field). We review some results
on the Kuramoto model from a statistical mechanics standpoint: we give in
particular necessary and sufficient conditions for reversibility and we point
out a formal analogy, in the N to infinity limit, with local mean field models
with conservative dynamics (an analogy that is exploited to identify in
particular a Lyapunov functional in the reversible set-up). We then focus on
the reversible Kuramoto model with sinusoidal interactions in the N to infinity
limit and analyze the stability of the non-trivial stationary profiles arising
when the interaction parameter K is larger than its critical value K_c. We
provide an analysis of the linear operator describing the time evolution in a
neighborhood of the synchronized profile: we exhibit a Hilbert space in which
this operator has a self-adjoint extension and we establish, as our main
result, a spectral gap inequality for every K>K_c.
