We propose a new type of supersymmetric models coupled to superconformal
field theories (SCFT's), leading simultaneously to hierarchical Yukawa
couplings and completely degenerate sfermion masses. We consider models with an
extra Abelian gauge symmetry to generate hierarchical structure for couplings
between the SM sector and the SC sector. Interestingly, this hierarchy is
inversely transferred to the Yukawa couplings in the SM sector. In this type of
models, flavor-independent structure of the superconformal fixed point
guarantees that the sfermion masses of the first and the second generations are
completely degenerate at low energy.
