The problem of Secret Key Establishment (SKE) over a pair of independent
Discrete Memoryless Broadcast Channels (DMBCs) has already been studied in
\cite{Ah10}, where we provided lower and upper bounds on the secret-key
capacity. In this paper, we study the above setup under each of the following
two cases: (1) the DMBCs have secrecy potential, and (2) the DMBCs are
stochastically degraded with independent channels. In the former case, we
propose a simple SKE protocol based on a novel technique, called Interactive
Channel Coding (ICC), and prove that it achieves the lower bound. In the latter
case, we give a simplified expression for the lower bound and prove a
single-letter capacity formula under the condition that one of the legitimate
parties sends only i.i.d. variables.
