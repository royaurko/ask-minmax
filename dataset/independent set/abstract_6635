Given any m-dimensional dilation matrix A with rational eigenvalues, we
demonstrate the existence of a digit set D such that the attractor T(A,D) of
the iterated function system generated by A and D is connected. We give an
easily verified sufficient condition on A for a specific digit set, which we
call the centered canonical digit set for A, to give rise to a connected
attractor T(A,D).
