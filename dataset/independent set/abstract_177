Existence of amplitude independent frequencies of oscillation is an unusual
property for a nonlinear oscillator. We find that a class of N coupled
nonlinear Li\'enard type oscillators exhibit this interesting property. We show
that a specific subset can be explicitly solved from which we demonstrate the
existence of periodic and quasiperiodic solutions. Another set of $N$-coupled
nonlinear oscillators, possessing the amplitude independent nature of
frequencies, is almost integrable in the sense that the system can be reduced
to a single nonautonomous first order scalar differential equation which can be
easily integrated numerically.
