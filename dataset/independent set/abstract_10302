Understanding the nature of the dark energy is one of the most important task
in cosmology. In principle several cosmological observations can be used to
discriminate amid a static cosmological constant contribution and a dynamical
quintessence component. In view of the upcoming high resolution CMB
experiments, using a model independent approach we study the dark energy
imprint in the CMB anisotropy power spectrum and the degeneracy with other
cosmological parameters.
