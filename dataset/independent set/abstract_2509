In certain problems in a variety of applied probability settings (from
probabilistic analysis of algorithms to statistical physics), the central
requirement is to solve a recursive distributional equation of the form X =^d
g((\xi_i,X_i),i\geq 1). Here (\xi_i) and g(\cdot) are given and the X_i are
independent copies of the unknown distribution X. We survey this area,
emphasizing examples where the function g(\cdot) is essentially a ``maximum''
or ``minimum'' function. We draw attention to the theoretical question of
endogeny: in the associated recursive tree process X_i, are the X_i measurable
functions of the innovations process (\xi_i)?
