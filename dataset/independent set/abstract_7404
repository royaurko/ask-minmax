A neutrosophic set is a more general platform, which can be used to present
uncertainty, imprecise, incomplete and inconsistent. In this paper a score
function and an accuracy function for single valued neutrosophic sets is
firstly proposed to make the distinction between them. Then the idea is
extended to interval neutrosophic sets. A multi-criteria decision making method
based on the developed score-accuracy functions is established in which
criterion values for alternatives are single valued neutrosophic sets and
interval neutrosophic sets. In decision making process, the neutrosophic
weighted aggregation operators (arithmetic and geometric average operators) are
adopted to aggregate the neutrosophic information related to each alternative.
Thus, we can rank all alternatives and make the selection of the best of one(s)
according to the score-accuracy functions. Finally, some illustrative examples
are presented to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.
