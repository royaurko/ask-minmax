Assume that $T$ is a conservative ergodic measure preserving transformation
of the infinite measure space $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$.We study the asymptotic
behaviour of occupation times of certain subsets of infinite measure.
Specifically, we prove a Darling-Kac type distributional limit theorem for
occupation times of barely infinite components which are separated from the
rest of the space by a set of finite measure with c.f.-mixing return process.
In the same setup we show that the ratios of occupation times of two components
separated in this way diverge almost everywhere. These abstract results are
illustrated by applications to interval maps with indifferent fixed points.
