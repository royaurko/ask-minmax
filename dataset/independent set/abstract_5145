In this work we study the set of leader codewords of a non-binary linear
code. This set has some nice properties related to the monotonicity of the
weight compatible order on the generalized support of a vector in $\mathbb
F_q^n$. This allows us to describe a test set, a trial set and the set zero
neighbours in terms of the leader codewords.
