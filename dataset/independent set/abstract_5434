We use graphs to define sets of Salem and Pisot numbers, and prove that the
union of these sets is closed, supporting a conjecture of Boyd that the set of
all Salem and Pisot numbers is closed. We find all trees that define Salem
numbers. We show that for all integers n the smallest known element of the n-th
derived set of the set of Pisot numbers comes from a graph. We define the
Mahler measure of a graph, and find all graphs of Mahler measure less than
(1+sqrt5)/2. Finally, we list all small Salem numbers known to be definable
using a graph.
