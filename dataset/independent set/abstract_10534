We study the relative phase fluctuations of two one-dimensional condensates
coupled along their whole extension with a local single-atom interaction. The
thermal equilibrium is defined by the competition between independent
longitudinal thermally excited phase fluctuations and the coupling between the
condensates which locally favors identical phase. We compute the relative phase
fluctuations and their correlation length as a function of the temperature and
the strength of the coupling.
