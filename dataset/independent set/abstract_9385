We consider two new aspects of Extensive Air Shower development universality
allowing to make accurate estimation of muon and electromagnetic (EM) shower
contents in two independent ways. In the first case, to get muon (or EM) signal
in water Cherenkov tanks or in scintillator detectors it is enough to know the
vertical depth of shower maximum and the total signal in the ground detector.
In the second case, the EM signal can be calculated from the primary particle
energy and the zenith angle. In both cases the parametrizations of muon and EM
signals are almost independent on primary particle nature, energy and zenith
angle. Implications of the considered properties for mass composition and
hadronic interaction studies are briefly discussed. The present study is
performed on 28000 of proton, oxygen and iron showers, generated with CORSIKA
6.735 for $E^{-1}$ spectrum in the energy range log(E/eV)=18.5-20.0 and
uniformly distributed in cos^2(theta) in zenith angle interval theta=0-65
degrees for QGSJET II/Fluka interaction models.
