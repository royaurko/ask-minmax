In this paper we study the relationship between three numerical invariants
associated to a Kleinian group, namely the critical exponent, the Hausdorff
dimension of the limit set and the convex core entropy. The Hausdorff dimension
of the limit set is naturally bounded below by the critical exponent and above
by the convex core entropy. We investigate when these inequalities become
strict and when they are equalities.
