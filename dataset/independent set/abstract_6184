We apply Freeman's variant of the Davenport-Heilbronn method to investigate
the exceptional set of real numbers not close to some value of a given real
diagonal form at an integral argument. Under appropriate conditions, we show
that the exceptional set in the interval [-N,N] has measure O(N^{1-c}), for a
positive number c.
