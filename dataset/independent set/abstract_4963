For regular one-dimensional variational problems, Ball and Nadirashvilli
introduced the notion of the universal singular set of a Lagrangian L and
established its topological negligibility. This set is defined to be the set of
all points in the plane through which the graph of some absolutely continuous
L-minimizer passes with infinite derivative.
  Motivated by Tonelli's partial regularity results, the question of the size
of the universal singular set in measure naturally arises. Here we show that
universal singular sets are characterized by being essentially purely
unrectifiable -- that is, they intersect most Lipschitz curves in sets of zero
length and that any compact purely unrectifiable set is contained within the
universal singular set of some smooth Lagrangian with given superlinear growth.
This gives examples of universal singular sets of Hausdorff dimension two,
filling the gap between previously known one-dimensional examples and Sychev's
result that universal singular sets are Lebesgue null.
  We show that some smoothness of the Lagrangian is necessary for the
topological size estimate, and investigate the relationship between growth of
the Lagrangian and the existence of (pathological) rectifiable pieces in the
universal singular set.
  We also show that Tonelli's partial regularity result is stable in that the
energy of a `near' minimizer u over the set where it has large derivative is
controlled by the how far u is from being a minimizer.
