The critical dynamics of superconductors in the charged regime is
reconsidered within field-theory. For the dynamics the Ginzburg-Landau model
with complex order parameter coupled to the gauge field suggested earlier
[Lannert et al. Phys. Rev. Lett.
  92, 097004 (2004)] is used. Assuming relaxational dynamics for both
quantities the renormalization group functions within one loop approximation
are recalculated for different choices of the gauge. A gauge independent result
for the divergence of the measurable electric conductivity is obtained only at
the weak scaling fixed point unstable in one loop order where the time scales
of the order parameter and the gauge field are different.
