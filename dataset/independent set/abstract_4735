The rules of d-separation provide a framework for deriving conditional
independence facts from model structure. However, this theory only applies to
simple directed graphical models. We introduce relational d-separation, a
theory for deriving conditional independence in relational models. We provide a
sound, complete, and computationally efficient method for relational
d-separation, and we present empirical results that demonstrate effectiveness.
