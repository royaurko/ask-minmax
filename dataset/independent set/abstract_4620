A new search for production of correlated e+e- pairs in the alpha decay of
241Am has been carried out deep underground at the Gran Sasso National
Laboratory of the I.N.F.N. by using pairs of NaI(Tl) detectors of the
DAMA/LIBRA set-up. The experimental data show an excess of double coincidences
of events with energy around 511 keV in faced pairs of detectors, which are not
explained by known side reactions. This measured excess gives a relative
activity lambda = (4.70 \pm 0.63) \times 10^{-9} for the Internal Pair
Production (IPP) with respect to alpha decay of 241Am; this value is of the
same order of magnitude as previous determinations. In a conservative approach
the upper limit lambda < 5.5 \times 10^{-9} (90% C.L.) can be derived. It is
worth noting that this is the first result on IPP obtained in an underground
experiment, and that the lambda value obtained in the present work is
independent on the live-time estimate.
