It is well known that the linear-noise approximation (LNA) exactly agrees
with the chemical master equation, up to second-order moments, for chemical
systems composed of zero and first-order reactions. Here we show that this is
also a property of the LNA for a subset of chemical systems with second-order
reactions. This agreement is independent of the number of interacting
molecules.
