Statistical model of strongly anisotropic fully developed turbulence of the
weakly compressible fluid is considered by means of the field theoretic
renormalization group. The corrections due to compressibility to the infrared
form of the kinetic energy spectrum have been calculated in the leading order
in Mach number expansion. Furthermore, in this approximation the validity of
the Kolmogorov hypothesis on the independence of dissipation length of velocity
correlation functions in the inertial range has been proved.
