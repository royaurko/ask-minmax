In this paper we test the hypothesis that the Pioneer anomaly can be of
gravitational origin by comparing the predicted model-independent shifts Delta
a/a for the semimajor axis of Uranus and Neptune with the Voyager 2
radio-technical distance measurements performed at JPL-NASA. As in the case of
other tests based on different methods and data sets (secular perihelion
advance, right ascension/declination residuals over about one century), the
orbits of the investigated planets are not affected by any anomalous
acceleration like that experienced by the Pioneer 10/11 spacecraft.
