The pathways along which A. Einstein and D. Hilbert independently came to the
gravitational field equations are traced. Some of the papers that assert a
point of view on the history of the derivation of the gravitational field
equations ``that radically differs from the standard point of view'' are
critically analyzed. It is shown that the conclusions drawn in these papers are
completely groundless.
