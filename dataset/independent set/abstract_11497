The purpose of this note is to show how calculi on unital associative algebra
with universal right bimodule generalize previously studied constructions by
Pusz and Woronowicz [1989] and by Wess and Zumino [1990] and that in this
language results are in a natural context, are easier to describe and handle.
As a by--product we obtained intrinsic, coordinate--free and basis--independent
generalization of the first order noncommutative differential calculi with
partial derivatives.
