We present formulae for the chiral extrapolation of spin-dependent and
spin-independent moments of quark distributions of octet baryons, including
loop corrections and counterterms to leading non-analytic order. This analysis
allows for isospin breaking, and may be used for the chiral extrapolation of
both (2+1)- and (1+1+1)-flavor lattice QCD results. An example of such an
application is given, with the extrapolation formulae applied to recent (2 +
1)-flavor QCDSF/UKQCD Collaboration lattice results for the first
spin-independent and first two spin-dependent Mellin moments.
