The group of $\mathcal C^1$-diffeomorphisms groups of any sparse Cantor
subset of a manifold is countable and discrete (possibly trivial). Thompson's
groups come out of this construction when we consider central ternary Cantor
subsets of an interval. Brin's higher dimensional generalizations $nV$ of
Thompson's group $V$ arise when we consider products of central ternary Cantor
sets. We derive that the $\mathcal C^2$-smooth mapping class group of a sparse
Cantor sphere pair is a discrete countable group and produce this way versions
of the braided Thompson groups.
