Consider two independent Goldstein-Kac telegraph processes $X_1(t)$ and
$X_2(t)$ on the real line $\Bbb R$. The processes $X_k(t), \; k=1,2,$ are
performed by stochastic motions at finite constant velocities $c_1>0, \;
c_2>0,$ that start at the initial time instant $t=0$ from the origin of the
real line $\Bbb R$ and are controlled by two independent homogeneous Poisson
processes of rates $\lambda_1>0, \; \lambda_2>0$, respectively. Closed-form
expression for the probability distribution function of the Euclidean distance
$$\rho(t) = |X_1(t) - X_2(t) |, \qquad t>0,$$ between these processes at
arbitrary time instant $t>0$, is obtained. Some numerical results are
presented.
