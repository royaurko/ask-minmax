In majority bootstrap percolation on a graph G, an infection spreads
according to the following deterministic rule: if at least half of the
neighbours of a vertex v are already infected, then v is also infected, and
infected vertices remain infected forever. Percolation occurs if eventually
every vertex is infected.
  The elements of the set of initially infected vertices, A \subset V(G), are
normally chosen independently at random, each with probability p, say. This
process has been extensively studied on the sequence of torus graphs [n]^d, for
n = 1,2,..., where d = d(n) is either fixed or a very slowly growing function
of n. For example, Cerf and Manzo showed that the critical probability is o(1)
if d(n) < log*(n), i.e., if p = p(n) is bounded away from zero then the
probability of percolation on [n]^d tends to one as n goes to infinity.
  In this paper we study the case when the growth of d to infinity is not
excessively slow; in particular, we show that the critical probability is 1/2 +
o(1) if d > (loglog(n))^2 logloglog(n), and give much stronger bounds in the
case that G is the hypercube, [2]^d.
