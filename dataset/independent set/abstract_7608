It has been conjectured that condensation of tachyons on a bosonic D-brane
gives rise to vacuum / soliton solutions which are independent of the initial
magnetic field on the D-brane. We present evidence for this conjecture using
results from two dimensional conformal field theory. In particular we identify
a continuous path in the configuration space of open string fields which
interpolates between D-brane configurations with two different quantized
magnetic flux.
