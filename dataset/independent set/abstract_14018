We present an overview of a result by Ju. A. Dubinskii [Mat. Sb. 67 (109)
(1965); translated in Amer. Math. Soc. Transl. (2) 67 (1968)], concerning the
compact embedding of a seminormed set in $L^p(0,T; \mathcal{A}_0)$, where
$\mathcal{A}_0$ is a Banach space and $p \in [1,\infty]$; we establish a
variant of Dubinskii's theorem, where a seminormed nonnegative cone is used
instead of a seminormed set; and we explore the connections of these results
with a nonlinear compact embedding theorem due to E. Maitre [Int. J. Math.
Math. Sci. 27 (2003)].
