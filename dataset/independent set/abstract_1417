We discuss a general method to learn data representations from multiple
tasks. We provide a justification for this method in both settings of multitask
learning and learning-to-learn. The method is illustrated in detail in the
special case of linear feature learning. Conditions on the theoretical
advantage offered by multitask representation learning over independent tasks
learning are established. In particular, focusing on the important example of
half-space learning, we derive the regime in which multitask representation
learning is beneficial over independent task learning, as a function of the
sample size, the number of tasks and the intrinsic data dimensionality. Other
potential applications of our results include multitask feature learning in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and multilayer, deep networks.
