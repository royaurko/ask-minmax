A method for an evaluation of fluctuations in the mixed event technique is
proposed. It is shown, that, generally, the magnitude of the fluctuations is
proportional to $N^{3/4}$, where $N$ is the number of produced events, which
should be compared with $N^{1/2}$ for the case of independent events. The
formula eligible for the use in an analysis of experimental data is provided.
