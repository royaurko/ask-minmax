Recent results on heavy flavor production at HERA are presented. New
measurements of charm production are available in the region of $ Q^2 <$ 1000
GeV$^2$ for $D^*$ and in the photoproduction limit, $Q^2\to 0$, for $D_s$. The
results are compared to theoretical calculations and the charm proton structure
function \f2cc$(x,Q^2)$ is extracted. A new independent measurement of the
$b\bar{b}$ cross section using a $b$-lifetime tag is reported.
