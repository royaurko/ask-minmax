We consider the set of the power non-negative polynomials of several
variables and its subset that consists of polynomials which can be represented
as a sum of squares. It is shown in the classic work by D.Hilbert that it is a
proper subset. Both sets are convex. In our paper we have made an attempt to
work out a general approach to the investigation of the extremal elements of
these convex sets. We also consider the class of non-negative rational
functions. The article is based on the following methods: 1.We investigate
non-negative trigonometrical polynomials and then with the help of the Calderon
transformation we proceed to the power polynomials. 2.The way of constructing
support hyperplanes to the convex sets is given in the paper.
