This paper proposes a robust ear identification system which is developed by
fusing SIFT features of color segmented slice regions of an ear. The proposed
ear identification method makes use of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to build
ear model with mixture of Gaussian using vector quantization algorithm and K-L
divergence is applied to the GMM framework for recording the color similarity
in the specified ranges by comparing color similarity between a pair of
reference ear and probe ear. SIFT features are then detected and extracted from
each color slice region as a part of invariant feature extraction. The
extracted keypoints are then fused separately by the two fusion approaches,
namely concatenation and the Dempster-Shafer theory. Finally, the fusion
approaches generate two independent augmented feature vectors which are used
for identification of individuals separately. The proposed identification
technique is tested on IIT Kanpur ear database of 400 individuals and is found
to achieve 98.25% accuracy for identification while top 5 matched criteria is
set for each subject.
