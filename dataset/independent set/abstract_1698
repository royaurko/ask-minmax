In this work we set observational constraints of the Superfluid Chaplygin gas
model, which gives a unified description of the dark sector of the Universe as
a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that behaves as dark energy (DE) while it is
in the ground state and as dark matter (DM) when it is in the excited state. We
first show and perform the various steps leading to a form of the equations
suitable for the observational tests to be carried out. Then, by using a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) code, we constrain the model with a sample of
cosmology-independent long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) calibrated using their Type
I Fundamental Plane, as well as the Union2.1 set and observational Hubble
parameter data. In this analysis, using our cosmological constraints, we sketch
the effective equation of state parameter and deceleration parameter, and we
also obtain the redshift of the transition from deceleration to acceleration:
$z_t$.
