Let $n$ and $k$ be integers. A set $A\subset\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is
$k$-free if for all $x$ in $A$, $kx\notin A$. We determine the maximal
cardinality of such a set when $k$ and $n$ are coprime. We also study several
particular cases and we propose an efficient algorithm for solving the general
case. We finally give the asymptotic behaviour of the minimal size of a
$k$-free set in $\left[ 1,n\right]$ which is maximal for inclusion.
