The present paper is devoted to the spectral analysis of multidimensional
discrete electromagnetic Schr\"odinger operators (doubly Jacobi-type operators)
$L_h$ from a multivector calculus perspective. We consider $L_h$ defined on the
uniform lattice $h\mathbb{Z}^n$ with mesh width $h>0$. Then, we apply the
factorization method to describe $L_h$ in terms of a pair of ladder operators
$(A_h^+,A_h^-)$, embody in a Clifford algebra with signature $(0,n)$. The
factorization approach combined with the Bayesian probability wisdom sheds a
new insight to the eigenspace description of the bound states. As a
consequence, several families of quasi-monomials, such as the hypercomplex
analogues of the Poisson-Charlier polynomials, yield naturally from of the
interpretation of the eigenstates of $L_h$ as discrete quasi-probability
distributions carrying a set of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d)
random variables.
