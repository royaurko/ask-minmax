A finite action principle for Chern-Simons AdS gravity is presented. The
construction is carried out in detail first in five dimensions, where the bulk
action is given by a particular combination of the Einstein-Hilbert action with
negative cosmological constant and a Gauss-Bonnet term; and is then generalized
for arbitrary odd dimensions. The boundary term needed to render the action
finite is singled out demanding the action to attain an extremum for an
appropriate set of boundary conditions. The boundary term is a local function
of the fields at the boundary and is sufficient to render the action finite for
asymptotically AdS solutions, without requiring background fields. It is shown
that the Euclidean continuation of the action correctly describes the black
hole thermodynamics in the canonical ensemble. Additionally, background
independent conserved charges associated with the asymptotic symmetries can be
written as surface integrals by direct application of Noether's theorem.
