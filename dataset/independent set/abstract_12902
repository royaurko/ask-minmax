The equation of state of QCD matter for temperatures near and above the
quark-hadron transition (165 MeV) is inferred within a Bayesian framework
through the comparison of data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and
from the Large Hadron Collider to theoretical models. State-of- the-art
statistical techniques are applied to simultaneously analyze multiple classes
of observables while varying 14 independent model parameters. The resulting
posterior distribution over possible equations of state is consistent with
results from lattice gauge theory.
