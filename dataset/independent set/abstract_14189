We consider non-parametric Bayesian estimation of the drift coefficient of a
one-dimensional stochastic differential equation from discrete-time
observations on the solution of this equation. Under suitable regularity
conditions that are weaker than those previosly suggested in the literature, we
establish posterior consistency in this context. Furthermore, we show that
posterior consistency extends to the multidimensional setting as well, which,
to the best of our knowledge, is a new result in this setting.
