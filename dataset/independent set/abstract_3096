We develop a general set of methods for computing the oblique electroweak
parameters S and T for bottom-up and top-down motivated scenarios in which the
Higgs weakly mixes with a superconformal extra sector. In addition to their
utility in phenomenological studies, the observables S and T are also of purely
theoretical interest as they are defined by correlation functions of broken
symmetries. We show that in the limit where the extra sector enjoys an
approximate custodial symmetry, the leading contributions to S and T can be
recast as calculable data of the theory in the conformal phase. Using this
result, we also obtain model-independent bounds on the sign and size of oblique
electroweak corrections from unitary superconformal theories.
