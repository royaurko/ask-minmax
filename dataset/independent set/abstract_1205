Parameter--elliptic pseudodifferential operators given on a closed smooth
manifold are investigated on the extended Sobolev scale. This scale consists of
all Hilbert spaces that are interpolation spaces with respect to the Hilbert
Sobolev scale. We prove that these operators set isomorphisms between
appropriate spaces of the scale provided the parameter is modulo large enough.
For solutions to the corresponding parameter--elliptic equations, we establish
two-sided a priori estimates, in which the constants are independent of the
parameter.
