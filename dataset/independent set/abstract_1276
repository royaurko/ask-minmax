Inspired by sample splitting and the reusable holdout introduced in the field
of differential privacy, we consider selective inference with a randomized
response. Using a randomized response can ensure that the leftover information
of Fithian et al.(2014) is bounded below ensuring that selective intervals are
better behaved than without randomization. Under independent sampling, we prove
a selective (or privatized) central limit theorem that transfers procedures
valid under asymptotic normality without selection to their corresponding
selective counterparts. We focus on the classical asymptotic setting, leaving
the interesting high-dimensional asymptotic questions for future work.
