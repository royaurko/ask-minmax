In the framework of the relativistic independent quark model the parameters
of the QCD-motivated static potential and the quark masses are calculated on
the basis of the $1^{--}$ meson mass spectra. The value of the confining
potential coefficient is found to be ($0.197\pm 0.005) GeV${}^2$. for quark-
antiquark interaction independently on their flavours. The dependence of the
quasi-Coulombic potential strength on the interaction distance are consistent
with the QCD-motivated behaviour. The $q\bar q$-separations are evaluated and
the $e^+e^-$ decay widths are estimated with the help of relativistic
modification of the Van Royen-Weisskopf formula.
