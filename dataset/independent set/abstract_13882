We prove a version of strong asymptotics of Christoffel functions with
varying weights for a general class of sets E and measures in the complex
plane. This class includes all regular measures in the sense of Stahl-Totik on
regular compact sets E in the plane and even allows varying weights. Our main
theorems cover some known results for subsets E of the real line R; in
particular, we recover information in the case of E=R with Lebesgue measure dx
and weight w(x) = exp(-Q(x)) where Q(x) is a nonnegative, even degree
polynomial having positive leading coefficient.
