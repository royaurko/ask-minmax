We introduce a new parameterization of four-fermion matrix elements which
does not involve quark masses and thus allows a reduction of systematic
uncertainties in physical amplitudes. As a result the apparent quadratic
dependence of e'/e on m_s is removed. To simplify the matching between lattice
and continuum renormalization schemes, we express our results in terms of
Renormalization Group Invariant B-parameters which are renormalization-scheme
and scale independent. As an application of our proposal, matrix elements of
DeltaI=3/2 and SUSY DeltaF=2 ($F=S,C,B$) four-fermion operators have been
computed.
