This paper develops the foundations of a simplicial theory of weak
omega-categories, which builds upon the insights originally expounded by Ross
Street in his 1987 paper on oriented simplices. The resulting theory of weak
complicial sets provides a common generalisation of the theories of (strict)
omega-categories, Kan complexes and Joyal's quasi-categories. We generalise a
number of results due to the current contributor with regard to complicial sets and
strict omega-categories to provide an armoury of well behaved technical
devices, such as joins and Gray tensor products, which will be used to study
these the weak omega-category theory of these structures in a series of
companion papers. In particular, we establish their basic homotopy theory by
constructing a Quillen model structure on the category of stratified simplicial
sets whose fibrant objects are the weak complicial sets. As a simple corollary
of this work we provide an independent construction of Joyal's model structure
on simplicial sets for which the fibrant objects are the quasi-categories.
