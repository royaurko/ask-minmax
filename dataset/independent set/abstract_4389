R-band intensity measurements along the light curve of Type Ia supernovae
discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP) are fitted in brightness to
templates allowing a free parameter the time-axis width factor w = s(1+z). The
data points are then individually aligned in the time-axis, normalized and
K-corrected back to the rest frame, after which the nearly 1300 normalized
intensity measurements are found to lie on a well-determined common rest-frame
B-band curve which we call the ``composite curve''. The same procedure is
applied to 18 low-redshift Calan/Tololo SNe with z < 0.11; these nearly 300
B-band photometry points are found to lie on the composite curve equally well.
The SCP search technique produces several measurements before maximum light for
each supernova. We demonstrate that the linear stretch factor, s, which
parameterizes the light-curve timescale appears independent of z,and applies
equally well to the declining and rising parts of the light curve. In fact, the
B-band template that best fits this composite curve fits the individual
supernova photometry data when stretched by a factor s with chi^2/DoF approx =
1, thus as well as any parameterization can, given the current data sets. The
measurement of the date of explosion, however, is model dependent and not
tightly constrained by the current data.
  We also demonstrate the 1+z light-curve time-axis broadening expected from
cosmological expansion. This argues strongly against alternative explanations,
such as tired light, for the redshift of distant objects.
