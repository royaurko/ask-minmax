Quantum control is traditionally expressed through bilinear models and their
associated Lie algebra controllability criteria. But, the first order
approximation are not always sufficient and higher order developpements are
used in recent works. Motivated by these applications, we give in this paper a
criterion that applies to situations where the evolution operator is expressed
as sum of possibly non-linear real functionals of the control that multiplies
some time independent (coupling) operators.
