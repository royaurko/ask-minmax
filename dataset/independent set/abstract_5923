In this study the ILC's capabilities for detecting WIMPs and measure their
properties are investigated. The signal events are detected by associated
production of Initial State Radiation (ISR). A model independent formulation of
the signal cross section is used. The cross section is normalized by inference
from the observed abundance of cosmological Dark Matter (DM). The study is
performed in full simulation of the ILD00 detector model. The prospects of
determining the WIMP parameters individually and simultaneously are presented.
