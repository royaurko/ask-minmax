Given two \'etale groupoids $\Cal G$ and $\Cal G'$, we consider the set of
pointed morphisms from $\Cal G$ to $\Cal G'$. Under suitable hypothesis we
introduce on this set a structure of Banach manifold which can be considered as
the space of objects of an \'etale groupoid whose space of orbits is the space
of morphisms from $\Cal G$ to $\Cal G'$.
