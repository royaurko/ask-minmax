New parameter-sets of the M3Y-type semi-realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction
are obtained, by taking into account the whole contribution of the interaction
to the pairing. The interactions are applicable to nuclear structure studies
via mean-field calculations and their extensions. Implementing self-consistent
mean-field calculations for the spherical nuclei, we confirm that the results
do not change significantly from the previous ones, in which the parameters
were determined by partly discarding influence of the density-dependent
repulsion on the pairing.
