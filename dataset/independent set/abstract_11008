In the framework of perturbative QCD and a model for the production of
charmed hadrons the structure function $F^c_2$ is calculated and compared with
the experimental data of H1 and ZEUS Collaborations. We show that the spectator
mechanism of the $D^*$-meson production independent of a hadronic remnant is
valid at $p_T>10$ GeV, only. We find that the evolution of $F^c_2(x,Q^2)$
versus the virtuality $Q^2$ can be neglected in the kinematic region of HERA.
