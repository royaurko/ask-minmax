In a previous paper arXiv:0707.2775 [gr-qc] we showed that stationary
asymptotically flat vacuum black hole solutions in 5 dimensions with two
commuting axial Killing fields can be completely characterized by their mass,
angular momentum, a set of real moduli, and a set of winding numbers. In this
paper we generalize our analysis to include Maxwell fields.
