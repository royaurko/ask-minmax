It was shown by Le Jan that the occupation field of a Poisson ensemble of
Markov loops ("loop soup") of parameter one-half associated to a transient
symmetric Markov jump process on a network is half the square of the Gaussian
free field on this network. We construct a coupling between these loops and the
free field such that an additional constraint holds: the sign of the free field
is constant on each cluster of loops. As a consequence of our coupling we
deduce that the loop clusters of parameter one-half do not percolate on
periodic lattices. We also construct a coupling between the random
interlacement on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $d\geq 3$, introduced by Sznitman, and the
Gaussian free field on the lattice such that the set of vertices visited by the
interlacement is contained in a level set of the free field. We deduce an
inequality between the critical level for the percolation by level sets of the
free field and the critical parameter for the percolation of the vacant set of
the random interlacement. Both in the case of loops and of the random
interlacement, the couplings are constructed by replacing discrete graphs by
metric graphs. Le Jan's and Sznitman's isomorphism theorems between the
Gaussian free field and the occupation field of trajectories can be extended to
the metric graph setting on which the intermediate value principle for
continuous fields holds.
