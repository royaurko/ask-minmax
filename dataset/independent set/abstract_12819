We would desire to have done the calculations of this paper in the measure on
nxn matrices that weights uniformly all 0-1 matrices with row and column sum
equal to r, other matrices given weight zero. Instead we work with all matrices
that are the sum of r independent uniformly weighted permutation matrices, with
the hope that the computations we perform give the same result in this measure.
We derive the result for limiting expectations
  lim (1/n)ln(E(perm_m(A) perm_m'(A))) =lim (1/n)ln(E(perm_m(A)))+
  +lim (1/n)ln(E(perm_m'(A)))
  Here the limit is n to infinity, r is fixed, and m and m' are taken as each
proportional to n.
