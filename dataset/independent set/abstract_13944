Consider an integer associated with every subset of the set of columns of an
$n\times k$ matrix. The collection of those matrices for which the rank of a
union of columns is the predescribed integer for every subset, will be denoted
by $X_C$. We study the equivariant cohomology class represented by the Zariski
closure $Y_C$ of this set. We show that the coefficients of this class are
solutions to problems in enumerative geometry, which are natural generalization
of the linear Gromov-Witten invariants of projective spaces. We also show how
to calculate these classes and present their basic properties.
