In this paper, we study the generation of maximal Poisson-disk sets with
varying radii. First, we present a geometric analysis of gaps in such disk
sets. This analysis is the basis for maximal and adaptive sampling in Euclidean
space and on manifolds. Second, we propose efficient algorithms and data
structures to detect gaps and update gaps when disks are inserted, deleted,
moved, or have their radius changed. We build on the concepts of the regular
triangulation and the power diagram. Third, we will show how our analysis can
make a contribution to the state-of-the-art in surface remeshing.
