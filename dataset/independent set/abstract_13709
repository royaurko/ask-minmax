We extend the strong multiplicity one theorem of Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro
and Shalika. Let $\pi$ be a unitary, cuspidal, automorphic representation of
$GL_n(\A_K)$. Let $S$ be a set of finite places of $K$, such that the sum
$\sum_{v\in S}Nv^{-2/(n^2+1)}$ is convergent. Then $\pi$ is uniquely determined
by the collection of the local components $\{\pi_v\mid v\not\in S, ~v
\~\text{finite}\}$ of $\pi$. Combining this theorem with base change, it is
possible to consider sets $S$ of positive density, having appropriate splitting
behavior with respect to solvable extensions of $K$, and where $\pi$ is
determined upto twisting by a character of the Galois group of $L$ over $K$.
