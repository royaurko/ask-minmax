The article considers a proton accelerator containing seven independent beams
arranged on the accelerator radius. The current in each beam is one hundred
milliamps. The initial part of the accelerator consists of shielded spiral
waveguides assembled in the common screen. The frequency of the acceleration:
three hundred megahertz, high-frequency power twenty-five megawatts, the length
of the accelerator six meters. After reaching the proton energy of six
megaelektronvolts the protons using lenses with the azimuthal magnetic field
are collected in one beam. Further beam acceleration is performed in the array
of superconducting cavities tuned to the frequency one and three tenths
gigahertz. The acceleration rate is equal to twenty megavolt per meter, the
high-frequency power consumption fifteen megawatts per meter.
