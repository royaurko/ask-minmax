We present the complete family of solutions of 3D gravity (Lambda<0) with two
asymptotically AdS exterior regions. The solutions are constructed from data at
the two boundaries, which correspond to two independent and arbitrary stress
tensors T_R, \bar T_R, and T_L, \bar T_L. The two exteriors are smoothly joined
on to an interior region through a regular horizon. We find CFT duals of these
geometries which are entangled states of two CFT's. We compute correlators
between general operators at the two boundaries and find perfect agreement
between CFT and bulk calculations. We calculate and match the CFT entanglement
entropy (EE) with the holographic EE which involves geodesics passing through
the wormhole. We also compute a holographic, non-equilibrium entropy for the
CFT using properties of the regular horizon. The construction of the bulk
solutions here uses an exact version of Brown-Henneaux type diffeomorphisms
which are asymptotically nontrivial and transform the CFT states by two
independent unitary operators on the two sides. Our solutions provide an
infinite family of explicit examples of the ER=EPR relation of Maldacena and
Susskind [arXiv:1306.0533].
