We study the specific role that the Ward-Green-Takahashi identity plays in
the restoration of the gauge independence of the physical observables related
to the phenomenon of Dynamical Symmetry Breaking in QED3, the chiral condensate
and the fermion mass, in the framework of the Schwinger-Dyson equations (SDE).
We see in the lack of gauge independence of the physical observables the
necessity of including further gauge invariance constraints and study the gauge
covariance of the Fermion Propagator (FP) through its
Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformation. From this we stress that 1) in order
to achieve full gauge independence of the physical observables we must include
the Full Vertex in the corresponding SDE for the FP, and 2) that Perturbation
Theory (PT) is the only scheme where this gauge independence as well as all of
the gauge invariance constraints are satisfied order by order. Therefore we
carry out the construction of the fermion-boson vertex taking PT as a guide
upto the first order of approximation. We completely relate this vertex to the
FP and propose a non perturbative form for it. Furthermore, we write this non
perturbative vertex in a suitable form for its future implementation in similar
studies.
