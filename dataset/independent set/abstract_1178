We define a class of transformations of the dependent and independent
variables in an ordinary difference scheme. The transformations leave the
solution set of the system invariant and reduces to a group of contact
transformations in the continuous limit. We use a simple example to show that
the class is not empty and that such "contact transformations for discrete
systems" genuinely exist.
