We calculate the ratio of the two branching ratios, Br(h -> bb-bar) and Br(h
-> cc-bar) + Br(h -> gg), in the minimal supersymmetric standard model taking
into account the SUSY-loop corrections to the Higgs sector and the hbb-bar
vertex. We show that the heavy Higgs mass can be extracted from the ratio,
almost independently of other SUSY parameters, in the region of tan(beta) ~<
10.
