We consider the problem of fitting a set of points in Euclidean space by an
algebraic hypersurface. We assume that points on a true hypersurface, described
by a polynomial equation, are corrupted by zero mean independent Gaussian
noise, and we estimate the coefficients of the true polynomial equation. The
adjusted least squares estimator accounts for the bias present in the ordinary
least squares estimator. The adjusted least squares estimator is based on
constructing a quasi-Hankel matrix, which is a bias-corrected matrix of
moments. For the case of unknown noise variance, the estimator is defined as a
solution of a polynomial eigenvalue problem. In this paper, we present new
results on invariance properties of the adjusted least squares estimator and an
improved algorithm for computing the estimator for an arbitrary set of
monomials in the polynomial equation.
