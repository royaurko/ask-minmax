We study the nodal set of the Steklov eigenfunctions on the boundary of a
smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ - the eigenfunctions of the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. Under the assumption that the domain $\Omega$ is
$C^2$, we prove a doubling property for the eigenfunction $u$. We estimate the
Hausdorff $\mathcal H^{n-2}$-measure of the nodal set of $u|_{\partial \Omega}$
in terms of the eigenvalue $\lambda$ as $\lambda$ grows to infinity. In case
that the domain $\Omega$ is analytic, we prove a polynomial bound
O($\lambda^6$). Our arguments, which make heavy use of Almgren's frequency
functions, are built on the previous works [Garofalo and Lin, CPAM 40 (1987),
no.3; Lin, CPAM 42(1989), no.6].
