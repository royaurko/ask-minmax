SuperAGILE is the hard X-ray monitor of the AGILE gamma ray mission, in orbit
since 23$^{rd}$ April 2007. It is an imaging experiment based on a set of four
independent silicon strip detectors, equipped with one-dimensional coded masks,
operating in the nominal energy range 18-60 keV. The main goal of SuperAGILE is
the observation of cosmic sources simultaneously with the main gamma-ray AGILE
experiment, the Gamma Ray Imaging Detector (GRID). Given its
$\sim$steradian-wide field of view and its $\sim$15 mCrab day-sensitivity,
SuperAGILE is also well suited for the long-term monitoring of Galactic compact
objects and the detection of bright transients. The SuperAGILE detector
properties and design allow for a 6 arcmin angular resolution in each of the
two independent orthogonal projections of the celestial coordinates. Photon by
photon data are continuously available by the experiment telemetry, and are
used to derive images and fluxes of individual sources, with integration times
depending on the source intensity and position in the field of view. In this
paper we report on the main scientific results achieved by SuperAGILE over its
first two years in orbit, until April 2009.
