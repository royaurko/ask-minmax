In random heteropolymer globules with short-range interactions between the
monomers, freezing takes place at the microscopic length scale only, and can be
described by a 1-step replica symmetry breaking. The fact that the long-range
Coulomb interaction has no intrinsic length scale suggests that freezing in
random polyampholyte globules might take place at all length scales,
corresponding to an overlap parameter q(x) that increases continuously from
zero to its maximum value. Study of the polyampholyte globule within the
independent interaction approximation seems to confirm this scenario. However,
the independent interaction model has an important deficiency: it cannot
account for self-screening, and we show that the model is only reliable at
length scales shorter than the self-screening length. Using the more realistic
sequence model we prove that in the general case of a random heteropolymer
globule containing two types of monomers such that unlike monomers attract each
other, freezing at arbitrarily large length scales is not possible. For
polyampholyte globules this implies that beyond the self-screening length, the
freezing behavior is qualitatively the same as in the case of short-range
interactions. We find that if the polyampholyte globule is not maximally
compact, the degree of frustration is insufficient to obtain freezing.
