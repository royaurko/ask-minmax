The escape probability out of the superconducting state of a hysteretic
DC-SQUID has been measured at different values of the applied magnetic flux. At
low temperature, the escape current and the width of the probability
distribution are temperature independent but they depend on flux. Experimental
results do not fit the usual one-dimensional (1D) Macroscopic Quantum Tunneling
(MQT) law but are perfectly accounted for by the two-dimensional (2D) MQT
behaviour as we propose here. Near zero flux, our data confirms the recent MQT
observation in a DC-SQUID \cite{Li02}.
