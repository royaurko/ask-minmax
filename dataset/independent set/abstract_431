All spaces are assumed to be separable and metrizable. Our main result is
that the statement "For every space $X$, every closed subset of $X$ has the
perfect set property if and only if every analytic subset of $X$ has the
perfect set property" is equivalent to $\mathfrak{b}>\omega_1$ (hence, in
particular, it is independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$). This, together with a theorem
of Solecki and an example of Miller, will allow us to determine the status of
the statement "For every space $X$, if every $\mathbf{\Gamma}$ subset of $X$
has the perfect set property then every $\mathbf{\Gamma}'$ subset of $X$ has
the perfect set property" as $\mathbf{\Gamma},\mathbf{\Gamma}'$ range over all
pointclasses of complexity at most analytic or coanalytic. Along the way, we
define and investigate a property of independent interest. We will say that a
subset $W$ of $2^\omega$ has the Grinzing property if it is uncountable and for
every uncountable $Y\subseteq W$ there exists an uncountable collection
consisting of uncountable subsets of $Y$ with pairwise disjoint closures in
$2^\omega$. The following theorems hold. (1) There exists a subset of
$2^\omega$ with the Grinzing property. (2) Assume
$\mathsf{MA}+\neg\mathsf{CH}$. Then $2^\omega$ has the Grinzing property. (3)
Assume $\mathsf{CH}$. Then $2^\omega$ does not have the Grinzing property. The
first result was obtained by Miller using a theorem of Todor\v{c}evi\'c, and is
needed in the proof of our main result.
