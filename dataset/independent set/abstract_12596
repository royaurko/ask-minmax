We study ergodic properties of compositions of holomorphic endomorphisms of
the complex projective space chosen independently at random according to some
probability distribution. Along the way, we construct positive closed currents
which have good invariance and convergence properties. We provide a sufficient
condition for these currents to have H\"{o}lder continuous quasi-potentials. We
also prove central limit theorem for d.s.h and H\"{o}lder continuous
observables.
