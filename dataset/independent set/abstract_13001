Comparison results are given for time-inhomogeneous Markov processes with
respect to function classes induced stochastic orderings. The main result
states comparison of two processes, provided that the comparability of their
infinitesimal generators as well as an invariance property of one process is
assumed. The corresponding proof is based on a representation result for the
solutions of inhomogeneous evolution problems in Banach spaces, which extends
previously known results from the literature. Based on this representation, an
ordering result for Markov processes induced by bounded and unbounded function
classes is established. We give various applications to time-inhomogeneous
diffusions, to processes with independent increments and to L\'evy driven
diffusion processes.
