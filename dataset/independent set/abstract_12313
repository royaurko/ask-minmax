For the most general off-shell N = 2 supersymmetric sigma model in projective
superspace, we elaborate on its formulation in terms of N = 1 chiral
superfields. A universal (model-independent) expression is obtained for the
holomorphic symplectic two-form, which determines the second supersymmetry
transformation. This two-form is associated with the two complex structures of
the hyperkahler target space, which are complimentary to the one used to
realize the target space as a Kahler manifold.
