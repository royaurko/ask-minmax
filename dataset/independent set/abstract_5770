A model-independent method for the determination of Breit-Wigner resonance
parameters is presented. The method is based on eliminating the dependence on
the choice of channel basis by analyzing the trace of the K and T matrices in
the coupled-channel formalism, rather than individual matrix elements of the
multichannel scattering matrix.
