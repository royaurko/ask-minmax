Stacks of intrinsic Josephson junctions in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta
}$ emit intense and coherent terahertz waves determined by the internal
electromagnetic cavity resonance. We identify the excited transverse magnetic
mode by observing the broadly tunable emissions from an identical nearly square
stack and simulating the scattering spectrum. We employ a wedge-type
interferometer to measure emitted integral power independently of the far-field
pattern. The simulation results are in good agreement with observed resonance
behaviors as a function of frequency.
