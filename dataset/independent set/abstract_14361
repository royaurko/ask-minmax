The nullity of a graph is the multiplicity of the eigenvalues zero in its
spectrum. A signed graph is a graph with a sign attached to each of its edges.
In this paper, we obtain the coe?cient theorem of the characteristic polynomial
of a signed graph, give two formulae on the nullity of signed graphs with
cut-points. As applications of the above results, we investigate the nullity of
the bicyclic signed graph $\Gamma(\infty(p,q,l))$, obtain the nullity set of
unbalanced bicyclic signed graphs, and thus determine the nullity set of
bicyclic signed graphs.
