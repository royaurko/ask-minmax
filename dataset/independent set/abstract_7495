We show that a saturable single-frequency elastic T-matrix approach to
scattering of light by atoms agrees remarkably well with a master equation
description in the regime of unsaturated atoms, or for large separation between
the atoms. If the atoms are in each other's near-field and the saturation of
the atoms is high enough, the two approaches yield different results.
