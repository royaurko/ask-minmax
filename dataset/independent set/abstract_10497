We present a simple mesoscale field theory inspired by rate-independent
plasticity that reflects the symmetry of the deformation process. We
parameterize the plastic deformation by a scalar field which evolves with
loading. The evolution equation for that field has the form of a
Hamilton-Jacobi equation which gives rise to cusp-singularity formation. These
cusps introduce irreversibilities analogous to those seen in plastic
deformation of real materials: we observe a yield stress, work hardening,
reversibility under unloading, and cell boundary formation.
