Light-cone quantization always involves the solution of differential
constraint equations. The solutions to these equations include integration
constants (fields independent of $x_-$). These fields are unphysical but when
they are consistently removed from the dynamics, additional operators (induced
operators), which would not be present if the integration constants were simply
set to zero, are included in the dynamics. These induced operators can be taken
to act in the usual light-cone subspace, for instance, the space used for DLCQ.
Here, I shall give a derivation of two such operators. The operators are
derived starting from the QCD Lagrangian but the derivation involves some
guesses. The operators will provide for the linear growth of the pion mass
squared with the quark bare mass and for the splitting of the pi and the rho at
zero quark mass.
