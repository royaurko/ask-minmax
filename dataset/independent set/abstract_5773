This report shows the latest results on the study of the method to determine
the angle phi_3 of the unitarity triangle using Dalitz plot analysis of D^0
decay from B->DK process in a model-independent way. We concentrate on the case
with a limited charm data sample, which will be available from the CLEO-c
collaboration in the nearest future, with the main goal to find the optimal
strategy for phi_3 extraction.
