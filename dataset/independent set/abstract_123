It is consistent that there is a set mapping from the four-tuples of omega_n
into the finite subsets with no free subsets of size t_n for some natural
number t_n. For any n< omega it is consistent that there is a set mapping from
the pairs of omega_n into the finite subsets with no infinite free sets.
