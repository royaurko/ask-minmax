We study the phase space of spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmology in
general scalar-tensor theories. A reduction to a two-dimensional phase space is
performed when possible-in these situations the phase space is usually a
two-dimensional curved surface embedded in a three-dimensional space and
composed of two sheets attached to each other, possibly with complicated
topology. The results obtained are independent of the choice of the coupling
function of the theory and, in certain situations, also of the potential.
