A preliminary combined mass limit of about 90 GeV has been reported for the
Minimal Standard Model Higgs boson from the 183 GeV data taken in 1997, with a
total luminosity of about 200 pb-1. Similar mass limits have been reported from
the individual LEP experiments based on the first 1998 data at 189 GeV with up
to 40 pb-1 each. For the first time the LEP experiments have made a common
effort to derive preliminary combined limits in the Minimal Supersymmetric
extension of the Standard Model. For three MSSM benchmark parameter sets, mass
limits for the lighter scalar of 77 GeV and for the pseudoscalar of 78 GeV have
been derived. In a more general parameter scan unexcluded mass regions have
been revealed. An independent variation of the SUSY parameters results in
cancellation effects of production cross sections and thus some parameter
regions are not excluded in this more general framework. Direct and indirect
limits from other SUSY particle searches have been taken into account.
