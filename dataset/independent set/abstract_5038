We investigate the spectral distribution of random matrix ensembles with
correlated entries. We consider symmetric matrices with real valued entries and
stochastically independent diagonals. Along the diagonals the entries may be
correlated. We show that under sufficiently nice moment conditions the
empirical eigenvalue distribution converges almost surely weakly to the
semi-circle law.
