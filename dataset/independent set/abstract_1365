With the randomization approach, sensitive data items of records are
randomized to protect privacy of individuals while allowing the distribution
information to be reconstructed for data analysis. In this paper, we
distinguish between reconstruction that has potential privacy risk, called
micro reconstruction, and reconstruction that does not, called aggregate
reconstruction. We show that the former could disclose sensitive information
about a target individual, whereas the latter is more useful for data analysis
than for privacy breaches. To limit the privacy risk of micro reconstruction,
we propose a privacy definition, called (epsilon,delta)-reconstruction-privacy.
Intuitively, this privacy notion requires that micro reconstruction has a large
error with a large probability. The promise of this approach is that micro
reconstruction is more sensitive to the number of independent trials in the
randomization process than aggregate reconstruction is; therefore, reducing the
number of independent trials helps achieve
(epsilon,delta)-reconstruction-privacy while preserving the accuracy of
aggregate reconstruction. We present an algorithm based on this idea and
evaluate the effectiveness of this approach using real life data sets.
