We study pairs of reals that are mutually Martin-L\"{o}f random with respect
to a common, not necessarily computable probability measure. We show that a
generalized version of van Lambalgen's Theorem holds for non-computable
probability measures, too. We study, for a given real $A$, the
\emph{independence spectrum} of $A$, the set of all $B$ so that there exists a
probability measure $\mu$ so that $\mu\{A,B\} = 0$ and $(A,B)$ is
$\mu\times\mu$-random. We prove that if $A$ is r.e., then no $\Delta^0_2$ set
is in the independence spectrum of $A$. We obtain applications of this fact to
PA degrees. In particular, we show that if $A$ is r.e.\ and $P$ is of PA degree
so that $P \not\geq_{T} A$, then $A \oplus P \geq_{T} 0'$.
