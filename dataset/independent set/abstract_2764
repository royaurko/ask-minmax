The article is devoted to the discussion of the high-throughput approach to
band structures calculations. We present scientific and computational
challenges as well as solutions relying on the developed framework (Automatic
Flow, AFLOW/ACONVASP). The key factors of the method are the standardization
and the robustness of the procedures. Two scenarios are relevant: 1)
independent users generating databases in their own computational systems
(off-line approach) and 2) teamed users sharing computational information based
on a common ground (on-line approach). Both cases are integrated in the
framework: for off-line approaches, the standardization is automatic and fully
integrated for the 14 Bravais lattices, the primitive and conventional unit
cells, and the coordinates of the high symmetry k-path in the Brillouin zones.
For on-line tasks, the framework offers an expandable web interface where the
user can prepare and set up calculations following the proposed standard. Few
examples of band structures are included. LSDA+U parameters (U, J) are also
presented for Nd, Sm, and Eu.
