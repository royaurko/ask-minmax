We investigate the relationship between global offensive $k$-alliances and
some characteristic sets of a graph including $r$-dependent sets and
$\tau$-dominating sets. As a consequence of the study, we obtain bounds on the
global offensive $k$-alliance number in terms of several parameters of the
graph.
