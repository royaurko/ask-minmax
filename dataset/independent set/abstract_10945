We study flavour neutrinos confined to our 4-dimensional world coupled to one
"bulk" state, i.e. a Kaluza-Klein tower. We discuss the spatial development of
the neutrino disappearance, the possibility of resurgence and the effective
flavour transitions induced in this mechanism. We show that even a simple model
can produce an energy-independent suppression at large distances, and relate
this to experimental data.
