In this paper we discuss Sudakov type minoration for the dependent setting.
Sudakov minoration is a well known property first proved for centered Gaussian
processes which states that for well separated points there is a natural lower
bound on the expectation of the supremum of such a process. We generalize this
concept for the dependent setting where we consider log concave random
variables and then discuss methods of proving the property.
