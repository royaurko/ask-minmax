A definition is given of seriate sets as being sets constituted out of
structured collections of objects which are recursively internally self-
similar. Fundamental (geometrical) objects of Dimension N are conceived
to be constituted out of seriate sets of fundamental objects of
Dimension N-1, starting with points assigned to Dimension 0. Syntactical
rules to enable such objects to be systematically named and combined,
are set out. A series of formal proofs of theorems relative to objects
of Dimensions 1 and 2 are worked through. A proof that four colours are
sufficient to colour any five area map is given in illustration.
  I know most/all will think all the above impossible, and necessarily the
work of some crazy. If it is wrong I believe it is wrong in interesting
ways. The underlying idea is easily grasped without working through the
theorems given, so I would be grateful to hear from anyone as to why it
is wrong - and not simply because it must be so.
