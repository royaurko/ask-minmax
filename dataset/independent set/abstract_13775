To directed graphs with unique sink and source we associate a noncommutative
associative alsgebra and a polynomial over this algebra. Edges of the graph
correspond to pseudo-roots of the polynomial. We give a sufficient condition
when coefficients of the polynomial can be rationally expressed via elements of
a given set of pseudo-roots (edges). Our results are based on a new theorem for
directed graphs also proved in this paper.
