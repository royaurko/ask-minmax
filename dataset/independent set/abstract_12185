Assuming Kotz-Riesz type I and II distributions and their corresponding
independent Riesz distributions the associated generalised matricvariate T
distributions, termed matricvariate T-Riesz distributions for real normed
division algebras are obtained with respect to the Lebesgue measure. In
addition some of their properties are also studied.
