Recovery of the sparsity pattern (or support) of an unknown sparse vector
from a small number of noisy linear measurements is an important problem in
compressed sensing. In this paper, the high-dimensional setting is considered.
It is shown that if the measurement rate and per-sample signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) are finite constants independent of the length of the vector, then the
optimal sparsity pattern estimate will have a constant fraction of errors.
Lower bounds on the measurement rate needed to attain a desired fraction of
errors are given in terms of the SNR and various key parameters of the unknown
vector. The tightness of the bounds in a scaling sense, as a function of the
SNR and the fraction of errors, is established by comparison with existing
achievable bounds. Near optimality is shown for a wide variety of practically
motivated signal models.
