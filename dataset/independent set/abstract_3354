We consider the Higgs Lepton Flavor Violating process $h \rightarrow \tau
\mu$, in which CMS found a $2.5 \sigma$ excess of events, from a model
independent perspective, and find that it is difficult to generate this
operator without also obtaining a sizeable Wilson coefficient for the dipole
operators responsible for tau radiative decay, constrained by BABAR to
${BR}(\tau \rightarrow \mu \gamma)< 4.4 \times 10^{-8} $. We then survey a set
of representative models for new physics, to determine which ones are capable
of evading this problem. We conclude that, should this measurement persist as a
signal, type-III Two Higgs Doublet Models and Higgs portal-like models are
favored, while SUSY and Composite Higgs models are unlikely to explain it.
