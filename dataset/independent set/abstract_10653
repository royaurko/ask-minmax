We present the first model-independent comparison of recent measurements of
the entropy and of the critical temperature of a unitary Fermi gas, performed
by Luo et al., with the most complete results currently available from finite
temperature Monte Carlo calculations. The measurement of the critical
temperature in a cold fermionic atomic cloud is consistent with a value
$T_c=0.23(2)epsilon_F$ in the bulk, as predicted by the present contributors in
their Monte Carlo calculations.
