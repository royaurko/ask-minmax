We formulate a simple Landau type model describing macroscopic behaviour
recently discovered new smectic phases composed of achiral bent-shaped
molecules. Films of such smectics exhibit three types of ordering related to
dipole polarization, molecular tilt, and chirality. However due to specific
third order coupling of the order parameters these three types of
symmetry-breaking are not independent ones, and this fact leads to specific
domain structures really observed in experiments.
