I discuss in parallel two universal phenomena: the independence of statistics
of the heat capacity and entropy of ideal gases of the same, constant, density
of states, on one hand, and the independence of statistics of the heat and
entropy transport through one-dimensional channels, on the other hand. I show
that there is a close similarity between the microscopic explanations of each
of these phenomena.
