Structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of Mn2-xCrxSb compounds
have been studied. In these compounds a first order magnetic phase transition
from the ferrimagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state occurs with decreasing
temperature, giving rise to giant inverse magnetocaloric effects that can be
tuned over a wide temperature interval through changes in substitution
concentration. Entropy changes as high as 7.5 J/kgK have been observed, and a
composition independent entropy change is obtained for several different
concentrations/working temperatures, making these compounds suitable candidates
for a composite working material.
