We introduce algebriac sets in the products of complex projective spaces for
multipartite mixed states, which are independent of their eigenvalues and only
measure the "position" of their eigenvectors, as their non-local invariants
(ie. remaining invariant after local untary transformations). These invariants
are naturally arised from the physical consideration of checking multipartite
mixed states by measuring them with multipartite separable pure states. The
algebraic sets have to be the sum of linear subspaces if the multipartite mixed
state is separable, and thus we give a new separability criterion of
multipartite mixed states. A continuous family of 4-party mixed states, whose
members are separable for any 2:2 cut and entangled for any 1:3 cut (thus bound
entanglement if 4 parties are isolated), is constructed and studied from our
invariants and separability criterion. Examples of LOCC-incomparable entangled
tripartite pure states are given to show it is hopeless to characterize the
entanglement properties of tripartite pure states by only using the eigenvalue
speactra of their partial traces. We also prove that at least $n^2+n-1$ terms
of separable pure states, which are "orthogonal" in some sence, are needed to
write a generic pure state in $H_A^{n^2} \otimes H_B^{n^2} \otimes H_C^{n^2}$
as a linear combination of them.
