We consider homogeneous multidimensional continued fraction algorithms, in
particular a family of maps which was introduced by F. Schweiger. We prove his
conjecture regarding the existence of an absorbing set for those maps. We also
establish that their renormalisations are nonergodic which disproves another
conjecture due to Schweiger. Other homogeneous algorithms are also analysed
including ones which are ergodic.
