Experimental observations and theoretical arguments at Galaxy and larger
scales have suggested that a large fraction of the Universe is composed by Dark
Matter particles. This has motivated the DAMA experimental efforts to
investigate the presence of such particles in the galactic halo by exploiting a
model independent signature and very highly radiopure set-ups deep underground.
Few introductory arguments are summarized before presenting a review of the
present model independent positive results obtained by the DAMA/NaI and
DAMA/LIBRA set-ups at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory of the INFN.
Implications and model dependent comparisons with other different kinds of
results will be shortly addressed. Some arguments put forward in literature
will be confuted.
