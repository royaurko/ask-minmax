It is a striking and elegant fact (proved independently by Furstenberg and
Sarkozy) that in any subset of the natural numbers of positive upper density
there necessarily exist two distinct elements whose difference is given by a
perfect square. In this article we present a new and simple proof of this
result by adapting an argument originally developed by Croot and Sisask to give
a new proof of Roth's theorem.
