We show that present experiments imply that neutrinos are nonstandard at the
87\% C.L., independently of solar or nuclear physics. Moreover, if neutrinos
are standard, the $^7$Be flux must be almost zero. Even if we arbitrarily
disregard one of the experiments, the neutrino flux must still be less than
half of the value predicted by standard solar models.
