We consider the product of two independent randomly rotated projectors. The
square of its radial part turns out to be distributed as a Jacobi ensemble. We
study its global and local properties in the large dimension scaling relevant
to free probability theory. We establish asymptotics for one point and two
point correlation functions, as well as properties of largest and smallest
eigenvalues.
