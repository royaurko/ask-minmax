We present a model independent study of the chiral condensate evolution in a
hadronic gas, in terms of temperature and baryon chemical potential. The
meson-meson interactions are described within Chiral Perturbation Theory and
the pion-nucleon interaction by means of Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation
Theory, both at one loop. Together with the virial expansion, this provides a
model independent systematic expansion at low temperatures and chemical
potentials, which includes the physical quark masses. This can serve as a
guideline for further studies on the lattice. We also obtain estimates of the
critical line of temperature and chemical potential where the chiral condensate
melts, which systematically lie somewhat higher than recent lattice
calculations but are consistent with several hadronic models.
