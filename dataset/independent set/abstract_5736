We present a new method for the determination of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix element $|V_{tb}|$ from
electroweak loop corrections, in particular those affecting the process $Z\to
b\bar{b}$. From a combined analysis of results from the LEP, SLC, Tevatron, and
neutrino scattering experiments we determine $|V_{tb}| = 0.77^{+0.18}_{-0.24}$.
This is the first determination of $|V_{tb}|$ which is independent of unitarity
assumptions.
