We design three dimensional electromagnetic cloaks, starting from a small
region of complex shape instead of a point. We derive the expression of a
transformation matrix describing an objet with a surface of revolution and its
associated non-singular cloak. We note that while none of the eigenvalues
vanish inside the cloak, they suffer a discontinuity on its inner surface.
Moreover, all three eigenvalues are independent upon the radius in the
concealed object. The validity of our analytical results is confirmed by finite
edge-elements computations showing scattering is much reduced when the object
is dressed with the cloak. We note that neither the object nor the cloak are
invisible on their own.
