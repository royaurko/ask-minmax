We show that functions of type $X_n = P[Z^n]$, where $P[t]$ is a periodic
function and $Z$ is a generic real number, can produce sequences such that any
string of values $X_{s}, X_{s+1}, ...,X_{s+m}$ is deterministically independent
of past and future values. There are no correlations between any values of the
sequence. We show that this kind of dynamics can be generated using a recently
constructed optical device composed of several Mach--Zehnder interferometers.
Quasiperiodic signals can be transformed into random dynamics using nonlinear
circuits. We present the results of real experiments with nonlinear circuits
that simulate exponential and sine functions.
