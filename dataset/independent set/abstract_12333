We study the incompressible limit of the compressible non-isentropic
magnetohydrodynamic equations with zero magnetic diffusivity and general
initial data in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ $(d=2,3)$. We first establish
the existence of classic solutions on a time interval independent of the Mach
number. Then, by deriving uniform a priori estimates, we obtain the convergence
of the solution to that of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations as
the Mach number tends to zero.
