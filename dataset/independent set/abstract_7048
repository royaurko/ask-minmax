Thurston introduced $\si_d$-invariant laminations (where $\si_d(z)$ coincides
with $z^d:\ucirc\to \ucirc$, $d\ge 2$). He defined \emph{wandering $k$-gons} as
sets $\T\subset \ucirc$ such that $\si_d^n(\T)$ consists of $k\ge 3$ distinct
points for all $n\ge 0$ and the convex hulls of all the sets $\si_d^n(\T)$ in
the plane are pairwise disjoint. Thurston proved that $\si_2$ has no wandering
$k$-gons and posed the problem of their existence for $\si_d$,\, $d\ge 3$. Call
a lamination with wandering $k$-gons a \emph{WT-lamination}. Denote the set of
cubic critical portraits by $\A_3$. A critical portrait, compatible with a
WT-lamination, is called a \emph{WT-critical portrait}; let $\WT_3$ be the set
of all of them. It was recently shown by the contributors that cubic WT-laminations
exist and cubic WT-critical portraits, defining polynomials with
\emph{condense} orbits of vertices of order three in their dendritic Julia
sets, are dense and locally uncountable in $\A_3$ ($D\subset X$ is
\emph{condense in $X$} if $D$ intersects every subcontinuum of $X$). Here we
show that $\WT_3$ is a dense first category subset of $\A_3$. We also show that
(a) critical portraits, whose laminations have a condense orbit in the
topological Julia set, form a residual subset of $\A_3$, (b) the existence of a
condense orbit in the Julia set $J$ implies that $J$ is locally connected.
