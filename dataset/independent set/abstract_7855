Numerical integration formulas in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space of degree
three are discussed. For the integrals with permutation symmetry we present a
method to construct its third-degree integration formulas with $2n$ real
points. We present a decomposition method and only need to deal with $n$
one-dimensional moment problems independently.
