We present a new method for algebraic independence results in the context of
Mahler's method. In particular, our method uses the asymptotic behaviour of a
Mahler function $f(z)$ as $z$ goes radially to a root of unity to deduce
algebraic independence results about the values of $f(z)$ at algebraic numbers.
We apply our method to the canonical example of a degree two Mahler function;
that is, we apply it to $F(z)$, the power series solution to the functional
equation $F(z)-(1+z+z^2)F(z^4)+z^4F(z^{16})=0$. Specifically, we prove that the
functions $F(z)$, $F(z^4)$, $F'(z)$, and $F'(z^4)$ are algebraically
independent over $\mathbb{C}(z)$. An application of a celebrated result of
Nishioka then allows one to replace $\mathbb{C}(z)$ by $\mathbb{Q}$ when
evaluating these functions at a nonzero algebraic number $\alpha$ in the unit
disc.
