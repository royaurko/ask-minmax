Sterile neutrinos with masses in the keV range are viable candidates for the
warm dark matter. We analyze existing data for the extragalactic diffuse X-ray
background for signatures of sterile neutrino decay. The absence of detectable
signal within current uncertainties of background measurements puts
model-independent constraints on allowed values of sterile neutrino mass and
mixing angle, which we present in this work.
