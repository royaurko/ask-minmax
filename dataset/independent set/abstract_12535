We study baryons as three-body systems using the QCD degrees of freedom in
the framework of covariant Bethe-Salpeter equations. The interaction among
quarks is reduced to a vector-vector interaction via a single dressed-gluon
exchange (Rainbow-Ladder truncation). The formalism allows for the study of the
hadron spectrum as well as their internal properties. We will present the
calculation of electromagnetic properties of spin-3/2 baryons. The model
independent features of our results are assessed using two different models for
the dressings.
