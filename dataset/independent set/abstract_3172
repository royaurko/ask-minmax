The Lead Radius Experiment (PREX) has provided the first model-independent
evidence in favor of a neutron-rich skin in ${}^{208}$Pb. Although the error
bars are large, the reported large central value of 0.33\,fm is particularly
intriguing. To test whether such a thick neutron-skin in ${}^{208}$Pb is
already incompatible with laboratory experiments or astrophysical observations,
we employ relativistic models with neutron-skin thickness in ${}^{208}$Pb
ranging from 0.16 to 0.33 fm to compute ground state properties of finite
nuclei, their collective monopole and dipole response, and mass-{\sl vs}-radius
relations for neutron stars. No compelling reason was found to rule out models
with large neutron skins in ${}^{208}$Pb from the set of observables considered
in this work.
