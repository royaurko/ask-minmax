It is shown, using high-precision numerical simulations, that the mobility
edge of the 3d Anderson model depends on the boundary hopping term t in the
infinite size limit. The critical exponent is independent of it. The
renormalized localization length at the critical point is also found to depend
on t but not on the distribution of on-site energies for box and Lorentzian
distributions. Implications of results for the description of the transition in
terms of a local order-parameter are discussed.
