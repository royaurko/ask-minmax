This paper is directed towards combining Pearl's structural-model approach to
causal reasoning with high-level formalisms for reasoning about actions. More
precisely, we present a combination of Pearl's structural-model approach with
Poole's independent choice logic. We show how probabilistic theories in the
independent choice logic can be mapped to probabilistic causal models. This
mapping provides the independent choice logic with appealing concepts of
causality and explanation from the structural-model approach. We illustrate
this along Halpern and Pearl's sophisticated notions of actual cause,
explanation, and partial explanation. This mapping also adds first-order
modeling capabilities and explicit actions to the structural-model approach.
