In proof theory the notion of canonical proof is rather basic, and it is
usually taken for granted that a canonical proof of a sentence must be unique
up to certain minor syntactical details (such as, e.g., change of bound
variables). When setting up a proof theory for equality one is faced with a
rather unexpected situation where there may not be a unique canonical proof of
an equality statement. Indeed, in a (1994--5) proposal for the formalisation of
proofs of propositional equality in the Curry--Howard style, we have already
uncovered such a peculiarity. Totally independently, and in a different
setting, Hofmann & Streicher (1994) have shown how to build a model of
Martin-L\"of's Type Theory in which uniqueness of canonical proofs of identity
types does not hold. The intention here is to show that, by considering as
sequences of rewrites and substitution, it comes a rather natural fact that two
(or more) distinct proofs may be yet canonical and are none to be preferred
over one another. By looking at proofs of equality as rewriting (or
computational) paths this approach will be in line with the recently proposed
connections between type theory and homotopy theory via identity types, since
elements of identity types will be, concretely, paths (or homotopies).
