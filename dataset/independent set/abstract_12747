The $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ transition form factors in the space-like region
are analyzed at low and intermediate energies in a model-independent way
through the use of rational approximants. The slope and curvature parameters of
the form factors as well as their values at infinity are extracted from
experimental data. The impact of these results on the mixing parameters of the
$\eta$-$\eta^\prime$ system are also discussed.
