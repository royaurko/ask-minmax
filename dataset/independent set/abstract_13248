We explore skewed parton distributions for two-body, light-front wave
functions. In order to access all kinematical regimes, we adopt a covariant
Bethe-Salpeter approach, which makes use of the underlying equation of motion
(here the Weinberg equation) and its Green's function. Such an approach allows
for the consistent treatment of the non-wave function vertex (but rules out the
case of phenomenological wave functions derived from ad hoc potentials). Our
investigation centers around checking internal consistency by demonstrating
time-reversal invariance and continuity between valence and non-valence
regimes. We derive our expressions by assuming the effective qq potential is
independent of the mass squared, and verify the sum rule in a non-relativistic
approximation in which the potential is energy independent. We consider
bare-coupling as well as interacting skewed parton distributions and develop
approximations for the Green's function which preserve the general properties
of these distributions. Lastly we apply our approach to time-like form factors
and find similar expressions for the related generalized distribution
amplitudes.
