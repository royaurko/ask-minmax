Dirac equation is solved in the near horizon limit geometry of an extreme
Kerr black hole. We decouple equations first as usual, into an axial and
angular part. The axial equation turns out to be independent of the mass and is
solved exactly. The angular equation reduces, in the massless case, to a
confluent Heun equation. In general for nonzero mass, the angular equation is
expressible at best, as a set of coupled first order differential equations apt
for numerical investigation. The axial potentials corresponding to the
associated Schrodinger-type equations and their conserved currents are found.
Finally, based on our solution, we verify in a similar way the absence of
superradiance for Dirac particles in the near horizon, a result which is
well-known within the context of general Kerr background.
