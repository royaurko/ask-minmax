Turbulence in superfluids depends crucially on the dissipative damping in
vortex motion. This is observed in the B phase of superfluid 3He where the
dynamics of quantized vortices changes radically in character as a function of
temperature. An abrupt transition to turbulence is the most peculiar
consequence. As distinct from viscous hydrodynamics, this transition to
turbulence is not governed by the velocity-dependent Reynolds number, but by a
velocity-independent dimensionless parameter 1/q which depends only on the
temperature-dependent mutual friction -- the dissipation which sets in when
vortices move with respect to the normal excitations of the liquid. At large
friction and small values of 1/q < 1 the dynamics is vortex number conserving,
while at low friction and large 1/q > 1 vortices are easily destabilized and
proliferate in number. A new measuring technique was employed to identify this
hydrodynamic transition: the injection of a tight bundle of many small vortex
loops in applied vortex-free flow at relatively high velocities. These vortices
are ejected from a vortex sheet covering the AB interface when a two-phase
sample of 3He-A and 3He-B is set in rotation and the interface becomes unstable
at a critical rotation velocity, triggered by the superfluid Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability.
