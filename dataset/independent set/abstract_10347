12 Bootis is a double-lined spectroscopic binary whose orbit has been
resolved by interferometry. We present a detailed modelling of the system and
show that the available observational constraints can be reproduced by models
at different evolutionary stages, depending on the details of extra-mixing
processes acting in the central regions. In order to discriminate among these
theoretical scenarios, additional and independent observational constraints are
needed: we show that these could be provided by solar-like oscillations, that
are expected to be excited in both system components.
