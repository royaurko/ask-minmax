We obtain optical instabilities in all-optical bistable systems arising from
competing cooperative pathways at low input light levels. In particular for
three-level atomic systems in the lambda and V configuration interacting with
two independent cavity modes, we identify the necessary conditions related to
the incoherent pathways required to obtain instabilities. The instabilities
arise when atomic states involved in the bistable transition are leaky and have
substantial population, where the incoherent processes adversely affect the
cooperative behavior of the atomic ensemble.
