We propose criteria that define a trend for time series with inherent
multi-scale features. We call this trend the {\it tendency} of a time series.
The tendency is defined empirically by a set of criteria and captures the
large-scale temporal variability of the original signal as well as the most
frequent events in its histogram. Among other properties, the tendency has a
variance no larger than that of the original signal; the histogram of the
difference between the original signal and the tendency is as symmetric as
possible; and with reduced complexity, the tendency captures essential features
of the signal.
  To find the tendency we first use the Intrinsic Time-Scale Decomposition
(ITD) of the signal, introduced in 2007 by Frei and Osorio, to produce a set of
candidate tendencies. We then apply the criteria to each of the candidates to
single out the one that best agrees with them.
  While the criteria for the tendency are independent of the signal
decomposition scheme, it is found that the ITD is a simple and stable
methodology, well suited for multi-scale signals. The ITD is a relatively new
decomposition and little is known about its outcomes. In this study we take the
first steps towards a probabilistic model of the ITD analysis of random time
series. This analysis yields details concerning the universality and scaling
properties of the components of the decomposition.
