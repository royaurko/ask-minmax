In some recent work, fractal curvatures C^f_k(F) and fractal curvature
measures C^f_k(F, .), k = 0, ..., d, have been determined for all self-similar
sets F in R^d, for which the parallel neighborhoods satisfy a certain
regularity condition and a certain rather technical curvature bound. The
regularity condition is conjectured to be always satisfied, while the curvature
bound has recently been shown to fail in some concrete examples. As a step
towards a better understanding of its meaning, we discuss several equivalent
formulations of the curvature bound condition and also a very natural
technically simpler condition which turns out to be stronger. These
reformulations show that the validity this condition does not depend on the
choice of the open set and the constant $R$ appearing in the condition and
allow to discuss some concrete examples of self-similar sets. In particular, it
is shown that the class of sets satisfying the curvature bound condition is
strictly larger than the class of sets satisfying the assumption of
polyconvexity used in earlier results.
