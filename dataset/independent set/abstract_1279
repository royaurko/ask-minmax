The multivariate covering lemma states that given a collection of $k$
codebooks, each of sufficiently large cardinality and independently generated
according to one of the marginals of a joint distribution, one can always
choose one codeword from each codebook such that the resulting $k$-tuple of
codewords is jointly typical with respect to the joint distribution. We give a
proof of this lemma for weakly typical sets. This allows achievability proofs
that rely on the covering lemma to go through for continuous channels (e.g.,
Gaussian) without the need for quantization. The covering lemma and its
converse are widely used in information theory, including in rate-distortion
theory and in achievability results for multi-user channels.
