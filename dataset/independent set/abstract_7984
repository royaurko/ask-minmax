We consider the complexity of Delaunay triangulations of sets of points in
R^3 under certain practical geometric constraints. The spread of a set of
points is the ratio between the longest and shortest pairwise distances. We
show that in the worst case, the Delaunay triangulation of n points in R^3 with
spread D has complexity Omega(min{D^3, nD, n^2}) and O(min{D^4, n^2}). For the
case D = Theta(sqrt{n}), our lower bound construction consists of a uniform
sample of a smooth convex surface with bounded curvature. We also construct a
family of smooth connected surfaces such that the Delaunay triangulation of any
good point sample has near-quadratic complexity.
