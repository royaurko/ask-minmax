Bell's theorem for systems more complicated than two qubits faces a hidden,
as yet undiscussed, problem. One of the methods to derive Bell's inequalities
is to assume existence of joint probability distribution for measurement
results for all settings in the given experiment. However for spins-1, one
faces the problem that eigenvalues of observables do not allow a consistent
algebra if one allows all possible settings on each side (Bell 1966
contradiction), or some specific sets (leading to a Kochen-Specker 1967
contradiction). We show here that by choosing special set of settings which
never lead to inconsistent algebra of eigenvalues, one can still derive
multisetting Bell inequalities, and that they are robustly violated. Violation
factors increase with the number of subsystems. The inequalities involve only
spin observables, we do not allow all possible qutrit observables, still the
violations are strong.
