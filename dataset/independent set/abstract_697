In recent years, there has been considerable interest in estimating
conditional independence graphs in the high-dimensional setting. Most prior
work has assumed that the variables are multivariate Gaussian, or that the
conditional means of the variables are linear. Unfortunately, if these
assumptions are violated, then the resulting conditional independence estimates
can be inaccurate. We present a semi-parametric method, SpaCE JAM, which allows
the conditional means of the features to take on an arbitrary additive form. We
present an efficient algorithm for its computation, and prove that our
estimator is consistent. We also extend our method to estimation of directed
graphs with known causal ordering. Using simulated data, we show that SpaCE JAM
enjoys superior performance to existing methods when there are non-linear
relationships among the features, and is comparable to methods that assume
multivariate normality when the conditional means are linear. We illustrate our
method on a cell-signaling data set.
