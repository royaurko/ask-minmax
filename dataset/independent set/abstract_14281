We review and extend here some recent results on the existence of minimal
surfaces and isoperimetric sets in non homogeneous and anisotropic periodic
media. We also describe the qualitative properties of the homogenized surface
tension, also known as stable norm (or minimal action) in Weak KAM theory. In
particular we investigate its strict convexity and differentiability
properties.
