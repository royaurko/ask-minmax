We adopt an empirical approach to the characterization of the distribution of
twin primes within the set of primes, rather than in the set of all natural
numbers. The occurrences of twin primes in any finite sequence of primes are
like fixed probability random events. As the sequence of primes grows, the
probability decreases as the reciprocal of the count of primes to that point.
The manner of the decrease is consistent with the Hardy--Littlewood Conjecture,
the Prime Number Theorem, and the Twin Prime Conjecture. Furthermore, our
probabilistic model, is simply parameterized. We discuss a simple test which
indicates the consistency of the model extrapolated outside of the range in
which it was constructed.
