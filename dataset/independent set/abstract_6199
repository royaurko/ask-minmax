Voronoi cells of a discrete set in Euclidean space are known as generalized
polyhedra. We identify polyhedral cells of a discrete set through a direction
cone. For an arbitrary set we distinguish polyhedral from non-polyhedral cells
using inversion at a sphere and a theorem of semi-infinite linear programming.
