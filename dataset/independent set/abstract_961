The complete list of definitions for quantities relevant in the analysis of
SLD/LEP-1 results around the Z-resonance is given. The common set of
conventions adopted by the programs TOPAZ0 and ZFITTER, following the
recommendations of the LEP electroweak working group, is reviewed. The
relevance of precision calculations is discussed in detail both for
pseudo-observables (PO) and for realistic observables (RO). The
model-independent approach is also discussed. A critical assessment is given of
the comparison between TOPAZ0 and ZFITTER.
