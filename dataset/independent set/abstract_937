We recast the problem of infinite neutral nonrelativistic matter interacting
via U(1) gauge fields in the hydrodynamic language. We treat the nuclei as
being spinless bosons for simplicity(for example in He4). We write down the
formal action in terms of a full set of independent gauge invariant
hydrodynamic variables.
 The claim is that the results of this theory are nonperturbative and nuclei
and electrons are treated on an equal footing.
