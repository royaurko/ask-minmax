We show that warm dark matter keV fermions (`inos') can be responsible for
both core and halo galactic structure, in agreement with current
astrophysical/cosmological constraints. We identify the inos with sterile
right-handed neutrinos. The possible mass range of up to a few tens of keV,
obtained independently from the galactic structure and dark matter
astroparticle physics, points towards an important role of the right-handed
neutrinos in the cosmic structure.
