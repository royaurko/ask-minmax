We describe a system for rapidly measuring the brightness of the night sky
using a mosaic of CCD images obtained with a low-cost automated system. The
portable system produces millions of independent photometric measurements
covering the entire sky, enabling the detailed characterization of natural sky
conditions and light domes produced by cities. The measurements are calibrated
using images of standard stars contained within the raw data, producing results
closely tracking the Johnson V astronomical standard. The National Park Service
has collected hundreds of data sets at numerous parks since 2001 and is using
these data for the protection and monitoring of the night-sky visual resource.
This system also allows comprehensive characterization of sky conditions at
astronomical observatories. We explore photometric issues raised by the
broadband measurement of the complex and variable night-sky spectrum, and
potential indices of night-sky quality.
