Let L be a compact convex set in R^n, and let 1 <= d <= n-1. The set L is
defined to be d-decomposable if L is a direct Minkowski sum (affine Cartesian
product) of two or more convex bodies each of dimension at most d. A compact
convex set L is called d-reliable if, whenever each d-dimensional orthogonal
projection of L contains a translate of the corresponding d-dimensional
projection of a compact convex set K, it must follow that L contains a
translate of K.
  It is shown that, for 1 <= d <= n-1:
  (1) d-decomposability implies d-reliability.
  (2) A compact convex set L in R^n is d-reliable if and only if, for all m >=
d+2, no m unit normals to regular boundary points of L form the outer unit
normals of a (m-1)-dimensional simplex.
  (3) Smooth convex bodies are not d-reliable.
  (4) A compact convex set L in R^n is 1-reliable if and only if L is
1-decomposable (i.e. a parallelotope).
  (5) A centrally symmetric compact convex set L in R^n is 2-reliable if and
only if L is 2-decomposable. However, there are non-centered 2-reliable convex
bodies that are not 2-decomposable.
