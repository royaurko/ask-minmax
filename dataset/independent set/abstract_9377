Let $\xi_i$, $i\in \mathbb {N}$, be independent copies of a L\'{e}vy process
$\{\xi(t),t\geq0\}$. Motivated by the results obtained previously in the
context of the random energy model, we prove functional limit theorems for the
process \[Z_N(t)=\sum_{i=1}^N\mathrm{e}^{\xi_i(s_N+t)}\] as $N\to\infty$, where
$s_N$ is a non-negative sequence converging to $+\infty$. The limiting process
depends heavily on the growth rate of the sequence $s_N$. If $s_N$ grows slowly
in the sense that $\liminf_{N\to\infty}\log N/s_N>\lambda_2$ for some critical
value $\lambda_2>0$, then the limit is an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process. However,
if $\lambda:=\lim_{N\to\infty}\log N/s_N\in(0,\lambda_2)$, then the limit is a
certain completely asymmetric $\alpha$-stable process $\mathbb {Y}_{\alpha
;\xi}$.
