We consider a large number of text data sets. These are cooking recipes. Term
distribution and other distributional properties of the data are investigated.
Our aim is to look at various analytical approaches which allow for mining of
information on both high and low detail scales. Metric space embedding is
fundamental to our interest in the semantic properties of this data. We
consider the projection of all data into analyses of aggregated versions of the
data. We contrast that with projection of aggregated versions of the data into
analyses of all the data. Analogously for the term set, we look at analysis of
selected terms. We also look at inherent term associations such as between
singular and plural. In addition to our use of Correspondence Analysis in R,
for latent semantic space mapping, we also use Apache Solr. Setting up the Solr
server and carrying out querying is described. A further novelty is that
querying is supported in Solr based on the principal factor plane mapping of
all the data. This uses a bounding box query, based on factor projections.
