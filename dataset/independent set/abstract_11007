We show that the nonperturbative solution of the SU(2) linear sigma model
field theory requires color number Nc=3. Also, we show that the three-point and
four-point functions bootstrap (or nonperturbatively ``shrink'') in the chiral
limit to the tree amplitudes. Independently, we show that a chiral phase
transition for Nf=2 requires Tc=180 MeV, consistent with the computer lattice
value (173 +/- 8 MeV).
