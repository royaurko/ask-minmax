We present recent LHCb results and future prospects for CP violation and
mixing measurements in multi-body charm decays. The complex amplitude structure
of multi-body decays provides unique sensitivity to CP violation localised in
certain phase space regions. A model-independent search in the phase space of
D->pi+pi-pi+pi- and D->K+K-pi+pi- decays showed no evidence for localised CP
violation. If one assumes the no CP violation hypothesis, the probability of
getting the observed results is 9.1% and 41%, respectively.
  The model-independent determination of gamma from B->DK requires external
input to account for the interference of D0 and D0bar amplitudes to the same
final state. Previously this input could only be obtained at the charm
threshold, but recently it has been proposed that D mixing can provide
complimentary information. For the example of D->K+pi-pi+pi- decays, it is
shown that charm mixing can be used to considerably improve current constraints
on the coherence factor and average strong phase difference, with existing
data.
