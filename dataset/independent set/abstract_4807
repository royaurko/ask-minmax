If ZFC is consistent, then each of the following are consistent with ZFC +
2^{{aleph_0}}= aleph_2 :
  1.) X subseteq R is of strong measure zero iff |X| <= aleph_1 + there is a
generalized Sierpinski set.
  2.) The union of aleph_1 many strong measure zero sets is a strong measure
zero set + there is a strong measure zero set of size aleph_2.
