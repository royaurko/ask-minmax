A graph is strongly even-cycle decomposable if the edge set of every
subdivision with an even number of edges can be partitioned into cycles of even
length. We prove that several fundamental composition operations that preserve
the property of being Eulerian also yield strongly even-cycle decomposable
graphs. As an easy application of our theorems, we give an exact
characterization of the set of strongly even-cycle decomposable cographs.
