A procedure that allows to obtain the dynamics of $N$ independent bodies each
locally interacting with its own reservoir is presented. It relies on the
knowledge of single body dynamics and it is valid for any form of environment
noise. It is then applied to the study of non-Markovian dynamics of two
independent qubits, each locally interacting with a zero temperature reservoir.
It is shown that, although no interaction is present or mediated between the
qubits, there is a revival of their entanglement, after a finite period of time
of its complete disappearance.
