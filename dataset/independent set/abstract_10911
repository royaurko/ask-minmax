Recent data point in the direction of a cosmological constant dominated
universe. We investigate the role of supersymmetric QCD with N_f < N_c as a
possible candidate for dynamical cosmological constant (``quintessence''). We
take in full consideration the multi-scalar nature of the model, allowing for
different initial conditions for the N_f independent scalar VEVs and studying
the coupled system of N_f equations of motion. The issues related to the
coupling of the scalars with other cosmological fields are also addressed.
