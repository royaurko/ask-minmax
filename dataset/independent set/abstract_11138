Dependence on the gauge parameters is an important issue in gauge theories:
physical quantities have to be independent. Extending BRS transformations by
variation of the gauge parameter into a Grassmann variable one can control
gauge parameter dependence algebraically. As application we discuss the anomaly
coefficient in the Slavnov-Taylor identity, $S$-matrix elements, the vector
two-point-function and the coefficients of renormalization group and
Callan-Symanzik equation.
