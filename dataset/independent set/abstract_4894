We have observed high-contrast matter wave interference between 30
Bose-Einstein condensates with uncorrelated phases. Interference patterns were
observed after independent condensates were released from a one-dimensional
optical lattice and allowed to expand and overlap. This initially surprising
phenomenon is explained with a simple theoretical model which generalizes the
analysis of the interference of two independent condensates.
