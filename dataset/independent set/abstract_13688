Grothendieck's conjecture on p-curvatures predicts that an arithmetic
differential equation has a full set of algebraic solutions if and only if its
reduction in positive characteristic has a full set of rational solutions for
almost all finite places. It is equivalent to Katz's conjectural description of
the generic Galois group. In this paper we prove an analogous statement for
arithmetic q-difference equation.
