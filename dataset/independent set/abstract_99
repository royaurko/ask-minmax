A fullerene graph is a cubic bridgeless plane graph with all faces of size 5
and 6. We show that that every fullerene graph on n vertices can be made
bipartite by deleting at most sqrt{12n/5} edges, and has an independent set
with at least n/2-sqrt{3n/5} vertices. Both bounds are sharp, and we
characterise the extremal graphs. This proves conjectures of Doslic and
Vukicevic, and of Daugherty. We deduce two further conjectures on the
independence number of fullerene graphs, as well as a new upper bound on the
smallest eigenvalue of a fullerene graph.
