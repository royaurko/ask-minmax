The variation distance closure of an exponential family with a convex set of
canonical parameters is described, assuming no regularity conditions. The tools
are the concepts of convex core of a measure and extension of an exponential
family, introduced previously by the contributors, and a new concept of accessible
faces of a convex set. Two other closures related to the information divergence
are also characterized.
