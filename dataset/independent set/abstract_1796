Consider the setting of \emph{randomly weighted graphs}, namely, graphs whose
edge weights are chosen independently according to probability distributions
with finite support over the non-negative reals. Under this setting, properties
of weighted graphs typically become random variables and we are interested in
computing their statistical features. Unfortunately, this turns out to be
computationally hard for some properties albeit the problem of computing them
in the traditional setting of algorithmic graph theory is tractable. For
example, there are well known efficient algorithms that compute the
\emph{diameter} of a given weighted graph, yet, computing the \emph{expected}
diameter of a given randomly weighted graph is \SharpP{}-hard even if the edge
weights are identically distributed. In this paper, we define a family of
properties of weighted graphs and show that for each property in this family,
the problem of computing the \emph{$k^{\text{th}}$ moment} (and in particular,
the expected value) of the corresponding random variable in a given randomly
weighted graph $G$ admits a \emph{fully polynomial time randomized
approximation scheme (FPRAS)} for every fixed $k$. This family includes
fundamental properties of weighted graphs such as the diameter of $G$, the
\emph{radius} of $G$ (with respect to any designated vertex) and the weight of
a \emph{minimum spanning tree} of $G$.
