It is known that diffusion provokes substantial changes in continuous
absorbing phase transitions. Conversely, its effect on discontinuous
transitions is much less understood. In order to shed light in this direction,
we study the inclusion of diffusion in the simplest one-dimensional model with
a discontinuous absorbing phase transition, namely the long-range contact
process ($\sigma$-CP). Particles interact as in the usual CP, but the
transition rate depends on the length $\ell$ of inactive sites according to $1
+ a \ell^{-\sigma}$, where $a$ and $\sigma$ are control parameters. In the
absence of diffusion, this system presents both a discontinuous and a
continuous phase transition, depending on the value of $\sigma$. The inclusion
of diffusion in this model has been investigated by numerical simulations and
mean-field calculations. Results show that there exists three distinct regimes.
For sufficiently low and large $\sigma$'s the transition is respectively always
discontinuous or continuous, independently of the strength of the diffusion. On
the other hand, in an intermediate range of $\sigma$'s, the diffusion causes a
suppression of the phase coexistence leading to a continuous transition
belonging to the DP universality class. This set of results does not agree with
mean-field predictions, whose reasons will be discussed further.
