We explore the device potential of tunable-gap bilayer graphene FET
exploiting the possibility of opening a bandgap in bilayer graphene by applying
a vertical electric field via independent gate operation. We evaluate device
behavior using atomistic simulations based on the self-consistent solution of
the Poisson and Schroedinger equations within the NEGF formalism. We show that
the concept works, but bandgap opening is not strong enough to suppress
band-to-band tunneling in order to obtain a sufficiently large Ion/Ioff ratio
for CMOS device operation.
