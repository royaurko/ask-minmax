Multistable L\'evy motions are extensions of L\'evy motions where the
stability index is allowed to vary in time. Several constructions of these
processes have been introduced recently, based on Poisson and
Ferguson-Klass-LePage series representations and on multistable measures. In
this work, we prove a functional central limit theorem for the
independent-increments multistable L\'evy motion, as well as of integrals with
respect to these processes, using weighted sums of independent random
variables. This allows us to construct continuous approximations of multistable
L\'evy motions. In particular, we prove that multistable L\'evy motions are
stochastic H\"older continuous and strongly localisable.
