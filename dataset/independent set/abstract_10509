Pulsed-laser deposition has been used to grow epitaxial thin films of the
giant-dielectric-constant material CaCu_3Ti_4O_{12} on LaAlO_3 and SrTiO_3
substrates with or without various conducting buffer layers. The latter include
YBa_2Cu_3O_7, La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4+\delta} and LaNiO_3. Above 100K - 150K
the thin films have a temperature independent dielectric constant as do single
crystals. The value of the dielectric constant is of the order of 1500 over a
wide temperature region, potentially making it a good candidate for many
applications. The frequency dependence of its dielectric properties below 100K
- 150K indicates an activated relaxation process.
