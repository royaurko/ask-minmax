Mandelbrot multiplicative cascades provide a construction of a dynamical
system on a set of probability measures defined by inequalities on moments. To
be more specific, beyond the first iteration, the trajectories take values in
the set of fixed points of smoothing transformations (i.e., some generalized
stable laws).
  Studying this system leads to a central limit theorem and to its functional
version. The limit Gaussian process can also be obtained as limit of an
`additive cascade' of independent normal variables.
