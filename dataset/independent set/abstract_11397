Investigated is the relativistic periodic Toda chain, to each site of which
the ultra-local Weyl algebra is associated. Weyl's $q$ we are considering here
is restricted to be inside the unit circle. Quantum Lax operators of the model
are intertwined by six vertex $R$-matrix. Both independent Baxter's
$Q$-operators are constructed explicitly as seria over local Weyl generators.
The operator-valued wronskian of $Q$-s is also calculated.
