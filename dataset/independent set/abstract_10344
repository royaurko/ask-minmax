A model independent analysis shows that the running of the spectral index of
the three year WMAP results can be nicely realized in noncommutative inflation.
We also re-examine some concrete noncommutative inflation models. We find that
a large tensor-scalar ratio is required, corresponding to a low number of
e-folds before the end of inflation in some simple models.
