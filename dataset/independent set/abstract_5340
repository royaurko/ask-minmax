We study the spread of stochastic SIR (Susceptible $\to$ Infectious $\to$
Recovered) epidemics in two types of structured populations, both consisting of
schools and households. In each of the types, every individual is part of one
school and one household. In the independent partition model, the partitions of
the population into schools and households are independent of each other. This
model corresponds to the well-studied household-workplace model. In the
hierarchical model which we introduce here, members of the same household are
also members of the same school.
  We introduce computable branching process approximations for both types of
populations and use these to compare the probabilities of a large outbreak. The
branching process approximation in the hierarchical model is novel and of
independent interest. We prove by a coupling argument that if all households
and schools have the same size, an epidemic spreads easier (in the sense that
the number of individuals infected is stochastically larger) in the independent
partition model. We also show by example that this result does not necessarily
hold if households and/or schools do not all have the same size.
