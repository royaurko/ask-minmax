A coupled system of two generalized logistic maps is studied. In particular
influence of the coupling to the behaviour of the Julia set in two dimensional
complex space is analyzed both analytically and numerically. It is proved
analytically that the Julia set disappears from the complex plane uniformly as
a parameter interpolates from the chaotic phase to the integrable phase, if the
coupling strength satisfies a certain condition.
