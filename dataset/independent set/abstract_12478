We fabricate MoS2 field effect transistors on both SiO2 and polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA) dielectrics and measure charge carrier mobility in a
four-probe configuration. For multilayer MoS2 on SiO2, the mobility is 30-60
cm2/Vs, relatively independent of thickness (15-90 nm), and most devices
exhibit unipolar n-type behavior. In contrast, multilayer MoS2 on PMMA shows
mobility increasing with thickness, up to 470 cm2/Vs (electrons) and 480 cm2/Vs
(holes) at thickness ~50 nm. The dependence of the mobility on thickness points
to a long-range dielectric effect of the bulk MoS2 in increasing mobility.
