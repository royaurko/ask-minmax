Derrick's theorem on the nonexistence of stable time-independent scalar field
configurations [G. H. Derrick, J. Math. Phys. 5, 1252 (1964)] is generalized to
finite systems of arbitrary dimension. It is shown that the "dilation" argument
underlying the theorem hinges upon the fulfillment of specific Neumann boundary
conditions, providing thus new means of evading it without resorting to
time-dependence or additional fields of higher spin. The theorem in its
original form is only recovered when the boundary conditions are such that both
the gradient and potential energies vanish at the boundaries, in which case it
establishes the nonexistence of stable time-independent solutions in finite
systems of more than two spatial dimensions.
