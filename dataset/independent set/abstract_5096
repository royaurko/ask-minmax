We study autonomous Tonelli Lagrangians on closed surfaces. We aim to clarify
the relationship between the Aubry set and the Mather set, when the latter
consists of periodic orbits which are not fixed points. Our main result says
that in that case the Aubry set and the Mather set almost always coincide.
