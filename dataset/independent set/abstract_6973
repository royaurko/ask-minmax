We report about the current state and designated features of the tool
SeaLion, aimed to serve as an integrated development environment (IDE) for
answer-set programming (ASP). A main goal of SeaLion is to provide a
user-friendly environment for supporting a developer to write, evaluate, debug,
and test answer-set programs. To this end, new support techniques have to be
developed that suit the requirements of the answer-set semantics and meet the
constraints of practical applicability. In this respect, SeaLion benefits from
the research results of a project on methods and methodologies for answer-set
program development in whose context SeaLion is realised. Currently, the tool
provides source-code editors for the languages of Gringo and DLV that offer
syntax highlighting, syntax checking, and a visual program outline. Further
implemented features are support for external solvers and visualisation as well
as visual editing of answer sets. SeaLion comes as a plugin of the popular
Eclipse platform and provides itself interfaces for future extensions of the
IDE.
