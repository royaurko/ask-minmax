An approximate hadronic symmetry based on spin and flavor independence and
broken by spin and mass dependent terms is shown to follow from QCD. This
symmetry justifies the SU(6) classification scheme, but is more general in
allowing its supersymmetric extension based on a diquark-antiquark symmetry. It
will be shown that the same supersymmetry is also implied in the skyrmion type
effective Lagrangian which could be extracted from QCD. Predictions of the
Skyrme model is improved by using different realizations of the chiral group.
