We introduce property-independent kernels for machine learning modeling of
arbitrarily many molecular properties. The kernels encode molecular structures
for training sets of varying size, as well as similarity measures sufficiently
diffuse in chemical space to sample over all training molecules. Corresponding
molecular reference properties provided, they enable the instantaneous
generation of ML models which can systematically be improved through the
addition of more data. This idea is exemplified for single kernel based
modeling of internal energy, enthalpy, free energy, heat capacity,
polarizability, electronic spread, zero-point vibrational energy, energies of
frontier orbitals, HOMO-LUMO gap, and the highest fundamental vibrational
wavenumber. Models of these properties are trained and tested using 112 kilo
organic molecules of similar size. Resulting models are discussed as well as
the kernels' use for generating and using other property models.
