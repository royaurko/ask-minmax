A new semiempirical formula, with only three parameters, is proposed for
cluster decay half-lives. The parameters of the formula are obtained by making
a least square fit to the available experimental data. The calculated
half-lives are compared with an other model-independent scaling law proposed
earlier by Horoi {\it et al}. Also, the calculated results of this formula are
compared with the recent results of the preformed cluster model for $^{12}$C
and $^{14}$C emissions from different deformed and superdeformed Nd and Gd
parents. The results are in good agreement with experiments as well as other
models.
