We present a Monte Carlo calculation for up to $N \sim 20 000$ bosons in 3 D
to determine the shift of the transition temperature due to small interactions
$a$. We generate independent configurations of the ideal gas. At finite $N$,
the superfluid density changes by a certain correlation function in the limit
$a \to 0$; the $N \to \infty$ limit is taken afterwards. We argue that our
result is independent of the order of limits. Detailed knowledge of the
non-interacting system for finite $N$ allows us to avoid finite-size scaling
assumptions.
