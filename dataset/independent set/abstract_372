We perform the most general model independent analysis of the latest 391-Day
Salt Phase SNO Data Set incorporating the Super-Kamiokande ES flux measurement
and obtain bounds on the antineutrino and sterile neutrino flux in the solar
$^{8}$B neutrino flux reaching the detectors on the earth. The muon/ tauon
antineutrino flux is found to be disallowed at 1.4$\sigma $ C.L. The sterile
flux is found to be non-zero at about 1.26 standard deviations.
