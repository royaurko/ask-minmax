The soft physics, pT < 2 GeV/c, observables at both RHIC and the SPS have now
been mapped out in quite specific detail. From these results there is mounting
evidence that this regime is primarily driven by the multiplicity per unit
rapidity, dNch/deta. This suggests that the entropy of the system alone is the
underlying driving force for many of the global observables measured in
heavy-ion collisions. That this is the case and there is an apparent
independence on collision energy is surprising. I present the evidence for this
multiplicity scaling and use it to make some extremely naive predictions for
the soft sector results at the LHC.
