It is shown how the S-matrix pinch technique may be extended to the cases of
external scalar and gauge boson fields. Using this extension, the universality
of the pinch technique gauge-independent one-loop gauge boson self-energy in a
general unbroken SU($N$) gauge theory is demonstrated explicitly.
