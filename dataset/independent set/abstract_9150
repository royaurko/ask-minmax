The nearly energy independent hadron emitter dimension $r$, measured in
$e^+e^-$ annihilation in the energy range 10 to 91 GeV via the Bose-Einstein
correlation of two identical charged pions, is shown to be well accounted for
by choosing the hadron jets as independent pion sources. To this end the known
normalised factorial cumulant moments dependence on particle sources is adapted
to the Bose-Einstein correlation formalism to yield a relation between $r$ and
these sources. This approach is also able to account for the measured $r$
values obtained for the $Z^0$ decays into two and three hadron jets. Finally
the estimated $r$ value of the hadronic $\Upsilon(9.46)$ decay via three gluons
is expected to be higher by about 6 to 11 % over that predicted for its one
photon hadronic decay mode.
