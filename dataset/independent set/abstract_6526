We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph that
can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the point set
has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include convex subsets of
lattices, points on two lines, and several other infinite families. As a
consequence, flip distance in such point sets can be computed efficiently.
