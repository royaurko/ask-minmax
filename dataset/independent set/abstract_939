We have studied the acoustoelectric current in single-electron pumps driven
by surface acoustic waves. We have found that in certain parameter ranges two
different sets of quantized steps dominate the acoustoelectric current versus
gate-voltage characteristics. In some cases, both types of quantized steps
appear simultaneously though at different current values, as if they were
superposed on each other. This could indicate two independent quantization
mechanisms for the acoustoelectric current.
