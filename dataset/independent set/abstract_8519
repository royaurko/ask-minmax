In this paper we develop a geometric approach to convex subdifferential
calculus in finite dimensions with employing some ideas of modern variational
analysis. This approach allows us to obtain natural and rather easy proofs of
basic results of convex subdifferential calculus in full generality and also
derive new results of convex analysis concerning marginal/value functions,
normal of inverse images of sets under set-valued mappings, calculus rules for
coderivatives of single-valued and set-valued mappings, and calculating
coderivatives of solution maps to convex generalized equations.
