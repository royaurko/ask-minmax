In network coding a constant dimension code consists of a set of
k-dimensional subspaces of F_q^n. Orbit codes are constant dimension codes
which are defined as orbits of a subgroup of the general linear group, acting
on the set of all subspaces of F_q^n. If the acting group is cyclic, the
corresponding orbit codes are called cyclic orbit codes. In this paper we give
a classification of cyclic orbit codes and propose a decoding procedure for a
particular subclass of cyclic orbit codes.
