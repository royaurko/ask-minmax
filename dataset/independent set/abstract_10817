We analyze constraints on low-energy flavour-changing sfermion mass terms,
coming from FCNC and CP violating processes, in the model-independent framework
of the mass insertion method. We discuss the relevance of these constraints as
tests of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model; in particular, we
consider grand-unified models and models with non-universal soft breaking
terms.
