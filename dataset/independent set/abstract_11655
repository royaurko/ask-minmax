We derive an expression for the determination of the apsidal angles that
holds good for arbitrary central potentials. Then we discuss under what
conditions the apsidal angles remain independent of the mechanical energy and
angular momentum in the central force problem. As a consequence, an alternative
and non-perturbative proof of Bertrand's theorem is obtained.
