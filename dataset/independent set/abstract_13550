A suite of relational notions of shape are presented at the level of
configuration space geometry, with corresponding new theories of shape
mechanics and shape statistics. These further generalize two quite well known
examples: -1) Kendall's (metric) shape space with his shape statistics and
Barbour's mechanics thereupon. 0) Leibnizian relational space alias metric
scale-and-shape space to which corresponds Barbour--Bertotti mechanics. This
paper's new theories include, using the invariant and group namings, 1) $Angle$
alias $conformal$ $shape$ $mechanics$. 2) $Area$ $ratio$ alias $affine$ $shape$
$mechanics$. 3) $Area$ alias $affine$ $scale$-$and$-$shape$ $mechanics$. 1) to
3) rest respectively on angle space, area-ratio space, and area space
configuration spaces. Affine shape matching and affine shape statistics are
argued to be of value to the theory of image analysis, as are in another sense
their projective counterparts which rest on the geometry of cross-ratio space
(another configuration space). The shape statistics of -1) and 0) are argued to
be of value in robotics.
  4) Various supersymmetric counterparts of -1) to 3) are considered. Since
supergravity differs considerably from GR-based conceptions of background
independence, some of the new supersymmetric shape mechanics are compared with
both. These reveal compatibility between supersymmetry and GR-based conceptions
of background independence, at least within these simpler model arenas.
