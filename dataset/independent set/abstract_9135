We derive model-independent constraints on four-fermion contact
interaction-type dynamics from the published preliminary LEP2 experimental data
on e^+e^- annihilation into \mu^+\mu^- and \tau^+\tau^- pairs, measured at
different energies between 130 and 207 GeV. The basic observables are chosen to
be the total cross section and the forward-backward asymmetry, and the analysis
realistically takes into account data uncertainties and correlations among
measurements at the various energies. The combination of data from different
energy points plays an important role in the determination of regions allowed
for the contact interaction coupling constants. In contrast to the more common
one-parameter analyses, we only obtain constraints on pairs of parameters
rather than limits on individual ones.
