We describe a one-dimensional disordered system, based on the Poschl-Teller
potential, that exhibits a continuum of extended states which is independent of
the random or correlated character of the sequence and of the length of the
system. The delocalization of the electronic states occurs in the whole
positive spectrum where the system shows a perfect transmission.
