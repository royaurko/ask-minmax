We have examined the directional cross-correlation of statistical `hot-spots'
between a Northern Sky TeV Gamma Ray Survey by the Milagro Observatory and a
similar survey by the Tibet Array. We find the directions of these hot-spots
are angularly uncorrelated between the two surveys for large angular
separations (Delta theta > 4 degrees), but there appears to be a statistically
significant correlation between hot-spot directions for Delta theta < 1.5
degrees. Independent simulations indicate the chance probability for the
occurrence of this correlation is approximately 10^-4, implying the existence
of one or more previously unobserved TeV gamma-ray sources in these directions.
The data sets are consistent with both point-like sources or diffuse sources
with extent of 1 - 2 degrees.
