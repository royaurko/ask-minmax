The critical boundaries separating ordered from chaotic behavior in randomly
wired S-state networks are calculated. These networks are a natural
generalization of random Boolean nets and are proposed as on extended approach
to genetic regulatory systems, sets of cells in different states or collectives
of agents engaged into a set of S possible tasks. A order parameter for the
transition is computed and analysed. The relevance of these networks to
biology, their relationships with standard cellular automata and possible
extensions are outlined.
