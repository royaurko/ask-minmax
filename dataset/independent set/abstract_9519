I report, emphasizing some key open issues and some aspects that are
particularly relevant for phenomenology, on the status of the development of
"doubly-special" relativistic ("DSR") theories with both an
observer-independent high-velocity scale and an observer-independent
small-length/large-momentum scale, possibly relevant for the
Planck-scale/quantum-gravity realm. I also give a true/false characterization
of the structure of these theories. In particular, I discuss a DSR scenario
without modification of the energy-momentum dispersion relation and without the
$\kappa$-Poincar\'e Hopf algebra, a scenario with deformed Poincar\'e
symmetries which is not a DSR scenario, some scenarios with both an invariant
length scale and an invariant velocity scale which are not DSR scenarios, and a
DSR scenario in which it is easy to verify that some observable relativistic
(but non-special-relativistic) features are insensitive to possible nonlinear
redefinitions of symmetry generators.
