We prove the immediate appearance of a lower bound for mild solutions to the
full Boltzmann equation in the torus or a $C^2$ convex domain with specular
boundary conditions, under the sole assumption of continuity away from the
grazing set of the solution. These results are entirely constructive if the
domain is $C^3$ and strictly convex. We investigate a wide range of collision
kernels, some satisfying Grad's cutoff assumption and others not. We show that
this lower bound is exponential, independent of time and space with explicit
constants depending only on the \textit{a priori} bounds on the solution. In
particular, this lower bound is Maxwellian in the case of cutoff collision
kernels. A thorough study of characteristic trajectories, as well as a
geometric approach of grazing collisions against the boundary are derived.
