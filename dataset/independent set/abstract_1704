This work considers special types of interval linear systems - overdetermined
systems. Simply said these systems have more equations than variables. The
solution set of an interval linear system is a collection of all solutions of
all instances of an interval system. By the instance we mean a point real
system that emerges when we independently choose a real number from each
interval coefficient of the interval system. Enclosing the solution set of
these systems is in some ways more difficult than for square systems. The main
goal of this work is to present various methods for solving overdetermined
interval linear systems. We would like to present them in an understandable way
even for nonspecialists in a field of linear systems. The second goal is a
numerical comparison of all the methods on random interval linear systems
regarding widths of enclosures, computation times and other special properties
of methods.
