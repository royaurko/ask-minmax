In [7], results about the global Jacquet-Langlands correspondence, (weak and
strong) multiplicity-one theorems and the classification of automorphic
representations for inner forms of the general linear group over a number field
are established, under the condition that the local inner forms are split at
archimedean places. In this paper, we extend the main local results of [7] to
archimedean places so that this assumption can be removed. Along the way, we
collect several results about the unitary dual of general linear groups over
$\bbR$, $\bbC$ or $\bbH$ of independent interest.
