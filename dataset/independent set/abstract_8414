We investigate the arithmetic properties of the coefficients for the
normalized conformal mapping of the exterior of the Multibrot set. In this
paper, an estimate of the prime factor of the denominator of these coefficients
is given. Bielefeld, Fisher and Haeseler presented Zagier's observation for the
growth of denominator of the coefficients for the Mandelbrot set and Yamashita
verified it in his master thesis. Our study takes into consideration both
Zagier's observation and Yamashita's estimate.
