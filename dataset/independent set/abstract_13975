We describe a method for determining a complete set of integrals for a
classical Hamiltonian that separates in orthogonal subgroup coordinates. As
examples, we use it to determine complete sets of integrals, polynomial in the
momenta, for some families of generalized oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb
systems, hence demonstrating their superintegrability. The latter generalizes
recent results of Verrier and Evans, and Rodriguez, Tempesta and Winternitz.
Another example is given of a superintegrable system on a non-conformally flat
space.
