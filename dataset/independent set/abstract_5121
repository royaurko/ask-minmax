In this paper we present a new concept called generalized neutrosophic soft
set. This concept incorporates the beneficial properties of both generalized
neutrosophic set introduced by A.A. Salama [7]and soft set techniques proposed
by Molodtsov [4]. We also study some properties of this concept. Some
definitions and operations have been introduced on generalized neutrosophic
soft set. Finally we present an application of generalized neuutrosophic soft
set in decision making problem.
