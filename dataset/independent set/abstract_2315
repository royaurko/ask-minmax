A granular gas may be modeled as a set of hard-spheres undergoing inelastic
collisions; its microscopic dynamics is thus strongly irreversible. As pointed
out in several experimental works bearing on turbulent flows or granular
materials, the power injected in a dissipative system to sustain a steady-state
over an asymptotically large time window is a central observable. We describe
an analytic approach allowing us to determine the full distribution of the
power injected in a granular gas within a steady-state resulting from
subjecting each particle independently either to a random force (stochastic
thermostat) or to a deterministic force proportional to its velocity (Gaussian
thermostat). We provide an analysis of our results in the light of the
relevance, for other types of systems, of the injected power to fluctuation
relations.
