As is well-known, given the complex sphere P^1 minus two points, there exist
nonconstant holomorphic maps from the plane into this set, the simplest
example of which is given by applying the exponential map and then composing
with a M\"obius transformation taking 0 and 1 to the two given punctures.
Likewise, given the sphere minus one point, we can map the plane into this set
by simply applying directly a M\"obius transformation taking 1 to this
puncture.
  In this paper we prove a parametrized version of this result.
