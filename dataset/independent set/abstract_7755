I reconsider the problem of a raindrop falling through mist, collecting mass,
and generalize it to allow an arbitrary power-law form for the accretion rate.
I show that the coupled differential equations can be solved by the simple
trick of temporarily eliminating time (t) in favor of the raindrop's mass (m)
as the independent variable
