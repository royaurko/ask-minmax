A statistical measure is given expressing relative occurrences of quantities
within a given data set. Application of this measure on several real life
physical data sets and some abstract distributions are shown to yield
consistent results. These empirical results also correspond almost exactly to
the theoretical converging limit of such a measure mathematically constructed
for k over x distribution defined over an infinite range.
