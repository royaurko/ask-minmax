A nearlattice is a join semilattice such that every principal filter is a
lattice with respect to the induced order. Hickman and later Chajda et al
independently showed that nearlattices can be treated as varieties of algebras
with a ternary operation satisfying certain axioms. Our main result is that the
variety of nearlattices is 2-based, and we exhibit an explicit axiom system of
two independent identities. We also show that the original axiom systems of
Hickman and of Chajda et al are, respectively, dependent.
