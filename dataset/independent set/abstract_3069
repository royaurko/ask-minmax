Let $\Omega$ be a countable infinite product $\Omega^\N$ of copies of the
same probability space $\Omega_1$, and let ${\Xi_n}$ be the sequence of the
coordinate projection functions from $\Omega$ to $\Omega_1$. Let $\Psi$ be a
possibly nonmeasurable function from $\Omega_1$ to $\R$, and let $X_n(\omega) =
\Psi(\Xi_n(\omega))$. Then we can think of ${X_n}$ as a sequence of independent
but possibly nonmeasurable random variables on $\Omega$. Let $S_n =
X_1+...+X_n$. By the ordinary Strong Law of Large Numbers, we almost surely
have $E_*[X_1] \le \liminf S_n/n \le \limsup S_n/n \le E^*[X_1]$, where $E_*$
and $E^*$ are the lower and upper expectations. We ask if anything more precise
can be said about the limit points of $S_n/n$ in the non-trivial case where
$E_*[X_1] < E^*[X_1]$, and obtain several negative answers. For instance, the
set of points of $\Omega$ where $S_n/n$ converges is maximally nonmeasurable:
it has inner measure zero and outer measure one.
