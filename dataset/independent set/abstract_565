Consider the problem of interference mitigation in the identification of the
dynamics of multidimensional control systems in the class of linear stationary
models for single realizations of the observed signals. A concepts uncorrelated
processes is not verifiable. Is entered the concept of system components of the
signal measured on a semiring. Properties of signals are defined for systems of
sets of linearly dependent and linearly independent measured signals. Frequency
method is found to deal with noise on the set of deterministic functions.
Example is considered to identify the dynamic characteristics of the aircraft
on the data obtained in the regime of one automatic landing.
