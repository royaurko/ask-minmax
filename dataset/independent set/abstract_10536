We study the dynamics of flat circular permalloy nanomagnets for 1.) magnetic
vortex and 2.) single-domain configurations, using micromagnetic simulation.
Dynamical studies for isolated vortex structures show that both the vorticity
and the central polarity of the out-of-plane component can be switched fast
(50-100 ps) and independently. Micromagnetic simulations of the switching
process in thin cylindrical Permalloy (Py) nanoparticles with an initial stable
single-domain state show nearly homogeneous single-domain behaviour followed by
excitation of spin waves.
