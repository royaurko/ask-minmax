We have developed a fabrication process for nanoscale tunnel junctions which
includes focused-ion-beam etching from different directions. By applying the
process to a Nb/(Al-)Al_2O_3/Nb trilayer, we have fabricated a Nb
single-electron transistor (SET), and characterized the SET at low
temperatures, T=0.04-40 K. The superconducting gap energy and the transition
temperature of the Nb SET agree with the bulk values, which suggests high
quality Nb junctions. The single-electron charging energy of the SET is
estimated to be larger than 1 K.
