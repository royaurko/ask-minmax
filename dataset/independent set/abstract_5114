The set of segments, each of the next is n times bigger than the first one is
a simple geometric interpretation of the set $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers.
In this paper we investigate the opposite situation. We construct an algebraic
structure similar to the set $\mathbb{N}$ which describes the set of congruent
triangles, each of the next has the sides n times bigger than the first one.
Later we do the same with the set of congruent tetrahedrons, and finally with a
set of simplices of any dimension.
