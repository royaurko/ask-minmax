A pedagogical account of some aspects of Extreme Value Statistics (EVS) is
presented from the somewhat non-standard viewpoint of Large Deviation Theory.
We address the following problem: given a set of $N$ i.i.d. random variables
$\{X_1,\ldots,X_N\}$ drawn from a parent probability density function (pdf)
$p(x)$, what is the probability that the maximum value of the set
$X_{\mathrm{max}}=\max_i X_i$ is "atypically larger" than expected? The cases
of exponential and Gaussian distributed variables are worked out in detail, and
the right rate function for a general pdf in the Gumbel basin of attraction is
derived. The Gaussian case convincingly demonstrates that the full rate
function cannot be determined from the knowledge of the limiting distribution
(Gumbel) alone, thus implying that it indeed carries additional information.
Given the simplicity and richness of the result and its derivation, its absence
from textbooks, tutorials and lecture notes on EVS for physicists appears
inexplicable.
