We consider the one dimensional symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP)
with additional births and deaths restricted to a subset of configurations
where there is a leftmost hole and a rightmost particle. At a fixed rate birth
of particles occur at the position of the leftmost hole and at the same rate,
independently, the rightmost particle dies. We prove convergence to a
hydrodynamic limit and discuss its relation with a free boundary problem.
