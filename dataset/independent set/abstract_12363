Given a process with independent increments $X$ (not necessarily a
martingale) and a large class of square integrable r.v. $H=f(X_T)$, $f$ being
the Fourier transform of a finite measure $\mu$, we provide explicit
Kunita-Watanabe and F\"ollmer-Schweizer decompositions. The representation is
expressed by means of two significant maps: the expectation and derivative
operators related to the characteristics of $X$. We also provide an explicit
expression for the variance optimal error when hedging the claim $H$ with
underlying process $X$. Those questions are motivated by finding the solution
of the celebrated problem of global and local quadratic risk minimization in
mathematical finance.
