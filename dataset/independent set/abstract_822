No-signaling boxes are the abstract objects for studying non-locality, and
wirings are local operations on the space of no-signaling boxes. This means
that, no matter how non-local the nature is, the set of physical non-local
correlations must be closed under wirings. Then, one approach to identify the
non-locality of nature is to characterize closed sets of non-local
correlations. Although non-trivial examples of wirings of no-signaling boxes
are known, there is no systematic way to study wirings. In particular, given a
set of no-signaling boxes, we do not know a general method to prove that it is
closed under wirings. In this paper, we propose the first general method to
construct such closed sets of non-local correlations. We show that a well-known
measure of correlation, called maximal correlation, when appropriately defined
for non-local correlations, is monotonically decreasing under wirings. This
establishes a conjecture about the impossibility of simulating isotropic boxes
from each other, implying the existence of a continuum of closed sets of
non-local boxes under wirings. To prove our main result, we introduce some
mathematical tools that may be of independent interest: we define a notion of
maximal correlation ribbon as a generalization of maximal correlation, and
provide a connection between it and a known object called hypercontractivity
ribbon; we show that these two ribbons are monotone under wirings too.
