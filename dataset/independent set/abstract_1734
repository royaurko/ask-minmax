Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by machine is an attractive research topic
in signal processing domain and has attracted many researchers to contribute in
this area. In recent year, there have been many advances in automatic speech
reading system with the inclusion of audio and visual speech features to
recognize words under noisy conditions. The objective of audio-visual speech
recognition system is to improve recognition accuracy. In this paper we
computed visual features using Zernike moments and audio feature using Mel
Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) on vVISWa (Visual Vocabulary of
Independent Standard Words) dataset which contains collection of isolated set
of city names of 10 speakers. The visual features were normalized and dimension
of features set was reduced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to
recognize the isolated word utterance on PCA space.The performance of
recognition of isolated words based on visual only and audio only features
results in 63.88 and 100 respectively.
