We consider two models of computation: centralized local algorithms and local
distributed algorithms. Algorithms in one model are adapted to the other model
to obtain improved algorithms.
  Distributed vertex coloring is employed to design improved centralized local
algorithms for: maximal independent set, maximal matching, and an approximation
scheme for maximum (weighted) matching over bounded degree graphs. The
improvement is threefold: the algorithms are deterministic, stateless, and the
number of probes grows polynomially in $\log^* n$, where $n$ is the number of
vertices of the input graph.
  The recursive centralized local improvement technique by Nguyen and
Onak~\cite{onak2008} is employed to obtain an improved distributed
approximation scheme for maximum (weighted) matching. The improvement is
twofold: we reduce the number of rounds from $O(\log n)$ to $O(\log^*n)$ for a
wide range of instances and, our algorithms are deterministic rather than
randomized.
