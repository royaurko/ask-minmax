We study the dynamics of the size of an extra-dimensional manifold stabilised
by fluxes. Inspecting the potential for the 4D field associated with this size
(the radion), we obtain the conditions under which it can be stabilised and
show that stable compactifications on hyperbolic manifolds necessarily have a
negative four-dimensional cosmological constant, in contradiction with
experimental observations. Assuming compactification on a positively curved
(spherical) manifold we find that the radion has a mass of the order of the
compactification scale, M_c, and Planck suppressed couplings. We also show that
the model becomes unstable and the extra dimensions decompactify when the
four-dimensional curvature is higher than a maximum value. This in particular
sets an upper bound on the scale of inflation in these models: V_max \sim M_c^2
M_P^2, independently of whether the radion or other field is responsible for
inflation. We comment on other possible contributions to the radion potential
as well as finite temperature effects and their impact on the bounds obtained.
