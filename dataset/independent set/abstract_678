Under the constraints of HQET the equations of motion of heavy meson
distribution amplitudes of definite geometric twist, using the knowledge of
their off-cone structure, are reformulated as a set of algebraic equations.
Together with equations due to various Dirac structures various relations
between the (sets of) independent two- and three particle distribution
amplitudes of definite geometric twist are derived and presented using both the
notion of (double) Mellin moments and re-summed non-local distribution
amplitudes. Resolving these relations for the independent two-particle moments
in terms of three-particle double moments we confirmed the representation of
$\Phi_{\pm|n}$ by Kawamura et al. (Phys. Lett. B \bf{523} (2001) 111).
