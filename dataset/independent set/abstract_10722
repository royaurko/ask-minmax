We discuss whether the future extrapolation of the present cosmological state
may lead to a singularity even in case of "conventional" (negative) pressure of
the dark energy field, namely $w=p/\rho \geq -1$. The discussion is based on an
often neglected aspect of scalar-tensor models of gravity: the fact that
different test particles may follow the geodesics of different metric frames,
and the need for a frame-independent regularization of curvature singularities.
