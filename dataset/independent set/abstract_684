If nonlocality is to be inferred from a violation of Bell's inequality, an
important assumption is that the measurement settings are freely chosen by the
observers, or alternatively, that they are random and uncorrelated with the
hypothetical local variables. We study the case where this assumption is
weakened, so that measurement settings and local variables are at least
partially correlated. As we show, there is a connection between this type of
model and models which reproduce nonlocal correlations by allowing classical
communication between the distant parties, and a connection with models that
exploit the detection loophole. We show that even if Bob's choices are
completely independent, all correlations obtained from projective measurements
on a singlet can be reproduced, with the correlation (measured by mutual
information) between Alice's choice and local variables less than or equal to a
single bit.
