We consider sequences of linear operators $U_nf(x)$ with localization
property. It is proved that for any set $E$ of measure zero there exists a set
$G$ for which $U_n\ZI_G(x)$ diverges at each point $x\in E$. This result is a
generalization of analogous theorems known for the Fourier sums operators with
respect to different orthogonal systems.
