We present a method which allows to deform extremal black hole solutions into
non-extremal solutions, for a large class of supersymmetric and
non-supersymmetric Einstein-Vector-Scalar type theories. The deformation is
shown to be largely independent of the details of the matter sector. While the
line element is dressed with an additional harmonic function, the attractor
equations for the scalars remain unmodified in suitable coordinates, and the
values of the scalar fields on the outer and inner horizon are obtained from
their fixed point values by making specific substitutions for the charges. For
a subclass of models, which includes the five-dimensional STU-model, we find
explicit solutions.
