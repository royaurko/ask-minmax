The conceptual design of a Variable-Phase Asynchronous Cyclotron (VPAC) is
describe, which provides longitudinal bunch compression of accelerated proton
or ion beams, and thus, permits high current acceleration at higher accelerator
efficiency, where the possible beam losses are minimized and the accelerator's
mechanical tolerances are relaxed. Beam control is assured by the ability to
independently set and vary the acceleration phase and rf voltage amplitude, the
inter-cavity harmonic number and the transverse focusing strength, which
considerably overcome the space charge effects in each sector and turn of the
proposed cyclotron. The new accelerator concept is especially suitable to
accelerate intense proton beams up to 800 MeV in energy and average beam
current in the 100-mA class. All accelerator elements are based on currently
available and feasible technologies. To demonstrate feasibility of design, the
detailed calculations and modeling of a 10-turn VPAC prototype for the
production of 25.6 MeV, 100 mA proton beam are presented and the key features
of the new accelerator concept are discussed.
