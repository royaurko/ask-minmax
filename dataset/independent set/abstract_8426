In this paper, we establish Luzin's condition (N) for mappings in certain
Sobolev-Orlicz spaces with certain moduli of continuity. Further, given a
mapping in these Sobolev-Orlicz spaces, we give bounds on the size of the
exceptional set where Luzin's condition (N) may fail. If a mapping violates
Luzin's condition (N), we show that there is a Cantor set of measure zero that
is mapped to a set of positive measure.
