This article proposes a spatial dynamic structural equation model for the
analysis of housing prices at the State level in the USA. The study contributes
to the existing literature by extending the use of dynamic factor models to the
econometric analysis of multivariate lattice data. One of the main advantages
of our model formulation is that by modeling the spatial variation via
spatially structured factor loadings, we entertain the possibility of
identifying similarity "regions" that share common time series components. The
factor loadings are modeled as conditionally independent multivariate Gaussian
Markov Random Fields, while the common components are modeled by latent dynamic
factors. The general model is proposed in a state-space formulation where both
stationary and nonstationary autoregressive distributed-lag processes for the
latent factors are considered. For the latent factors which exhibit a common
trend, and hence are cointegrated, an error correction specification of the
(vector) autoregressive distributed-lag process is proposed. Full probabilistic
inference for the model parameters is facilitated by adapting standard Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for dynamic linear models to our model
formulation. The fit of the model is discussed for a data set of 48 States for
which we model the relationship between housing prices and the macroeconomy,
using State level unemployment and per capita personal income.
