We study the occurrence, visibility, and curvature strength of singularities
in dust-containing Szekeres spacetimes (which possess no Killing vectors) with
a positive cosmological constant. We find that such singularities can be
locally naked, Tipler strong, and develop from a non-zero-measure set of
regular initial data. When examined along timelike geodesics, the singularity's
curvature strength is found to be independent of the initial data.
