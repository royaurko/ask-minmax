Let G=(V,E) be a graph. A set S is independent if no two vertices from S are
adjacent, alpha(G) is the size of a maximum independent set, and core(G) is the
intersection of all maximum independent sets. The number d(X)=|X|-|N(X)| is the
difference of the set X, and d_{c}(G)=max{d(I):I is an independent set} is
called the critical difference of G. A set X is critical if d(X)=d_{c}(G). For
a graph G we define ker(G) as the intersection of all critical independent
sets, while diadem(G) is the union of all critical independent sets. For a
bipartite graph G=(A,B,E), with bipartition {A,B}, Ore defined delta(X)=d(X)
for every subset X of A, while delta_0(A)=max{delta(X):X is a subset of A}.
Similarly is defined delta_0(B). In this paper we prove that for every
bipartite graph G=(A,B,E) the following assertions hold:
d_{c}(G)=delta_0(A)+delta_0(B); ker(G)=core(G);
|ker(G)|+|diadem(G)|=2*alpha(G).
