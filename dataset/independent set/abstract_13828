There exist two different sorts of gaps in the nonsymmetric numerical
additive semigroups finitely generated by a minimal set of positive integers
{d_1,...,d_m}. The h-gaps are specific only for the nonsymmetric semigroups
while the g-gaps are possessed by both, symmetric and nonsymmetric semigroups.
We derive the generating functions for the corresponding sets of gaps,
Delta_H({\bf d}^m) and Delta_G({\bf d}^m), and prove several statements on the
minimal and maximal values of the h-gaps. Detailed description of both sorts of
gaps is given for three special kinds of nonsymmetric semigroups: semigroups
with maximal embedding dimension, semigroups of maximal and almost maximal
length, and pseudo--symmetric semigroups.
