Two equations are constructed which reflect, for fermions moving
independently in a spherical harmonic potential, a differential virial theorem
and a relation between the turning points of kinetic energy and particle
densities. These equations are used to derive a differential equation for the
particle density and a non-local kinetic energy functional.
