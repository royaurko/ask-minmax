We will prove that there exists a model of ZFC+``c= omega_2'' in which every
M subseteq R of cardinality less than continuum c is meager, and such that for
every X subseteq R of cardinality c there exists a continuous function f:R-> R
with f[X]=[0,1]. In particular in this model there is no magic set, i.e., a
set M subseteq R such that the equation f[M]=g[M] implies f=g for every
continuous nowhere constant functions f,g:R-> R .
