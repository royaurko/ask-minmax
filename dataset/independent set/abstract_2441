We study the problem of constructing N=2 superconformal algebras out of an
N=1 affine Lie algebra. Following a recent independent observation of Getzler
and the contributor, we derive a simplified set of N=2 master equations, which we
then proceed to solve for the case of sl(2). There is a unique construction for
all noncritical values of the level, which can be identified as the
Kazama-Suzuki coset associated to the hermitian symmetric space SO(3)/SO(2). We
also identify the construction with a generalized parafermionic construction
or, after bosonization, with a bosonic construction of the type analyzed by
Kazama and Suzuki. A mild generalization of this construction can be associated
to any embedding of sl(2) in G.
