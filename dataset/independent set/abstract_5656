We present the first quantitative results explaining the presence in the
Large Magellanic Cloud of some asymptotic giant branch stars that share the
properties of lithium rich carbon stars. A self-consistent description of
time-dependent mixing, overshooting, and nuclear burning was required. We
identify a narrow range of masses and luminosities for this peculiar stars.
Comparison of these models with the luminosities of the few Li-rich C stars in
the Large Magellanic Cloud provides an independent distance indicator for the
LMC
