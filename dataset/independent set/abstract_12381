This paper presents preliminary results of an investigation of collectively
intelligent behavior in a Native North American speech community. The research
reveals several independently initiated strategies organized around the
collective problem of language endangerment. Specifically, speakers are
engaging in self-organizing efforts to reverse historical language
simplification that resulted from cultural trauma. These acts of collective
intelligence serve to reduce entropy in speech community identity.
