We give conditions under which a germ of a holomorphic mapping in
$\Bbb C^N$, mapping an irreducible real algebraic set into
another of the same dimension, is actually algebraic.
  Let $A\subset \bC^N$ be an irreducible real algebraic set.  Assume that
there exists $\po \in A$ such that $A$ is a minimal, generic,
holomorphically nondegenerate submanifold at $\po$.  We show here that if
$H$ is a germ at $p_1 \in A$ of a holomorphic mapping from $\bC^N$ into
itself, with Jacobian $H$ not identically $0$, and $H(A)$ contained in a
real algebraic set of the same dimension as $A$, then $H$ must extend to
all of $\bC^N$ (minus a complex algebraic set) as an algebraic
mapping. Conversely, we show that for any ``model case'' (i.e., $A$ given
by quasi-homogeneous real polynomials), the conditions on $A$ are actually
necessary for the conclusion to hold.
