Fundamental questions in Diophantine approximation are related to the
Hausdorff dimension of sets of the form $\{x\in \mathbb{R}: \delta_x =
\delta\}$, where $\delta \geq 1$ and $\delta_x$ is the Diophantine
approximation rate of an irrational number $x$. We go beyond the classical
results by computing the Hausdorff dimension of the sets $\{x\in\mathbb{R}:
\delta_x =f(x)\}$, where $f$ is a continuous function. Our theorem applies to
the study of the approximation rates by various approximation families. It also
applies to functions $f$ which are continuous outside a set of prescribed
Hausdorff dimension.
