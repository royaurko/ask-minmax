A {\em convex hole} (or {\em empty convex polygon)} of a point set $P$ in the
plane is a convex polygon with vertices in $P$, containing no points of $P$ in
its interior. Let $R$ be a bounded convex region in the plane. We show that the
expected number of vertices of the largest convex hole of a set of $n$ random
points chosen independently and uniformly over $R$ is
$\Theta(\log{n}/(\log{\log{n}}))$, regardless of the shape of $R$.
