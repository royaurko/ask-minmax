We study the left tail behavior of the distribution function of a sum of
dependent positive random variables, with a special focus on the setting of
asymptotic independence. Asymptotics at the logarithmic scale are computed
under the assumption that the marginal distribution functions decay slowly at
zero, meaning that their logarithms are slowly varying functions. This includes
parametric families such as log-normal, gamma, Weibull and many distributions
from the financial mathematics literature. We show that the asymptotics of the
sum depend on a characteristic of the copula of the random variables which we
term weak lower tail dependence function. We then compute this function
explicitly for several families of copulas, such as the Gaussian copula, the
copulas of Gaussian mean-variance mixtures and a class of Archimedean copulas.
As an illustration, we compute the left tail asymptotics for a portfolio of
call options in the multidimensional Black-Scholes model.
