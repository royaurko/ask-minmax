We consider the problem of estimating the mean vector of a p-variate normal
$(\theta,\Sigma)$ distribution under invariant quadratic loss,
$(\delta-\theta)'\Sigma^{-1}(\delta-\theta)$, when the covariance is unknown.
We propose a new class of estimators that dominate the usual estimator
$\delta^0(X)=X$. The proposed estimators of $\theta$ depend upon X and an
independent Wishart matrix S with n degrees of freedom, however, S is singular
almost surely when p>n. The proof of domination involves the development of
some new unbiased estimators of risk for the p>n setting. We also find some
relationships between the amount of domination and the magnitudes of n and p.
