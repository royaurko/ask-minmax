A new class of graphical models capturing the dependence structure of events
that occur in time is proposed. The graphs represent so-called local
independences, meaning that the intensities of certain types of events are
independent of some (but not necessarily all) events in the past. This dynamic
concept of independence is asymmetric, similar to Granger non-causality, so
that the corresponding local independence graphs differ considerably from
classical graphical models. Hence a new notion of graph separation, called
delta-separation, is introduced and implications for the underlying model as
well as for likelihood inference are explored. Benefits regarding facilitation
of reasoning about and understanding of dynamic dependencies as well as
computational simplifications are discussed.
