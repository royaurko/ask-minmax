We show that N=1, D=4 Einstein-frame supergravity is inconsistent at one loop
because of an anomaly in local supersymmetry transformations. A Jacobian must
be added to the Einstein-frame Lagrangian to cancel this anomaly. We show how
the Jacobian arises from the super-Weyl field redefinition that takes the
superspace Lagrangian to the Einstein frame. We present an explicit example
which demonstrates that the Jacobian is necessary for one-loop scattering
amplitudes to be frame independent.
