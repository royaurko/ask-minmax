We address the issue of the quark-hadron duality in the spectral densities
induced by the heavy-light quark currents anti-Q q. In the limit m_Q ->oo, m_q
->0 we observe an enhancement of the physical spectral density compared to the
quark one in the scalar and axial channels, due to the Goldstone meson
contributions. This may imply that the scale where duality sets in is higher in
these channels than in the vector (pseudoscalar) case. Implications for the
nonleptonic decays of B mesons (the b -> c anti-c s transition) are considered.
We discuss in detail the decay pattern and obtain an independent estimate of
the "wrong" sign D yield.
