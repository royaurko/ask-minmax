We introduce Synapse motivated by the needs to estimate workload execution
characteristics on distributed heterogeneous resources. Synapse has an
automated and system-independent application profiler, and the ability to
emulate profiled workloads on a variety of heterogeneous resources. We designed
experiments that show: (i) that Synapses automated profiling truthfully
represents the application characteristics; (ii) that Synapses application
emulation truthfully reproduces the application characteristics in the original
runtime environment; and (iii) that Synapses application emulation retains
those properties when used in a different runtime environment.
