We consider Faddeev formulation of gravity, in which the metric is bilinear
of $d = 10$ 4-vector fields. A unique feature of this formulation is that the
action remains finite for the discontinuous fields (although continuity is
recovered on the equations of motion). This means that the spacetime can be
decomposed into the 4-simplices virtually not coinciding on their common faces,
that is, independent. This allows, in particular, to consider a surface as
consisting of a set of virtually independent elementary pieces (2-simplices).
Then the spectrum of surface area is the sum of the spectra of independent
elementary areas. We use connection representation of the Faddeev action for
the piecewise flat (simplicial) manifold earlier proposed in our work. The
spectrum of elementary areas is the spectrum of the field bilinears which are
canonically conjugate to the orthogonal connection matrices. We find that the
elementary area spectrum is proportional to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter
$\gamma$ in the Faddeev gravity and is similar to the spectrum of the angular
momentum in the space with the dimension $d - 2$. Knowing this spectrum allows
to estimate statistical black hole entropy. Requiring that this entropy
coincide with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy gives the equation, known in the
literature. This equation allows to estimate $\gamma$ for arbitrary $d$, in
particular, $\gamma = 0.39...$ for genuine $d = 10$.
