A random matrix approach is used to analyze the vibrational properties of
amorphous solids. We investigated a dynamical matrix M=AA^T with non-negative
eigenvalues. The matrix A is an arbitrary real NxN sparse random matrix with n
independent non-zero elements in each row. The average values <A_{ij}>=0 and
dispersion <A_{ij}^2>=V^2 for all non-zero elements. The density of vibrational
states g(w) of the matrix M for N,n >> 1 is given by the Wigner quarter circle
law with radius independent of N. We argue that for n^2 << N this model can be
used to describe the interaction of atoms in amorphous solids. The level
statistics of matrix M is well described by the Wigner surmise and corresponds
to repulsion of eigenfrequencies. The participation ratio for the major part of
vibrational modes in three dimensional system is about 0.2 - 0.3 and
independent of N. Together with term repulsion it indicates clearly to the
delocalization of vibrational excitations. We show that these vibrations spread
in space by means of diffusion. In this respect they are similar to diffusons
introduced by Allen, Feldman, et al., Phil. Mag. B 79, 1715 (1999) in amorphous
silicon. Our results are in a qualitative and sometimes in a quantitative
agreement with molecular dynamic simulations of real and model glasses.
