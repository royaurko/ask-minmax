We consider weighted counting of independent sets using a rational weight x:
Given a graph with n vertices, count its independent sets such that each set of
size k contributes x^k. This is equivalent to computation of the partition
function of the lattice gas with hard-core self-repulsion and hard-core pair
interaction. We show the following conditional lower bounds: If counting the
satisfying assignments of a 3-CNF formula in n variables (#3SAT) needs time
2^{\Omega(n)} (i.e. there is a c>0 such that no algorithm can solve #3SAT in
time 2^{cn}), counting the independent sets of size n/3 of an n-vertex graph
needs time 2^{\Omega(n)} and weighted counting of independent sets needs time
2^{\Omega(n/log^3 n)} for all rational weights x\neq 0.
  We have two technical ingredients: The first is a reduction from 3SAT to
independent sets that preserves the number of solutions and increases the
instance size only by a constant factor. Second, we devise a combination of
vertex cloning and path addition. This graph transformation allows us to adapt
a recent technique by Dell, Husfeldt, and Wahlen which enables interpolation by
a family of reductions, each of which increases the instance size only
polylogarithmically.
