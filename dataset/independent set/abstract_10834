Magnetic moments of baryons are studied within the chiral quark soliton model
with special emphasis on the decuplet of baryons. The model is used to identify
all symmetry breaking terms proportional to $m_{\rm s}$. Sum rules for the
magnetic moments are derived. A ``model-independent'' analysis of the symmetry
breaking terms is performed and finally model calculations are presented, which
show the importance of the rotational $1/N_{\rm c}$ corrections for cranking of
the soliton.
