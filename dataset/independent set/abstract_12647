We show that the supremum of the average of the Airy process and its time
reversal minus a parabola is distributed as the maximum of two independent GUE
Tracy-Widom random variables. The proof is obtained by considering a directed
last passage percolation model with a rotational symmetry in two different
ways. We also review other known identities between the Airy process and the
Tracy-Widom distributions.
