A search for charged Higgs bosons produced in pairs is performed with data
collected at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 189 to 209 GeV by ALEPH at
LEP, corresponding to a total luminosity of 629 invpb. The three final states
taunutaunu, taunucs and cscs are considered. No evidence for a signal is found
and lower limits are set on the mass M_H+ as a function of the branching
fraction B(H to taunu). In the framework of a two-Higgs-doublet model, and
assuming B(H+ to taunu + B(H+ to cs) = 1 charged Higgs bosons with masses below
79.3 Gev/c2 are excluded at 95% confidence level independently of the branching
ratios.
