We investigate the set-theoretic properties of the lattice of projections in
the Calkin algebra of a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space in
relation to those of the Boolean algebra $P(\omega)/{\rm fin}$, which is
isomorphic to the sublattice of diagonal projections. In particular, we prove
some basic consistency results about the possible cofinalities of well-ordered
sequences of projections and the possible cardinalities of sets of mutually
orthogonal projections that are analogous to well-known results about
$P(\omega)/{\rm fin}$.
