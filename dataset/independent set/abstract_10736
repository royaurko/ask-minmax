We present a fully model-independent analysis of the extensive observations
reported by a recent ether-drift experiment in Berlin. No a priori assumption
is made on the nature of a hypothetical preferred frame. We find a remarkable
consistency with an Earth's cosmic motion exhibiting an average declination
angle |\gamma|\sim 43^o and with values of the RMS anisotropy parameter
(1/2-\beta+\delta) that are one order of magnitude larger than the presently
quoted ones. This might represent the first modern indication for a preferred
frame and for a non-zero anisotropy of the speed of light.
