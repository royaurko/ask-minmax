Session types are used to describe and structure interactions between
independent processes in distributed systems. Higher-order types are needed in
order to properly structure delegation of responsibility between processes.
  In this paper we show that higher-order web-service contracts can be used to
provide a fully-abstract model of recursive higher-order session types. The
model is set-theoretic, in the sense that the meaning of a contract is given in
terms of the set of contracts with which it complies.
  The proof of full-abstraction depends on a novel notion of the complement of
a contract. This in turn gives rise to an alternative to the type duality
commonly used in systems for type-checking session types. We believe that the
notion of complement captures more faithfully the behavioural intuition
underlying type duality.
