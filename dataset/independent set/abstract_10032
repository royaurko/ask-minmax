We study the problem whether there exist variants of {\sc Wythoff}'s game
whose $\P$-positions, except for a finite number, are obtained from those of
{\sc Wythoff}'s game by adding a constant $k$ to each $\P$-position. We solve
this question by introducing a class $\{\W_k\}_{k \geq 0}$ of variants of {\sc
Wythoff}'s game in which, for any fixed $k \geq 0$, the $\P$-positions of
$\W_k$ form the set $\{(i,i) | 0 \leq i < k\}\cup \{(\lfloor \phi n \rfloor +
k, \lfloor \phi^2 n \rfloor + k) | n\ge 0\}$, where $\phi$ is the golden ratio.
We then analyze a class $\{\T_k\}_{k \geq 0}$ of variants of {\sc Wythoff}'s
game whose members share the same $\P$-positions set $\{(0,0)\}\cup \{(\lfloor
\phi n \rfloor + 1, \lfloor \phi^2 n \rfloor + 1) | n \geq 0 \}$. We establish
several results for the Sprague-Grundy function of these two families. On the
way we exhibit a family of games with different rule sets that share the same
set of $\P$-positions.
