We propose and analyse a hybrid numerical-asymptotic $hp$ boundary element
method for time-harmonic scattering of an incident plane wave by an arbitrary
collinear array of sound-soft two-dimensional screens. Our method uses an
approximation space enriched with oscillatory basis functions, chosen to
capture the high frequency asymptotics of the solution. We provide a rigorous
frequency-explicit error analysis which proves that the method converges
exponentially as the number of degrees of freedom $N$ increases, and that to
achieve any desired accuracy it is sufficient to increase $N$ in proportion to
the square of the logarithm of the frequency as the frequency increases
(standard boundary element methods require $N$ to increase at least linearly
with frequency to retain accuracy). Our numerical results suggest that fixed
accuracy can in fact be achieved at arbitrarily high frequencies with a
frequency-independent computational cost, when the oscillatory integrals
required for implementation are computed using Filon quadrature. We also show
how our method can be applied to the complementary "breakwater" problem of
propagation through an aperture in an infinite sound-hard screen.
