The sum-product algorithm for decoding of binary codes is analyzed for
bipartite graphs in which the check nodes all have degree $2$. The algorithm
simplifies dramatically and may be expressed using linear algebra. Exact
results about the convergence of the algorithm are derived and applied to
trapping sets.
