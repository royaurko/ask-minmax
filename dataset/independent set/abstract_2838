To understand the network response to large-scale physical attacks, we
investigate the asymptotic capacity of a half-duplex fading relay network with
random node failures when the number of relays $N$ is infinitely large. In this
paper, a simplified independent attack model is assumed where each relay node
fails with a certain probability. The noncoherent relaying scheme is
considered, which corresponds to the case of zero forward-link channel state
information (CSI) at the relays. Accordingly, the whole relay network can be
shown equivalent to a Rayleigh fading channel, where we derive the
$\epsilon$-outage capacity upper bound according to the multiple access (MAC)
cut-set, and the $\epsilon$-outage achievable rates for both the
amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) strategies. Furthermore,
we show that the DF strategy is asymptotically optimal as the outage
probability $\epsilon$ goes to zero, with the AF strategy strictly suboptimal
over all signal to noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Regarding the rate loss due to
random attacks, the AF strategy suffers a less portion of rate loss than the DF
strategy in the high SNR regime, while the DF strategy demonstrates more robust
performance in the low SNR regime.
