We evaluate an analogue of an integral of Dirichlet over the sphere S^D, but
with an integrand that is independent of [(D + 1)/2] Killing coordinates. As an
application, we evaluate an integral that arises when comparing a conformal
fluid on S^D and black holes in (D + 2)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime.
