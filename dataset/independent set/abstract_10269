New Hubble Space Telescope observations of Cepheid variable stars in the
nearby galaxy M96 give a distance to the host galaxy group, Leo-I, of
11.6+/-0.8 Mpc. This value, used in conjunction with several reliable secondary
indicators of relative distance, constrains the distances to more remote galaxy
clusters, and yields a value of the Hubble constant (Ho=69+/-8 km/s/Mpc) that
is independent of the velocity of the Leo-I group itself.
