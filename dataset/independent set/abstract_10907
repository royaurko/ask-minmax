It is recalled that spin-observables in the strangeness-exchange reaction
$\bar{p}{p} \to \bar{\Lambda}{\Lambda}$ are not independent but are related to
each other by simple algebraic relations. This provides constraints on the
existing data on polarization and spin-correlation coefficients, and also on
the forthcoming data obtained using a polarized proton target.
