We report on recent progress in the NNPDF framework of global PDF analysis.
The NNPDF2.3 set is the first and only available PDF set with includes LHC
data. A recent benchmark comparison of NNPDF2.3 and all other modern NNLO PDF
sets with LHC data was performed. We have also studied theoretical
uncertainties due to heavy quark renormalization schemes, higher twists and
deuterium corrections in PDFs. Finally, we report on the release of positive
definite PDF sets, based on the NNPDF2.3 analysis, specially suited for use in
Monte Carlo event generators.
