Suppose that A is a finite set of integers of diameter D. Suppose also that
the set of integers B is such that A+B is a tiling of the integers, that is
each integer is uniquely expressible as a+b, with a in A, b in B. It is well
known that B must be a periodic set in this case. Here we study the
relationship between the diameter D of A and the least period T of B. We show
that T is at most C exp(C \sqrt D \log D \sqrt{\log\log D}) and that we can
have T at least quadratic in D.
