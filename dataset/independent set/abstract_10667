As an example of what happens with physically relevant theories like
effective gravity, we consider the covariant relativistic theory of a scalar
field of arbitrarily higher differential order. A procedure based on the
Legendre transformation and suitable field redefinitions allows to recast it as
a theory of second order with one explicit independent field for each degree of
freedom. The physical and ghost fields are then apparent. The full (classical)
equivalence of both Higher and Lower Derivative versions is shown. An artifact
of the method is the appearance of irrelevant spurious fields which are devoid
of any dynamical content.
