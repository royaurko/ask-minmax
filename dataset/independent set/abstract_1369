The PC algorithm uses conditional independence tests for model selection in
graphical modeling with acyclic directed graphs. In Gaussian models, tests of
conditional independence are typically based on Pearson correlations, and
high-dimensional consistency results have been obtained for the PC algorithm in
this setting. We prove that high-dimensional consistency carries over to the
broader class of Gaussian copula or \textit{nonparanormal} models when using
rank-based measures of correlation. For graphs with bounded degree, our result
is as strong as prior Gaussian results. In simulations, the `Rank PC' algorithm
works as well as the `Pearson PC' algorithm for normal data and considerably
better for non-normal Gaussian copula data, all the while incurring a
negligible increase of computation time. Simulations with contaminated data
show that rank correlations can also perform better than other robust estimates
considered in previous work when the underlying distribution does not belong to
the nonparanormal family.
