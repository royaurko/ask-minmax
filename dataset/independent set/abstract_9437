A critical survey of the existing direct and indirect constraints on massive
spin-one color octets is presented. Since such new degrees of freedom appear in
any extension of the color gauge group to a product of at least two SU(3)
factors, we keep our discussion as independent as possible from the underlying
theory. In the framework of scenarios that involve flavor non-universal
couplings, we show that excessive flavor-changing neutral currents can be
avoided by a suitable alignment in flavor space. Constraints from electroweak
precision observables and direct production at hadron colliders still leave
space for sizable new-physics effects in top-quark pair production, in
particular a large forward-backward asymmetry. In this context, we derive a
model-independent upper bound on the asymmetry that applies whenever
top-antitop production receives the dominant corrections from s-channel
exchange of a new single color-octet resonance.
