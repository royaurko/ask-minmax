The semiclassical theory of Bloch wave packet dynamics predicts a
self-rotation angular momentum in asymmetric periodic potentials, which has
never been observed. We show how this is manifested in
 Bose-Einstein condensed atoms in optical lattices. Displacing the wave packet
to a corner of the Brillouin zone we obtain a current distribution with a
non-quantized angular momentum, independent of the size of the distribution. A
weak interatomic interaction does not modify the results, affecting only the
rate of spreading in the lattice. A strong repulsive interaction results in a
collapse of the wavefunction into matter-wave lattice solitons.
