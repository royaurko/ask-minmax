This paper studies robustness of MIMO control systems with parametric
uncertainties, and establishes a lower dimensional robust stability criterion.
For control systems with interval transfer matrices, we identify the minimal
testing set whose stability can guarantee the stability of the entire uncertain
set. Our results improve the results in the literature, and provide a
constructive solution to the robustness of a family of MIMO control systems.
