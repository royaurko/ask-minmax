Angle-resolved photoemission and X-ray diffraction experiments show that
multilayer epitaxial graphene grown on the SiC(000-1) surface is a new form of
carbon that is composed of effectively isolated graphene sheets. The unique
rotational stacking of these films cause adjacent graphene layers to
electronically decouple leading to a set of nearly independent linearly
dispersing bands (Dirac cones) at the graphene K-point. Each cone corresponds
to an individual macro-scale graphene sheet in a multilayer stack where
AB-stacked sheets can be considered as low density faults.
