Linear principal component analysis (PCA) can be extended to a nonlinear PCA
by using artificial neural networks. But the benefit of curved components
requires a careful control of the model complexity. Moreover, standard
techniques for model selection, including cross-validation and more generally
the use of an independent test set, fail when applied to nonlinear PCA because
of its inherent unsupervised characteristics. This paper presents a new
approach for validating the complexity of nonlinear PCA models by using the
error in missing data estimation as a criterion for model selection. It is
motivated by the idea that only the model of optimal complexity is able to
predict missing values with the highest accuracy. While standard test set
validation usually favours over-fitted nonlinear PCA models, the proposed model
validation approach correctly selects the optimal model complexity.
