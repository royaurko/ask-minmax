We discuss two parameterizations of models for marginal independencies for
discrete distributions which are representable by bi-directed graph models,
under the global Markov property. Such models are useful data analytic tools
especially if used in combination with other graphical models. The first
parameterization, in the saturated case, is also known as the multivariate
logistic transformation, the second is a variant that allows, in some (but not
all) cases, variation independent parameters. An algorithm for maximum
likelihood fitting is proposed, based on an extension of the Aitchison and
Silvey method.
