We present the results obtained in the development of scintillating Double
Beta Decay bolometers. Several Mo and Cd based crystals were tested with the
bolometric technique. The scintillation light was measured through a second
independent bolometer. A 140 g CdWO_4 crystal was run in a 417 h live time
measurement. Thanks to the scintillation light, the alpha background is easily
discriminated resulting in zero counts above the 2615 keV gamma line of
Thallium 208. These results, combined with an extremely easy light detector
operation, represent the first tangible proof demonstrating the feasibility of
this kind of technique.
