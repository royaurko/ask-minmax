We present here continued fraction for Zeta(3) parametrized by some family of
points (F,G) on projective line. This family of points can be obtained if from
full projective line would be removed some no more than countable exeptional
set of finite points.
  A countable set, which contains the above exeptional set of finite points, is
specified also.
