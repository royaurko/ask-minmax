We present a covariant quantization of the free "massive" spin-3/2 fields in
four-dimensional de Sitter space-time based on analyticity in the complexified
pseudo-Riemannian manifold. The field equation is obtained as an eigenvalue
equation of the Casimir operator of the de Sitter group. The solutions are
calculated in terms of coordinate-independent de Sitter plane-waves in tube
domains and the null curvature limit is discussed. We give the group
theoretical content of the field equation. The Wightman two-point function
$S^{i \bar j}_{\alpha\alpha'}(x,x')$ is calculated. We introduce the
spinor-vector field operator $\Psi_\alpha(f)$ and the Hilbert space structure.
A coordinate-independent formula for the field operator $\Psi_\alpha(x)$ is
also presented.
