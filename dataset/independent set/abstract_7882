In this paper, using an argument of P. Erdos, K. Alniacik and E. Saias, we
extend earlier results on Liouville numbers, due to P. Erdos, G.J. Rieger, W.
Schwarz, K. Alniacik, E. Saias, E.B. Burger. We also produce new results of
algebraic independence related with Liouville numbers and Schanuel's
Conjecture, in the framework of G delta-subsets.
