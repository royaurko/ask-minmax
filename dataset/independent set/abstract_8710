Two constructed prime number subsets (called prime brother & sisters and
prime cousins) lead to a third one (called isolated primes) so that all three
disjoint subsets together generate the prime number set. It should be suggested
how the subset of isolated primes give a new approach to expand the set theory
by using virtual subsets.
