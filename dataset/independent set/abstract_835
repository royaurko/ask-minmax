An algorithm is presented that efficiently solves the selection problem:
finding the k-th smallest member of a set. Relevant to a divide-and-conquer
strategy, the algorithm also partitions a set into small and large valued
subsets. Applied recursively, this partitioning results in a sorted set. The
algorithm's applicability is therefore much broader than just the selection
problem. The presented algorithm is based upon R.W. Floyd's 1964 algorithm that
constructs a heap from the bottom-up. Empirically, the presented algorithm's
performance appears competitive with the popular quickselect algorithm, a
variant of C.A.R. Hoare's 1962 quicksort algorithm. Furthermore, constructing a
heap from the bottom-up is an inherently parallel process (processors can work
independently and simultaneously on subheap construction), suggesting a
performance advantage with parallel implementations. Given the presented
algorithm's broad applicability, simplicity, serial performance, and parallel
nature, further study is warranted. Specifically, worst-case analysis is an
important but still unsolved problem.
