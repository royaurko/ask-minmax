A simple procedure is developed to determine orbital elements of an object
orbiting in a central force field which contribute more than three independent
celestial positions. By manipulation of formal three point Gauss method of
orbit determination, an initial set of heliocentric state vectors ${\bf r}_i$
and $\dot{\bf{r}}_i$ is calculated. Then using the fact that the object follows
the path that keep the constants of motion unchanged, I derive conserved
quantities by applying simple linear regression method on state vectors ${\bf
r}_i$ and $\dot{\bf{r}}_i$. The best orbital plane is fixed by applying an
iterative procedure which minimize the variation in magnitude of angular
momentum of the orbit. Same procedure is used to fix shape and orientation of
the orbit in the plane by minimizing variation in total energy and Laplace
Runge Lenz vector. The method is tested using simulated data for a hypothetical
planet rotating around the sun.
