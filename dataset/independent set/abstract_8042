S. Garcia-Ferreira and H. Ohta gave a construction that was intended to
produce a tau-pseudocompact space, which has a regular-closed zero set A and a
regular-closed C-embedded set B such that neither A nor B is tau-pseudocompact.
We show that although their sets A, B are not regular-closed, there are at
least two ways to make their construction work to give the desired example.
