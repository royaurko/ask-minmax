The Randall-Sundrum-like scenario with the small curvature kappa (RSSC model)
is studied in detail in comparison with the original RS1 model. In the
framework of the RSSC model, the p_t distributions for the dilepton production
at the LHC are calculated. Both dielectron and dimuon events are taken into
account. The important feature of calculations is the account of the widths of
massive graviton excitations. For the summary statistics taken at 7 TeV (L = 5
fb^(-1)) and 8 TeV (L = 20 fb^(-1)), the exclusion limit on the 5-dimensional
gravity scale M_5 is set to be 6.84 TeV at 95% C.L. For sqrt(s) = 13 TeV and
integrated luminosity 30 fb^(-1), the LHC search limit is found to be 10.16
TeV. These bounds on M_5 are independent of kappa (up to powerlike
corrections), provided kappa << M_5.
