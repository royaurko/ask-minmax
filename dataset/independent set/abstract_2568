A newly-proposed parity-violating nucleon-nucleon interaction based on
effective field theory is studied in this work. It is found that at low energy,
i.e., E_lab less than 90 MeV for 1S0-3P0 transitions and E_lab less than 40 MeV
for 3S1-1P1 and 3S1-3P1 transitions, the parity-violating observables can be
completely specified by a minimal set of six parameters. It contains five
low-energy constants, which are equivalent to the Danilov parameters, and an
additional parameter that characterizes the long-range one-pion exchange and is
proportional to the parity-violating pion-nucleon coupling constant. Selected
observables in two-nucleons systems are analyzed in this framework with their
dependence on these parameters being expressed in a nearly model-independent
way.
