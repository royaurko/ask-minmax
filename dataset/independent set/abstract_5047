In this paper, we investigate some properties of the Perron vector of
connected graphs. These results are used to characterize that all extremal
connected graphs with having the minimum (maximum) spectra radius among all
connected graphs of order $n=k\alpha$ with the independence number $\alpha$,
respectively.
