We establish plurisubharmonicity of envelopes of certain classical disc
functionals on locally irreducible complex spaces, thereby generalizing the
corresponding results for complex manifolds. We also find new formulae
expressing the Siciak-Zaharyuta extremal function of an open set in a locally
irreducible affine algebraic variety as the envelope of certain disc
functionals, similarly to what has been done for open sets in C^n by Lempert
and by Larusson and Sigurdsson.
