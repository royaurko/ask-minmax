Constraints on a spin-independent interaction by exchange of a neutral light
boson are derived from precision data on the electron anomalous magnetic moment
and from atomic spectroscopy of hydrogen and deuterium atoms. The mass range
from $1 $eV$/c^2$ to $1 $Mev$/c^2$ is studied and the effective coupling
constant $\alpha^\prime$ is allowed below the level of $10^{-11} - 10^{-13}$
depending on the value of the boson mass. The mass range corresponds to the
Yukawa radius from 0.0002 nm to 20 nm, which covers the distances far above and
far below the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom.
