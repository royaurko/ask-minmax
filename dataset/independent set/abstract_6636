We study sets of nontypical points under the map $f_\beta \mapsto \beta x $
mod 1, for non-integer $\beta$ and extend our results from [F\"arm, Persson,
Schmeling, 2010] in several directions. In particular we prove that sets of
points whose forward orbit avoid certain Cantor sets, and set of points for
which ergodic averages diverge, have large intersection properties. We observe
that the technical condition $\beta>1.541$ found in [F\"arm, Persson,
Schmeling, 2010] can be removed.
