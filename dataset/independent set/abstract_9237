We present a new high-quality nucleon-nucleon potential with explicit charge
dependence and charge asymmetry, which we designate Argonne $v_{18}$. The model
has a charge-independent part with fourteen operator components that is an
updated version of the Argonne $v_{14}$ potential. Three additional
charge-dependent and one charge-asymmetric operators are added, along with a
complete electromagnetic interaction. The potential has been fit directly to
the Nijmegen $pp$ and $np$ scattering data base, low-energy $nn$ scattering
parameters, and deuteron binding energy. With 40 adjustable parameters it gives
a $\chi^{2}$ per datum of 1.09 for 4301 $pp$ and $np$ data in the range 0--350
MeV.
