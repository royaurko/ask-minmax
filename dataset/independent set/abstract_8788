We show that for n billiard particles on the line there exist three open sets
in the product of phase space and the space of their masses, such that these
particles exhibit exactly n-1, n over 2 respectively n+1 over 3 collisions.
These open sets intersect any neighborhood of the diagonal in mass space.
