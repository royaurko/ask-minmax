We construct certain eigenfunctions of the Calogero-Sutherland hamiltonian
for particles on a circle, with mixed boundary conditions. That is, the
behavior of the eigenfunction, as neighbouring particles collide, depend on the
pair of colliding particles. This behavior is generically a linear combination
of two types of power laws, depending on the statistics of the particles
involved. For fixed ratio of each type at each pair of neighboring particles,
there is an eigenfunction, the ground state, with lowest energy, and there is a
discrete set of eigenstates and eigenvalues, the excited states and the
energies above this ground state. We find the ground state and special excited
states along with their energies in a certain class of mixed boundary
conditions, interpreted as having pairs of neighboring bosons and other
particles being fermions. These particular eigenfunctions are characterised by
the fact that they are in direct correspondence with correlation functions in
boundary conformal field theory. We expect that they have applications to
measures on certain configurations of curves in the statistical O(n) loop
model. The derivation, although completely independent from results of
conformal field theory, uses ideas from the "Coulomb gas" formulation.
