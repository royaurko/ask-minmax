We study the geometric properties of the Julia sets of McMullen maps
$f_\lambda(z)=z^m+\lambda/z^l$, where $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$ and
$l,m$ are both positive integers satisfying $1/l+1/m<1$. If the free critical
points of $f_\lambda$ are escaping, we prove that the Julia set $J_\lambda$ of
$f_\lambda$ is quasisymmetrically equivalent to either a standard Cantor set, a
standard Cantor circles or a round Sierpi\'nski carpet (which is also standard
in some sense). If the free critical points are not escaping, we give a
sufficient condition on $\lambda$ to grantee that $J_\lambda$ is a Sierpi\'nski
carpet and prove most of them are quasisymmetrically equivalent to a round one.
In particular, there exists non-hyperbolic rational map whose Julia set is
quasisymmetrically equivalent to a round carpet.
