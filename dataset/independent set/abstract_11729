We investigate the entanglement dynamics of two initially entangled qubits
interacting independently with two uncorrelated reservoirs beyond the Markovian
approximation. Quite different from the Markovian reservoirs [C. E. Lopez et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101 (2008) 080503], we find that entanglement sudden
birth (ESB) of the two reservoirs occurs without certain symmetry with respect
to the entanglement sudden death (ESD) of the two qubits. A phenomenological
interpretation of entanglement revival is also given.
