A class K of structures is controlled if, for all cardinals lambda, the
relation of L_{infty,lambda}-equivalence partitions K into a set of equivalence
classes (as opposed to a proper class). We prove that the class of doubly
transitive linear orders is controlled, while any pseudo-elementary class with
the omega-independence property is not controlled.
