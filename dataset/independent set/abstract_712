Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, I and J ideals of R and M a finitely
generated R-module. Let F be a covariant R-linear functor from the category of
finitely generated R-modules to itself. We first show that if F is coherent,
then the sets of associated primes of F(M/I^n M) and F(I^n-1 M / I^n M) and the
J-depths of F(M/I^n M) and F(I^n-1 M / I^n M) become independent of n for large
n. Next, we consider several examples in which F is a rather familiar functor,
but is not coherent or not even finitely generated in general. In these cases,
the set of associated primes of F(M/I^n M) still becomes independent of n for
large n. We then show one negative result where F is not finitely generated.
Finally, we give a positive result where F belongs to a special class of
functors which are not finitely generated in general, an example of which is
the zeroth local cohomology functor.
