Non-extreme black hole solutions of four dimensional, N=2 supergravity
theories with Calabi-Yau prepotentials are presented, which generalize certain
known double-extreme and extreme solutions. The boost parameters characterizing
the nonextreme solutions must satisfy certain constraints, which effectively
limit the functional independence of the moduli scalars. A necessary condition
for being able to take certain boost parameters independent is found to be
block diagonality of the gauge coupling matrix. We present a number of examples
aimed at developing an understanding of this situation and speculate about the
existence of more general solutions.
