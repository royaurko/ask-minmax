Let Q be an infinite set of positive integers. Denote by W_{\tau, n}(Q)
(resp. W_{\tau, n}) the set of points in dimension n simultaneously
\tau--approximable by infinitely many rationals with denominators in Q (resp.
in N*). A non--trivial lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the liminf
set W_{\tau, n}\W_{\tau, n}(Q) is established when n>1 and \tau >1+1/(n-1) in
the case where the set Q satisfies some divisibility properties. The
computation of the actual value of this Hausdorff dimension as well as the
one--dimensional analogue of the problem are also discussed.
