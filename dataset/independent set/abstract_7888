We present a characterization of the continuous increasing surjections
$\phi:K\to L$ between compact lines $K$ and $L$ for which the corresponding
subalgebra $\phi^*C(L)$ has the $c_0$-extension property in $C(K)$. A natural
question arising in connection with this characterization is shown to be
independent of the axioms of ZFC.
