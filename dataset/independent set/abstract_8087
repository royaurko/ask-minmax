Chaotic transients occur in many experiments including those in fluids, in
simulations of the plane Couette flow, and in coupled map lattices and they are
a common phenomena in dynamical systems. Superlong chaotic transients are
caused by the presence of chaotic saddles whose stable sets have fractal
dimensions that are close to phase-space dimension. For many physical systems
chaotic saddles have a big impact on laboratory measurements, and it is
important to compute the dimension of such stable sets including fractal basin
boundaries through a direct method. In this work, we present a new method to
compute the dimension of stable sets of chaotic saddles directly, fast, and
reliable.
