The direct detection of gravitational waves with the next generation
detectors, like Advanced LIGO, provides the opportunity to measure deviations
from the predictions of General Relativity. One such departure would be the
existence of alternative polarizations. To measure these, we study a single
detector measurement of a continuous gravitational wave from a triaxial pulsar
source. We develop methods to detect signals of any polarization content and
distinguish between them in a model independent way. We present LIGO S5
sensitivity estimates for 115 pulsars.
