A consistent set of six integrable discrete and continuous dynamical systems
are suggested corresponding to arbitrary affine Lie algebra. The set contains a
system of partial differential equations which can be treated as a version of
generalized Toda lattice while semi-discrete systems in the set define the
Backlund transform for this Toda lattice and the fully discrete representative
of the set can be obtained as a superposition of such kind Backlund transforms.
Four linear Zakharov-Shabat type systems taken pairwise realize Lax pairs for
these six dynamical systems.
