We explore the effect of initial conditions on the inflationary wavefunction
and their consequences for the observed spectrum of primordial fluctuations. In
a class of models with a sudden transition into inflation we find that, for a
reasonable set of assumptions about the reheat temperature and the number of
e-foldings, it is possible for initial conditions set by a pre-inflationary
epoch to have an observable effect.
