We describe a constraint analysis for the interaction of the vector-meson
octet with the baryon octet. Applying Dirac's Hamiltonian method, we verify
that the standard interaction in terms of two independent SU(3) structures is
consistent at the classical level. We argue how the requirement of self
consistency with respect to perturbative renormalizability may lead to
relations among the renormalized coupling constants of the system.
