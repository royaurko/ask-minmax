Using a recent calculation of the perturbative hard part for dilepton
production that sums large threshold corrections to all orders in perturbative
QCD, we compute the corresponding cross sections. The hard part has been
evaluated using principal value resummation and contains all singular
momentum-dependent corrections. We also include a resummation of large Sudakov
terms, which are independent of parton momenta. We give predictions for the
dilepton-mass distribution, the rapidity distribution and the
rapidity-integrated $K$-factor at fixed-target energies and compare with
various experimental results in several kinematic regimes. We find that
principal value resummation produces cross sections that are finite and
well-behaved. For both protons and anti-protons on fixed targets, the resummed
cross sections are, in general, in excellent agreement with the data.
