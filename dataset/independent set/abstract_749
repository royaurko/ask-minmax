Inspired by recent work of Geiss-Leclerc-Schroer, we use Hom-finite cluster
categories to give a good candidate set for a basis of (upper) cluster algebras
with coefficients arising from quivers. This set consists of generic values
taken by the cluster character on objects having the same index. If the matrix
associated to the quiver is of full rank, then we prove that the elements in
this set are linearly independent. If the cluster algebra arises from the
setting of Geiss-Leclerc-Schroer, then we obtain the basis found by these
contributors. We show how our point of view agrees with the spirit of conjectures of
Fock-Goncharov concerning the parametrization of a basis of the upper cluster
algebra by points in the tropical X-variety.
