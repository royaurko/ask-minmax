We analyze spin dynamics in the tunneling decay of a metastable localized
state in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We find that the spin
polarization at short time scales is affected by the initial state while at
long time scales both the probability- and the spin density exhibit
diffraction-in-time phenomenon. We find that in addition to the tunneling time
the tunneling in general can be characterized by a new parameter, the tunneling
length. Although the tunneling length is independent on the spin-orbit
coupling, it can be accessed by the spin rotation measurement.
