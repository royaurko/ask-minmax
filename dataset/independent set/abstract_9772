Using Voiculescu's notion of a matricial microstate we introduce fractal
dimensions and entropies for finite sets of selfadjoint operators in a tracial
von Neumann algebra. We show that they possess properties similar to their
classical predecessors. We relate the new quantities to free entropy and free
entropy dimension and show that a modified version of free Hausdorff dimension
is an algebraic invariant. We compute the free Hausdorff dimension in the cases
where the set generates a finite dimensional algebra or where the set consists
of a single selfadjoint. We show that the free Hausdorff dimension becomes
additive for such sets in the presence of freeness.
