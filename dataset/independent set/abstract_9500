Let $N > 1$ be a fixed integer and $(C_1,..., C_N,Q)$ a random element of
$GL(d, \R)^N x \R^d$. We consider solutions of multivariate smoothing
transforms, i.e. random variables $R$ satisfying $$R \eqdist \sum_{i=1}^N C_i
R_i +Q $$ where $\eqdist$ denotes equality in distribution, and $R, R_1,...,
R_N$ are independent identically distributed $\R^d$-valued random variables,
and independent of $(C_1,..., C_N, Q)$. We briefly review conditions for the
existence of solutions, and then study their asymptotic behaviour. We show that
under natural conditions, these solutions exhibit heavy tails. Our results also
cover the case of complex valued weights $(C_1,..., C_N)$.
