Let H: C^2 -> C^2 be the Henon mapping given by (x,y) --> (p(x) - ay,x). The
key invariant subsets are K_+/-, the sets of points with bounded forward
images, J_+/- = the boundary of K_+/-, J = the union of J_+ and J_-, and K =
the union of K_+ and K_-. In this paper we identify the topological structure
of these sets when p is hyperbolic and |a| is sufficiently small, ie, when H
is a small perturbation of the polynomial p. The description involves
projective and inductive limits of objects defined in terms of p alone.
