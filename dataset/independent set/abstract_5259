In this article a class of closed convex sets in the Euclidean $n$-space
which are the convex hull of their profiles is described. Thus a generalization
of Krein-Milman theorem\cite{Lay:1982} to a class of closed non-compact convex
sets is obtained. Sufficient and necessary conditions for convexity, affinity
and starshapedness of a closed set and its boundary have been derived in terms
of their boundary points.
