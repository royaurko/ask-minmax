We report on some technical aspects of our calculation of alpha_s^4
corrections to R(s) and the semi-leptonic tau decay width [1-3]. We discuss the
inner structure of the result as well as the issue of its correctness. We
demonstrate recently appeared independent evidence positively testing one of
two components of the full result.
