In 1989, Deutsch gave a basic physical explanation of why quantum-mechanical
probabilities are squares of amplitudes. Essentially, a general state vector is
transformed into a highly symmetric equal-amplitude superposition. The argument
was recently elaborated and publicised by DeWitt. It has remained incomplete,
however, inasmuch as both contributors anticipate the usual normalization (sum of
amplitudes squared) of state vectors. In the present paper, a thought
experiment is devised in which Deutsch's idea is demonstrated independently of
the normalization, exploiting further symmetries instead.
