The finite element method is popular and robust but still depends heavily on
element shape quality for its performance. In this paper, we introduce the
Adaptive Extended Stencil Finite Element Method (AES-FEM) as a means of
overcoming this dependence on good element shape quality. The traditional
isoparametric basis functions are replaced with a set of polynomial basis
functions constructed using a generalized finite difference method based on a
local weighted least-squares fitting over a stencil of neighboring points. The
test functions are chosen to be the traditional isoparametric shape functions
for finite element method. We describe our formulation, present the
implementation, and show its effectiveness using numerical experiments in two
and three dimensions. The numerical experiments compare FEM, GFD, and two
variations of AES-FEM solving the Poisson equation and a time-independent
convection-diffusion equation on structured and unstructured meshes.
