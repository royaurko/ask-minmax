At the most fundamental level, all digital images are just large arrays of
numbers that can easily be manipulated by computer software. Specialized
digital imaging software packages often use routines common to many different
applications and fields of study. The freely available, platform independent,
image-processing package ImageJ has many such functions. We highlight ImageJ's
capabilities by presenting methods of processing sequences of images to produce
a star trail image and a single high quality planetary image.
