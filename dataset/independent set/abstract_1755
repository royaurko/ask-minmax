This paper generalizes Kingman's model of selection and mutation which
studies the limit distribution of type values (or fitness values) in an asexual
population of discrete generations and infinite size undergoing selection and
mutation. A small set of assumptions for selection effects are proposed and for
the mutation, as in Kingman's model, we assume that the type value of a mutant
is independent of that of parent's. General macroscopic epistasis (or
individual interactions) are designable through selection effect functions.
Convergence to the unique limit type distribution is obtained for the general
model. This setting covers the specific case studied in Kingman's model and
also partially generalizes the framework of B\"urger's. The generalized model
is then applied to Lenski experiment which investigates in the laboratory the
long-term evolution of 12 initially identical populations of Escherichia coli
in identical environments.
