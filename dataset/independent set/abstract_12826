Deformation, a key concept in our understanding of heavy nuclei, is based on
a mean-field description that breaks the rotational invariance of the nuclear
many-body Hamiltonian. We present a method to analyze nuclear deformations at
finite temperature in a framework that preserves rotational invariance. The
auxiliary-field Monte-Carlo method is used to generate the statistical ensemble
and calculate the probability distribution associated with the quadrupole
operator. Applying the technique to nuclei in the rare-earth region, we
identify model-independent signatures of deformation and find that deformation
effects persist to higher temperatures than the spherical-to-deformed shape
phase-transition temperature of mean-field theory.
