An approach is proposed which, given a family of linearly independent
functions, constructs the appropriate biorthogonal set so as to represent the
orthogonal projector operator onto the corresponding subspace. The procedure
evolves iteratively and it is endowed with the following properties: i) it
yields the desired biorthogonal functions avoiding the need of inverse
operations ii) it allows to quickly update a whole family of biorthogonal
functions each time that a new member is introduced in the given set. The
approach is of particular relevance to the approximation problem arising when a
function is to be represented as a finite linear superposition of non
orthogonal waveforms.
