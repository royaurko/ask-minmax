In this article we shall consider the tensor gauge fields which are possible
to embed into the existing framework of generalized YM theory and therefore
allows to construct the gauge invariant and metric independent forms in 2n+4
and 2n+2 dimensions. These new forms are analogous to the
Pontryagin-Chern-Simons densities in YM gauge theory and to the corresponding
series of densities in 2n+3 dimensions constructed recently in arXiv:1205.0027.
