We study thorn forking and rosiness in the context of continuous logic. We
prove that the Urysohn sphere is rosy (with respect to finitary imaginaries),
providing the first example of an essentially continuous unstable theory with a
nice notion of independence. In the process, we show that a real rosy theory
which has weak elimination of finitary imaginaries is rosy with respect to
finitary imaginaries, a fact which is new even for classical real rosy
theories.
