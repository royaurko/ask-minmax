While studying some properties of linear operators in a Euclidean Jordan
algebra, Gowda, Sznajder and Tao have introduced generalized lattice operations
based on the projection onto the cone of squares. In two recent papers of the
contributors of the present paper it has been shown that these lattice-like
operators and their generalizations are important tools in establishing the
isotonicity of the metric projection onto some closed convex sets. The results
of this kind are motivated by metods for proving the existence of solutions of
variational inequalities and methods for finding these solutions in a recursive
way. It turns out, that the closed convex sets admitting isotone projections
are exactly the sets which are invariant with respect to these lattice-like
operations, called lattice-like sets. In this paper it is shown that the Jordan
subalgebras are lattice-like sets, but the converse in general is not true. In
the case of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras of rank at least three the
lattice-like property is rather restrictive, e.g., there are no lattice-like
proper closed convex sets with interior points.
