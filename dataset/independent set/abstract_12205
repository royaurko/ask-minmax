We consider a Markov-modulated Brownian motion reflected to stay in a strip
[0,B]. The stationary distribution of this process is known to have a simple
form under some assumptions. We provide a short probabilistic argument leading
to this result and explaining its simplicity. Moreover, this argument allows
for generalizations including the distribution of the reflected process at an
independent exponentially distributed epoch. Our second contribution concerns
transient behavior of the reflected system. We identify the joint law of the
processes t,X(t),J(t) at inverse local times.
