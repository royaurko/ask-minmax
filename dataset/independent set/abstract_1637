Three methods for detecting and characterizing structure in point data, such
as that generated by redshift surveys, are described: classification using
self-organizing maps, segmentation using Bayesian blocks, and density
estimation using adaptive kernels. The first two methods are new, and allow
detection and characterization of structures of arbitrary shape and at a wide
range of spatial scales. These methods should elucidate not only clusters, but
also the more distributed, wide-ranging filaments and sheets, and further allow
the possibility of detecting and characterizing an even broader class of
shapes. The methods are demonstrated and compared in application to three data
sets: a carefully selected volume-limited sample from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey redshift data, a similarly selected sample from the Millennium
Simulation, and a set of points independently drawn from a uniform probability
distribution -- a so-called Poisson distribution. We demonstrate a few of the
many ways in which these methods elucidate large scale structure in the
distribution of galaxies in the nearby Universe.
