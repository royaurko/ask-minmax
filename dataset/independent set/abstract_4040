We analyze theoretically the problem of cargo transport along microtubules by
motors of two species with opposite polarities. We consider two different
one-dimensional models previously developed in the literature. On the one hand,
a quite widespread model which assumes equal force sharing, here referred to as
mean field model (MFM). On the other hand, a stochastic model (SM) which
considers individual motor-cargo links. We find that in generic situations the
MFM predicts larger cargo mean velocity, smaller mean run time and less
frequent reversions than the SM. These phenomena are found to be consequences
of the load sharing assumptions and can be interpreted in terms the
probabilities of the different motility states. We also explore the influence
of the viscosity in both models and the role of the stiffness of the
motor-cargo links within the SM. Our results show that the mean cargo velocity
is independent of the stiffness while the mean run time decreases with such a
parameter. We explore the case of symmetric forward and backward motors
considering kinesin- 1 parameters, and the problem of transport by kinesin-1
and cytoplasmic dyneins considering two different sets of parameters previously
proposed for dyneins.
