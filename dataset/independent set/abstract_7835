We prove some results related to a conjecture of Hivert and Thi\'ery about
the dimension of the space of q-harmonics. In the process we compute the
actions of the involved operators on symmetric and alternating functions, which
have some independent interest. We then use these computations to prove other
results related to the same conjecture.
