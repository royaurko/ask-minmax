In this paper, we propose a cross-layer analytical model for the study of
Network Coding (NC)-based Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) Medium Access Control
(MAC) protocols in correlated slow faded (shadowed) environments, where two end
nodes are assisted by a cluster of relays to exchange data packets. The goal of
our work is threefold: i) to provide general Physical (PHY) layer theoretical
expressions for estimating crucial network parameters (i.e., network outage
probability and expected size of the active relay set), applicable in two-way
communications, ii) to demonstrate how these expressions are incorporated in
theoretical models of the upper layers (i.e., MAC), and iii) to study the
performance of a recently proposed NC-aided Cooperative ARQ (NCCARQ) MAC
protocol under correlated shadowing conditions. Extensive Monte Carlo
experiments have been carried out to validate the efficiency of the developed
analytical model and to investigate the realistic performance of NCCARQ. Our
results indicate that the number of active relays is independent of the
shadowing correlation in the wireless links and reveal intriguing trade-offs
between throughput and energy efficiency, highlighting the importance of
cross-layer approaches for the assessment of cooperative MAC protocols.
