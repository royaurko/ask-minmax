High statistics Standard Model processes like fermion- and photon-pair
production in e+e- collisions are studied at centre-of-mass energies up to 209
GeV. No significant deviation from the Standard Model is observed, leading to
strong constraints on models with additional heavy vector bosons, contact
interactions and low scale gravity. A largely model independent determination
of the Z mass becomes feasible with the measurement of gamma / Z interference
in e+e- to q q-bar at LEPII .
