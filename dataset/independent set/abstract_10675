In a recent paper, general solutions for the vacuum wave functionals in the
Schrodinger picture were given for a variety of classes of curved spacetimes.
Here, we describe a number of simple examples which illustrate how the presence
of spacetime boundaries influences the vacuum wave functional and how physical
quantities are independent of the choice of spacetime foliation used in the
Schrodinger approach despite the foliation dependence of the wave functionals
themselves.
