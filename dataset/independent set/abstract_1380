The paper formalizes and extends the idea of local structure approximation
for cellular automata originally proposed by Gutowitz et. al. We start with a
review of the construction of a probability measure on the set of bi-infinite
strings over a finite alphabet of $N$ symbols. We then demonstrate that for a
shift-invariant probability measure, probabilities of all blocks of length up
to $k$ can be expressed by $(N-1)N^{k-1}$ linearly independent block
probabilities. Two choices of these independent blocks are discussed in detail,
one in which we choose the longest possible blocks ("long form") and one in
which we choose the shortest possible blocks ("short form"). We then proceed to
review the method which allows to approximate probabilities of blocks longer
than $k$ by blocks of length $k$ or less. This approximation, known as Bayesian
extension or Markov measure, is then used to construct approximate orbits of
shift-invariant probability measures under the action of probabilistic or
deterministic cellular automaton. We show that the aforementioned approximate
orbit is completely determined by an $(N-1)N^{k1}$-dimensional map. When the
short form of block probabilities is used, this map takes particularly simple
form, often revealing important features of a particular cellular automaton.
