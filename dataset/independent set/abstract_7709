Models describing one- and two-photon transitions for ions in crystalline
environments are unified and extended to the case of parity-allowed and parity-
forbidden p-photon transitions. The number of independent parameters for
characterizing the polarization dependence is shown to depend on an ensemble of
properties and rules which combine symmetry considerations and physical models.
