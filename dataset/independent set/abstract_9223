We discuss the proposal of Freedman, Ringo, and Dombeck to search for the
neutron electric dipole moment use of the acceleration of neutrons in an
inhomogeneous electric field followed by amplification of the resulting
displacement by several methods involving spin independent interactions
(gravity) or reflection from curved (spin independent) mirrors. We show that
the proposed technique is inferior to the usual methods based on magnetic
resonance.
