Directional point-contact spectroscopy measurements were performed for the
first time in state-of-the-art MgB_2 single crystals. The selective suppression
of the superconductivity in the "pi" band by means of a suitable magnetic field
allowed separating the partial contribution of each band to the total
point-contact conductance. By fitting the partial conductance curves
sigma_sigma(V) and sigma_pi(V), we got an independent determination of the two
gaps, Delta_sigma and Delta_pi, with a strong reduction of the experimental
uncertainty. Their temperature dependence was found to agree well with the
predictions of the two-band models for MgB_2.
