In this work we show that the prime distribution is deterministic. Indeed the
set of prime numbers P can be expressed in terms of two subsets of N using
three specific selection rules, acting on two sets of prime candidates. The
prime candidates are obtained in terms of the first perfect number. The
asymptotic behaviour is also considered.
  We obtain for the first time an explicit relation for generating the full set
P of prime numbers smaller than n or equal to n.
