Recently V. Ginzburg proved that Calogero phase space is a coadjoint orbit
for some infinite dimensional Lie algebra coming from noncommutative symplectic
geometry. In this note we generalize this argument to specific quotient
varieties of representations of (deformed) preprojective algebras. This result
was also obtained independently by V. Ginzburg.
