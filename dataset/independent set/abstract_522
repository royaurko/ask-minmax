Recent studies of exclusive electroproduction of vector mesons at JLab make
it possible for the first time to play with two independent hard scales: the
virtuality Q^2 of the photon, which sets the observation scale, and the
momentum transfer t to the hadronic system, which sets the interaction scale.
They reinforce the description of hard scattering processes in terms of few
effective degrees of freedom relevant to the Jlab-Hermes energy range.
