The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the noise in
a position measurement and the momentum disturbance caused by that measurement
should be no less than the limit set by Planck's constant, hbar/2, as
demonstrated by Heisenberg's thought experiment using a gamma-ray microscope.
Here I show that this common assumption is false: a universally valid trade-off
relation between the noise and the disturbance has an additional correlation
term, which is redundant when the intervention brought by the measurement is
independent of the measured object, but which allows the noise-disturbance
product much below Planck's constant when the intervention is dependent. A
model of measuring interaction with dependent intervention shows that
Heisenberg's lower bound for the noise-disturbance product is violated even by
a nearly nondisturbing, precise position measuring instrument. An experimental
implementation is also proposed to realize the above model in the context of
optical quadrature measurement with currently available linear optical devices.
