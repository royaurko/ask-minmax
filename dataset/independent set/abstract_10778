Classical vortex solutions in $(1+2)$-dimensional multi-Higgs systems are
studied. In particular the existence of such a solution requires equal
characteristic lengths and a specific relation between the ratio of the two
Higgs vacuum expectation values and the couplings in the Higgs potential, if
$\lambda_3\neq 0$.
