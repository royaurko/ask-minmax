Some selected catalogs of the effective temperatures for F, G and K stars are
analyzed. By an improved technique we estimate the external errors of these
catalogs from data intercomparisons. The values of the effective temperatures
are then averaged with the appropriate weights to produce a mean homogeneous
catalog based on the selected data. This catalog, containing 800 stars, is
compared with some other independent catalogs for estimating their external
errors. The data may be used as a source of reliable homogeneous values of
effective temperatures, together with their errors.
