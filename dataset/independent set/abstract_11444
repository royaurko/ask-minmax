We present an investigation of six quarks system kinematics, independent on
quark-quark interactions. There has been created and investigated basis of six
quarks antisymmetrical and translationally invariant functions, applying
formalism with spin, isospin, and color degrees of freedom and many-particle
harmonic oscillator (HO) functions, dependent on Jacobian variables. We have
also investigated expansions of realistic wave-functions in this basis. There
are given analytical expressions for matrix elements of three and six particle
antisymmetrizers and probability to find two colorless hadrons in six quarks
system.
