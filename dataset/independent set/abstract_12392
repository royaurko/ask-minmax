We study l-independence of monodromy groups G_l of any compatible system of
l-adic representations (in the sense of Serre) of number field K assuming
semisimplicity. We prove that the formal character of the derived group of the
identity component of G_l is independent of l and the (complexified) Lie
algebra g_l of G_l satisfies an equal-rank subalgebra equivalence for all l.
This equivalence is equivalent to the l-independence of the number of A_n
factors for all n belonging to {6,9,10,11,...} and the parity of A_4 factors in
g_l.
