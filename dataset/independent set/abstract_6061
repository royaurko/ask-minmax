In this paper we present a workflow to design and control robot manipulation
behavior. To remain independent from particular robot hardware and an explicit
area of application, an embedded domain specific language (eDSL) is used to
describe the particular robot and a controller network that drives the robot.
We make use of a) a component-based software framework, b) model-based
algorithms for motion- and sensor processing representations, c) an abstract
model of the control system, and d) a plan management software, to describe a
sequence of software component networks that generate the desired robot
behavior.
  As first results, we present an eDSL for the description of a robotic system
composed of mechatronic subsystems, and for the creation of a multi-stage
control network.
