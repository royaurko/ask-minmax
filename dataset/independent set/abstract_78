Let G be a graph and let N_1, ..., N_k be k independent sets in G. The graph
G is a k-probe cograph if G can be embedded into a cograph by adding edges
between vertices that are contained in the same independent set. We show that
there exists an O(k n^5) algorithm to check if a graph G is a k-probe cograph.
