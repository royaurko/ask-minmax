We present a model independent analysis of inelastic dark matter transitions
at direct detection experiments by modifying the elastic methodology of
Fitzpatrick, et al. By analyzing the kinematics of inelastic transitions, we
find the relevant variables to describe these scattering processes, the primary
change being a modification of the $\vec{v}^\perp$ variable. Taking this into
account, we list the relevant scattering matrix elements and modify the
Mathematica package of Anand, et al. to calculate the necessary form factors.
As an application, we determine the matrix elements of inelastic scattering for
spin transitions between a fermion to fermion, scalar to vector, and scalar to
scalar. Finally, we consider fits to the DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation signal
for the magnetic inelastic dark matter scenario as well as a model independent
scan over relativistic operators, constraining them with limits from direct
detection experiments. In the magnetic inelastic dark matter scenario or if the
dark matter couples through relativistic operators involving only protons, we
find that experiments with xenon and germanium targets can have consistently
small rates. However, limits from iodine experiments are much more
constraining, leaving small regions of allowed parameter space. We point out
that existing uncertainties in the iodine quenching factor strongly affects the
constraints, motivating further study to pin down the correct values.
