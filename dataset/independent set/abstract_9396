We compare three methods for computing invariant Lyapunov exponents (LEs) in
general relativity. They involve the geodesic deviation vector technique (M1),
the two-nearby-orbits method with projection operations and with coordinate
time as an independent variable (M2), and the two-nearby-orbits method without
projection operations and with proper time as an independent variable (M3). An
analysis indicates that M1 and M3 do not need any projection operation. In
general, the values of LEs from the three methods are almost the same. As an
advantage, M3 is simpler to use than M2. In addition, we propose to construct
the invariant fast Lyapunov indictor (FLI) with two-nearby-trajectories and
give its algorithm in order to quickly distinguish chaos from order. Taking a
static axisymmetric spacetime as a physical model, we apply the invariant FLIs
to explore the global dynamics of phase space of the system where regions of
chaos and order are clearlyidentified.
