The current work introduces the notion of pdominant sets and studies their
recursion-theoretic properties. Here a set $A$ is called pdominant iff there is
a partial $A$-recursive function $\psi$ such that for every partial recursive
function $\phi$ and almost every $x$ in the domain of $\phi$ there is a $y$ in
the domain of $\psi$ with $y \leq x$ and $\psi(y) > \phi(x)$. While there is a
full $\Pi^0_1$-class of nonrecursive sets where no set is pdominant, there is
no $\Pi^0_1$-class containing only pdominant sets. No weakly $2$-generic set is
pdominant while there are pdominant $1$-generic sets below $K$. The halves of
Chaitin's $\Omega$ are pdominant. No set which is low for Martin-L\"of random
is pdominant. There is a low r.e. set which is pdominant and a high r.e. set
which is not pdominant.
