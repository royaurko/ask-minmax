We investigate the interior nodal sets $\mathcal{N}_\lambda$ of Steklov
eigenfunctions on compact surfaces with boundary. The optimal vanishing order
of Steklov eigenfunctions is shown be $C\lambda$. The singular sets
$\mathcal{S}_\lambda$ are finite points on the nodal sets. We are able to prove
that the Hausdorff measure $H^0(\mathcal{S}_\lambda)\leq C\lambda^2$.
Furthermore, we obtain an upper bound for the measure of interior nodal sets
$H^1(\mathcal{N}_\lambda)\leq C\lambda^{\frac{3}{2}}$. Here those positive
constants $C$ depend only on the surfaces.
