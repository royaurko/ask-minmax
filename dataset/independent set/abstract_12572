In this work a study of the gravity is made using Einstein's equation in the
post-Newtonian approach. This is a method to linearise the General Relativity
indicated to treat non-relativistic objects. It enables us to construct, from
metric-independent elements, fields that are governed by equations similar to
the Maxwell's ones in Lorentz gauge. We promediate these equations for matter
distributed in local systems, like solar systems or galaxies. Finally we define
the large scale fields for this distribution, which includes terms analogous to
electromagnetic case, like polarization, magnetization and superiors terms.
