A fair sack is a finite set of independent dice, not required to be fair and
allowed to have any number of sides, for which all totals are equally likely.
These have been studied for over 60 years. Most results restrict the possible
orders of dice in such a sack and almost no examples were known. Building on a
rather different approach due to Gasarch and Kruskal, we give an explicit
construction of all such sacks.
