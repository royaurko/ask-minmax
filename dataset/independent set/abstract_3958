Using the low-energy effective field theory for magnons, we systematically
evaluate the partition function of the O(3) ferromagnet up to three loops.
Dyson, in his pioneering microscopic analysis of the Heisenberg model, showed
that the spin-wave interaction starts manifesting itself in the low-temperature
expansion of the spontaneous magnetization of an ideal ferromagnet only at
order $T^4$. Although several contributors tried to go beyond Dyson's result, to the
best of our knowledge, a fully systematic and rigorous investigation of higher
order terms induced by the spin-wave interaction, has never been achieved. As
we demonstrate in the present paper, it is straightforward to evaluate the
partition function of an ideal ferromagnet beyond Dyson's analysis, using
effective Lagrangian techniques. In particular, we show that the
next-to-leading contribution to the spontaneous magnetization resulting from
the spin-wave interaction already sets in at order $T^{9/2}$ -- in contrast to
all claims that have appeared before in the literature. Remarkably, the
corresponding coefficient is completely determined by the leading-order
effective Lagrangian and is thus independent of the anisotropies of the cubic
lattice. We also consider even higher-order corrections and thereby solve --
once and for all -- the question of how the spin-wave interaction in an ideal
ferromagnet manifests itself in the spontaneous magnetization beyond the Dyson
term.
