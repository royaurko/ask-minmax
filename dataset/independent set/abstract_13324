We take a first step towards the solution of QCD in 1+1 dimensions at nonzero
density. We regularize the theory in the UV by using a lattice and in the IR by
putting the theory in a box of spatial size L. After fixing to axial gauge we
use the coherent states approach to obtain the large-N classical Hamiltonian H
that describes color neutral quark-antiquark pairs interacting with spatial
Polyakov loops in the background of baryons. Minimizing H we get a regularized
form of the `t Hooft equation that depends on the expectation values of the
Polyakov loops. Analyzing the L-dependence of this equation we show how volume
independence, a la Eguchi and Kawai, emerges in the large-N limit, and how it
depends on the expectation values of the Polyakov loops. We describe how this
independence relies on the realization of translation symmetry, in particular
when the ground state contains a baryon crystal. Finally, we remark on the
implications of our results on studying baryon density in large-N QCD within
single-site lattice theories, and on some general lessons concerning the way
four-dimensional large-N QCD behaves in the presence of baryons.
