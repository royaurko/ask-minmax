We propose an atom-interferometry experiment based on the scalar
Aharonov-Bohm effect which detects an atom charge at the 10^{-28}e level, and
improves the current laboratory limits by 8 orders of magnitude. This setup
independently probes neutron charges down to 10^{-28}e, 7 orders of magnitude
below current bounds.
