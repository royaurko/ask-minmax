The boundary integral method is an efficient approach for solving
time-harmonic acoustic obstacle scattering problems. The main computational
task is the evaluation of an oscillatory boundary integral at each
discretization point of the boundary. This paper presents a new fast algorithm
for this task in two dimensions. This algorithm is built on top of directional
low-rank approximations of the scattering kernel and uses oscillatory Chebyshev
interpolation and local FFTs to achieve quasi-linear complexity. The algorithm
is simple, fast, and kernel-independent. Numerical results are provided to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
