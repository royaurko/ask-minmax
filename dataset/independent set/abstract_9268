We study the robustness of the GHZ (or ``cat'') class of multi-partite states
under decoherence. The noise model is described by a general completely
positive map for qubits independently coupled to the environment. In
particular, the robustness of N-party entanglement is studied in the large N
limit when (a) the number of spatially separated subsystems is fixed but the
size of each subsystem becomes large (b) the size of the subsystems is fixed
while their number becomes arbitrarily large. We obtain conditions for
entanglement in these two cases. Among our other results, we show that the
parity of an entangled state (i.e., whether it contains an even or odd number
of qubits) can lead to qualitatively different robustness of entanglement under
certain conditions.
