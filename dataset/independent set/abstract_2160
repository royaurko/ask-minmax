Numerical linear algebra plays an important role in computer science. In this
paper, we initiate the study of performing linear algebraic tasks while
preserving privacy when the data is streamed online. Our main focus is the
space requirement of the privacy-preserving data-structures. We give the first
{\em sketch-based} algorithm for differential privacy. We give optimal, up to
logarithmic factor, space data-structures that can compute low rank
approximation, linear regression, and matrix multiplication, while preserving
differential privacy with better additive error bounds compared to the known
results. Notably, we match the best known space bound in the non-private
setting by Kane and Nelson (J. ACM, 61(1):4).
  Our mechanism for differentially private low-rank approximation {\em reuses}
the random Gaussian matrix in a specific way to provide a single-pass
mechanism. We prove that the resulting distribution also preserve differential
privacy. This can be of independent interest. We do not make any assumptions,
like singular value separation or normalized row assumption, as made in the
earlier works. The mechanisms for matrix multiplication and linear regression
can be seen as the private analogues of the known non-private algorithms. All
our mechanisms, in the form presented, can also be computed in the distributed
setting.
