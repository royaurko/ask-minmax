In this paper we show that the value at zero of the zeta function of the
Laplacian on the non-commutative two torus, endowed with its canonical
conformal structure, is independent of the choice of the volume element (Weyl
factor) given by a (non-unimodular) state. We had obtained, in the late
eighties, in an unpublished computation, a general formula for this value at
zero involving modified logarithms of the modular operator of the state. We
give here the detailed computation and prove that the result is independent of
the Weyl factor as in the classical case, thus proving the analogue of the
Gauss-Bonnet theorem for the noncommutative two torus.
