Janson and Janson, Luczak and Rucinski proved several inequalities for the
lower tail of the distribution of the number of events that hold, when all the
events are up-sets (increasing events) of a special form - each event is the
intersection of some subset of a single set of independent events (i.e., a
principal up-set). We show that these inequalities in fact hold for arbitrary
up-sets, by modifying existing proofs to use only positive correlation,
avoiding the need to assume positive correlation conditioned on one of the
events.
