As an extension of projective homology, stereohomology is proposed via an
extension of Desargues theorem and the extended Desargues configuration.
Geometric transformations such as reflection, translation, central symmetry,
central projection, parallel projection, shearing, central dilation, scaling,
and so on are all included in stereohomology and represented as
Householder-Chen elementary matrices. Hence all these geometric transformations
are called elementary. This makes it possible to represent these elementary
geometric transformations in homogeneous square matrices independent of a
particular choice of coordinate system.
