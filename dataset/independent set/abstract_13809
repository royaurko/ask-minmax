In this paper, we establish a bijection between the set of mutation classes
of mutation-cyclic skew-symmetric integral 3x3-matrices and the set of triples
of integers (a,b,c) which are all greater than 1 and where the product of the
two smaller numbers is greater than or equal to the maximal number. We also
give an algorithm allowing to verify whether a matrix is mutation-cyclic or
not. We prove that these two cases are not intertwined.
