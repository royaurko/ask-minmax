We retrieve the non-BPS extremal black hole superpotential of N=8, d=4
supergravity by using the Maurer-Cartan equations of the symmetric space
E_7(7)/SU(8). This superpotential was recently obtained with different 3- and
4-dimensional techniques. The present derivation is independent on the
reduction to d=3.
