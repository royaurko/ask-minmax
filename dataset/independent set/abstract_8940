Let $f$ be a meromorphic function with bounded set of singular values and for
which infinity is a logarithmic singularity. Then we show that $f$ has
infinitely many repelling periodic points for any minimal period $n\geq1$,
using a much simpler argument than the more general results for arbitrary
entire transcendental functions.
