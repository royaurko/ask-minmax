Much recent work has concerned sparse approximations to speed up the Gaussian
process regression from the unfavorable O(n3) scaling in computational time to
O(nm2). Thus far, work has concentrated on models with one covariance function.
However, in many practical situations additive models with multiple covariance
functions may perform better, since the data may contain both long and short
length-scale phenomena. The long length-scales can be captured with global
sparse approximations, such as fully independent conditional (FIC), and the
short length-scales can be modeled naturally by covariance functions with
compact support (CS). CS covariance functions lead to naturally sparse
covariance matrices, which are computationally cheaper to handle than full
covariance matrices. In this paper, we propose a new sparse Gaussian process
model with two additive components: FIC for the long length-scales and CS
covariance function for the short length-scales. We give theoretical and
experimental results and show that under certain conditions the proposed model
has the same computational complexity as FIC. We also compare the model
performance of the proposed model to additive models approximated by fully and
partially independent conditional (PIC). We use real data sets and show that
our model outperforms FIC and PIC approximations for data sets with two
additive phenomena.
