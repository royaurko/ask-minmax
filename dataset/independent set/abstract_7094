We discuss issues in a scenario that hierarchical Yukawa couplings are
generated through strong dynamics of superconformal field theories (SCFTs).
Independently of mediation mechanism of supersymmetry breaking, infrared
convergence property of SCFTs can provide an interesting solution to
supersymmetric flavor problem; sfermion masses are suppressed around the
decoupling scale of SCFTs and eventually become degenerate to some degree,
thanks to family-independent radiative corrections governed by the SM gaugino
masses. We discuss under what conditions the degeneracy of sfermion mass can be
estimated in a simple manner. We also discuss the constraints from lepton
flavor violations. We then study explicitly sfermion mass degeneracy within the
framework of grand unified theories coupled to SCFTs. It is found that the
degeneracy for right-handed sleptons becomes worse in the conventional SU(5)
model than in the MSSM. On the other hand, in the flipped SU(5) \times U(1)
model, each right-handed lepton is still an SU(5)-singlet, whereas the bino
mass M_1 is determined by two independent gaugino masses of SU(5) \times U(1).
These two properties enable us to have an improved degeneracy for the
right-handed sleptons. We also speculate how further improvement can be
obtained in the SCFT approach.
