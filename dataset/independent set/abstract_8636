Among other things, we show that the ideal sheaf of a complex Hilbert
submanifold of a pseudoconvex open subset of Hilbert space is acyclic over the
ambient pseudoconvex open set. We also prove a vanishing theorem for a fairly
general class of analytic sheaves over pseudoconvex open sets of a large class
of Banach spaces. Some applications are also given.
