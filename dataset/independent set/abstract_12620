We present the stochastic solution to a generalized fractional partial
differential equation involving a regularized operator related to the so-called
Prabhakar operator and admitting, amongst others, as specific cases the
fractional diffusion equation and the fractional telegraph equation. The
stochastic solution is expressed as a L\'evy process time-changed with the
inverse process to a linear combination of (possibly subordinated) independent
stable subordinators of different indices. Furthermore a related SDE is derived
and discussed.
