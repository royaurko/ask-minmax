We prove that H\"ormander's global wave front set and Nakamura's homogeneous
wave front set of a tempered distribution coincide. In addition we construct a
tempered distribution with a given wave front set, and we develop a
pseudodifferential calculus adapted to Nakamura's homogeneous wave front set.
