We partition the fast escaping set of a transcendental entire function into
two subsets, the maximally fast escaping set and the non-maximally fast
escaping set. These sets are shown to have strong dynamical properties. We show
that the intersection of the Julia set with the non-maximally fast escaping set
is never empty. The proof uses a new covering result for annuli, which is of
wider interest.
  It was shown by Rippon and Stallard that the fast escaping set has no bounded
components. In contrast, by studying a function considered by Hardy, we give an
example of a transcendental entire function for which the maximally and
non-maximally fast escaping sets each have uncountably many singleton
components.
