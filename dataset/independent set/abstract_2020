We review the available near- and mid-infrared photometry for white dwarfs
obtained from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and by the Spitzer Space
Telescope. Both data sets have recently been used to seek white dwarfs with
infrared excesses due to the presence of unresolved companions or circumstellar
disks, and also to derive the atmospheric parameters of cool white dwarfs. We
first attempt to evaluate the reliability of the 2MASS photometry by comparing
it with an independent set of published JHK CIT magnitudes for 160 cool white
dwarf stars, and also by comparing the data with the predictions of detailed
model atmosphere calculations. The possibility of using 2MASS to identify
unresolved M dwarf companions or circumstellar disks is then discussed. We also
revisit the analysis of 46 binary candidates from Wachter et al. using the
synthetic flux method and confirm the large near-infrared excesses in most
objects. We perform a similar analysis by fitting Spitzer 4.5 and 8 micron
photometric observations of white dwarfs with our grid of model atmospheres,
and demonstrate the reliability of both the Spitzer data and the theoretical
calculations up to 8 micron. Finally, we search for massive disks resulting
from the merger of two white dwarfs in a 2MASS sample composed of 57 massive
degenerates, and show that massive disks are uncommon in such stars.
