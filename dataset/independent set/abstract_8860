We discuss Rayleigh-Ritz variational calculations with nonorthogonal basis
sets that exhibit the correct asymptotic behaviour. We construct the suitable
basis sets for general one-dimensional models and illustrate the application of
the approach on two double-well oscillators proposed recently by other contributors.
The rate of convergence of the variational method proves to be considerably
greater than the one exhibited by the recently developed orthogonal polynomial
projection quantization.
