Given a group G, the model $\mathcal{G}(G,p)$ denotes the probability space
of all Cayley graphs of G where each element of the generating set is chosen
independently at random with probability p.
  In this article we show that for any $\epsilon > 0$ and any family of groups
G_k of order n_k for which $n_k \to \infty$, a graph $\Gamma_k \in
\mathcal{G}(G_k,p)$ with high probability has diameter at most 2 if $p
\geqslant \sqrt{(2 + \epsilon) \frac{\log{n_k}}{n_k}}$ and with high
probability has diameter greater than 2 if $p \leqslant \sqrt{(1/4 +
\epsilon)\frac{\log{n_k}}{n_k}}$.
  We also provide examples of families of graphs which show that both of these
results are best possible.
  Of particular interest is that for some families of groups, the corresponding
random Cayley graphs achieve diameter 2 significantly faster than the
Erd\H{o}s-Renyi random graphs.
