In this paper, B=3 soliton solutions with tetrahedral symmetry are obtained
numerically in the chiral quark soliton model using the rational map ansatz.
The solution exhibits a triply degenerate bound spectrum of the quark orbits in
the background of tetrahedrally symmetric pion field configuration. The
corresponding baryon density is tetrahedral in shape. Our numerical technique
is independent on the baryon number and its application to $B \geq 4$ is
straightforward.
