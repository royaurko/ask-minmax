Suppose a sequence of random variables {X_n} has negative drift when above a
certain threshold and has increments bounded in L^p. When p>2 this implies that
EX_n is bounded above by a constant independent of n and the particular
sequence {X_n}. When p=<2 there are counterexamples showing this does not hold.
In general, increments bounded in L^p lead to a uniform L^r bound on X_n^+ for
any r<p-1, but not for r>=p-1. These results are motivated by questions about
stability of queueing networks.
