Suppose that a cup is installed at every point of a planar set $P$, and that
somebody pours water into the cups. The total rate at which the water flows
into the cups is 1. A player moves in the plane with unit speed, emptying the
cups. At any time, the player sees how much water there is in every cup. The
player has no information on how the water will be poured into the cups in the
future; in particular, the pouring may depend on the player's motion. The
backlog of the player is the maximum amount of water in any cup at any time,
and the player's objective is to minimise the backlog. Let $D$ be the diameter
of $P$. If the water is poured at the rate of 1/2 into the cups at the ends of
a diameter, the backlog is $\Omega(D)$. We show that there is a strategy for a
player that guarantees the backlog of $O(D)$, matching the lower bound up to a
multiplicative constant. Note that our guarantee is independent of the number
of the cups.
