There is a familiar conjugate for integer partitions: transpose the Ferrers
diagram, and a conjugate for integer compositions: transpose a Ferrers-like
diagram. Here we propose a conjugate for set partitions and show that it
interchanges # singletons and # adjacencies. Its restriction to noncrossing
partitions cropped up in a 1972 paper of Kreweras. We also exhibit an analogous
pairs of statistics interchanged by the composition conjugate.
