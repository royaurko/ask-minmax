The evaluation of the average number S_N(t) of distinct sites visited up to
time t by N independent random walkers all starting from the same origin on an
Euclidean lattice is addressed. We find that, for the nontrivial time regime
and for large N, S_N(t) \approx \hat S_N(t) (1-\Delta), where \hat S_N(t) is
the volume of a hypersphere of radius (4Dt \ln N)^{1/2},
\Delta={1/2}\sum_{n=1}^\infty \ln^{-n} N \sum_{m=0}^n s_m^{(n)} \ln^{m} \ln N,
d is the dimension of the lattice, and the coefficients s_m^{(n)} depend on the
dimension and time. The first three terms of these series are calculated
explicitly and the resulting expressions are compared with other approximations
and with simulation results for dimensions 1, 2, and 3. Some implications of
these results on the geometry of the set of visited sites are discussed.
