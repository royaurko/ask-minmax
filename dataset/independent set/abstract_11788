Recently it has been discovered that certain two-qutrit entangled states
interacting with global and/or multi-local decoherence undergo distillability
sudden death (DSD). We investigate this phenomenon for qutrit-qutrit systems
interacting with statistically independent zero-temperature reservoirs. We show
that certain initially prepared free-entangled states become bound-entangled in
a finite time due to the action of Markovian dissipative environment. Moreover,
in contrast with local dephasing, simple local unitary transformations can
completely avoid distillability sudden death under amplitude damping.
