Define the non-overlapping return time of a random process to be the number
of blocks that we wait before a particular block reappears. We prove a Central
Limit Theorem based on these return times. This result has applications to
entropy estimation, and to the problem of determining if digits have come from
an independent equidistribted sequence. In the case of an equidistributed
sequence, we use an argument based on negative association to prove convergence
under weaker conditions.
