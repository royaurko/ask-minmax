Given a convex set and an interior point close to the boundary, we prove the
existence of a supporting hyperplane whose distance to the point is controlled,
in a dimensionally quantified way, by the thickness of the convex set in the
orthogonal direction. This result has important applications in the regularity
theory for Monge-Amp\`ere type equations arising in optimal transportation.
