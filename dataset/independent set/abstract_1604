This report describes the MUDOS-NG summarization system, which applies a set
of language-independent and generic methods for generating extractive
summaries. The proposed methods are mostly combinations of simple operators on
a generic character n-gram graph representation of texts. This work defines the
set of used operators upon n-gram graphs and proposes using these operators
within the multi-document summarization process in such subtasks as document
analysis, salient sentence selection, query expansion and redundancy control.
Furthermore, a novel chunking methodology is used, together with a novel way to
assign concepts to sentences for query expansion. The experimental results of
the summarization system, performed upon widely used corpora from the Document
Understanding and the Text Analysis Conferences, are promising and provide
evidence for the potential of the generic methods introduced. This work aims to
designate core methods exploiting the n-gram graph representation, providing
the basis for more advanced summarization systems.
