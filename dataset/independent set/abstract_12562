The ability to predict the future in a given domain can be acquired by
discovering empirically from experience certain temporal patterns that tend to
repeat unerringly. Previous works in time series analysis allow one to make
quantitative predictions on the likely values of certain linear variables.
Since certain types of knowledge are better expressed in symbolic forms, making
qualitative predictions based on symbolic representations require a different
approach. A domain independent methodology called TIM (Time based Inductive
Machine) for discovering potentially uncertain temporal patterns from real time
observations using the technique of inductive inference is described here.
