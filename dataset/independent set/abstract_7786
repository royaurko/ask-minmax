Relativistic thermodynamics is treated from the point of view of kinetic
theory. It is shown that the generalized J\"uttner distribution suggested in
[1] is compatible with kinetic equilibrium. The requirement of compatibility of
kinetic and thermodynamic equilibrium reveals several generalizations of the
Gibbs relation where the velocity field is an independent thermodynamic
variable.
