We analyze the possibility of tomographic reconstruction of a system of
three-level atoms in both non-degenerate and degenerate cases. In the
non-degenerate case (when both transitions can be accessed independently) a
complete reconstruction is possible. In the degenerate case (when both
transitions are excited simultaneously) the complete reconstruction is
achievable only for a single atom in the Sigma configuration. For multiple
Sigma atoms, or even a single atom in the Lambda configuration, only partial
reconstruction is possible. Examples of one and two-atom cases are explicitly
considered.
