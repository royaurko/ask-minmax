In this series of papers, we investigate the spreading and vanishing dynamics
of time almost periodic diffusive KPP equations with free boundaries. Such
equations are used to characterize the spreading of a new species in time
almost periodic environments with free boundaries representing the spreading
fronts. In this first part, we show that a spreading-vanishing dichotomy occurs
for such free boundary problems, that is, the species either successfully
spreads to all the new environment and stabilizes at a time almost periodic
positive solution, or it fails to establish and dies out eventually. The
results of this part extend the existing results on spreading-vanishing
dichotomy for time and space independent, or time periodic and space
independent, or time independent and space periodic diffusive KPP equations
with free boundaries. The extension is nontrivial and is ever done for the
first time.
