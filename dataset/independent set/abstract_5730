We consider the origin of new phases in supersymmetric grand unification
model, and show how significant new contributions arise from the gluino
mediated diagram. We then present a more general model independent analysis of
various modes of B-decays suggested previously for measurement of the CKM
phases and point out what they really measure. It is in principle possible to
separate out all the phases.
