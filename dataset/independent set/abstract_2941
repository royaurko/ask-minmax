In earlier work, we constructed invariants of irreducible representations of
the Kauffman skein algebra of a surface. We introduce here an inverse
construction, which to a set of possible invariants associates an irreducible
representation that realizes these invariants. The current article is
restricted to surfaces with at least one puncture, a condition that will be
lifted in subsequent work of the contributors that relies on this one. A step in the
proof is of independent interest, and describes the algebraic structure of the
Thurston intersection form on the space of integer weight systems for a train
track.
