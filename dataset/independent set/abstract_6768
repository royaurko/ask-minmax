Write $P_k:= \mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_k]$ for the polynomial algebra
over the prime field of two elements, $\mathbb F_2$, in $k$ variables $x_1,
x_2, \ldots , x_k$, each of degree 1. We study the hit problem, set up by F.
Peterson, of finding a minimal set of generators for $P_k$ as a module over the
mod-2 Steenrod algebra, $\mathcal{A}$. In this paper, we explicitly determine a
minimal set of $\mathcal A$-generators for $P_k$ with $k=5$ and in degree
$2^{s+2} -4$ with $s$ an arbitrary positive integer.
