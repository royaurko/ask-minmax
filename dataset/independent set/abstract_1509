The rational cohomology of the moduli space of rank two, odd degree stable
bundles over a curve (of genus g > 1) has been studied intensely in recent
years and in particular the invariant subring generated by Newstead's
generators alpha, beta, gamma. Several contributors have independently found a
minimal complete set of relations for this subring. Their methods are very
different from the methods originally employed by Kirwan to prove Mumford's
conjecture -- that relations derived from the vanishing Chern classes of a
particular rank 2g-1 bundle are a complete set of relations for the entire
cohomology ring. This note contains two theorems which readily follow from
Kirwan's original calculations. We rederive the above result showing that the
first three invariant Mumford relations generate the relation ideal of the
invariant subring. Secondly we prove a stronger version of Mumford's conjecture
and show that the relations coming from the first vanishing Chern class
generate the relation ideal of the entire cohomology ring as a
Q[alpha,beta]-module. (Only a few typos have been amended in this revised
version).
