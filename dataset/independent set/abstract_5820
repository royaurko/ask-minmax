The codons, sixtyfour in number, are distributed over the coding parts of DNA
sequences. The distribution function is the plot of frequency-versus-rank of
the codons. These distributions are characterised by parameters that are almost
universal, i.e., gene independent. There is but a small part that depends on
the gene. We present the theory to calculate the universal (gene-independent)
part. The part that is gene-specific, however, has undetermined overlaps and
fluctuations.
