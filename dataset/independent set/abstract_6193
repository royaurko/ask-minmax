A simple linear loop is a simple while loop with linear assignments and
linear loop guards. If a simple linear loop has only two program variables, we
give a complete algorithm for computing the set of all the inputs on which the
loop does not terminate. For the case of more program variables, we show that
the non-termination set cannot be described by Tarski formulae in general
