We have investigated properties of photospheric Bright Points (BPs) observed
in an Active Region during its decay phase and in a quiet Sun region. We have
analyzed two sets of photospheric observations taken with IBIS (Interferometric
Bidimensioal Spectrometer) at the NSO Dunn Solar Telescope. The first set
consists of spectral data acquired in the Fe I 709.0 nm and Ca I 854.2 nm lines
and simultaneous broad-band and of G-band observations. The second set consists
of spectro-polarimetric observations in the Fe I 630.15 nm - 630.25 nm doublet
and simultaneous white light and G-band observations. The relation between BP
filling factor and RMS image contrast indicates that, on average, BPs cover up
to 3% of the solar surface outside Active Regions. The relation between area
and intensity values of the features identified on both data sets suggests that
they are composed of aggregations of magnetic flux elements. The horizontal
velocity values are as high as 2 km/s, thus supporting the scenario of BPs
motion contributing to the coronal heating.
