We propose and study a new minimal model for two-component dark matter. The
model contains only three additional fields, one fermion and two scalars, all
singlets under the Standard Model gauge group. Two of these fields, one fermion
and one scalar, are odd under a $Z_2$ symmetry that renders them simultaneously
stable. Thus, both particles contribute to the observed dark matter density.
This model resembles the union of the singlet scalar and the singlet fermionic
models but it contains some new features of its own. We analyze in some detail
its dark matter phenomenology. Regarding the relic density, the main novelty is
the possible annihilation of one dark matter particle into the other, which can
affect the predicted relic density in a significant way. Regarding dark matter
detection, we identify a new contribution that can lead either to an
enhancement or to a suppression of the spin-independent cross section for the
scalar dark matter particle. Finally, we define a set of five benchmarks models
compatible with all present bounds and examine their direct detection prospects
at planned experiments. A generic feature of this model is that both particles
give rise to observable signals in 1-ton direct detection experiments. In fact,
such experiments will be able to probe even a subdominant dark matter component
at the percent level.
