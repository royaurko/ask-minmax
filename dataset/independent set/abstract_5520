We study the integral geometry of subsets A of a smooth oriented manifold M
that can be defined locally in coordinates as sublevel sets of a difference of
convex functions at a weakly regular value (WDC sets). We show that the
conormal cycle of A, well-defined by previous work of the second- and
third-named contributors, is supported on a set of suitably small Minkowski
dimension. This is enough to establish kinematic formulas for pairs of such
sets living in Riemannian isotropic spaces.
