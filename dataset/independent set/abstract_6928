We show that the minimum distance projection in the L1-norm from an interior
point onto the boundary of a convex set is achieved by a single, unidimensional
projection. Application of this characterization when the convex set is a
polyhedron leads to either an elementary minmax problem or a set of easily
solved linear programs, depending upon whether the polyhedron is given as the
intersection of a set of half spaces or as the convex hull of a set of extreme
points. The outcome is an easier and more straightforward derivation of the
special case results given in a recent paper by Briec.
