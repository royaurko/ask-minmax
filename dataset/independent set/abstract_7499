We present numerical evidence supporting the validity of the Gallavotti-Cohen
Fluctuation Theorem applied to the driven Lorentz gas with Nos\'e-Hoover
thermostating. It is moreover argued that the asymptotic form of the
fluctuation formula is independent of the amplitude of the driving force, in
the limit where it is small.
