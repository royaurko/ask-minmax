The aim of these lectures is to give a short introduction to forcing. We will
avoid metamathematical issues as much as possible and similarly we will avoid
performing the actual construction of forcing. We assume familiarity with basic
predicate logic, the axioms of ZF C set theory and constructible sets. We will
also make use of tools like the coding of Borel sets and the Shoenfield
absoluteness result.
