Weak decays of beauty baryons like \Lambda_b (\bar\Lambda_b) into \Lambda
(\bar\Lambda) and V (J^P = 1^-), where both decay products are polarized, offer
interesting opportunities to perform tests of time reversal and CP violations
and of CPT invariance. We propose a model independent parametrization of the
angular distribution and of the polarization of the final resonances, by means
of the spin density matrix. The transverse component of the polarization is
sensitive to time reversal violations, moreover CP-and CPT-sensitive
observables are defined.
