We have performed accurate ab initio total energy calculations using the
full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method with the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation potential
to systematically investigate elastic properties of 18 stable, meta-stable and
hypothetical hexagonal (AlB2-like) metal diborides MB2, where M = Na, Be, Mg,
Ca, Al, Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Ag and Au. For monocrystalline
MB2 the optimized lattice parameters, independent elastic constants (Cij), bulk
modules (B), shear modules (G) are obtained and analyzed in comparison with the
available theoretical and experimental data. For the first time numerical
estimates of a set of elastic parameters of the polycrystalline MB2 ceramics
(in the framework of the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation), namely bulk and shear
modules, compressibility, Young's modules, Poisson's ratio, Lame's coefficients
are performed.
