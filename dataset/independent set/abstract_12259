We propose a method based on probabilistic arguments to study the convexity
of the autocorrelation function of processes associated with a single server
queue. To illustrate the power of the method we apply it in two cases: to the
workload process seen by the customers of a GI/GI/1 queue, and to the workload
process of a fluid queue fed by a general L\'evy process.
