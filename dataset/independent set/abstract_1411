This paper investigates the role of factorial speech processing models in
noise-robust automatic speech recognition tasks. Factorial models can embed
non-stationary noise models using Markov chains as one of its source chain. The
paper proposes a modeling scheme for modeling state-conditional observation
distribution of factorial models based on weighted stereo samples. This scheme
is an extension to previous single pass retraining for ideal model compensation
and here we used it to construct ideal state-conditional observation
distributions. Experiments of this paper over the set A of the Aurora 2 dataset
shows that by considering noise models with multiple states, system performance
can be improved especially in low SNR conditions up to 4% absolute word
recognition performance. In addition to its power in accurate representation of
state-conditional observation distribution, it has an important advantage over
previous methods by providing the opportunity to independently select feature
spaces for both source and corrupted features. This opens a new window for
seeking better feature spaces appropriate for noise-robust tasks independent
from clean speech feature space.
