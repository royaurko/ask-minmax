A new class of partial order-types, class $\gbqo^+$ is defined and
investigated here. A poset $P$ is in the class $W^+ $ iff the free poset
algebra $F(P)$ is generated by a better quasi-order $G$ that is included in the
free lattice $L(P)$.
  We prove that if $P$ is any well quasi-ordering, then $L(P)$ is well founded,
and is a countable union of well quasi-orderings. We prove that the class $W^+$
is contained in the class of well quasi-ordered sets. We prove that $W^+$ is
preserved under homomorphic image, finite products, and lexicographic sum over
better quasi-ordered index sets. We prove also that every countable well
quasi-ordered set is in $W^+$. We do not know, however if the class of well
quasi-ordered sets is contained in $W^+$. Additional results concern
homomorphic images of posets algebras.
