We count the number of independent structures which can arise in expressions
for radiation friction force in different even space-time dimensions and
demonstrate that their number is too big at d\geq 8 to allow determination of
this force from the transversality condition alone, as was done by B.Kosyakov
in 6d. This implies that in general one can not bypass a tedious calculation
involving explicit regularization and evaluation of emerging counterterms.
However, simple Kosyakov's method works nicely in any dimension for the special
case of circular motion with constant angular velocity.
