We characterize all the pairs of complementary non-homogenous Beatty
sequences $(A_n)_{n\ge 0}$ and $(B_n)_{n\ge 0}$ for which there exists an
invariant game having exactly $\{(A_n,B_n)\mid n\ge 0\}\cup \{(B_n,A_n)\mid
n\ge 0\}$ as set of $\mathcal{P}$-positions. Using the notion of Sturmian word
and tools arising in symbolic dynamics and combinatorics on words, this
characterization can be translated to a decision procedure relying only on a
few algebraic tests about algebraicity or rational independence. Given any four
real numbers defining the two sequences, up to these tests, we can therefore
decide whether or not such an invariant game exists.
