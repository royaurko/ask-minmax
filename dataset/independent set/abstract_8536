Let $Q$ be a quiver with dimension vector $\alpha$ prehomogeneous under the
action of the product of general linear groups $\operatorname{GL}(\alpha)$ on
the representation variety $\operatorname{Rep}(Q,\alpha)$. We study geometric
properties of zero sets of semi-invariants of this space. It is known that for
large numbers $N$, the nullcone in $\operatorname{Rep}(Q,N\cdot \alpha)$
becomes a complete intersection. First, we show that it also becomes reduced.
Then, using Bernstein-Sato polynomials, we discuss some criteria for zero sets
to have rational singularities. In particular, we show that for Dynkin quivers
codimension $1$ orbits have rational singularities.
