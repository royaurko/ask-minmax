In 2009, a lossless compression algorithm based on 1D chaotic maps known as
Generalized Lur\"{o}th Series (or GLS) has been proposed. This algorithm
(GLS-coding) encodes the input message as a symbolic sequence on an appropriate
1D chaotic map (GLS) and the compressed file is obtained as the initial value
by iterating backwards on the map. For ergodic sources, it was shown that
GLS-coding achieves the best possible lossless compression (in the noiseless
setting) bounded by Shannon entropy. However, in the presence of noise, even
small errors in the compressed file leads to catastrophic decoding errors owing
to sensitive dependence on initial values. In this paper, we first show that
Repetition codes $\mathcal{R}_n$ (every symbol is repeated $n$ times, where $n$
is a positive odd integer), the oldest and the most basic error correction and
detection codes in literature, actually lie on a Cantor set with a fractal
dimension of $\frac{1}{n}$, which is also the rate of the code. Inspired by
this, we incorporate error detection capability to GLS-coding by ensuring that
the compressed file (initial value on the map) lies on a Cantor set of measure
zero. Even a 1-bit error in the initial value will throw it outside the Cantor
set which can be detected while decoding. The error detection performance (and
also the rate of the code) can be controlled by the fractal dimension of the
Cantor set and could be suitably adjusted depending on the noise level of the
communication channel.
