We study the growth rate of the hard squares lattice gas, equivalent to the
number of independent sets on the square lattice, and two related models -
non-attacking kings and read-write isolated memory. We use an assortment of
techniques from combinatorics, statistical mechanics and linear algebra to
prove upper bounds on these growth rates. We start from Calkin and Wilf's
transfer matrix eigenvalue bound, then bound that with the Collatz-Wielandt
formula from linear algebra. To obtain an approximate eigenvector, we use an
ansatz from Baxter's corner transfer matrix formalism, optimised with Nishino
and Okunishi's corner transfer matrix renormalisation group method. This
results in an upper bound algorithm which no longer requires exponential memory
and so is much faster to calculate than a direct evaluation of the Calkin-Wilf
bound. Furthermore, it is extremely parallelisable and so allows us to make
dramatic improvements to the previous best known upper bounds. In all cases we
reduce the gap between upper and lower bounds by 4-6 orders of magnitude.
