Polar codes are introduced for discrete memoryless broadcast channels. For
$m$-user deterministic broadcast channels, polarization is applied to map
uniformly random message bits from $m$ independent messages to one codeword
while satisfying broadcast constraints. The polarization-based codes achieve
rates on the boundary of the private-message capacity region. For two-user
noisy broadcast channels, polar implementations are presented for two
information-theoretic schemes: i) Cover's superposition codes; ii) Marton's
codes. Due to the structure of polarization, constraints on the auxiliary and
channel-input distributions are identified to ensure proper alignment of
polarization indices in the multi-user setting. The codes achieve rates on the
capacity boundary of a few classes of broadcast channels (e.g., binary-input
stochastically degraded). The complexity of encoding and decoding is $O(n*log
n)$ where $n$ is the block length. In addition, polar code sequences obtain a
stretched-exponential decay of $O(2^{-n^{\beta}})$ of the average block error
probability where $0 < \beta < 0.5$.
