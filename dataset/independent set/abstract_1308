Using chiral symmetry we investigate the leading SU(3) violation in the
complete set of quark twist-3 light-cone distribution functions of the pion,
kaon, and eta. It is shown that terms non-analytic in the quark masses do not
affect the shape, and only appear in the normalization constants. Predictive
power is retained including the leading analytic m_{q} operators. With the
symmetry violating corrections we derive useful model-independent relations
between the distributions of pion, kaon and eta. We also comment on the
calculations of the moments of these distributions using lattice QCD and
light-cone sum rules.
