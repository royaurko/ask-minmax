It is shown that the effective Standard Model theory with the physical Higgs
mass lighter than $\sim 200$ GeV takes the form of an unbroken electroweak
theory already at moderately high, $O(1 TeV)$, energy scales. No such
transitional scale exists for the heavier Higgses. This result is independently
obtained by two standard regularization methods.
