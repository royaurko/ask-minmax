We prove maximal inequalities for $L_q$-valued martingales obtained by
stochastic integration with respect to compensated random measures. A version
of these estimates for integrals with respect to compensated Poisson random
measures were first obtained by Dirksen (arXiv:1208:3885) using arguments based
on inequalities for sums of independent Banach-space-valued random variables,
geometric properties of Banach spaces, and decoupling inequalities. Our proofs
are completely different and rely almost exclusively on classical stochastic
analysis for real semimartingales.
