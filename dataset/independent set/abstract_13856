We show that standard nonlocal boxes, also known as Popescu-Rohrlich
machines, are not sufficient to simulate any nonlocal correlations that do not
allow signalling. This was known in the multipartite scenario, but we extend
the result to the bipartite case. We then generalize this result further by
showing that no finite set containing any finite-output-alphabet nonlocal boxes
can be a universal set for nonlocality.
