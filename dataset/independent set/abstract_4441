In order to satisfy the equivalence principle, any non-conventional mechanism
proposed to gravitationally explain the Pioneer anomaly, in the form in which
it is presently known from the so-far analyzed Pioneer 10/11 data, cannot leave
out of consideration its impact on the motion of the planets of the Solar
System as well, especially those orbiting in the regions in which the anomalous
behavior of the Pioneer probes manifested itself. In this paper we, first,
discuss the residuals of the right ascension \alpha and declination \delta of
Uranus, Neptune and Pluto obtained by processing various data sets with
different, well established dynamical theories (JPL DE, IAA EPM, VSOP). Second,
we use the latest determinations of the perihelion secular advances of some
planets in order to put on the test two gravitational mechanisms recently
proposed to accommodate the Pioneer anomaly based on two models of modified
gravity. Finally, we adopt the ranging data to Voyager 2 when it encountered
Uranus and Neptune to perform a further, independent test of the hypothesis
that a Pioneer-like acceleration can also affect the motion of the outer
planets of the Solar System. The obtained answers are negative.
