In this paper, we develop the theory of bi-freeness in an amalgamated
setting. We construct the operator-valued bi-free cumulant functions, and show
that the vanishing of mixed cumulants is necessary and sufficient for bi-free
independence. Further, we develop a multiplicative convolution for
operator-valued random variables and explore ways to construct bi-free pairs of
B-faces.
