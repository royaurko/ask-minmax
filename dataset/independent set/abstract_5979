We show that the effect of stress on the reproductive fitness of noisy cell
populations can be modelled as first-passage time problem, and demonstrate that
even relatively short-lived fluctuations in gene expression can ensure
long-term survival of a drug-resistant population. We examine how this effect
contributes to the development of drug-resistant cancer cells, and demonstrate
that permanent immunity can arise independently of mutations.
