This work is a direct and model-independent measurement of the low mass
$\pi^+\pi^-$ phase motion in the $D^+ \to \pi^-\pi^+\pi^+$ decay. The results
show a strong phase variation, compatible with an isoscalar $\sigma(500)$
meson. This result confirms the previous Fermilab E791 result which found
evidence for the existence of this scalar particle using a full Dalitz-plot
analysis.
