We present the first quantitative comparison of two independent
general-relativistic hydrodynamics codes, the Whisky code and the SACRA code.
We compare the output of simulations starting from the same initial data and
carried out with the configuration (numerical methods, grid setup, resolution,
gauges) which for each code has been found to give consistent and sufficiently
accurate results, in particular in terms of cleanness of gravitational
waveforms. We focus on the quantities that should be conserved during the
evolution (rest mass, total mass energy, and total angular momentum) and on the
gravitational-wave amplitude and frequency. We find that the results produced
by the two codes agree at a reasonable level, with variations in the different
quantities but always at better than about 10%.
