Two independent sets of a graph are adjacent if they differ on exactly one
vertex (i.e. we can transform one into the other by adding or deleting a
vertex). Let $k$ be an integer. We consider the reconfiguration graph
$TAR_k(G)$ on the set of independent sets of size at least $k$ in a graph $G$,
with the above notion of adjacency. Here we provide a cubic-time algorithm to
decide whether $TAR_k(G)$ is connected when $G$ is a cograph, thus solving an
open question of~[Bonsma 2014]. As a by-product, we also describe a linear-time
algorithm which decides whether two elements of $TAR_k(G)$ are in the same
connected component.
