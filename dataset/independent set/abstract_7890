Our main goal is to determine, under certain restrictions, the maximal closed
connected subgroups of simple algebraic groups containing a regular torus. We
call a torus regular if its centralizer is abelian.
  We also obtain some results of independent interest. In particular, we
determine the irreducible representations of simple algebraic groups whose
non-zero weights occur with multiplicity 1.
