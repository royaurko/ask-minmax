We analyze the time profiles of individual gamma-ray burst (GRB) pulses, that
are longer than 2 s, by modelling them with analytical functions that are based
empirical descriptions of GRB spectral evolution. These analytical profiles are
independent of the emission mechanism and can be used to model both the rise
and decay profiles Using this method, we have studied a sample of 77 individual
GRB pulses, allowing us to examine the fluence, pulse width, asymmetry, and
rise and decay power-law distributions. We find that the rise phase is best
modelled with a power law of average index $r = 1.31 \pm 0.11$ and that the
average decay phase has an index o.f $d = 2.39 \pm 0.12$. We also find that the
ratio between the rise and decay times (the pulse asymmetry) exhibited by the
GRB pulse shape has an average value of 0.47 which varies little from pulse to
pulse and is independent of pulse duration or intensity. We compare these
parameters with those predicted to occur if individual pulse shapes are created
purely by relativistic curvature effects in the context of the fireball model,
a process that makes specific predictions about the shape of GRB pulses. The
decay index distribution obtained from our sample shows that the average GRB
pulse fades faster than the value predicted by curvature effects, with only 39%
of our sample being consistent with the curvature model. We discuss several
refinements of the relativistic curvature scenario that could naturally account
for these observed deviations.
