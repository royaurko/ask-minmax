The hypothesis is considered that the present Galactic cosmic ray spectrum is
at present softer than its time average due to source intermittency.
Measurements of muogenic nuclides underground could provide an independent
measurement of the time averaged spectrum. Source intermittency could also
account for the surprising low anisotropy reported by the IceCube
collaboration. Predictions for Galactic emission of ultrahigh-energy quanta,
such as UHE gamma rays and neutrinos, might be higher or lower than previously
estimated.
