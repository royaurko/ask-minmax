Let S_k be the k-th partial sum of Banach space valued independent
identically distributed random variables. In this paper, we compare the tail
distribution of ||S_k|| with that of ||S_j||, and deduce some tail distribution
maximal inequalities.
  Theorem: There is universal constant c such that for j < k
  Pr(||S_j|| > t) <= c Pr(||S_k|| > t/c).
