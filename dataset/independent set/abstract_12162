In many environmental applications, time series are either incomplete or
irregularly spaced. We investigate the application of the Spartan random
process to missing data prediction. We employ a novel modified method of
moments (MMoM) for parameter inference. The CPU time of MMoM is shown to be
much faster than that of maximum likelihood estimation and almost independent
of the data size. We formulate an explicit Spartan interpolator for estimating
missing data. The model validation is performed on both synthetic data and real
time series of atmospheric aerosol concentrations. The prediction performance
is shown to be comparable with that attained by the best linear unbiased
(Kolmogorov-Wiener) predictor at reduced computational cost.
