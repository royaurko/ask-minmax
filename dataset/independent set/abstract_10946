Deep-inelastic events for the scattering of the longitudinally polarized
electron by polarized proton with tagged collinear photon radiated from
initial-state electron are considered. The corresponding cross-section is
derived in the Born approximation. The model-independent radiative corrections
to the Born cross-section are also calculated. Obtained result is applied to
the case of elastic scattering.
