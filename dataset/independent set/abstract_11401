A discussion about dependences of the (fractal) basin boundary dimension with
the definition of the basins and the size of the exits is presented for systems
with one or more exits. In particular, it is shown that the dimension is
largely independent of the choice of the basins, and decreases with the size of
the exits. Considering the limit of small exits, a strong relation between
fractals in exit systems and chaos in closed systems is found. The discussion
is illustrated by simple examples of one-dimensional maps.
