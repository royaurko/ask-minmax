We describe an optical bench in which we lock the relative frequencies or
phases of a set of three lasers in order to use them in a cold atoms
interferometry experiment. As a new feature, the same two lasers serve
alternately to cool atoms and to realize the atomic interferometer. This
requires a fast change of the optical frequencies over a few GHz. The number of
required independent laser sources is then only 3, which enables the
construction of the whole laser system on a single transportable optical bench.
Recent results obtained with this optical setup are also presented.
