I observe a rough volume-dependent scaling of the low eigenvalues of a chiral
Dirac operator in lattice studies of SU(3) lattice gauge theory with two
flavors of color sextet fermions, in its weak-coupling phase. The mean value of
the ith eigenvalue scales with the simulation volume V=L^4 as <lambda_i>L^p
~zeta_i, where zeta_i is a volume-independent constant. The exponent p is about
1.4. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that p is the leading
relevant exponent associated with the fermion mass dependence of correlation
functions in a theory whose zero-mass limit is conformal.
