We discuss the connection between supersymmetric field theories and
topological field theories and show how this connection may be used to
construct local lattice field theories which maintain an exact supersymmetry.
It is shown how metric independence of the continuum topological field theory
allows us to derive the lattice theory by blocking out of the continuum in a
deformed geometry. This, in turn, allows us to prove the cut-off independence
of certain supersymmetric Ward identities.
