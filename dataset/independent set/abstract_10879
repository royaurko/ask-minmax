Quark confinement in Buchm\"{u}ller's picture of a rotating flux tube is
reconsidered in the context of a minimum area evaluation of the Wilson loop.
The question is asked whether resulting spin independent dynamics are
consistent with Thomas precessional spin dependence leading from electric
confinement. The answer appears to be in the negative; self-consistency of the
picture found in the literature is examined and explained in simple classical
terms, with illustrations.
