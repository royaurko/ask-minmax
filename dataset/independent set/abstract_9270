We use the density matrix formalism in order to calculate the energy level
shifts, in second order on interaction, of an atom in the presence of a
perfectly conducting wall in the dipole approximation. The thermal corrections
are also examined when $\hbar \omega_0/k_B T = k_0 \lambda_T \gg 1$, where
${$\omega_0=k_0 c$}$ is the dominant transition frequency of the atom and
$\lambda_T$ is the thermal length. When the distance $z$ between the atom and
the wall is larger than $\lambda_T$ we find the well known result obtained from
Lifshitz's formula, whose leading term is proportional to temperature and is
independent of $c$, $\hbar$ and $k_0$. In the short distance limit, when
$z\ll\lambda_T$, only very small corrections to the leading vacuum term occur.
We also show, for all distance regimes, that the main thermal corrections are
independent of $k_0$ (dispersion is not important) and dependent of $c$, which
means that there is not a non-retarded regime for the thermal contributions.
