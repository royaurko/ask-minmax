We construct an effective Lagrangian which describes interactions of heavy
and light hadrons utilizing the chiral flavor symmetry for light quarks and
heavy quark symmetry. For both light and heavy sector we include pseudo
scalars, vectors and baryons in the Lagrangian. Heavy hadron decays are
discussed as application of our formalism. The $D_s$ decay constant and the
coupling constant among heavy meson, heavy vector meson and light meson are
fitted from the experimental data of $D^0 \rightarrow K^- e^+\nu_e$ decay. We
also point out the possibility of model independent determination of $|V_{ub}|$
from $\Lambda_b \rightarrow p l \bar \nu$ decay.
