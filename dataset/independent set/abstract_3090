We formulate a principle for classification with the knowledge of the
marginal distribution over the data points (unlabeled data). The principle is
cast in terms of Tikhonov style regularization where the regularization penalty
articulates the way in which the marginal density should constrain otherwise
unrestricted conditional distributions. Specifically, the regularization
penalty penalizes any information introduced between the examples and labels
beyond what is provided by the available labeled examples. The work extends
Szummer and Jaakkola's information regularization (NIPS 2002) to multiple
dimensions, providing a regularizer independent of the covering of the space
used in the derivation. We show in addition how the information regularizer can
be used as a measure of complexity of the classification task with unlabeled
data and prove a relevant sample-complexity bound. We illustrate the
regularization principle in practice by restricting the class of conditional
distributions to be logistic regression models and constructing the
regularization penalty from a finite set of unlabeled examples.
