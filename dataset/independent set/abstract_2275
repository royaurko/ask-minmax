We extend the self-consistent Ornstein-Zernike approximation (SCOZA), first
formulated in the context of liquid-state theory, to the study of the random
field Ising model. Within the replica formalism, we treat the quenched random
field as an annealed spin variable, thereby avoiding the usual average over the
random field distribution. This allows to study the influence of the
distribution on the phase diagram in finite dimensions. The thermodynamics and
the correlation functions are obtained as solutions of a set a coupled partial
differential equations with magnetization, temperature and disorder strength as
independent variables. A preliminary analysis based on high-temperature and 1/d
series expansions shows that the theory can predict accurately the dependence
of the critical temperature on disorder strength for dimensions d>4. For the
bimodal distribution, we find a tricritical point which moves to weaker fields
as the dimension is reduced. For the Gaussian distribution, a tricritical point
may appear for d slightly above 4.
