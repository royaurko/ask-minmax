The known prepotential solutions F to the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde
(WDVV) equation are parametrized by a set {alpha} of covectors. This set may be
taken to be indecomposable, since F_{alpha oplus beta}=F_{alpha}+F_{beta}. We
couple mutually orthogonal covector sets by adding so-called radial terms to
the standard form of F. The resulting reducible covector set yields a new type
of irreducible solution to the WDVV equation.
