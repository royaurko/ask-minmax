We present an explicit on-shell framework to renormalize the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix at the one-loop level. It
is based on a novel procedure to separate the external-leg mixing corrections
into gauge-independent self-mass (sm) and gauge-dependent wave-function
renormalization contributions, and to adjust non-diagonal mass counterterm
matrices to cancel all the divergent sm contributions, and also their finite
parts subject to constraints imposed by the hermiticity of the mass matrices.
It is also shown that the proof of gauge independence and finiteness of the
remaining one-loop corrections to W -> q_i + anti-q_j reduces to that in the
unmixed, single-generation case. Diagonalization of the complete mass matrices
leads then to an explicit expression for the CKM counterterm matrix, which is
gauge independent, preserves unitarity, and leads to renormalized amplitudes
that are non-singular in the limit in which any two fermions become mass
degenerate.
