We present the results of the fifth Interferometric Imaging Beauty Contest.
The contest consists in blind imaging of test data sets derived from model
sources and distributed in the OIFITS format. Two scenarios of imaging with
CHARA/MIRC-6T were offered for reconstruction: imaging a T Tauri disc and
imaging a spotted red supergiant. There were eight different teams competing
this time: Monnier with the software package MACIM; Hofmann, Schertl and
Weigelt with IRS; Thi\'ebaut and Soulez with MiRA ; Young with BSMEM; Mary and
Vannier with MIROIRS; Millour and Vannier with independent BSMEM and MiRA
entries; Rengaswamy with an original method; and Elias with the radio-astronomy
package CASA. The contest model images, the data delivered to the contestants
and the rules are described as well as the results of the image reconstruction
obtained by each method. These results are discussed as well as the strengths
and limitations of each algorithm.
