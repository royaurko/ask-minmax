The set of transition probabilities for a single neutrino emitted from a
point source after passage through a turbulent supernova density profile have
been found to be random variates drawn from parent distributions whose
properties depend upon the stage of the explosion, the neutrino energy and
mixing parameters, the observed channel, and the properties of the turbulence
such as the amplitude C*. In this paper we examine the consequences of the
recently measured mixing angle \theta_13 upon the neutrino flavor
transformation in supernova when passing through turbulence. We find the
measurements of a relatively large value of \theta_13 means the neutrinos are
relatively immune to small, C* < 1%, amplitude turbulence but as C* increases
the turbulence effects grow rapidly and spread to all mixing channels. For C* >
10% the turbulence effects in the high (H) density resonance mixing channels
are independent of \theta_13 but non-resonant mixing channels are more
sensitive to turbulence when \theta_13 is large.
