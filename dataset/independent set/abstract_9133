We present a very promising method for a measurement of the Higgs boson
parity using the H/A -> tau^+ tau^- --> rho^+ nu rho^- nu --> pi^+ pi^0 nu pi^-
pi^0 nu decay chain. The method is both model independent and independent of
the Higgs production mechanism. Angular distributions of the tau decay products
which are sensitive to the Higgs boson parity are defined and are found to be
measurable using typical properties of a future detector for an e^+ e^- linear
collider. The prospects for the measurement of the parity of a Higgs boson with
a mass of 120 GeV are quantified for the case of e^+ e^- collisons of 500 GeV
center of mass energy with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb^-1. The Standard
Model Higgsstrahlung production process is used as an example.
