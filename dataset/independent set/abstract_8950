Binary multirelations generalise binary relations by associating elements of
a set to its subsets. We study the structure and algebra of multirelations
under the operations of union, intersection, sequential and parallel
composition, as well as finite and infinite iteration. Starting from a
set-theoretic investigation, we propose axiom systems for multirelations in
contexts ranging from bi-monoids to bi-quantales.
