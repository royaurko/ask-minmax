Recently, several algorithms have been proposed for independent subspace
analysis where hidden variables are i.i.d. processes. We show that these
methods can be extended to certain AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA tasks. Central to our
paper is that we introduce a cascade of algorithms, which aims to solve these
tasks without previous knowledge about the number and the dimensions of the
hidden processes. Our claim is supported by numerical simulations. As a
particular application, we search for subspaces of facial components.
