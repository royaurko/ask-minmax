In this paper, we have studied the axiomatics of {\it Ann-categories} and
{\it categorical rings.} These are the categories with distributivity
constraints whose axiomatics are similar with those of ring structures. The
main result we have achieved is proving the independence of the axiomatics of
Ann-category definition. And then we have proved that after adding an axiom
into the definition of categorical rings, we obtain the new axiomatics which is
equivalent to the one of Ann-categories. In [PJ], contributors modified the
definition of Ann-categories to be the one of {\it categorical rings,} where
the condition Ann-1 is omitted, and the compatibility of the operation $\tx$
with the associativity and commutativity is replaced with the compatibility of
the operation $\tx$ with the "associativity - commutativity" constraint. This
replacement is to make it more convenient in using Mac Lane cohomology.
However, the fact that the definition of categorical rings and Ann-categories
are equivalent is still an open question. In [q], contributors showed that the set
of Ann-categories is a subset of the set of categorical rings. And these sets
coincide if and only if the condition (U)is satisfied.
