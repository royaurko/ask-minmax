An optimal extension of the Jensen covering lemma, within the limits
imposed by Prikry forcing, is proved.  If L[E] is an "iterable" weasel
with no measurable cardinals, then either L[E] has "indiscernibles", or
every uncountable set of ordinals is contained in a set in L[E] of the
same cardinality.  (The terms "iterable" and "indiscernibles" are made
precise in the paper.)  Most importantly, there is no hypothesis
explicitly limiting the large cardinals which are consistent in L[E].
