We show that there exists a surjection from the set of effective divisors of
degree $g$ on a tropical curve of genus $g$ to its Jacobian by using a tropical
version of the Riemann-Roch theorem. We then show that the restriction of the
surjection is reduced to the bijection on an appropriate subset of the set of
effective divisors of degree $g$ on the curve. Thus the subset of effective
divisors has the additive group structure induced from the Jacobian. We finally
realize the addition in Jacobian of a tropical hyperelliptic curve of genus $g$
via the intersection with a tropical curve of degree $3g/2$ or $3(g-1)/2$.
