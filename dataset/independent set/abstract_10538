Linear stability analysis of speckle pattern resulting from multiple, diffuse
scattering of coherent light waves in random media with intensity-dependent
refractive index (noninstantaneous Kerr nonlinearity) is performed. The speckle
pattern is shown to become unstable with respect to dynamic perturbations
within a certain frequency band, provided that nonlinearity exceeds some
frequency-dependent threshold. Although the absolute instability threshold is
independent of the response time of nonlinearity, the latter significantly
affects speckle dynamics (in particular, its spectral content) beyond the
threshold. Our results suggest that speckle dynamics becomes chaotic
immediately beyond the threshold.
