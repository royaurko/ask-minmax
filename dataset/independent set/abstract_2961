In the wake of the Higgs discovery and over the long haul of the LHC run, one
should keep a lookout for kinematic anomalies in the most massive known trio of
coupled particles, $t \bar{t} h$. After surveying the scope of prior
constraints on chromomagnetic dipole and Higgs-gluon kinetic couplings, we
focus on surpluses of boosted-$p_T$ Higgs bosons fomented by these momentum
dependent dimension-six operators in $t \bar{t} h$ final states. We uncover a
number of simple, $p_T$ weighted angular variables useful for discriminating
Standard Model from dimension-6 boosted Higgs distributions, and make headway
arguing that one of these variables may improve the reach of existing Standard
Model top-Higgs searches. The approach we take is model independent, because we
just consider a set of effective operators that contribute to the same
three-body final state.
