We define impulse response sequence in the set of all linear recurring
sequences satisfying a linear recurrence relation of order $r$. The generating
function and expression of the impulse response sequence are presented. Some
identities of impulse response sequences including a type of nonlinear
expressions are established. The interrelationship between the impulse response
sequence and other linear recurring sequences in the same set is given, which
is used to transfer the identities of impulse response sequences to those of
the linear recurring sequences in the same set. Some applications of impulse
response sequences to the structure of Stirling numbers of the second order,
the Wythoff array, and the Boustrophedon transform are studied.
