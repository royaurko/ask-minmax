In this note we study multivariate integration for permutation-invariant
functions from a certain Banach space E_{d,\alpha} of Korobov type in the worst
case setting. We present a lower error bound which particularly implies that in
dimension d every cubature rule which reduces the initial error necessarily
uses at least d+1 function values. Since this holds independently of the number
of permutation-invariant coordinates, this shows that the integration problem
can never be strongly polynomially tractable in this setting. Our assertions
generalize results due to Sloan and Wo\'zniakowski. Moreover, for large
smoothness parameters \alpha our bound can not be improved. Finally, we extend
our results to the case of permutation-invariant functions from Korobov-type
spaces equipped with product weights.
