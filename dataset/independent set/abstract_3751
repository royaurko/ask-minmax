Using events in which one of two neutral-B mesons from the decay of an Y(4S)
resonance is fully reconstructed, we set limits on the difference between the
decay rates of the two neutral-B mass eigenstates and on CP, T, and CPT
violation in B0-antiB0 mixing. The reconstructed decays, comprising both CP and
flavor eigenstates, are obtained from 88 million Y(4S) --> Banti-B decays
collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy B Factory at
SLAC. We determine six independent parameters governing oscillations (Deltam,
DeltaGamma/Gamma), CPT and CP violation (Re Z, Im Z), and CP and T violation
(Im lambdaCP, |q/p|), where lambdaCP characterizes B0 and anti-B0 decays to
states of charmonium plus K0S or K0L. The results are sgn(Re
lambdaCP)xDeltaGamma/Gamma = -0.008 +/- 0.037(stat) +/- 0.018(syst)
[-0.084,0.068], |q/p| = 1.029 +/- 0.013(stat) +/- 0.011(syst) [ 1.001,1.057],
(Re lambdaCP)/|lambdaCP|xRe z = 0.014 +/- 0.035(stat) +/- 0.034(syst)
[-0.072,0.101], Im z = 0.038 +/- 0.029(stat) +/- 0.025(syst) [-0.028,0.104],
The values inside square brackets indicate the 90% confidence-level intervals.
The values of Im lambdaCP and Deltam are consistent with previous analyses and
are used as cross-checks. These measurements are in agreement with Standard
Model expectations.
