In this book, the contributors introduce the notion of set codes, set bicodes and
set n-codes. These are the most generalized notions of semigroup n-codes and
group n-codes. Several types of set n-codes are defined. Several examples are
given to enable the reader to understand the concept.
  These new classes of codes will find applications in cryptography, computer
networking (where fragmenting of codes is to be carried out) and data storage
(where confidentiality is to be maintained). We also describe the error
detection and error correction of these codes. The contributors feel that these
codes would be appropriate to the computer dominated world.
  This book has three chapters. Chapter One gives basic concepts to make the
book a self-contained one. In Chapter Two, the notion of set codes is
introduced. The set bicodes and their generalization to set n-codes (n >= 3) is
carried out in Chapter Three. This chapter also gives the applications of these
codes in the above-mentioned fields.
