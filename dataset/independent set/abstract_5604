Our original aim was, in Abelian group theory to prove the consistency of:
lambda is strong limit singular and for some properties of abelian groups which
are relatives of being free, the compactness in singular fails. In fact this
should work for R-modules, etc. As in earlier cases part of the work is
analyzing how to move between the set theory and the algebra.
  Set theoretically we try to force a universe which satisfies G.C.H. and
diamond holds for many stationary sets but, for every regular uncountable
lambda, in some sense anything which "may" hold for some stationary set, does
hold for some stationary set. More specifically we try to get a universe
satisfying GCH such that e.g. for regular kappa < lambda there are pairs (S,B),
S \subseteq S^\lambda_\kappa stationary, B \subseteq H (lambda), which
satisfies some pregiven forcing axiom related to (S,B), (so (lambda\
S)-complete, i.e. "trivial outside S) but no more, i.e. slightly stronger
versions fail. So set theoretically we try to get a universe satisfying G.C.H.
but still satisfies "many", even for a maximal family in some sense, of forcing
axioms of the form "for some stationary" while preserving GCH. As completion of
the work lagged for a while, here we deal only with the set theory.
