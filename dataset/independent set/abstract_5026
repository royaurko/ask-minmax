In the literature there are two different notions of lovely pairs of a theory
T, according to whether T is simple or geometric. We introduce a notion of
lovely pairs for an independence relation, which generalizes both the simple
and the geometric case, and show how the main theorems for those two cases
extend to our general notion.
