"Nonfreeness" is the (negative of the) difference between the von Neumann
entropies of a given many-fermion state and the free state that has the same
1-particle statistics. It also equals the relative entropy of the two states in
question, i.e., it is the entropy of the given state relative to the
corresponding free state. The nonfreeness of a pure state is the same as its
"particle-hole symmetric correlation entropy", a variant of an established
measure of electron correlation. But nonfreeness is also defined for mixed
states, and this allows one to compare the nonfreeness of subsystems to the
nonfreeness of the whole. Nonfreeness of a part does not exceed that in the
whole; nonfreeness is additive over independent subsystems; and nonfreeness is
superadditive over subsystems that are independent on the 1-particle level.
