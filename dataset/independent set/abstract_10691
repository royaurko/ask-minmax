Scaling behavior in the moduli space of monopole and dyon solutions in the
Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in the asymptotically anti-de Sitter space is
derived. The mass of monopoles and dyons scales with respect to their magnetic
and electric charges, independent of the values of the cosmological constant
and gauge coupling constant. The stable monopole and dyon solutions are
approximated by solutions in the fixed anti-de Sitter spacetime. Unstable
solutions can be viewed as the Bartnik-McKinnon solutions dressed with monopole
and dyon solutions in the fixed anti-de Sitter space.
