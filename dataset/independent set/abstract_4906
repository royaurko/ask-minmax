We observe the statistical properties of blogs that are expected to reflect
social human interaction. Firstly, we introduce a basic normalization
preprocess that enables us to evaluate the genuine word frequency in blogs that
are independent of external factors such as spam blogs, server-breakdowns,
increase in the population of bloggers, and periodic weekly behaviors. After
this process, we can confirm that small frequency words clearly follow an
independent Poisson process as theoretically expected. Secondly, we focus on
each blogger's basic behaviors. It is found that there are two kinds of
behaviors of bloggers. Further, Zipf's law on word frequency is confirmed to be
universally independent of individual activity types.
