We study analytically and numerically the corrections to scaling in
turbulence which arise due to the finite ratio of the outer scale $L$ of
turbulence to the viscous scale $\eta$, i.e., they are due to finite size
effects as anisotropic forcing or boundary conditions at large scales. We find
that the deviations $\dzm$ from the classical Kolmogorov scaling $\zeta_m =
m/3$ of the velocity moments $\langle |\u(\k)|^m\rangle \propto k^{-\zeta_m}$
decrease like $\delta\zeta_m (Re) =c_m Re^{-3/10}$. Our numerics employ a
reduced wave vector set approximation for which the small scale structures are
not fully resolved. Within this approximation we do not find $Re$ independent
anomalous scaling within the inertial subrange. If anomalous scaling in the
inertial subrange can be verified in the large $Re$ limit, this supports the
suggestion that small scale structures should be responsible, originating from
viscosity either in the bulk (vortex tubes or sheets) or from the boundary
layers (plumes or swirls).
