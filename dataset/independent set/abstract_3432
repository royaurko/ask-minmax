A coloring of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a partition $\{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of
$V$ into independent sets or color classes. A vertex $v\in V_i$ is a Grundy
vertex if it is adjacent to at least one vertex in each color class $V_j$ for
every $j<i$. A coloring is a Grundy coloring if every vertex is a Grundy
vertex, and the Grundy number $\Gamma(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum number
of colors in a Grundy coloring. We provide two new upper bounds on Grundy
number of a graph and a stronger version of the well-known Nordhaus-Gaddum
theorem. In addition, we give a new characterization for a $\{P_{4},
C_4\}$-free graph.
