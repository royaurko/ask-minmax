We use the method of monotone iterations to obtain fixed point and coupled
fixed point results for mixed monotone operators in the setting of partially
ordered sets, with no additional assumptions on the partial order and with no
convergence structure. We define the concept of attractive fixed point with
respect to the partial order and obtain several criteria for the existence,
uniqueness and order-attractiveness of the fixed points, both in the presence
and in the absence of a coupled lower-upper fixed point. As an application, we
present a fixed point result for a class of mixed monotone operators in the
setting of ordered linear spaces.
