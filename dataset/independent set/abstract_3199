A full-duplex wireless network with three users that want to establish full
message-exchange via a relay is considered. Thus, the network known as the
Y-channel has a total of 6 messages, 2 outgoing and 2 incoming at each user.
The users are not physically connected, and thus the relay is essential for
their communication. The linear-shift deterministic Y-channel is considered
first, its capacity region is characterized and shown not to be given by the
cut-set bounds. The capacity achieving scheme has three different components
(strategies): a bi-directional, a cyclic, and a uni-directional strategy.
Network coding is used to realize the bi-directional and the cyclic strategies,
and thus to prove the achievability of the capacity region. The result is then
extended to the Gaussian Y-channel where the capacity region is characterized
within a constant gap independent of the channel parameters.
