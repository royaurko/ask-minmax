For any class of one-sided $1-\alpha$ confidence intervals with a certain
monotonicity ordering on the random confidence limit, the smallest interval, in
the sense of the set inclusion for the difference of two proportions of two
independent binomial random variables, is constructed based on a direct
analysis of coverage probability function. A special ordering on the confidence
limit is developed and the corresponding smallest confidence interval is
derived. This interval is then applied to identify the minimum effective dose
(MED) for binary data in dose-response studies, and a multiple test procedure
that controls the familywise error rate at level $\alpha$ is obtained. A
generalization of constructing the smallest one-sided confidence interval to
other discrete sample spaces is discussed in the presence of nuisance
parameters.
