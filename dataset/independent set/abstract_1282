We consider two-player random extensive form games where the payoffs at the
leaves are independently drawn uniformly at random from a given feasible set C.
We study the asymptotic distribution of the subgame perfect equilibrium outcome
for binary-trees with increasing depth in various random (or deterministic)
assignments of players to nodes. We characterize the assignments under which
the asymptotic distribution concentrates around a point. Our analysis provides
a natural way to derive from the asymptotic distribution a novel solution
concept for two-player bargaining problems with a solid strategic
justification.
