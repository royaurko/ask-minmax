We develop a model-independent "box" parameterization of neutrino
oscillations. Oscillation probabilities are linear in these new parameters, so
measurements can straightforwardly determine the box parameters which can then
be manipulated to yield magnitudes of mixing matrix elements. We examine the
effects of unitarity On the box parameters and reduce the number of parameters
to the minimum set. Using the box algebra, we show that CP-violation may be
inferred from measurements of neutrino flavor mixing even when the oscillatory
factor has averaged. The framework presented here will facilitate general
analyses of neutrino oscillations among $n\ge 3$ flavors.
