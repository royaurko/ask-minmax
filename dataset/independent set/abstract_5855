A sampling method for spin systems is presented. The spin lattice is written
as the union of a nested sequence of sublattices, all but the last with
conditionally independent spins, which are sampled in succession using their
marginals. The marginals are computed concurrently by a fast algorithm; errors
in the evaluation of the marginals are offset by weights. There are no Markov
chains and each sample is independent of the previous ones; the cost of a
sample is proportional to the number of spins (but the number of samples needed
for good statistics may grow with array size). The examples include the
Edwards-Anderson spin glass in three dimensions.
