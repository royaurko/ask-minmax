A stochastic algorithm is proposed, finding the set of intrinsic $p$-mean(s)
associated to a probability measure $\nu$ on a compact Riemannian manifold and
to $p\in[1,\infty)$. It is fed sequentially with independent random variables
$(Y_n)_{n\in\NN}$ distributed according to $\nu$ and this is the only knowledge
of $\nu$ required. Furthermore the algorithm is easy to implement, because it
evolves like a Brownian motion between the random times it jumps in direction
of one of the $Y_n$, $n\in\NN$. Its principle is based on simulated annealing
and homogenization, so that temperature and approximations schemes must be
tuned up (plus a regularizing scheme if $\nu$ does not admit a H\"olderian
density). The analyze of the convergence is restricted to the case where the
state space is a circle. In its principle, the proof relies on the
investigation of the evolution of a time-inhomogeneous $\LL^2$ functional and
on the corresponding spectral gap estimates due to Holley, Kusuoka and Stroock.
But it requires new estimates on the discrepancies between the unknown
instantaneous invariant measures and some convenient Gibbs measures.
