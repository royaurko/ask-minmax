We report a measurement of the inclusive electron energy spectrum for charmed
semileptonic decays of B mesons in a 140fb-1 data sample collected at the
\Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e+
e- collider. We determine the first four moments of the electron energy
spectrum for threshold values of the electron energy between 0.4 and 2.0 GeV.
In addition, we provide values of the partial branching fraction (zeroth
moment) for the same electron threshold energies, and independent measurements
of the B+ and B0 partial branching fractions at 0.4 GeV and 0.6 GeV electron
threshold energies. We measure the independent B+ and B^0 partial branching
fractions with electron threshold energies of 0.4 GeV to be \Delta \mathcal{B}
(B+ -> X_c e \nu)=(10.79 +/- 0.25(stat.) +/- 0.27(sys.))% and \Delta
\mathcal{B} (B0 -> X_c e \nu)=(10.09 +/- 0.30(stat.) +/- 0.22(sys.))%. Full
correlations between all measurements are evaluated.
