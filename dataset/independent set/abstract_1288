The DAMA/NaI set-up of the DAMA experiment has been operative during seven
annual cycles and has investigated several rare processes. In particular, it
has been realised in order to investigate the model independent annual
modulation signature for Dark Matter particles in the galactic halo. With the
total exposure collected in the seven annual cycles (107731 kg day) a model
independent evidence for the presence of a Dark Matter particle component in
the galactic halo has been pointed out at 6.3 sigma C.L.. Some of the many
possible corollary model dependent quests for the candidate particle have been
presented as well.
