Observational data usually comes with a multimodal nature, which means that
it can be naturally represented by a multi-layer graph whose layers share the
same set of vertices (users) with different edges (pairwise relationships). In
this paper, we address the problem of combining different layers of the
multi-layer graph for improved clustering of the vertices compared to using
layers independently. We propose two novel methods, which are based on joint
matrix factorization and graph regularization framework respectively, to
efficiently combine the spectrum of the multiple graph layers, namely the
eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrices. In each case, the resulting
combination, which we call a "joint spectrum" of multiple graphs, is used for
clustering the vertices. We evaluate our approaches by simulations with several
real world social network datasets. Results demonstrate the superior or
competitive performance of the proposed methods over state-of-the-art technique
and common baseline methods, such as co-regularization and summation of
information from individual graphs.
