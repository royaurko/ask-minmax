By using the invariant method we find one-parameter squeezed Gaussian states
for both time-independent and time-dependent oscillators. The squeezing
parameter is expressed in terms of energy expectation value for
time-independent case and represents the degree of mixing positive and negative
frequency solutions for time-dependent case. A {\it minimum uncertainty
proposal} is advanced to select uniquely vacuum states at each moment of time.
We show that the Gaussian states with minimum uncertainty coincide with the
true vacuum state for time-independent oscillator and the Bunch-Davies vacuum
for a massive scalar field in a de Sitter spacetime.
