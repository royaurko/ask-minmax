We study the off-shell mixing and renormalization of flavor-diagonal
dimension-5 T- and P-odd operators involving quarks, gluons, and photons,
including quark electric dipole and chromo-electric dipole operators. We
present the renormalization matrix to one-loop in the $\bar{\rm MS}$ scheme. We
also provide a definition of the quark chromo-electric dipole operator in a
regularization-independent momentum-subtraction scheme suitable for
non-perturbative lattice calculations and present the matching coefficients
with the $\bar{\rm MS}$ scheme to one-loop in perturbation theory, using both
the naive dimensional regularization and 't Hooft-Veltman prescriptions for
$\gamma_5$.
