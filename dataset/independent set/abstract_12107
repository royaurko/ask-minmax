We present a functional calculus approach to the study of rates of decay in
mean ergodic theorems for bounded strongly continuous operator semigroups. A
central role is played by operators of the form $g(A)$, where $-A$ is the
generator of the semigroup and $g$ is a Bernstein function. In addition, we
obtain some new results on Bernstein functions that are of independent
interest.
