Baryon form factors can be analyzed in a largely model-independent fashion in
terms of two complementary approaches. These are chiral perturbation theory and
dispersion relations. I review the status of dispersive calculations of the
nucleon electromagnetic form factors in the light of new data. Then, I present
the leading one-loop chiral perturbation theory analysis of the hyperon and the
strange nucleon form factors. Open problems and challenges are also discussed.
