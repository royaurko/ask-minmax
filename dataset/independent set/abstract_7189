Frequently, data in scientific computing is in its abstract form a finite
point set in space, and it is sometimes useful or required to compute what one
might call the ``shape'' of the set. For that purpose, this paper introduces
the formal notion of the family of $\alpha$-shapes of a finite point set in
$\Real^3$. Each shape is a well-defined polytope, derived from the Delaunay
triangulation of the point set, with a parameter $\alpha \in \Real$
controlling the desired level of detail. An algorithm is presented that
constructs the entire family of shapes for a given set of size $n$ in time
$O(n^2)$, worst case. A robust implementation of the algorithm is discussed
and several applications in the area of scientific computing are mentioned.
