We have examined $HZ\gamma$ vertex to obtain the limits on anomalous
$a_\gamma$, $b_\gamma$ and $\tilde b_\gamma$ couplings in a model independent
way through the $\gamma p$ collisions via the process $pp\to p \gamma p\to
pHqX$. The sensitivities to the anomalous couplings can be obtained as
$|b_\gamma|$, $|\tilde{b}_\gamma|\sim 10^{-3}$ for the integrated luminosity of
$L_{int}=100 ~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at the LHC with $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV.
