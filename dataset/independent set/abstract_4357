In this paper we introduce some Christoffel-Darboux type identities for
independence polynomials. As an application, we give a new proof of a theorem
of M. Chudnovsky and P. Seymour, claiming that the independence polynomial of a
claw-free graph has only real roots. Another application is related to a
conjecture of Merrifield and Simmons.
