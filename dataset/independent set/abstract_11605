Let X be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension d. We show that its
primitive cohomology in degree d is generated by certain "tube classes,"
constructed from the monodromy of the family of smooth hyperplane sections on
X. The proof makes use of a result about the group cohomology of certain
representations that may be of independent interest.
