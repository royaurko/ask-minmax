A framework for understanding the geometry of continuous actions of Z^d was
developed by Boyle and Lind using the notion of expansive behavior along
lower-dimensional subspaces. For algebraic Z^d-actions of entropy rank one, the
expansive subdynamics is readily described in terms of Lyapunov exponents. Here
we show that periodic point counts for elements of an entropy rank one action
determine the expansive subdynamics. Moreover, the finer structure of the
non-expansive set is visible in the topological and smooth structure of a set
of functions associated to the periodic point data.
