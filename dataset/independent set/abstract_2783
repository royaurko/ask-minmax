This paper studies the problem of exact localization of sparse (point or
extended) objects with noisy data. The crux of the proposed approach consists
of random illumination. Several recovery methods are analyzed: the Lasso, BPDN
and the One-Step Thresholding (OST). For independent random probes, it is shown
that both recovery methods can localize exactly $s=\cO(m)$, up to a logarithmic
factor, objects where $m$ is the number of data. Moreover, when the number of
random probes is large the Lasso with random illumination has a performance
guarantee for superresolution, beating the Rayleigh resolution limit. Numerical
evidence confirms the predictions and indicates that the performance of the
Lasso is superior to that of the OST for the proposed set-up with random
illumination.
