This paper describes a search algorithm to find multiple sets of one
dimensional unipolar (optical) orthogonal codes characterized by parameters,
binary code sequence of length (n bits) and weight w (number of bit 1s in the
sequence) as well as auto-correlation and cross-correlation constraint
respectively for the codes within a set. For a given code length n and code
weight w all possible difference sets, with auto-correlation constraints lying
from 1 to w-1 can be designed with distinct code serial number. For given
cross-correlation constraint from 1 to w-1 Multiple sets can be searched out of
the codes with auto-correlation constraints less than or equal to given
auto-correlation constraint using proposed algorithm. The searched multiple
sets can be sorted as having number of codes not less than the upper bound of
the sets given by Johnson bound. These one dimensional unipolar orthogonal
codes have their application in incoherent optical code division multiple
access systems.
