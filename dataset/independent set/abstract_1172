We develop a new method to sample from posterior distributions in
hierarchical models without using Markov chain Monte Carlo. This method, which
is a variant of importance sampling ideas, is generally applicable to
high-dimensional models involving large data sets. Samples are independent, so
they can be collected in parallel, and we do not need to be concerned with
issues like chain convergence and autocorrelation. Additionally, the method can
be used to compute marginal likelihoods.
