In this paper, the study of the global orbit pattern (gop) formed by all the
periodic orbits of discrete dynamical systems on a finite set $X$ allows us to
describe precisely the behaviour of such systems. We can predict by means of
closed formulas, the number of gop of the set of all the function from $X$ to
itself. We also explore, using the brute force of computers, some subsets of
locally rigid functions on $X$, for which interesting patterns of periodic
orbits are found.
