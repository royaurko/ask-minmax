We compare two different probes of the expansion history of the universe,
namely, luminosity distances from type Ia supernovae and angular diameter
distances from galaxy clusters, using the Bayesian interpretation of Crossing
statistic [1, 2] in conjunction with the assumption of cosmic duality relation.
Our analysis is conducted independently of any a-priori assumptions about the
nature of dark energy. The model independent method which we invoke searches
for inconsistencies between SNIa and galaxy cluster data sets. If detected such
an inconsistency would imply the presence of systematics in either of the two
data sets. Simulating observations based on expected WFIRST supernovae data and
X-ray eROSITA + SZ Planck cluster data, we show that our method allows one to
detect systematics with high precision and without advancing any hypothesis
about the nature of dark energy.
