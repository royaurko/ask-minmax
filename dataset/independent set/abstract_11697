Full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method with the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation potential
has been applied for the study of structural, elastic and electronic properties
of the newly synthesized nitrogen-containing perovskite-like superconductor
ZnNNi3. The optimized lattice parameter, independent elastic constants (C11,
C12 and C44), bulk modulus B, compressibility betta, and shear modulus G are
evaluated. The band structure, total and site- projected l- decomposed DOSs,
the shape of the Fermi surface, the Sommerfeld coefficient and the molar Pauli
paramagnetic susceptibility for this novel anti-perovskite are obtained and
analyzed in comparison with related anti-perovskites ZnCNi3 and MgCNi3
