We develop multiattribute auctions that accommodate generalized additive
independent (GAI) preferences. We propose an iterative auction mechanism that
maintains prices on potentially overlapping GAI clusters of attributes, thus
decreases elicitation and computational burden, and creates an open competition
among suppliers over a multidimensional domain. Most significantly, the auction
is guaranteed to achieve surplus which approximates optimal welfare up to a
small additive factor, under reasonable equilibrium strategies of traders. The
main departure of GAI auctions from previous literature is to accommodate
non-additive trader preferences, hence allowing traders to condition their
evaluation of specific attributes on the value of other attributes. At the same
time, the GAI structure supports a compact representation of prices, enabling a
tractable auction process. We perform a simulation study, demonstrating and
quantifying the significant efficiency advantage of more expressive preference
modeling. We draw random GAI-structured utility functions with various internal
structures, generate additive functions that approximate the GAI utility, and
compare the performance of the auctions using the two representations. We find
that allowing traders to express existing dependencies among attributes
improves the economic efficiency of multiattribute auctions.
