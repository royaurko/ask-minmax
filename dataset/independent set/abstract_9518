In e+e- collisions the particle spectra at low momenta reflect the properties
of the underlying "soft" QCD gluon bremsstrahlung: the particle density, in the
limit p\to 0, becomes independent of the incoming energy \sqrt{s} and directly
proportional to the colour factors C_A,C_F for primary gluons or quarks
respectively. We find that experimental data from the pp and nuclear reactions
reveal the same behaviour: in the limit p_T\to 0 the invariant particle spectra
become independent of the collision energy, and their intensities in e+e-, pp
and nuclear reactions are compatible with the expected colour factors C_F: C_A:
(N_{part}/2) C_A for N_{part} nucleons, participating in the interaction.
Coherent soft gluon bremsstrahlung is, therefore, suggested to be the dominant
QCD mechanism for the soft particle production in all these reactions. These
"soft" particles probe the very early stage of hadron formation in the
collision. Future measurements at the LHC will provide crucial tests on the
contributions from possible incoherent multi-component processes.
