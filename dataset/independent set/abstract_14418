In this paper some aspects on chaotic behavior and minimality in planar
piecewise smooth vector fields theory are treated. The occurrence of
non-deterministic chaos is observed and the concept of orientable minimality is
introduced. It is also investigated some relations between minimality and
orientable minimality and observed the existence of new kinds of non-trivial
minimal sets in chaotic systems. The approach is geometrical and involve the
ordinary techniques of non-smooth systems.
