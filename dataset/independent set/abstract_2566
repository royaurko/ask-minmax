An all-order summation of core polarization diagrams using the low-momentum
nucleon-nucleon interaction, V_low-k is presented. The summation is based on
the Kirson-Babu-Brown (KBB) induced interaction approach in which the vertex
functions are obtained self consistently by solving a set of non-linear coupled
equations. It is found that the solution of these equations is simplified by
using V_low-k, which is energy independent, and by employing Green functions in
the particle-particle and particle-hole channels. We have applied this approach
to the sd-shell effective interactions and find that the results calculated to
all orders using the KBB summation technique are remarkably similar to those of
second-order perturbation theory, average differences being less than 10%.
