We propose a strategy for disclosure risk evaluation and disclosure control
of a microdata set based on fitting decomposable models of a multiway
contingency table corresponding to the microdata set. By fitting decomposable
models, we can evaluate per-record identification (or re-identification) risk
of a microdata set. Furthermore we can easily determine swappability of risky
records which does not disturb the set of marginals of the decomposable model.
Use of decomposable models has been already considered in the existing
literature. The contribution of this paper is to propose a systematic strategy
to the problem of finding a model with a good fit, identifying risky records
under the model, and then applying the swapping procedure to these records.
