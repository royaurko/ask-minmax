Using the gauge/gravity duality, we calculate the electromagnetic
contributions to hadron masses, where mass generates dynamically by strong QCD
interactions. Based on the Sakai-Sugimoto model of holographic QCD we find that
the electromagnetic mass of proton is $0.48~{\rm MeV}$ larger than that of
neutron, which is in agreement with recent lattice results. Similarly for pions
we obtain $m_{\pi^{\pm}}-m_{\pi^0}=1.8~{\rm MeV}$, roughly half of the
experimental value. The electromagnetic mass of pions is found to be
independent of $N_c$ and 't Hooft coupling and its scale is set only by the
Kaluza-Klein scale of the model, $M_{\rm KK}=949~{\rm MeV}$.
