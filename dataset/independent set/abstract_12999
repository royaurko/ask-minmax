The search for neutrinoless double-beta decay is important in determining the
Majorana nature of the neutrino, and also in establishing if lepton number is
violated. In this work, we combine the published data from five independent
neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments: CUORICINO, EXO, GERDA, KamLAND-Zen
and NEMO-3. As these experiments use different isotope sources, the relative
signal normalisation between them depends on the Nuclear Matrix Element (NME)
calculations used. The combined limits for the Majorana neutrino mass for 5
different NME models range from 130-310 meV. The combined mass limits can offer
an improvement over the individual experiments of up to 25%, depending on the
NME model.
