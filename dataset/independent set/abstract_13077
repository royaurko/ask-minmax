We present a three-loop model of neutrino mass in which both the weak scale
and neutrino mass arise as radiative effects. In this approach, the scales for
electroweak symmetry breaking, dark matter, and the exotics responsible for
neutrino mass, are related due to an underlying scale-invariance. This
motivates the otherwise-independent O(TeV) exotic masses usually found in
three-loop models of neutrino mass. We demonstrate the existence of viable
parameter space and show that the model can be probed at colliders, precision
experiments, and dark matter direct-detection experiments.
