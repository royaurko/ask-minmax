We use the large $N$ self consistency method to compute the critical
exponents of the fields and coupling of the supersymmetric CP(N) sigma model at
leading order in $1/N$ in various dimensions. We verify that the correction to
the critical beta-function slope vanishes at O(1/N) which is consistent with
supersymmetry. The three dimensional model is investigated explicitly when a
Chern Simons term is included supersymmetrically. We determine the modification
that this has on the gauge independent quantity \beta^\prime(g_c) as a function
of the Chern Simons coupling, \vartheta. For an N = 2 supersymmetric Chern
Simons term the exponent is independent of \vartheta at O(1/N), whilst it is
invariant under \vartheta \rightarrow 1/\vartheta when an N = 1 supersymmetric
Chern Simons term is included.
