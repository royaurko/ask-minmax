We consider the situation that two players have cardinal preferences over a
finite set of alternatives. These preferences are common knowledge to the
players, and they engage in bargaining to choose an alternative. In this they
are assisted by an arbitrator (a mechanism) who does not know the preferences.
  Our main positive result suggests a satisfactory-alternatives mechanism
wherein each player reports a set of alternatives. If the sets intersect, then
the mechanism chooses an alternative from the intersection uniformly at random.
If the sets are disjoint, then the mechanism chooses an alternative from the
union uniformly at random. We show that a close variant of this mechanism
succeeds in selecting Pareto efficient alternatives only, as pure Nash
equilibria outcomes.
  Then we characterize the possible and the impossible with respect to the
classical bargaining axioms. Namely, we characterize the subsets of axioms can
be satisfied simultaneously by the set of pure Nash equilibria outcomes of a
mechanism. We provide a complete answer to this question for all subsets of
axioms. In all cases that the answer is positive, we present a simple and
intuitive mechanism which achieves this goal. The satisfactory-alternatives
mechanism constitutes a positive answer to one of these possibility cases
(arguably the most interesting case). Our negative results exclude the
possibility of an efficient mechanism with unique equilibrium outcome, and
exclude the possibility of an efficient symmetric mechanism which is invariant
with respect to repetition of alternatives.
