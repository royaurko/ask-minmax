We calculate the almost sure Hausdorff dimension of uniformly random
self-similar fractals. These random fractals are generated from a finite family
of similarities, where the linear parts of the mappings are independent
uniformly distributed random variables at each step of iteration. We also prove
that the Lebesgue measure of such sets is almost surely positive in some cases.
