In this article we prove in a new way that a generic polynomial vector field
in $\mathbb C^2$ possesses countably many homologically independent limit
cycles. The new proof needs no estimates on integrals, provides thinner
exceptional set for quadratic vector fields, and provides limit cycles that
stay in a bounded domain.
