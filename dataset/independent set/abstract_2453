We consider pure Yang Mills theory on the four torus. A set of non-Abelian
transition functions is presented which encompass all instanton sectors. It is
argued that these transition functions are a convenient starting point for
gauge fixing. In particular, we give an extended Abelian projection with
respect to the Polyakov loop, where $A_0$ is independent of time and in the
Cartan subalgebra. In the non-perturbative sectors such gauge fixings are
necessarily singular. These singularities can be restricted to Dirac strings
joining monopole and anti-monopole like ``defects''.
