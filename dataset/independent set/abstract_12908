This paper presents a single-step tunable group delay phaser for spectrum
sniffing. This device may be seen as a "time filter", where frequencies are
suppressed by time separation rather than by spectral attenuation. Compared to
its multiple-step counterpart, this phaser features higher processing
resolution, greater simplicity, lower loss and better channel equalization, due
to the smaller and channel-independent group delay swing. A three-channel
example is provided for illustration.
