We propose a novel method for the description of spatial patterns formed by a
coverage of point sets representing galaxy samples. This method is based on a
complete family of morphological measures known as Minkowski functionals, which
includes the topological Euler characteristic and geometric descriptors to
specify the content, shape and connectivity of spatial sets. The method is
numerically robust even for small samples, independent of statistical
assumptions, and yields global as well as local morphological information. We
illustrate the method by applying it to a Poisson process, a `double-Poisson'
process, and to the Abell catalogue of galaxy clusters.
