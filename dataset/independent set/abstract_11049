A hypothetical violation of Lorentz invariance in the electrons' equation of
motion (expressed within the Lorentz-violating extension of the standard model)
leads to a change of the geometry of crystals and thus shifts the resonance
frequency of an electromagnetic cavity. This allows experimental tests of
Lorentz invariance of the electron sector of the standard model. The material
dependence of the effect allows to separate it from an additional shift caused
by Lorentz violation in electrodynamics, and to place independent limits on
both effects. From present experiments, upper limits on Lorentz violation in
the electrons' kinetic energy term are deduced.
