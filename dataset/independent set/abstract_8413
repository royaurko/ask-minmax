Given a sequence of complex numbers {\rho}_n, we study the asymptotic
distribution of the sets of parameters c {\epsilon} C such that the quadratic
maps z^2 +c has a cycle of period n and multiplier {\rho}_n. Assume
1/n.log|{\rho}_n| tends to L. If L {\leq} log 2, they equidistribute on the
boundary of the Mandelbrot set. If L > log 2 they equidistribute on the
equipotential of the Mandelbrot set of level 2L - 2 log 2.
