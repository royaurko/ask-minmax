We give a brief discussion of some of the issues which have arisen in the
course of formalizing some classical set-theoretical mathematics in the Coq
system. This sprouts from, expands and replaces a chapter of math.HO/0311260
which will be removed in revision, and also contains as a tar-attachment to the
source file the revised and expanded version of the proof development which had
been attached to math.HO/0311260.
