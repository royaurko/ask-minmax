In approachability with full monitoring there are two types of conditions
that are known to be equivalent for convex sets: a primal and a dual condition.
The primal one is of the form: a set C is approachable if and only all
containing half-spaces are approachable in the one-shot game; while the dual
one is of the form: a convex set C is approachable if and only if it intersects
all payoff sets of a certain form. We consider approachability in games with
partial monitoring. In previous works (Perchet 2011; Mannor et al. 2011) we
provided a dual characterization of approachable convex sets; we also exhibited
efficient strategies in the case where C is a polytope. In this paper we
provide primal conditions on a convex set to be approachable with partial
monitoring. They depend on a modified reward function and lead to
approachability strategies, based on modified payoff functions, that proceed by
projections similarly to Blackwell's (1956) strategy; this is in contrast with
previously studied strategies in this context that relied mostly on the
signaling structure and aimed at estimating well the distributions of the
signals received. Our results generalize classical results by Kohlberg 1975
(see also Mertens et al. 1994) and apply to games with arbitrary signaling
structure as well as to arbitrary convex sets.
