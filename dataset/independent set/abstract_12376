We study the evolution of the phase-space of collisionless N-body systems
under repeated stirrings or perturbations. We find convergence towards a
limited solution group, in accordance with Hansen 2010, that is independent of
the initial system and environmental conditions, paying particular attention to
the assumed gravitational paradigm (Newtonian and MOND). We examine the effects
of changes to the perturbation scheme and in doing so identify a large group of
perturbations featuring radial orbit instability (ROI) which always lead to
convergence. The attractor is thus found to be a robust and reproducible effect
under a variety of circumstances.
