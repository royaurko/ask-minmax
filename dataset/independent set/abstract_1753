The non-monotonic propagation of fronts is considered. When the speed
function F, which may depend on space and time, is prescribed, the non-linear
advection equation phi_t+F|grad(phi)|=0 is a Hamilton-Jacobi equation known as
the level-set equation. It is argued that a small enough neighbourhood of the
zero-level-set M of the solution phi: R^n x [0,T] --> R is the image of psi:
R^n --> R where psi solves a Dirichlet problem of the form
H(u,psi(u),grad(psi(u))=0. A fast-marching algorithm is presented where each
point is computed using a discretization of such a Dirichlet problem, with no
restrictions on the sign of F. The output is a directed graph whose vertices
evenly sample M. The convergence, consistency and stability of the scheme are
addressed. Bounds on the computational complexity are established, and verified
to be on par with the Fast Marching Method. Examples are presented where the
algorithm is shown to be globally first-order accurate. The complexity and
accuracy observed are independent of the monotonicity of the evolution.
