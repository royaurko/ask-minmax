We compute the next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) ultrasoft running of the
spin-independent singlet potentials up to ${\cal O}(1/m^2)$, and the
corresponding contribution to the spectrum. This includes the static energy at
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNNLL) order. As a byproduct of
these results one could obtain the heavy quarkonium spectrum with N$^3$LL
accuracy for $l\not=0$ (angular momentum) and $s=0$ (spin) states, setting the
stage for the full analytic and numerical N$^3$LL analysis of such quantity. We
also compute the next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^4$LO)
ultrasoft spin-independent contribution to the heavy quarkonium mass and static
energy.
