We report the hard X-ray spectrum of the Coma cluster obtained using the PDS
data of two independent BeppoSAX observations performed with a time interval of
about three years. In both the spectra a non thermal excess with respect to the
thermal emission is present at a confidence level of ~ 3.4 sigma. The combined
spectrum obtained by adding up the two spectra allows a measurement of the
excess at the level of ~ 4.8 sigma at energies above 20 keV. The analysis of
the full BeppoSAX data set provides a revised non-thermal X-ray flux which is
slightly lower than that previously estimated (Fusco-Femiano et al. 1999) and
in agreement with that measured by two RXTE observations. The analysis of the
offset fields in our Coma observations provides a possible flux determination
of the BL Lac object 1ES 1255+244.
