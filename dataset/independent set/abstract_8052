First-order Goedel logics are a family of infinite-valued logics where the
sets of truth values V are closed subsets of [0, 1] containing both 0 and 1.
Different such sets V in general determine different Goedel logics G_V (sets of
those formulas which evaluate to 1 in every interpretation into V). It is shown
that G_V is axiomatizable iff V is finite, V is uncountable with 0 isolated in
V, or every neighborhood of 0 in V is uncountable. Complete axiomatizations for
each of these cases are given. The r.e. prenex, negation-free, and existential
fragments of all first-order Goedel logics are also characterized.
