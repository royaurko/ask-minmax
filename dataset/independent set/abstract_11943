Heavy quark jet quenching in nuclear collisions at LHC is predicted and
compared using the classical gravity AdS/CFT correspondence and Standard Model
perturbative QCD. The momentum independence and inverse quark mass dependence
of the drag coefficient in AdS/CFT differs substantially from the
characteristic log(pT/M)/pT variation of the drag in QCD. We propose that the
measurement of the momentum dependence of the double ratio of the nuclear
modification factors of charm and bottom jets is a robust observable that can
be used to search for strong coupling deviations from perturbative QCD
predictions.
