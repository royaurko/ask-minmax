The frequencies of three separate Cs fountain clocks and one Rb fountain
clock have been compared to various hydrogen masers to search for periodic
changes correlated with the changing solar gravitational potential at the Earth
and boost with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) rest frame. The
data sets span over more than eight years. The main sources of long-term noise
in such experiments are the offsets and linear drifts associated with the
various H-masers. The drift can vary from nearly immeasurable to as high as
1.3*10^-15 per day. To circumvent these effects we apply a numerical derivative
to the data, which significantly reduces the standard error when searching for
periodic signals. We determine a standard error for the putative Local Position
Invariance (LPI) coefficient with respect to gravity for a Cs-Fountain H-maser
comparison of 4.8*10^-6 and 10^-5 for a Rb-Fountain H-maser comparison. From
the same data the putative boost LPI coefficients were measured to a precision
of up to parts in 10^11 with respect to the CMB rest frame. By combining these
boost invariance experiments to a Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillator versus H-maser
comparison, independent limits on all nine coefficients of the boost violation
vector with respect to fundamental constant invariance (fine structure
constant, electron mass and quark mass respectively), were determined to a
precision of parts up to 10^10.
