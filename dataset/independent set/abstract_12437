In a wide class of holographic models described by the Yang-Mills and
Chern-Simons terms, we derive all the ${\cal O}(p^6)$ Chiral Perturbation
Theory low-energy constants. Various model-independent relations exist among
the constants up to this order, generalizing the previously found relations at
$p^4$ order. Some of them can be extended to relations between different
amplitudes.
