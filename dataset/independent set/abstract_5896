For a random polynomial with standard normal coefficients, two cases of the
K-level crossings have been considered by Farahmand. When the coefficients are
independent, Farahmand was able to derive an asymptotic value for the expected
number of level crossings, even if K is allowed to grow to infinity.
Alternatively, it was shown that when the coefficients have a constant
covariance, the expected number of level crossings is reduced by half. In this
paper we are interested in studying the behavior for dependent standard normal
coefficients where the covariance is decaying and no longer constant. Using
techniques similar to those of Farahmand, we will be able to show that for a
wide range of covariance functions behavior similar to the independent case can
be expected.
