In this paper the stability and the renormalizability of Yang-Mills theory in
the Background Field Gauge are studied. By means of Ward Identities of
Background gauge invariance and Slavnov-Taylor Identities the stability of the
classical model is proved and, in a regularization independent way, its
renormalizability is verified. A prescription on how to build the counterterms
is given and the possible anomalies which may appear for Ward Identities and
for Slavnov-Taylor Identities are shown.
