To accompany recent openings in category theory and philosophy, I discuss how
Alain Badiou attempts to rephrase his dialectic philosophy in topos-theoretic
terms. Topos theory bridges the problems emerging in set-theoretic language by
a categorical approach that reinscribes set-theoretic language in a categorical
framework. Badiou's own topos-theoretic formalism, however, turns out to be
confined only to a limited, set-theoretically bounded branch of locales. This
results with his mathematically reduced understanding of the 'postulate of
materialism' constitutive to his account. Badiou falsely assumes this postulate
to be singular whereas topos theory reveals its two-sided nature whose
synthesis emerges only as a result of a (quasi-)split structure of truth.
Badiou thus struggles with his own mathematical argument. I accomplish a
correct version of his proof the sets defined over such a 'transcendental
algebra' T form a (local) topos. Finally, I discuss the philosophical
implications Badiou's mathematical inadequacies entail.
