We show how observations of the evolution of the galaxy cluster number
abundance can be used to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity in the universe.
We carry out a maximum likelihood analysis incorporating a number of current
datasets and accounting for a wide range of sources of systematic error. Under
the assumption of Gaussianity, the current data prefer a universe with matter
density $\Omega_m\simeq 0.3$ and are inconsistent with $\Omega_m=1$ at the
$2\sigma$ level. If we assume $\Omega_m=1$, the predicted degree of cluster
evolution is consistent with the data for non-Gaussian models where the
primordial fluctuations have at least two times as many peaks of height
$3\sigma$ or more as a Gaussian distribution does. These results are robust to
almost all sources of systematic error considered: in particular, the
$\Omega_m=1$ Gaussian case can only be reconciled with the data if a number of
systematic effects conspire to modify the analysis in the right direction.
Given an independent measurement of $\Omega_m$, the techniques described here
represent a powerful tool with which to constrain non-Gaussianity in the
primordial universe, independent of specific details of the non-Gaussian
physics. We discuss the prospects and strategies for improving the constraints
with future observations.
