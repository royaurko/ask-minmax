A large class of first order partial nonlinear differential equations in two
independent variables which possess an infinite set of polynomial conservation
laws derived from an explicit generating function is constructed. The conserved
charge densities are all homogeneous polynomials in the unknown functions which
satisfy the differential equations in question.
 The simplest member of the class of equations is related to the Born-Infeld
equation in two dimensions. It is observed that some members of this class
possess identical charge densities. This enables the construction of a set of
multivariable equations with an infinite number of conservation laws.
