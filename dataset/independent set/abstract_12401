We show that orbital currents in a CuO2 plane, if present, should be
described by two independent parity and time-reversal odd order parameters, a
toroidal dipole (anapole) and a magnetic quadrupole. Based on this, we derive
the resonant X-ray diffraction cross-section for monoclinic CuO at the
antiferromagnetic wavevector and show that the two order parameters can be
disentangled. From our analysis, we examine a recent claim of detecting
anapoles in CuO.
