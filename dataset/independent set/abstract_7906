Let D be a compact convex domain in the plane. P\'olya & Szeg\"o and,
independently, Levi & Pan defined the point p in D that is "best insulated from
the boundary C of D". We compute p in the case when C is an isosceles right
triangle, revisiting exact results from the study of complex conformal
mappings.
