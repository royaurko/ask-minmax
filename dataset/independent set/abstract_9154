The model-independent determination of the Higgs-boson CP properties at the
Photon Collider at TESLA has been studied in detail, for masses between 200 and
350 GeV, using realistic luminosity spectra and detector simulation. We
consider a generic model with the CP violating Higgs tensor couplings to gauge
bosons. We introduce a new variable describing angular distributions of the
secondary WW and ZZ decay products which is very sensitive to the CP properties
of the Higgs-boson. Understanding of the detector performance turns out to be
crucial, as the influence of the acceptance corrections is similar to the
effects of CP violation. From the combined measurement of invariant mass
distributions and various angular distributions the phase describing a CP
violation can be determined to about 50 mrad after one year of Photon Collider
running.
