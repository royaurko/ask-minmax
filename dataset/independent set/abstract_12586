Turbulence is generally associated with universal power-law spectra in scale
ranges without significant drive or damping. Although many examples of
turbulent systems do not exhibit such an inertial range, power-law spectra may
still be observed. As a simple model for such situations, a modified version of
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is studied. By means of semi-analytical and
numerical studies, one finds power laws with nonuniversal exponents in the
spectral range for which the ratio of nonlinear and linear time scales is
(roughly) scale-independent.
