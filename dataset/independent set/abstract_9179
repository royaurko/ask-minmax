We study the underlying gauge symmetry algebra of the $N=2$ string, which is
broken down to a subalgebra in any spacetime background. For given toroidal
backgrounds, the unbroken gauge symmetries (corresponding to holomorphic and
antiholomorphic worldsheet currents) generate area-preserving diffeomorphism
algebras of null 2-tori. A minimal Lie algebraic closure containing all the
gauge symmetries that arise in this way, is the background--independent
volume--preserving diffeomorphism algebra of the target Narain torus $T^{4,4}$.
The underlying symmetries act on the ground ring of functions on $T^{4,4}$ as
derivations, much as in the case of the $d=2$ string. A background--independent
spacetime action valid for noncompact metrics is presented, whose symmetries
are volume--preserving diffeomorphisms. Possible extensions to $N=2$ and $N=1$
heterotic strings are briefly discussed.
