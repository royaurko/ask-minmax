In this paper, the notion of c-support points of a set in a semitopological
cone is introduced, and it's shown that any nonempty convex Scott closed
bounded set has a c-support point in a cancellative bd-cone under certain
condition. We also prove the Bishop-Phelps type theorem for cancellative
continuous locally convex wd-cone.
