We study disjunctive conic sets involving a general regular (closed, convex,
full dimensional, and pointed) cone K such as the nonnegative orthant, the
Lorentz cone or the positive semidefinite cone. In a unified framework, we
introduce K-minimal inequalities and show that under mild assumptions, these
inequalities together with the trivial cone-implied inequalities are sufficient
to describe the convex hull. We study the properties of K-minimal inequalities
by establishing algebraic necessary conditions for an inequality to be
K-minimal. This characterization leads to a broader algebraically defined class
of K- sublinear inequalities. We establish a close connection between
K-sublinear inequalities and the support functions of sets with a particular
structure. This connection results in practical ways of showing that a given
inequality is K-sublinear and K-minimal.
  Our framework generalizes some of the results from the mixed integer linear
case. It is well known that the minimal inequalities for mixed integer linear
programs are generated by sublinear (positively homogeneous, subadditive and
convex) functions that are also piecewise linear. This result is easily
recovered by our analysis. Whenever possible we highlight the connections to
the existing literature. However, our study unveils that such a cut generating
function view treating the data associated with each individual variable
independently is not possible in the case of general cones other than
nonnegative orthant, even when the cone involved is the Lorentz cone.
