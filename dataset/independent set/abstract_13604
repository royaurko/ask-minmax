A recently developed technique to determine the order and strength of phase
transitions by extracting the density of partition function zeroes (a
continuous function) from finite-size systems (a discrete data set) is
generalized to systems for which (i) some or all of the zeroes occur in
degenerate sets and/or (ii) they are not confined to a singular line in the
complex plane. The technique is demonstrated by application to the case of free
Wilson fermions.
