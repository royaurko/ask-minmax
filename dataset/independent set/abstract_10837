We study the contributions of the CP violating anomalous WW-gamma
interactions to b->s l^+ l^-. We obtain cutoff independent results on tilde
kappa and tilde lambda, by constructing an asymmetry for the process
B->K^*l^+l^-, where the B and B bar events are added. We show that a sample of
10^4 B-> K^*e^+e^- events, can yield a bound
 |tilde kappa| < 0.42 at 90% C.L., which is much tighter than the recent
constraint from D0.
