In this paper, with the notion of independent identically distributed random
variables under sub-linear expectations initiated by Peng, we derive three
kinds of strong laws of large numbers for capacities. Moreover, these theorems
are natural and fairly neat extensions of the classical Kolmogorov's strong law
of large numbers to the case where probability measures are no longer additive.
Finally, an important feature of these strong laws of large numbers is to
provide a frequentist perspective on capacities.
