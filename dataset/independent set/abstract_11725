We show that a remarkable compatibility exists between the results of a
potential model with constituent quarks and the 1/Nc expansion mass formula for
strange and nonstrange baryon resonances. Such compatibility brings support to
the basic assumptions of relativistic quark models and sheds light on the
physical content of the model-independent large Nc mass formula. Good agreement
between both approaches is also found for heavy baryons, made of one heavy and
two light quarks, in the ground state band.
