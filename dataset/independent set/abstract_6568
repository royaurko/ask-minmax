The visibility graph Vis(X) of a discrete point set X in the plane has vertex
set X and an edge xy for every two points x,y\in X whenever there is no other
point in X on the line segment between x and y. We show that for every graph G,
there is a point set X, such that the subgraph of Vis(X\cup Z^2) induced by X
is isomorphic to G. As a consequence, we show that there are visibility graphs
of arbitrary high chromatic number with clique number six settling a question
