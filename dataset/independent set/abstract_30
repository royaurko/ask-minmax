We study the existence and the number of $k$-dominating independent sets in
certain graph families. While the case $k=1$ namely the case of maximal
independent sets - which is originated from Erd\H{o}s and Moser - is widely
investigated, much less is known in general. In this paper we settle the
question for trees and prove that the maximum number of $k$-dominating
independent sets in $n$-vertex graphs is between $c_k\cdot\sqrt[2k]{2}^n$ and
$c_k'\cdot\sqrt[k+1]{2}^n$ if $k\geq 2$, moreover the maximum number of
$2$-dominating independent sets in $n$-vertex graphs is between $c\cdot 1.22^n$
and $c'\cdot1.246^n$. Graph constructions containing a large number of
$k$-dominating independent sets are coming from product graphs, complete
bipartite graphs and with finite geometries. The product graph construction is
associated with the number of certain MDS codes.
