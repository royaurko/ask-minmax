Working within a five-dimensional consistent truncation of type IIB
supergravity dimensionally reduced on $T^{1,1}$, we consider supersymmetry
breaking solutions with the asymptotics of the supersymmetric
Klebanov-Strassler background. There exists a two-parameter family of such
solutions. Within this family, we show that those (and only those) solutions
related to antiD-branes at the tip of the conifold correspond to dual field
theory vacua where a goldstino mode is present and the supercurrent Ward
identities hold. Our findings do not depend on the IR singularity of the dual
backgrounds, nor on its resolution. As such, they provide independent evidence
for the existence of superysymmetry breaking vacua in the conifold cascading
gauge theory.
