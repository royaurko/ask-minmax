It is shown that the electron spin may not be conserved after a
spin-independent scattering. This fact strongly limits the validity of the
classical model of spin-up/spin-down bands, which has been used for description
of magnetic properties of conduction electrons. It is shown that it is possible
to divide all conduction electrons into two group distinguished by their
symmetry for time reversal. The number of electrons in each group is conserved
after a spin-independent scattering. This makes it convenient to use these
groups for describing of the magnetic properties of conduction electrons. The
energy distribution of spins, the Pauli paramagnetism and the spin distribution
in the ferromagnetic metals are described within the presented model. The
effects of spin torque and spin-torque current are described. The origin of
spin-transfer torque is explained within presented model.
