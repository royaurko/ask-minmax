A generalization of numeration system in which the set N of the natural
numbers is recognizable by finite automata can be obtained by describing a
lexicographically ordered infinite regular language. Here we show that if P
belonging to Q[x] is a polynomial such that P(N) is a subset of N then we can
construct a numeration system in which the set of representations of P(N) is
regular. The main issue in this construction is to setup a regular language
with a density function equals to P(n+1)-P(n) for n large enough.
