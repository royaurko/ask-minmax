We discuss the theory of inclusive production of heavy quarkonium, the
comparison between theory and experiment, and the expected nuclear effects in
cold nuclear targets. We also present predictions, based on Nonrelativistic QCD
(NRQCD), for quarkonium production cross sections in the LHC energy range. We
find that nuclear effects in the production cross sections are largely
independent of the sizes of the NRQCD matrix elements, the charmonium state
that is produced and, in the color-octet case, largely independent of the
partonic subprocess that produces the heavy quark-antiquark pair.
