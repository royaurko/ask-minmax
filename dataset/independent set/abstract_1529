A thermodynamic approach to rapid phase transformations within a diffuse
interface in a binary system is developed. Assuming an extended set of
independent thermodynamic variables formed by the union of the classic set of
slow variables and the space of fast variables, we introduce finiteness of the
heat and solute diffusive propagation at the finite speed of the interface
advancing. To describe the transformation within the diffuse interface, we use
the phase-field model which allows us to follow the steep but smooth change of
phases within the width of diffuse interface. The governing equations of the
phase-field model are derived for the hyperbolic model, model with memory, and
for a model of nonlinear evolution of transformation within the
diffuse-interface. The consistency of the model is proved by the condition of
positive entropy production and by the outcomes of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem. A comparison with the existing sharp-interface and diffuse-interface
versions of the model is given.
