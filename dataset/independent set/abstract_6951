We present new theoretical results on differentially private data release
useful with respect to any target class of counting queries, coupled with
experimental results on a variety of real world data sets.
  Specifically, we study a simple combination of the multiplicative weights
approach of [Hardt and Rothblum, 2010] with the exponential mechanism of
[McSherry and Talwar, 2007]. The multiplicative weights framework allows us to
maintain and improve a distribution approximating a given data set with respect
to a set of counting queries. We use the exponential mechanism to select those
queries most incorrectly tracked by the current distribution. Combing the two,
we quickly approach a distribution that agrees with the data set on the given
set of queries up to small error.
  The resulting algorithm and its analysis is simple, but nevertheless improves
upon previous work in terms of both error and running time. We also empirically
demonstrate the practicality of our approach on several data sets commonly used
in the statistical community for contingency table release.
