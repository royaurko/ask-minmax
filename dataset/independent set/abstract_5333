We propose the modified form of the conventional holographic conserved
charges which provides us the frame-independent expressions for charges. This
form is also preferable to the conventional one since it is independent of the
holographic renormalization scheme. We show the frame and scheme independence
through the matching of our holographic expression to the covariant bulk
expression of conserved charges. As an explicit example, we consider
five-dimensional AdS Kerr black holes and show that our form of holographic
conserved charges gives us the identical expressions in the rotating and
non-rotating frames.
