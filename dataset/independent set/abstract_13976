Theory of representations of universal algebra is a natural development of
the theory of universal algebra. Morphism of the representation is the map that
conserve the structure of the representation. Exploring of morphisms of the
representation leads to the concepts of generating set and basis of
representation. In the book I considered the notion of tower of representations
of $F_i$-algebras, i=1 ..., n, as the set of coordinated representations of
$F_i$-algebras.
