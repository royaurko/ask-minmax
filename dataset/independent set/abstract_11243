We present several results on the number of irrational and linear independent
values among $\zeta(s),\zeta(s+2),...,\zeta(s+2n)$, where $s>2$ is an odd
integer and $n>0$ is an integer. The main tool in our proofs is a certain
generalization of Rivoal's construction (math.NT/0008051, math.NT/0104221).
