We consider the problem of determining whether a set of primes, or, more
generally, prime ideals in a number field, can be realized as a finite union of
residue classes, or of Frobenius conjugacy classes. We give criteria for a set
to be realized in this manner, and show that the subset of primes consisting of
every other prime cannot be expressed in this way, even if we allow a finite
number of exceptions.
