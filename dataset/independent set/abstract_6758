We investigate the size of the regular set for suitable weak solutions of the
Navier--Stokes equation, in the sense of Caffarelli--Kohn--Nirenberg. We
consider initial data in weighted Lebesgue spaces with mixed radial-angular
integrability, and we prove that the regular set increases if the data have
higher angular integrability, invading the whole half space $\{t>0\}$ in an
appropriate limit. In particular, we obtain that if the $L^{2}$ norm with
weight $|x|^{-\frac12}$ of the data tends to 0, the regular set invades
$\{t>0\}$.
