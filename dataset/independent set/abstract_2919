We introduce a general procedure for directly ascertaining how many
independent stochastic sources exist in a complex system modeled through a set
of coupled Langevin equations of arbitrary dimension. The procedure is based on
the computation of the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of local
diffusion matrices. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to two examples
of systems showing Hopf-bifurcation. We argue that computing the eigenvectors
associated to the eigenvalues of the diffusion matrix at local mesh points in
the phase space enables one to define vector fields of stochastic
eigendirections. In particular, the eigenvector associated to the lowest
eigenvalue defines the path of minimum stochastic forcing in phase space, and a
transform to a new coordinate system aligned with the eigenvectors can increase
the predictability of the system.
