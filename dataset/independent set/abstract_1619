We present a novel catalog-independent method, based on a scale dependent
approach, to detect anisotropy signatures in the arrival direction distribution
of the ultra highest energy cosmic rays (UHECR). The method provides a good
discrimination power for both large and small data sets, even in presence of
strong contaminating isotropic background. We present some applications to
simulated data sets of events corresponding to plausible scenarios for charged
particles detected by world-wide surface detector-based observatories, in the
last decades.
