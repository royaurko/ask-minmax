For a fixed rational number g different from -1,0,1 and integers a and d the
set N_g(a,d) of primes p for which the order of g(mod p) is congruent to a(mod
d) is considered. It is shown, assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis
(GRH), that this set has a natural density which can be computed in terms of
degrees of certain Kummer extensions and Galois theoretic intersection
coefficients. In case d is a power of an odd prime several properties of this
density are established.
