We consider the relation between geometrically finite groups and their limit
sets in infinite-dimensional hyperbolic space. Specifically, we show that a
rigidity theorem of Susskind and Swarup ('92) generalizes to infinite
dimensions, while a stronger rigidity theorem of Yang and Jiang ('10) does not.
