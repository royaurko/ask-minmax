We consider a generalized version (GES) of the wellknown Severini-Egoroff
theorem in real analysis, first shown to be undecidable in ZFC by Tomasz Weiss.
This independence is easily derived from suitable hypotheses on some cardinal
characteristics of the continuum like b and o, the latter being the least
cardinality of a subset of [0,1] having full outer measure.
