Framings provide a way to construct Quillen functors from simplicial sets to
any given model category. A more structured set-up studies stable frames giving
Quillen functors from spectra to stable model categories. We will investigate
how this is compatible with Bousfield localisation to gain insight into the
deeper structure of the stable homotopy category. We further show how these
techniques relate to rigidity questions and how they can be used to study
algebraic model categories.
