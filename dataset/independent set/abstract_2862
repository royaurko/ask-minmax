Natural and technological interdependent systems have been shown to be highly
vulnerable due to cascading failures and an abrupt collapse of global
connectivity under initial failure. Mitigating the risk by partial
disconnection endangers their functionality. Here we propose a systematic
strategy of selecting a minimum number of autonomous nodes that guarantee a
smooth transition in robustness. Our method which is based on betweenness is
tested on various examples including the famous 2003 electrical blackout of
Italy. We show that, with this strategy, the necessary number of autonomous
nodes can be reduced by a factor of five compared to a random choice. We also
find that the transition to abrupt collapse follows tricritical scaling
characterized by a set of exponents which is independent on the protection
strategy.
