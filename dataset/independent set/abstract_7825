This note examines linear combinations of multi-indexed sequences and derives
the multivariate generating function of such a linear combination in terms of
the original sequence's m.g.f. Applications include finding distributions and
moments of non-negative discrete random variables conditioned on non-negative
linear combinations of the original variables. Examples include independent
Poisson r.v.'s and a $d$-variate multinomial distribution.
