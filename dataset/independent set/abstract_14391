The paper is devoted to the study of the dynamical behavior of the solutions
of stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo lattice equations, driven by fractional Brownian
motions, with Hurst parameter greater than $1/2$. Under some usual
dissipativity conditions, the system considered here features different
dynamics from the same one perturbed by Brownian motion. In our case, the
random dynamical system has a unique random equilibrium, which constitutes a
singleton sets random attractor.
