The advent of the Java Card standard has been a major turning point in smart
card technology. With the growing acceptance of this standard, understanding
the performance behavior of these platforms is becoming crucial. To meet this
need, we present in this paper a novel benchmarking framework to test and
evaluate the performance of Java Card platforms. MESURE tool is the first
framework which accuracy and effectiveness are independent from the particular
Java Card platform tested and CAD used.
