We present an analysis of the deepest pure-UV observations with the highest
angular resolution ever performed, a set of 12 exposures with the HST WFPC2 and
F160BW filter obtained in parallel observing mode, which cover $\sim$12 square
arcminutes in the LMC, North of the bar and in the ``general field'' regime of
the LMC. The 341 independent measurements of 198 objects represent an
accumulated exposure of $\geq 2 10^4$ sec and reveal stars as faint as
m$_{UV}\simeq$22 mag. The observations show that $\sim 2/3$ of the UV emission
from the LMC is emitted by our HST-detected UV stars in the field, i.e., not in
clusters or associations. We identified optical counterparts in the ROE/NRL
photometric catalog for $\sim 1/3$ of the objects. The results are used to
discuss the nature of these UV sources, to estimate the diffuse UV emission
from the LMC as a prototype of dwarf galaxies, and to evaluate the
contamination by field stars of UV observations of globular and open clusters
in the LMC. We find that the projected density of UV stars in the general field
of the LMC is a few times higher than in the Galactic disk close to the Sun.
Combining our data with observations by UIT allows us to define the stellar UV
luminosity function from $m_{UV}=8$ to 18 mag, and to confirm that the field
regions in the LMC have been forming stars at a steady rate during the last 1
Gyr, with an IMF close to the Salpeter law.
