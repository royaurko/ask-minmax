Marginal likelihoods for the cosmic expansion rates are evaluated using the
`Constitution' data of 397 supernovas, thereby updating the results in some
previous works. Even when beginning with a very strong prior probability that
favors an accelerated expansion, we obtain a marginal likelihood for the
deceleration parameter $q_0$ peaked around zero in the spatially flat case. It
is also found that the new data significantly constrains the cosmographic
expansion rates, when compared to the previous analyses. These results may
strongly depend on the Gaussian prior probability distribution chosen for the
Hubble parameter represented by $h$, with $h=0.68\pm 0.06$. This and similar
priors for other expansion rates were deduced from previous data. Here again we
perform the Bayesian model-independent analysis in which the scale factor is
expanded into a Taylor series in time about the present epoch. Unlike such
Taylor expansions in terms of redshift, this approach has no convergence
problem.
