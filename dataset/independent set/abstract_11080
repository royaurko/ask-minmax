We point out that the surface integral of the Babu diagram gives non-trivial
main contribution independent of the charged lepton masses and the scale of new
physics. It can fit the experimental data on both solar and atmospheric
neutrino oscillations. However, then the coupling constants of the new Higgs
singlets with the leptons gain values smaller than that in the usual two-loop
radiative analyses. This yields distinction between our consideration on
ultraviolet-behaviors and the former based on the infrared radiative
corrections.
