The trajectory of a primary gamma-ray detected with an array of at least four
atmospheric Cherenkov imaging telescopes can be reconstructed from the shower
image centroid positions and geometrical considerations independent of the
primary energy. Using only the image centroid positions some cosmic-ray
discrimination is also possible. This minimal approach opens the possibility of
pushing the analysis threshold to lower values, close to the hardware
threshold.
