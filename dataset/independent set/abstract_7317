We introduce the concept of attainable sets of payoffs in two-player repeated
games with vector payoffs. A set of payoff vectors is called {\em attainable}
if player 1 can ensure that there is a finite horizon $T$ such that after time
$T$ the distance between the set and the cumulative payoff is arbitrarily
small, regardless of what strategy player 2 is using. This paper focuses on the
case where the attainable set consists of one payoff vector. In this case the
vector is called an attainable vector. We study properties of the set of
attainable vectors, and characterize when a specific vector is attainable and
when every vector is attainable.
