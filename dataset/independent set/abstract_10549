We report the analysis of the magnetic fluctuations in the superconducing
La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 and the related lanthanum cuprates having the different
symmetry of the low temperature structure. The NMR and ESR investigations
revealed the dynamical coexistence of the superconductivity and the
antiferromagnetic correlations in the large part of superconductivity region of
the phase diagram. We show that for all compounds, independent on their low
temperature symmetry and on their superconducting properties, the enhancement
of the spin stiffness near 1/8 doping takes place.
