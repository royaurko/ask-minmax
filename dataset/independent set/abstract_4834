Independent component analysis (ICA) is a computational method for separating
a multivariate signal into subcomponents assuming the mutual statistical
independence of the non-Gaussian source signals. The classical Independent
Components Analysis (ICA) framework usually assumes linear combinations of
independent sources over the field of realvalued numbers R. In this paper, we
investigate binary ICA for OR mixtures (bICA), which can find applications in
many domains including medical diagnosis, multi-cluster assignment, Internet
tomography and network resource management. We prove that bICA is uniquely
identifiable under the disjunctive generation model, and propose a
deterministic iterative algorithm to determine the distribution of the latent
random variables and the mixing matrix. The inverse problem concerning
inferring the values of latent variables are also considered along with noisy
measurements. We conduct an extensive simulation study to verify the
effectiveness of the propose algorithm and present examples of real-world
applications where bICA can be applied.
