Let K be an algebraically closed field endowed with a complete
non-archimedean norm with valuation ring R. Let f:Y -> X be a map of
K-affinoid varieties. In this paper we study the analytic structure of the
image f(Y) in X; such an image is a typical example of a subanalytic set. We
show that the subanalytic sets are precisely the D-semianalytic sets, where D
is the truncated division function first introduced by Denef and van den
Dries. This result is most conveniently stated as a Quantifier Elimination
result for the valuation ring R in an analytic expansion of the language of
valued fields.
