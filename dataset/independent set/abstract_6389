We show that the drift-diffusion mechanism in a normal-metal layer in
combination with the resonance electron-magnon interactions at
ferromagnet-normal interface of F-N-F heterostucture creates spatial
instability modes and, out of these modes, a quasi-stable periodic structure of
spin-transfer d.c. current can arise with certain channel step and
step-to-radius ratio. The ferromagnetic resonance conditions determine
spin-transfer current density. Independent nano-oscillators creating
intersecting arrays of channels can phase-lock on sub-micrometer distance,
which depends on multilayer geometry and applied fields. By decreasing the
layer thickness, the number of channels affected by each independent
d.c.-current source and their radius may be diminished. Phase-locking of
multiple independent nano-oscillators can be used for enhancement of output
power.
