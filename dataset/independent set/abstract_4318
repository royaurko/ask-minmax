A new class of fuzzy closed sets, namely fuzzy weakly closed set in a fuzzy
topological space is introduced and it is established that this class of fuzzy
closed sets lies between fuzzy closed sets and fuzzy generalized closed sets.
Alongwith the study of fundamental results of such closed sets, we define and
characterize fuzzy weakly compact space and fuzzy weakly closed space.
