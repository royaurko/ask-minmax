We revisit the method of kinematical endpoints for particle mass
determination, applied to the popular SUSY decay chain squark -> neutralino ->
slepton -> LSP. We analyze the uniqueness of the solutions for the mass
spectrum in terms of the measured endpoints in the observable invariant mass
distributions. We provide simple analytical inversion formulas for the masses
in terms of the measured endpoints. We show that in a sizable portion of the
SUSY mass parameter space the solutions always suffer from a two-fold
ambiguity, due to the fact that the original relations between the masses and
the endpoints are piecewise-defined functions. The ambiguity persists even in
the ideal case of a perfect detector and infinite statistics. We delineate the
corresponding dangerous regions of parameter space and identify the sets of
"twin" mass spectra. In order to resolve the ambiguity, we propose a
generalization of the endpoint method, from single-variable distributions to
two-variable distributions. In particular, we study analytically the boundaries
of the (m_{jl(lo)}, m_{jl(hi)}) and (m_{ll}, m_{jll}) distributions and prove
that their shapes are in principle sufficient to resolve the ambiguity in the
mass determination. We identify several additional independent measurements
which can be obtained from the boundary lines of these bivariate distributions.
The purely kinematical nature of our method makes it generally applicable to
any model that exhibits a SUSY-like cascade decay.
