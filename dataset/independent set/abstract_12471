In this article, we prove decorrelation estimates for the eigenvalues of a 1D
discrete tight binding model near two distinct energies in the localized
regime. Consequently, with an arbitrary, fixed number n, the asymptotic
independence for local level statistics near n distinct energies is obtained.
