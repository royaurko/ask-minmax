The first part of this article deals with theorems on uniqueness in law for
\sigma-finite and constructive countable random sets, which in contrast to the
usual assumptions may have points of accumulation. We discuss and compare two
approaches on uniqueness theorems: First, the study of generators for
\sigma-fields used in this context and, secondly, the analysis of hitting
functions. The last section of this paper deals with the notion of
constructiveness. We will prove a measurable selection theorem and a
decomposition theorem for constructive countable random sets, and study
constructive countable random sets with independent increments.
