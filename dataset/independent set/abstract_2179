PCANet was proposed as a lightweight deep learning network that mainly
leverages Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to learn multistage filter banks
and followed by binarization and block-wise histograming. PCANet was shown
worked surprisingly well in various image classification tasks. However, PCANet
is data-dependence and hence inflexible. In this paper, we proposed a
data-independence network, dubbed DCTNet for face recognition in which we adopt
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as filter banks in place of PCA. This is
motivated by the fact that 2D DCT basis is indeed a good approximation for high
ranked eigenvectors of PCA. Both 2D DCT and PCA resemble a kind of modulated
sine-wave patterns, which can be perceived as a bandpass filter bank. DCTNet is
free from learning as 2D DCT bases can be computed in advance. Besides that, we
also proposed an effective method to regulate the block-wise histogram feature
vector of DCTNet for robustness. It is shown to provide surprising performance
boost when the gallery set and probe set have extensive deviation such as faces
with different poses. We evaluate the performance of DCTNet extensively on a
number of benchmark face databases and being able to achieve on par with or
often better accuracy performance than PCANet.
