In this research a new algebraic semantics of rough set theory including
additional meta aspects is proposed. The semantics is based on enhancing the
standard rough set theory with notions of 'relative ability of subsets of
approximation spaces to approximate'. The eventual algebraic semantics is
developed via many deep results in convexity in ordered structures. A new
variation of rough set theory, namely 'ill-posed rough set theory' in which it
may suffice to know some of the approximations of sets, is eventually
introduced.
