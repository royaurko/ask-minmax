In preceding papers of this series, TF relations for galaxies in 24 clusters
with radial velocities between 1000 and 9200 km/s (SCI sample) were obtained, a
Tully-Fisher (TF) template relation was constructed and mean offsets of each
cluster with respect to the template obtained. Here, an estimate of the
line-of-sight peculiar velocities of the clusters and their associated errors
are given. It is found that cluster peculiar velocities in the Cosmic Microwave
Background reference frame do not exceed 600 k/ms and that their distribution
has a line-of-sight dispersion of 300 k/ms, suggesting a more quiescent cluster
peculiar velocity field than previously reported. When measured in a reference
frame in which the Local Group is at rest, the set of clusters at cz > 3000
km/s exhibits a dipole moment in agreement with that of the CMB, both in
amplitude and apex direction. It is estimated that the bulk flow of a sphere of
6000 km/s radius in the CMB reference frame is between 140 and 320 km/s. These
results are in agreement with those obtained from an independent sample of
field galaxies (Giovanelli et al. 1998; see astro-ph/9807274)
