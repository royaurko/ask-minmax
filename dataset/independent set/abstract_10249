For any non-negative integer v we construct explicitly [v/2]+1 independent
covariant bilinear differential operators from J_{k,m} x J_{k',m'} to
J_{k+k'+v,m+m'}. As an application we construct a covariant bilinear
differential operator mapping S_k^{(2)} x S^{(2)}_{k'} to S^{(2)}_{k+k'+v}.
Here J_{k,m} denotes the space of Jacobi forms of weight k and index m and
S^{(2)}_k the space of Siegel modular forms of degree 2 and weight k. The
covariant bilinear differential operators constructed are analogous to
operators already studied in the elliptic case by R. Rankin and H. Cohen and we
call them Rankin-Cohen operators.
