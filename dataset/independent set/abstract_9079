By considering clans as genuine elementary subprocesses, i.e., intermediate
parton sources in the Simplified Parton Shower model, a generalized version of
this model is defined. It predicts analytically clan properties at parton level
in agreement with the general trends observed experimentally at hadronic level
and in Monte Carlo simulations both at partonic and hadronic level. In
particular the model shows a linear rising in rapidity of the average number of
clans at fixed energy of the initial parton and its subsequent bending for
rapidity intervals at the border of phase space, and approximate energy
independence of the average number of clans in fixed rapidity intervals. The
energy independence becomes stricter by properly normalizing the average number
of clans.
