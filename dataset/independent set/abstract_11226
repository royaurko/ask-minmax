We give bounds on the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the symmetric
simple exclusion process in $\Z^d$. Our results include the existent results in
the literature. We get better bounds and larger class of initial states via a
unified approach. The method includes a comparison of the evolution of n
interacting particles with n independent ones along the whole time trajectory.
