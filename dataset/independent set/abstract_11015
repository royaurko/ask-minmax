We study the gauge covariance of the massive fermion propagator in three as
well as four dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). Starting from its value
at the lowest order in perturbation theory, we evaluate a non-perturbative
expression for it by means of its Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin (LKF)
transformation. We compare the perturbative expansion of our findings with the
known one loop results and observe perfect agreement upto a gauge parameter
independent term, a difference permitted by the structure of the LKF
transformations.
