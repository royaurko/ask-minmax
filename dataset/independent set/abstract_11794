We show that spin transfer torque from direct spin-polarized current applied
parallel to a magnetic domain wall (DW) induces DW motion in a direction
independent of the current polarity. This unidirectional response of the DW to
spin torque enables DW pumping: long-range DW displacement driven by
alternating current. Our numerical simulations reveal that DW pumping can be
resonantly amplified through excitation of internal degrees of freedom of the
DW by the current.
