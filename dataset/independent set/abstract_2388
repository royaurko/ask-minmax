We consider a class of models predicting new heavy neutral fermionic states,
whose mixing with the light neutrinos can be naturally significant and produce
observable effects below the threshold for their production. We update the
indirect limits on the flavour non-diagonal mixing parameters that can be
derived from unitarity, and show that significant rates are in general expected
for one-loop-induced rare processes due to the exchange of virtual heavy
neutrinos, involving the violation of the muon and electron lepton numbers. In
particular, the amplitudes for $\mu$--$e$ conversion in nuclei and for $\mu\to
ee^+e^-$ show a non-decoupling quadratic dependence on the heavy neutrino mass
$M$, while $\mu\to e\gamma$ is almost independent of the heavy scale above the
electroweak scale. These three processes are then used to set stringent
constraints on the flavour-violating mixing angles. In all the cases
considered, we point out explicitly that the non-decoupling behaviour is
strictly related to the spontaneous breaking of the SU(2) symmetry.
