We propose a new method for detecting paired states in either bosonic or
fermionic systems using interference experiments with independent or weakly
coupled low dimensional systems. We demonstrate that our method can be used to
detect both the FFLO and the d-wave paired states of fermions, as well as
quasicondensates of singlet pairs for polar F=1 atoms in two dimensional
systems. We discuss how this method can be used to perform phase-sensitive
determination of the symmetry of the pairing amplitude.
