The second contributor has introduced non-crossing tableaux, objects whose
non-nesting analogues are semi-standard Young tableaux. We relate non-crossing
tableaux to Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns and develop the non-crossing analogue of
standard monomial theory. Leclerc and Zelevinsky's weakly separated sets are
special cases of non-crossing tableaux, and we suggest that non-crossing
tableaux may help illuminate the theory of weakly separated sets.
