The purpose of this paper is to propose the use of models, theories and laws
in bibliometrics and scientometrics to enhance information retrieval processes,
especially ranking. A common pattern in many man-made data sets is Lotka's Law
which follows the well-known power-law distributions. These informetric
distributions can be used to give an alternative order to large and scattered
result sets and can be applied as a new ranking mechanism. The
polyrepresentation of information in Digital Library systems is used to enhance
the retrieval quality, to overcome the drawbacks of the typical term-based
ranking approaches and to enable users to explore retrieved document sets from
a different perspective.
