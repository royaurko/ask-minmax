We apply analytic perturbation theory to the Gross--Llewellyn Smith sum rule.
We study the $Q^2$ evolution and the renormalization scheme dependence of the
analytic three-loop QCD correction to this sum rule, and demonstrate that the
results are practically renormalization scheme independent and lead to rather
different $Q^2$ evolution than the standard perturbative correction possesses.
