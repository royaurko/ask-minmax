The application of the background-field method to the electroweak Standard
Model is reviewed and further explored. Special emphasis is put on questions of
gauge invariance and gauge-parameter (in-)dependence. Owing to the gauge
invariance of the background-field effective action, the vertex functions obey
simple Ward identities which imply important properties of the vertex
functions. Carrying out the renormalization in a way respecting
background-field gauge invariance leads to considerable simplifications. The
generalization of the background-field method to the non-linear realization of
the scalar sector of the Standard Model is illustrated. Furthermore, the
interplay between gauge independence of the S-matrix and Ward identities of
vertex functions is investigated. Finally, the Standard Model contributions to
the $S$, $T$, and $U$ parameters are calculated and discussed within the
background-field method.
