We constrain Galactic foreground contamination of the Python V cosmic
microwave background anisotropy data by cross correlating it with foreground
contaminant emission templates. To model foreground emission we use 100 and 12
$\mu$m dust emission templates and two point source templates based on the PMN
survey. The analysis takes account of inter-modulation correlations in 8
modulations of the data that are sensitive to a large range of angular scales
and also densely sample a large area of sky. As a consequence the analysis here
is highly constraining. We find little evidence for foreground contamination in
an analysis of the whole data set. However, there is indication that
foregrounds are present in the data from the larger-angular-scale modulations
of those Python V fields that overlap the region scanned earlier by the UCSB
South Pole 1994 experiment. This is an independent consistency cross-check of
findings from the South Pole 1994 data.
