We present a procedure to enumerate the whole set of numerical semigroups
with a given Frobenius number F, S(F). The methodology is based on the
construction of a partition of S(F) by a congruence relation. We identify
exactly one irreducible and one homogeneous numerical semigroup at each class
in the relation, and from those two elements we reconstruct the whole class. An
alternative more efficient method is proposed based on the use of the
Kunz-coordinates vectors of the elements in S(F).
