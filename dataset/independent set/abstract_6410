In the three dimensional flat space any classical Hamiltonian, which has five
functionally independent integrals of motion, including the Hamiltonian, is
characterized as superintegrable. Kalnins, Kress and Miller have proved that,
in the case of non degenerate potentials, i.e potentials depending linearly on
four parameters, with quadratic symmetries, posses a sixth quadratic integral,
which is linearly independent of the other integrals. The existence of this
sixth integral imply that the integrals of motion form a ternary
parafermionic-like quadratic Poisson algebra with five generators. The Kepler
Coulomb potential that was introduced by Verrier and Evans is a special case of
superintegrable system, having two independent integrals of motion of fourth
order among the remaining quadratic ones. The corresponding Poisson algebra of
integrals is a quadratic one, having the same special form, characteristic to
the non degenerate case of systems with quadratic integrals.
