We give two independent arguments why the classical membrane fields should be
loops. The first argument comes from how we may construct selfdual strings in
the M5 brane from a loop space version of the Nahm equations. The second
argument is that there appears to be no infinite set of finite-dimensional Lie
algebras (such as $su(N)$ for any $N$) that satisfies the algebraic structure
of the membrane theory.
