Inspired by our previous finding that supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons
(SYM-CS) theory dimensionally reduced to 1+1 dimensions possesses approximate
Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states, we study the analogous phenomenon
in the three-dimensional theory. Approximate BPS states in two dimensions have
masses which are nearly independent of the Yang-Mills coupling and proportional
to their average number of partons. These states are a reflection of the
exactly massless BPS states of the underlying pure SYM theory. In three
dimensions we find that this mechanism leads to anomalously light bound states.
While the mass scale is still proportional to the average number of partons
times the square of the CS coupling, the average number of partons in these
bound states changes with the Yang-Mills coupling. Therefore, the masses of
these states are not independent of the coupling. Our numerical calculations
are done using supersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ).
