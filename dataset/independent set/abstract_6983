We provide a framework for studying randomly coloured point sets in a locally
compact, second-countable space on which a metrisable unimodular group acts
continuously and properly. We first construct and describe an appropriate
dynamical system for uniformly discrete uncoloured point sets. For point sets
of finite local complexity, we characterise ergodicity geometrically in terms
of pattern frequencies. The general framework allows to incorporate a random
colouring of the point sets. We derive an ergodic theorem for randomly coloured
point sets with finite-range dependencies. Special attention is paid to the
exclusion of exceptional instances for uniquely ergodic systems. The setup
allows for a straightforward application to randomly coloured graphs.
