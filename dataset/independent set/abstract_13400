A strong excess in a form of a wide peak in the energy range of 300-800 GeV
was discovered in the first measurements of the electron spectrum in the energy
range from 20 GeV to 3 TeV by the balloon-borne experiment ATIC (J. Chang et
al. Nature, 2008). The experimental data processing and analysis of the
electron spectrum with different criteria for selection of electrons,
completely independent of the results reported in (J. Chang et al. Nature,
2008) is employed in the present paper. The new independent analysis generally
confirms the results of (J. Chang et al. Nature, 2008), but shows that the
spectrum in the region of the excess is represented by a number of narrow
peaks. The measured spectrum is compared to the spectrum of (J. Chang et al.
Nature, 2008) and to the spectrum of the Fermi/LAT experiment.
