The model-independent formalism is constructed to describe decays of mixed
particles without using the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation. Limitations due to
various symmetries are traced for neutral $K-$mesons. As an application we show
that effects of $CPT-$violation and going beyond WWA may be separated and
studied independently.
