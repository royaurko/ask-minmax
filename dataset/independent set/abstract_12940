The magnetic moments of heavy sextet $J^P = {1\over 2}^+$ baryons are
calculated in framework of the light cone QCD sum rules method. Linearly
independent relations among the magnetic moments of these baryons are obtained.
The results for the magnetic moments of heavy baryons obtained in this work are
compared with the predictions of the other approaches.
