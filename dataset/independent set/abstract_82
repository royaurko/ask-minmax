A bicolored rectangular family BRF is a collection of all axis-parallel
rectangles contained in a given region Z of the plane formed by selecting a
bottom-left corner from a set A and an upper-right corner from a set B. We
prove that the maximum independent set and the minimum hitting set of a BRF
have the same cardinality and devise polynomial time algorithms to compute
both. As a direct consequence, we obtain the first polynomial time algorithm to
compute minimum biclique covers, maximum cross-free matchings and jump numbers
in a class of bipartite graphs that significantly extends convex bipartite
graphs and interval bigraphs. We also establish several connections between our
work and other seemingly unrelated problems. Furthermore, when the bicolored
rectangular family is weighted, we show that the problem of finding the maximum
weight of an independent set is NP-hard, and provide efficient algorithms to
solve it on certain subclasses.
