We study the set of Dedekind cuts over a linearly ordered Abelian group as a
structure over the language (0,<,+,-). Moreover, we obtain a simple set of
axioms for the universal part of the theory of such structures. Finally, we
prove that every structure satisfying the given axioms is a sub-structure of
the set of cuts over a suitable group.
