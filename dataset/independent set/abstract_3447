In this paper we study incremental stability and convergence of switched
(bimodal) Filippov systems via contraction analysis. In particular, we use
regularization to derive sufficient conditions for convergence of any two
trajectories of the Filippov system between each other within some region of
interest. By using results on regularization of switched dynamical systems, we
obtain conditions to ensure the Filippov system is contracting: namely that
both modes of the system should be contracting and that the difference of the
two modes evaluated at the switching manifold $\Sigma$ should verify an
additional condition. Significantly, our conditions hold independent of the
dynamics that are imposed on $\Sigma$. We then apply these conditions to the
study of different classes of Filippov system including piecewise affine (PWA)
systems, relay feedback systems and piecewise smooth (PWS) systems. We show
that the conditions allow the system to be studied in metrics other than the
Euclidean norm. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical
simulations on a set of representative examples that confirm their
effectiveness and ease of application.
