We derive traffic rule for spectral networks for A_2 theory for Riemann
surface with punctures and use it to study in details the moduli space M of
flat GL(3,C) connections on P^1 with 3 full punctures. We apply the simplified
traffic rule to find the global description of M as the fibration with
symplectic fibers and to study the space of line defects in 4d theory
corresponding to the conformal point in the base of M. We define higher
web-like structures, not previously discussed in the literature. They give rise
to line defects independent of the defects corresponding to the traces of
holonomies.
