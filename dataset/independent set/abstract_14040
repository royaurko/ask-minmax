Let $K$ be a prime knot in $S^3$ and $G(K)=\pi_1(S^3-K)$ the knot group. We
write $K_1 \geq K_2$ if there exists a surjective homomorphism from $G(K_1)$
onto $G(K_2)$. In this paper, we determine this partial order on the set of
prime knots with up to 11 crossings. There exist such 801 prime knots and then
$640,800$ should be considered. The existence of a surjective homomorphism can
be proved by constructing it explicitly. On the other hand, the non-existence
of a surjective homomorphism can be proved by the Alexander polynomial and the
twisted Alexander polynomial. This work is an extension of the result of
\cite{KS1}.
