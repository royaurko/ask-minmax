We present a search for excited neutrinos using e^-p data taken by the H1
experiment at HERA at a center-of-mass energy of 318 GeV with an integrated
luminosity of 15 pb-1. No evidence for excited neutrino production is found.
Mass dependent exclusion limits are determined for the ratio of the coupling to
the compositeness scale, f/Lambda, independently of the relative couplings to
the SU(2) and U(1) gauge bosons. These limits extend the excluded region to
higher masses than has been possible in previous searches at other colliders.
