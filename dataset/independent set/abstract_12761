The purpose of the present paper consists in proposing and discussing a
double probabilistic representation for a porous media equation in the whole
space perturbed by a multiplicative colored noise. For almost all random
realizations $\omega$, one associates a stochastic differential equation in law
with random coefficients, driven by an independent Brownian motion. The key
ingredient is a uniqueness lemma for a linear SPDE of Fokker-Planck type with
measurable bounded (possibly degenerated) random coefficients.
