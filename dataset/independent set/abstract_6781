We show a general theorem of existence of temporal foliations in a general
causal set, under mild constraints. Then we study automorphisms of infinite
causal sets (which satisfy further requirements) and show that they fall under
one of two types:
  1) Automorphims that induce automorphisms of spacelike hypersurfaces in some
given foliation (i.e. spacelike automorphisms), or
  2) Translation in time.
  These results might be useful for quantization of the aforementioned causal
sets.
