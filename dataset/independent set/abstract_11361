We consider the invariance principle without the classical condition of
asymptotic negligibility of individual terms. More precisely, we explore the
difference of the following two distributions in the space C (of continuous
functions on [0,1]). The first is the distribution of the continuous piecewise
linear partial-sum process generated by a sequence of independent random
variables, and the second is the distribution of the similar process generated
by the sequence of normal r.v.'s with the same first two moments. The novelty
is that the condition of negligibility of the r.v.'s is not imposed. We
establish a necessary and sufficient condition of the weak convergence of the
difference mentioned to zero measure in C.
