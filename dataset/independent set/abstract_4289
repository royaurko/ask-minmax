R-trees can be used to store and query sets of point data in two or more
dimensions. An easy way to construct and maintain R-trees for two-dimensional
points, due to Kamel and Faloutsos, is to keep the points in the order in which
they appear along the Hilbert curve. The R-tree will then store bounding boxes
of points along contiguous sections of the curve, and the efficiency of the
R-tree depends on the size of the bounding boxes---smaller is better. Since
there are many different ways to generalize the Hilbert curve to higher
dimensions, this raises the question which generalization results in the
smallest bounding boxes. Familiar methods, such as the one by Butz, can result
in curve sections whose bounding boxes are a factor $\Omega(2^{d/2})$ larger
than the volume traversed by that section of the curve. Most of the volume
bounded by such bounding boxes would not contain any data points. In this paper
we present a new way of generalizing Hilbert's curve to higher dimensions,
which results in much tighter bounding boxes: they have at most 4 times the
volume of the part of the curve covered, independent of the number of
dimensions. Moreover, we prove that a factor 4 is asymptotically optimal.
