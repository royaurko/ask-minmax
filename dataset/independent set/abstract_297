A random intersection graph is constructed by independently assigning a
subset of a given set of objects $W,$ to each vertex of the vertex set $V$ of a
simple graph $G.$ There is an edge between two vertices of $V,$ iff their
respective subsets(in $W$,) have at least one common element. The strong
threshold for the connectivity between any two arbitrary vertices of vertex set
$V,$ is derived. Also we determine the almost sure probability bounds for the
vertex degree of a typical vertex of graph $G.$
