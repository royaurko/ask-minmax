Let f be a transcendental entire function in the Eremenko-Lyubich class B. We
give a lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set of f that
depends on the growth of f. This estimate is best possible and is obtained by
proving a more general result concerning the size of the escaping set of a
function with a logarithmic tract.
