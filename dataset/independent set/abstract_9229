We present a measurement of pi-\pi+, K-/K+ and pbar/p from p+p collisions at
sqrt(s) = 20 0GeV over the rapidity range 0<y<3.4. For pT < 2.0 GeV/c we see no
significant transverse momentum dependence of the ratios. All three ratios are
independent of rapidity for y ~< 1.5 and then steadily decline from y ~ 1.5 to
y ~ 3. The pi-\pi+ ratio is below unity for y > 2.0. The pbar/p ratio is very
similar for p+p and 20% central Au+Au collisions at all rapidities. In the
fragmentation region the three ratios seem to be independent of beam energy
when viewed from the rest frame of one of the protons. Theoretical models based
on quark-diquark breaking mechanisms overestimate the pbar/p ratio up to y ~<
3. Including additional mechanisms for baryon number transport such as baryon
junctions leads to a better description of the data.
