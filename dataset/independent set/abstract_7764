We study the large-time behavior of the charged-polymer Hamiltonian $H_n$ of
Kantor and Kardar [Bernoulli case] and Derrida, Griffiths, and Higgs [Gaussian
case], using strong approximations to Brownian motion. Our results imply, among
other things, that in one dimension the process $\{H_{[nt]}\}_{0\le t\le 1}$
behaves like a Brownian motion, time-changed by the intersection local-time
process of an independent Brownian motion. Chung-type LILs are also discussed.
