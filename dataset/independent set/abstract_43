A subset X of the Cantor space, 2^\omega, is a lambda-prime-set iff for every
countable subset Y of the Cantor space Y is relatively G-delta in X union Y. In
this paper we prove two forcing results about lambda-prime-sets. First we show
that it is consistent that every lambda-prime-set is a gamma-set. Secondly we
show that is independent whether or not every dagger-lambda-set is a
lambda-prime-set.
