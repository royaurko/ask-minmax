Effective field theory allows for a systematic and model-independent
derivation of the forces between nucleons in harmony with the symmetries of
Quantum Chromodynamics. We review the foundations of this approach and discuss
its application for light nuclei at various resolution scales. The extension of
this approach to many-body systems is briefly sketched.
