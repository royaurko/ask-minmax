Staggered fading pattern between different users is crucial to interference
alignment without CSIT, or so-called blind interference alignment (BIA). This
special fading structure naturally arises from heterogeneous block fading
setting, in which different users experience independent block fading with
different coherent times. Jafar et al. prove that BIA can be applied in some
special heterogeneous block fading channels, which are formed naturally or
constructed artificially. In this paper, we show that in the context of a
2-user 2x1 broadcasting (BC) channel, staggered fading pattern can also be
found in homogeneous block fading setting, in which both users experience
independent fading with the same coherent time; and we propose a scheme to
achieve the optimal 4/3 DoF for the homogenous setting by using BIA. Applying
the proposed scheme, we further study a 2x1 BC network with K users undergoing
homogeneous block fading. When K>=4, we show it is almost guaranteed that the
transmitter can find two users among the K users to form a 2-user 2x1 BC
channel which can apply BIA.
