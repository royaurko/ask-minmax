We characterize the corings whose category of comodules has a generating set
of small projective comodules in terms of the (non commutative) descent theory.
In order to extricate the structure of these corings, we give a generalization
of the notions of comatrix coring and Galois comodule which avoid finiteness
conditions. A sufficient condition for a coring to be isomorphic to an infinite
comatrix coring is found. We deduce in particular that any coalgebra over a
field and the coring associated to a group-graded ring are isomorphic to
adequate infinite comatrix corings. We also characterize when the free module
canonically associated to a (not necessarily finite) set of group like elements
is Galois.
