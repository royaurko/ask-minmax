The properties of a fictitious, fermionic, many-body system based on the
complex zeros of the Riemann zeta function are studied. The imaginary part of
the zeros are interpreted as mean-field single-particle energies, and one fills
them up to a Fermi energy $E_F$. The distribution of the total energy is shown
to be non-Gaussian, asymmetric, and independent of $E_F$ in the limit
$E_F\to\infty$. The moments of the limit distribution are computed
analytically. The autocorrelation function, the finite energy corrections, and
a comparison with random matrix theory are also discussed.
