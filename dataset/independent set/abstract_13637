We construct a QFT for the Thirring model for any value of the mass in a
functional integral approach, by proving that a set of Grassmann integrals
converges, as the cutoffs are removed and for a proper choice of the bare
parameters, to a set of Schwinger functions verifying the Osterwalder-Schrader
axioms. The corresponding Ward Identities have anomalies which are not linear
in the coupling and which violate the anomaly non-renormalization property.
Additional anomalies are present in the closed equation for the interacting
propagator, obtained by combining a Schwinger-Dyson equation with Ward
Identities.
