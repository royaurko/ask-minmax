Polarization observables for the reaction $\bar p+p\to e^++e^-$ are given in
terms of three independent complex amplitudes, in presence of two photon
exchange. General expressions for the differential cross section and the
polarization observables are given and model independent properties are
derived. Polarization effects depending on the polarization of the antiproton
beam, the target and of the electron in the final state, have been calculated.
