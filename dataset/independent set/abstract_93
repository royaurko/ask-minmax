This paper reports the values of contributions to the electron g-2 from 300
Feynman diagrams of the gauge-invariant Set III(a) and 450 Feynman diagrams of
the gauge-invariant Set III(b). The evaluation is carried out in two versions.
Version A is to start from the sixth-order magnetic anomaly M_6 obtained in the
previous work. The mass-independent contributions of Set III(a) and Set III(b)
are 2.1275 (2) and 3.3271 (6) in units of (alpha/pi)^5, respectively. Version B
is based on the recently-developed automatic code generation scheme. This
method yields 2.1271 (3) and 3.3271 (8) in units of (alpha/pi)^5, respectively.
They are in excellent agreement with the results of the first method within the
uncertainties of numerical integration. Combining these results as
statistically independent we obtain the best values, 2.1273 (2), and 3.3271 (5)
times (alpha/pi)^5, for the mass-independent contributions of the Set III(a)
and Set III(b), respectively. We have also evaluated mass-dependent
contributions of diagrams containing muon and/or tau-particle loop. Including
them the total contribution of Set III(a) is 2.1349 (2) and that of Set III(b)
is 3.3299 (5) in units of (alpha/pi)^5. The total contributions to the muon g-2
of various leptonic vacuum-polarization loops of Set III(a) and Set III(b) are
112.418 (32) and 15.407 (5) in units of (alpha/pi)^5, respectively.
