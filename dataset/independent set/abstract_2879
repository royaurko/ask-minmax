The unique optoelectronic properties of graphene [1] make it an ideal
platform for a variety of photonic applications [2], including fast
photodetectors [3], transparent electrodes [4], optical modulators [5], and
ultra-fast lasers [6]. Owing to its high carrier mobility, gapless spectrum,
and frequency-independent absorption coefficient, it has been recognized as a
very promising element for the development of detectors and modulators
operating in the Terahertz (THz) region of the electromagnetic spectrum
(wavelengths in the hundreds of micrometers range), which is still severely
lacking in terms of solid-state devices. Here we demonstrate efficient THz
detectors based on antenna-coupled graphene field-effect transistors (FETs).
These exploit the non-linear FET response to the oscillating radiation field at
the gate electrode, with contributions of thermoelectric and photoconductive
origin. We demonstrate room temperature (RT) operation at 0.3 THz, with noise
equivalent power (NEP) levels < 30 nW/Hz^(1/2), showing that our devices are
well beyond a proof-of-concept phase and can already be used in a realistic
setting, enabling large area, fast imaging of macroscopic samples.
