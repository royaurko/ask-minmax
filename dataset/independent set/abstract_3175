If dark matter is dissipative then the distribution of dark matter within
galactic halos can be governed by dissipation, heating and hydrostatic
equilibrium. Previous work has shown that a specific model, in the framework of
mirror dark matter, can explain several empirical galactic scaling relations.
It is shown here that this dynamical halo model implies a quasi-isothermal dark
matter density, $\rho (r) = \rho_0 r_0^2/(r^2 + r_0^2)$, where the core radius,
$r_0$, scales with disk scale length, $r_D$, via $r_0/{\rm kpc} =
1.4\left(r_D/{\rm kpc}\right)$. Additionally, the product $\rho_0 r_0$ is
roughly $constant$, i.e. independent of galaxy size (the $constant$ is set by
the parameters of the model). The derived dark matter density profile implies
that the galactic rotation velocity satisfies the Tully-Fisher relation, $L_B
\propto v^{3}_{max}$, where $v_{max}$ is the maximal rotational velocity.
Examples of rotation curves resulting from this dynamics are given.
