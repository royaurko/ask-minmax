We discuss a model of protein conformations where conformations are
combinations of short fragments from some small set. For these fragments we
consider a distribution of frequencies of occurrence of pairs (sequence of
amino acids, conformation), averaged over some balls in the spaces of sequences
and conformations. These frequencies can be estimated due to smallness of the
epsilon-entropy of the set of conformations of protein fragments.
  We consider statistical potentials for protein fragments which describe the
mentioned frequencies of occurrence and discuss model of free energy of a
protein where the free energy is equal to a sum of statistical potentials of
the fragments.
  We also consider contribution of contacts of fragments to the energy of
protein conformation, and contribution from statistical potentials of some
hierarchical set of larger protein fragments. This set of fragments is
constructed using the distribution of frequencies of occurrence of short
fragments. We discuss analogy between this approach and deep learning methods.
  We discuss applications of this model to problem of prediction of the native
conformation of a protein from its primary structure and to description of
dynamics of a protein.
