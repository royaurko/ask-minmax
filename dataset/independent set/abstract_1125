Let X be a countably infinite set of real numbers and let Y_x, x \in X, be an
independent family of stationary random subsets of the real numbers, e.g.
homogeneous Poisson point processes. We give criteria for the a.s. existence of
various "regular" functions f with the property that f(x) \in Y_x for all x \in
X. Several open questions are posed.
