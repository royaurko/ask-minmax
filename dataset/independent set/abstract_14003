We show that a natural isomorphism between the rational cohomology groups of
the two zero-dimensional Hilbert schemes of $n$-points of two surfaces, the
affine plane minus the axes and the cotangent bundle of an elliptic curve,
exchanges the weight filtration on the first set of cohomology groups with the
perverse Leray filtration associated with a natural fibration on the second set
of cohomology groups. We discuss some associated hard Lefschetz phenomena.
