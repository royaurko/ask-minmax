The well-known M4 processes of Smith and Weissman are very flexible models
for asymptotically dependent multivariate data. Extended M4 of Heffernan
\emph{et al.} allows to also account for asymptotic independence. In this paper
we introduce a more general multivariate model comprising asymptotic dependence
and independence, which has the extended M4 class as a particular case. We
study properties of the proposed model. In particular, we compute the
multivariate extremal index, tail dependence and extremal coefficients.
