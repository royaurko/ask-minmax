It is shown that statistical properties of developed hydrodynamic turbulence
are characterized by an infinite set of independent anomalous exponents which
describes the scaling behavior of hydrodynamic fields constructed from the
second and larger powers of the velocity derivatives. A physical mechanism
responsible for anomalous scaling, ``telescopic multi-step eddy interaction",
is discovered and investigated. The essence of this mechanism is the existence
of a very large number $(R/\eta)^{\Delta_j}\gg 1$ of channels of interaction of
large eddies of scale $R$ in the inertial interval with eddies of viscous scale
$\eta$ via a set of eddies of all intermediate scales between $R$ and $\eta$.
The description of this mechanism based on the NS equation in the quasi
Lagrangian representation is presented. In the diagrammatic expansion of the
correlation function of the energy dissipation field $K_ {\varepsilon
\varepsilon}(R)$, we have found an infinite series of logarithmically diverging
diagrams. Their summation leads to a renormalization of the normal
Kolmogorov-41 dimensions. For a description of the scaling of various
hydrodynamic fields an infinite set of primary fields $O_n$ with independent
scaling exponents $\Delta_n$ was introduced. We have proposed a symmetry
classification of the fields $O_n$ enabling one to predict relations between
scaling the behavior of different correlation functions.
