We review the prospects for discovering supersymmetric dark matter in a
recently proposed set of post-LEP supersymmetric benchmark scenarios. We
consider direct detection through spin-independent nuclear scattering, as well
as indirect detection through relic annihilations to neutrinos, photons, and
positrons. We find that several of the benchmark scenarios offer good prospects
for direct detection through spin-independent nuclear scattering, as well as
indirect detection through muons produced by neutrinos from relic annihilations
in the Sun, and photons from annihilations in the galactic center.
