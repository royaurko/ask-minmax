Taylors Law (TL) describes the scaling relationship between the mean and
variance of populations as a power-law. TL is widely observed in ecological
systems across space and time with exponents varying largely between 1 and 2.
Many ecological explanations have been proposed for TL but it is also commonly
observed outside ecology. We propose that TL arises from the constraining
influence of two primary variables: the number of individuals and the number of
censuses or sites. We show that most possible configurations of individuals
among censuses or sites produce the power-law form of TL with exponents between
1 and 2. This feasible set approach suggests that TL is a statistical pattern
driven by two constraints, providing an a priori explanation for this
ubiquitous pattern. However, the exact form of any specific mean-variance
relationship cannot be predicted in this way, i.e., this approach does a poor
job of predicting variation in the exponent, suggesting that TL may still
contain ecological information.
