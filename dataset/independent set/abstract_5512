We discuss the dynamics of an arbitrary semigroup of transcendental entire
functions using Fatou-Julia theory and provide some condition for the complete
invariance of escaping set and Julia set of transcendental semigroups. Some
results on limit functions and postsingular set have been discussed. A class of
hyperbolic transcendental semigroups and semigroups having no wandering domains
have also been provided.
