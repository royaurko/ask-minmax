Frankl's union-closed sets conjecture states that in every finite
union-closed set of sets, there is an element that is contained in at least
half of the member-sets (provided there are at least two members). The
conjecture has an equivalent formulation in terms of graphs: In every bipartite
graph with least one edge, both colour classes contain a vertex belonging to at
most half of the maximal stable sets.
  We prove that, for every fixed edge-probability, almost every random
bipartite graph almost satisfies Frankl's conjecture.
