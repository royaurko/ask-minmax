For extra-large Coxeter systems (m(s,r)>3), we construct a natural and
explicit set of Soergel bimodules D={D_w}_{w\in W} such that each D_w contains
as a direct summand (or is equal to) the indecomposable Soergel bimodule B_w.
When decategorified, we prove that D gives rise to a set {d_w}_{w\in W} that is
actually a basis of the Hecke algebra. This basis is close to the
Kazhdan-Lusztig basis and satisfies a ``positivity condition''.
