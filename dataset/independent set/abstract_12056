We study N=8 supergravity deformed by the presence of the candidate
counterterms. We show that even though they are invariant under undeformed
E{7(7)}, all of the candidate counterterms violate the deformed E{7(7)} current
conservation. The same conclusion follows from the uniqueness of the Lorentz
and SU(8) covariant, E{7(7)} invariant unitarity constraint expressing the
56-dimensional E{7(7)} doublet via 28 independent vectors. Therefore E{7(7)}
duality predicts the all-loop UV finiteness of perturbative N=8 supergravity.
