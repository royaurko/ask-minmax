We present new hairy black hole solutions of su(N) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory
(EYM) in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (adS) space. These black holes are
described by N+1 independent parameters, and have N-1 independent gauge field
degrees of freedom. Solutions in which all gauge field functions have no zeros
exist for all N, and for sufficiently large (and negative) cosmological
constant. At least some of these solutions are shown to be stable under
classical, linear, spherically symmetric perturbations. Therefore there is no
upper bound on the amount of stable gauge field hair with which a black hole in
adS can be endowed.
