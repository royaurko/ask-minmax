The usual composition rule of independent systems, as applied to decoherent
histories or to linearly positive histories, requires (at least) medium
decoherence and, consequently, a second constraint for the linearly positive
histories of Goldstein and Page. Other plausible classical features, valid for
medium decoherence, seem anyhow to be missed by linear positive histories.
