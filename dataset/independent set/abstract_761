By a result of Heinrich, Novak, Wasilkowski and Wo\'zniakowski the inverse of
the star discrepancy $n(d,\varepsilon)$ satisfies $n(d,\varepsilon)\leq
c_{\abs}d\varepsilon^{-2}$. Equivalently for any $N$ and $d$ there exists a set
of $N$ points in $[0,1)^d$ with star discrepacny bounded by
$\sqrt{c_{\abs}\cdot d/N}$. They actually proved that a set of independent
uniformly distributed random points satisfies this upper bound with positive
probability. Although Aistleitner and Hofer later refined this result by
proving a precise value of $c_{\abs}$ depending on the probability with which
the inequality holds, so far there is no general construction for such a set of
points known. In this paper we consider the sequence $(x_n)_{n\geq 1}=(\langle
2^{n-1}x_1\rangle)_{n\geq 1}$ for a uniformly distributed point $x_1\in
[0,1)^d$ and prove that the star discrepancy is bounded by
$C\sqrt{d\log_2d/N}$. The precise value of $C$ depends on the probability with
which this upper bound holds.
