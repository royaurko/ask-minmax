It is proved that the associative differential graded algebra of (polynomial)
polyvector fields on a vector space (may be infinite- dimensional) is
quasi-isomorphic to the corresponding cohomological Hochschild complex of
(polynomial) functions on this vector space as an associative differential
graded algebra. This result is an $A_\infty$-version of the Formality
conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich [K].
