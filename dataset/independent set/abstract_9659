Giant foxtail (Setaria faberi) seeds differ in requirements for germination.
Variable germinability arises during seed development under the influence of
genotype, environment and parent plant. Giant foxtail seed germination has been
shown to be regulated by independent asynchronous or dependent synchronous
action of seed structures. To gain better insight into the process, germination
was divided into axis specific embryo growth categories or states. Three states
were defined for each embryonic axis. The degree of embryo growth (germination
state) after eight to twelve days under germination conditions is believed to
reveal the germinability state (potential for germination) possessed by the
seed before germination. The embryo axes behave independently, which allows any
combination of germination states to occur. In general, the greater the
difference in germination between the axes, the less likely the combination of
states will occur. Photographic evidence of each germination state is shown for
caryopses and seed. Seed with a variety of germinability states is a strategy
for surviving variable environments.
