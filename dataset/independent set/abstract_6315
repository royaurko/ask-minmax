Canonical analysis leading to formal quantisation of the higher derivative
theories are considered. The first order formalism is adopted where all the
configuration space variables along with their higher time derivatives are
considered to be independent fields. A systematic algorithm of abstracting the
independent gauge symmetries is developed which is an extension of the method
developed by Banerjee et al. for the usual first order theories. For the
massive relativistic particle model with curvature, we solve the mismatch in
the no of independent gauge parameters and no of independent primary fist class
constarints. In addition, we show a direct connection between the gauge
symmetry and the $W_3$-algebra for the rigid relativistic particle. Also, BRST
symmetries for both the massive and massless particle models have been
considered and its connection to $W_3$-algebras is demonstrated. The exact
mapping of this gauge symmetry is shown with the reparametrisation invariance.
Different models from field theory, gravity and membrane theory have been
considered as illustrative examples from a new perspective to clarify many not
so adequately addressed issues.
