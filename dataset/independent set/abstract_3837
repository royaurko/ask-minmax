The exclusive electroproduction process $\vec{e}p \to e^\prime n \pi^+$ was
measured in the range of the photon virtuality $Q^2 = 1.7 - 4.5 \rm{GeV^2}$,
and the invariant mass range for the $n\pi^+$ system of $W = 1.15 - 1.7
\rm{GeV}$ using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer. For the first time,
these kinematics are probed in exclusive $\pi^+$ production from protons with
nearly full coverage in the azimuthal and polar angles of the $n\pi^+$
center-of-mass system. The $n\pi^+$ channel has particular sensitivity to the
isospin 1/2 excited nucleon states, and together with the $p\pi^0$ final state
will serve to determine the transition form factors of a large number of
resonances. The largest discrepancy between these results and present modes was
seen in the $\sigma_{LT'}$ structure function. In this experiment, 31,295 cross
section and 4,184 asymmetry data points were measured. Because of the large
volume of data, only a reduced set of structure functions and Legendre
polynomial moments can be presented that are obtained in model-independent fits
to the differential cross sections.
