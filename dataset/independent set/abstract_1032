A novel Hamiltonian system in n dimensions which admits the maximal number
2n-1 of functionally independent, quadratic first integrals is presented. This
system turns out to be the first example of a maximally superintegrable
Hamiltonian on an n-dimensional Riemannian space of nonconstant curvature, and
it can be interpreted as the intrinsic Smorodinsky-Winternitz system on such a
space. Moreover, we provide three different complete sets of integrals in
involution and solve the equations of motion in closed form.
