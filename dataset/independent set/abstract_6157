We consider representations of Cuntz--Krieger algebras on the Hilbert space
of square integrable functions on the limit set, identified with a Cantor set
in the unit interval. We use these representations and the associated
Perron-Frobenius and Ruelle operators to construct families of wavelets on
these Cantor sets.
