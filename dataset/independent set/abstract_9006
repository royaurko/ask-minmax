We use non-linear scaling relations (NSRs) to investigate the effects arising
from the existence of negative correlations on the evolution of gravitational
clustering in an expanding universe. It turns out that such anti-correlated
regions have important dynamical effects on {\it all} scales. In particular,
the mere existence of negative values for the linear two-point correlation
function $\xib_L$ over some range of scales starting from $l = L_o$, implies
that the non-linear correlation function is bounded from above at {\it all}
scales $x < L_o$. This also results in the relation $\xib \propto x^{-3}$, at
these scales, at late times, independent of the original form of the
correlation function. Current observations do not rule out the existence of
negative $\xib$ for $ 200 h^{-1}$ Mpc $\la \xib \la 1000 h^{-1}$ Mpc; the
present work may thus have relevance for the real Universe. The only assumption
made in the analysis is the {\it existence} of the NSR; the results are
independent of the form of the NSR as well as of the stable clustering
hypothesis.
