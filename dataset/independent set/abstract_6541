We give an example of a totally disconnected set E in R^3 which is not
removable for quasiconformal homeomorphisms, i.e., there is a homeomorphism f
of R^3 to itself which is quasiconformal off E, but not quasiconformal on all
of R^3. The set E may be taken with Hausdorff dimension 2. The construction
also gives a non-removable set for locally biLipschitz homeomorphisms.
