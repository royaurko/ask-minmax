We present a prescription for obtaining Bell's inequalities for N>2 observers
involving more than two alternative measurement settings. We give examples of
some families of such inequalities. The inequalities are violated by certain
classes of states for which all standard Bell's inequalities with two
measurement settings per observer are satisfied.
