A detailed proof of hard scattering factorization is given with the inclusion
of heavy quark masses. Although the proof is explicitly given for
deep-inelastic scattering, the methods apply more generally The
power-suppressed corrections to the factorization formula are uniformly
suppressed by a power of \Lambda/Q, independently of the size of heavy quark
masses, M, relative to Q.
