We introduce (binary) Darboux transformation for general differential
equation of the second order in two independent variables. We present a
discrete version of the transformation for a 6-point difference scheme. The
scheme is appropriate to solving a hyperbolic type initial-boundary value
problem. We discuss several reductions and specifications of the
transformations as well as construction of other Darboux covariant schemes by
means of existing ones. In particular we introduce a 10-point scheme which can
be regarded as the discretization of self-adjoint hyperbolic equation.
