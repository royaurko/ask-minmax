We apply a pulsed-light interferometer to measure both the intensity and the
phase of light that is transmitted through a strongly scattering disordered
material. From a single set of measurements we obtain the time-resolved
intensity, frequency correlations and statistical phase information
simultaneously. We compare several independent techniques of measuring the
diffusion constant for diffuse propagation of light. By comparing these
independent measurements, we obtain experimental proof of the consistency of
the diffusion model and corroborate phase statistics theory.
