We construct background-independent Noether charges in Topologically Massive
Gravity with negative cosmological constant using its first-order formulation.
The procedure is carried out by keeping track of the surface terms in the
variation of the action, regardless the value of the gravitational Chern-Simons
coupling $\mu$. In particular, this method provides a definition of conserved
quantities for solutions at the chiral point $\mu l = 1$ ($l$ is the AdS
radius) that contain logarithmic terms (Log Gravity). It is also shown that the
charge formula gives a finite result for warped AdS black holes without the
need for any background-substraction procedure.
