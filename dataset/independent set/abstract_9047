We report measurements of the Lorentz-Lorenz coefficient density dependence,
the critical temperature, and the critical density, of the fluid
1,1-difluoroethylene. Lorentz-Lorenz coefficient data were obtained by
measuring refractive index and density of the same fluid sample independently
of one another. Accurate determination of the Lorentz-Lorenz coefficient is
necessary for transformation of refractive index data into density data from
optics-based experiments on critical phenomena of fluid systems done with
different apparatus, with which independent measurement of the refractive indes
and density is not possible. Measurements were made along the coexistence curve
of the fluid and span the density range 0.01 to 0.80 g/cc. The Lorentz-Lorenz
coefficient results show a stronger density dependence along the coexistence
curve than previously observed in other fluids, with a monotonic decrease from
a density of about 0.2 g/cc onwards, and an overall variation of about 2.5% in
the density range studied. No anomaly in the Lorentz-Lorenz coefficient was
observed near the critical density. The critical temperature is measured at
Tc=(302.964+-0.002) K (29.814 C) and the measured critical density is
(0.4195+-0.0018)g/cc.
