We extend the classical mean ergodic theorem to the setting of norming dual
pairs. It turns out that, in general, not all equivalences from the Banach
space setting remain valid in our situation. However, for Markovian semigroups
on the norming dual pair (C_b(E), M(E)) all classical equivalences hold true
under an additional assumption which is slightly weaker than the e-property.
