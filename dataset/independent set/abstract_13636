Geometric variables naturally occurring in a time-like foliation of
brane-worlds are introduced. These consist of the induced metric and two sets
of lapse functions and shift vectors, supplemented by two sets of tensorial,
vectorial and scalar variables arising as projections of the two extrinsic
curvatures. A subset of these variables turn out to be dynamical. Brane-world
gravitational dynamics is given as the time evolution of these variables.
