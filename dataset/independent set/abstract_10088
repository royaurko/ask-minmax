In this paper, we propose algorithms to compute differential Chow forms for
prime differential ideals which are given by their characteristic sets. The
main algorithm is based on an optimal bound for the order of a prime
differential ideal in terms of its characteristic set under an arbitrary
ranking, which shows the Jacobi bound conjecture holds in this case. Apart from
the order bound, we also give a degree bound for the differential Chow form. In
addition, for prime differential ideals given by their characteristic sets
under an orderly ranking, a much more simpler algorithm is given to compute its
differential Chow form. The computational complexity of both is single
exponential in terms of the Jacobi number, the maximal degree of the
differential polynomials in the characteristic set and the number of variables.
