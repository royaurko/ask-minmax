Useful information from the inner layers of stellar pulsators may be derived
from the study of their oscillations. In this paper we analyse three diagnostic
tools suggested in the literature built from the oscillation frequencies
computed for a set of main sequence models with masses between $1.0\, {\rm
M}_{\odot}$ and $1.6\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$, to check what information they may
hold about stellar cores. For the models with convective cores ($M \geq
1.2\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$) we find a relation between the frequency slopes of the
diagnostic tools and the size of the jump in the sound speed at the edge of the
core. We show that this relation is independent of the mass of the models. In
practice, since the size of the jump in the sound speed is related to the age
of the star, using these seismic tools we may, in principle, infer the star's
evolutionary state. We also show that when combining two of the three
diagnostic tools studied, we are able to distinguish models with convective
cores from models without a convective core but with strong sound-speed
gradients in the inner layers.
