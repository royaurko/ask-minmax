Two new formulations of general relativity are introduced. The first one is a
parabolization of the Arnowitt, Deser, Misner (ADM) formulation and is derived
by addition of combinations of the constraints and their derivatives to the
right-hand-side of the ADM evolution equations. The desirable property of this
modification is that it turns the surface of constraints into a local attractor
because the constraint propagation equations become second-order parabolic
independently of the gauge conditions employed. This system may be classified
as mixed hyperbolic - second-order parabolic. The second formulation is a
parabolization of the Kidder, Scheel, Teukolsky formulation and is a manifestly
mixed strongly hyperbolic - second-order parabolic set of equations, bearing
thus resemblance to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. As a first test,
a stability analysis of flat space is carried out and it is shown that the
first modification exponentially damps and smoothes all constraint violating
modes. These systems provide a new basis for constructing schemes for long-term
and stable numerical integration of the Einstein field equations.
