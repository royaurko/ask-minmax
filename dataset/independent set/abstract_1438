Using an approximate likelihood method adapted to band--power estimates, we
analyze the ensemble of first generation cosmic microwave background anisotropy
experiments to deduce constraints over a six--dimensional parameter space
describing Inflation--generated adiabatic, scalar fluctuations. The basic
preferences of simple Inflation scenarios are consistent with the data set:
flat geometries $(\OmT \equiv 1-\Omk \sim 1)$ and a scale--invariant primeval
spectrum ($n\sim 1$) are favored. Models with significant negative curvature
($\OmT < 0.7$) are eliminated, while constraints on postive curvature are less
stringent. Degeneracies among the parameters prevent independent determinations
of the matter density $\OmM$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, and the
Hubble constant $\Ho$ remains relatively unconstrained. We also find that the
height of the first Doppler peak relative to the amplitude suggested by data at
larger $l$ indicates a high baryon content ($\Omb h^2$), almost independently
of the other parameters. Besides the overall qualitative advance expected of
the next generation experiments, their improved dipole calibrations will be
particularly useful for constraining the peak height. Our analysis includes a
{\em Goodness--of--Fit} statistic applicable to power estimates and which
indicates that the maximum likelihood model provides an acceptable fit to the
data set.
