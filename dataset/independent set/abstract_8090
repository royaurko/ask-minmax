We present a quantization scheme of an arbitrary measure space based on
overcomplete families of states and generalizing the Klauder and the
Berezin-Toeplitz approaches. This scheme could reveal itself as an efficient
tool for quantizing physical systems for which more traditional methods like
geometric quantization are uneasy to implement. The procedure is illustrated by
(mostly two-dimensional) elementary examples in which the measure space is a
$N$-element set and the unit interval. Spaces of states for the $N$-element set
and the unit interval are the 2-dimensional euclidean $\R^2$ and hermitian
$\C^2$ planes.
