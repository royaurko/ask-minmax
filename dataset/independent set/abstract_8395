We prove an asymptotic formula for the number of scattering resonances in a
strip near the real axis when the trapped set is r-normally hyperbolic with r
large and a pinching condition on the normal expansion rates holds. Our
dynamical assumptions are stable under smooth perturbations and motivated by
the setting of black holes. The key tool is a Fourier integral operator which
microlocally projects onto the resonant states in the strip. In addition to
Weyl law, this operator provides new information about microlocal concentration
of resonant states.
