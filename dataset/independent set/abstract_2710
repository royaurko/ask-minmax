Models of ordering dynamics allow to understand natural systems in which an
initially disordered population homogenizes some traits via local interactions.
The simplest of these models, with wide applications ranging from evolutionary
to social dynamics, are the Voter and Moran processes, usually defined in terms
of static or randomly mixed individuals that interact with a neighbor to copy
or modify a discrete trait. Here we study the effects of diffusion in
Voter/Moran processes by proposing a generalization of ordering dynamics in a
metapopulation framework, in which individuals are endowed with mobility and
diffuse through a spatial structure represented as a graph of patches upon
which interactions take place. We show that diffusion dramatically affects the
time to reach the homogeneous state, independently of the underlying network's
topology, while the final consensus emerges through different local/global
mechanisms, depending on the mobility strength. Our results highlight the
crucial role played by mobility in ordering processes and set up a general
framework that allows to study its effect on a large class of models, with
implications in the understanding of evolutionary and social phenomena.
