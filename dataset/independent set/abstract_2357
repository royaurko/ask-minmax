The data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 188.6 GeV by ALEPH at LEP,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 176.2 pb-1, are analysed in a
search for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons H+/-. Three analyses are employed
to select the taunutaunu, taunucs and cscs final states. No evidence for a
signal is found. Upper limits are set on the production cross section as a
function of the branching fraction BR(H+ to tau nu) and of the mass M(H+),
assuming that the sum of the branching ratios is equal to one. In the framework
of a two-Higgs-doublet model, charged Higgs bosons with masses below 65.4
GeV/c2 are excluded at 95% confidence level independently of the decay mode.
