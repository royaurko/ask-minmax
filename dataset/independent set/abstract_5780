Using explicit expressions for a class of singular vectors of the $N=2$
(untwisted) algebra and following the approach of Malikov-Feigin-Fuchs and
Kent, we show that the analytically extended Verma modules contain two linearly
independent neutral singular vectors at the same grade. We construct this two
dimensional space and we identify the singular vectors of the original Verma
modules. We show that in some Verma modules these expressions lead to two
linearly independent singular vectors which are at the same grade and have the
same charge.
