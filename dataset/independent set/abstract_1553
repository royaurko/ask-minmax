First, we provide another proof that the signed count of the real
$J$-holomorphic spheres (or $J$-holomorphic discs) passing through a generic
real configuration of $k$ points is independent of the choice of the real
configuration and the choice of $J$, if the dimension of the Lagrangian
submanifold $L$ (fixed points set of the involution) is two or three, and also
if we assume $L$ is orientable and relatively spin, and $M$ is strongly
semi-positive. This theorem was first proved by Welschinger in a more general
setting, and we provide more natural approach using the degree of evaluation
maps from the moduli spaces of $J$-holomorphic discs. Then, we define the
invariant count of discs intersecting cycles of a symplectic manifold at fixed
interior marked points, and intersecting real points at the boundary under
certain assumptions. The last result is new and was not proved by Welshinger's
method.
