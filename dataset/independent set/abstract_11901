We prove a Paley-Wiener Theorem for a class of symmetric spaces of the
compact type, in which all root multiplicities are even. This theorem
characterizes functions of small support in terms of holomorphic extendability
and exponential type of their (discrete) Fourier transforms. We also provide
three independent new proofs of the strong Huygens' principle for a suitable
constant shift of the wave equation on odd-dimensional spaces from our class.
