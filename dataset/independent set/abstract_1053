High luminosity Super B/Flavor factories, near and on top of the $\Upsilon$
resonances, allow for a detailed investigation of CP-violation in $\tau$
physics. In particular, bounds on the $\tau$ electric dipole moment can be
obtained from CP-odd observables. We perform an independent analysis from other
low and high energy data. For polarized electron beam a CP-odd asymmetry,
associated to the normal polarization term, can be used to set stringent bounds
on the $\tau$ electric dipole moment.
