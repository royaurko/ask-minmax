An algorithm to generate the locus of a circle using the intersection points
of straight lines is proposed. The pixels on the circle are plotted independent
of one another and the operations involved in finding the locus of the circle
from the intersection of straight lines are parallelizable. Integer only
arithmetic and algorithmic optimizations are used for speedup. The proposed
algorithm makes use of an envelope to form a parabolic arc which is consequent
transformed into a circle. The use of parabolic arcs for the transformation
results in higher pixel errors as the radius of the circle to be drawn
increases. At its current state, the algorithm presented may be suitable only
for generating circles for string art.
