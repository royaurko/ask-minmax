Most studies of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) have only considered the
radiation from independent dipole magnets. However, in the damping rings of
future linear colliders, a large fraction of the radiation power will be
emitted in damping wigglers. In this paper, the longitudinal wakefield and
impedance due to CSR in a wiggler are derived in the limit of a large wiggler
parameter $K$. After an appropriate scaling, the results can be expressed in
terms of universal functions, which are independent of $K$. Analytical
asymptotic results are obtained for the wakefield in the limit of large and
small distances, and for the impedance in the limit of small and high
frequencies.
