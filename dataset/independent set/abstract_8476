We study geometric data structures for sets of point-based temporal events,
answering time-windowed queries, i.e., given a contiguous time interval we
answer common geometric queries about the point events with time stamps in this
interval. The geometric queries we consider include queries based on the
skyline, convex hull, and proximity relations of the point set. We provide
space efficient data structures which answer queries in polylogarithmic time.
