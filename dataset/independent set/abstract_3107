We have solved the Einstein equations of general relativity for a class of
metrics with constant spatial curvature and found a non-vanishing Weyl tensor
in the presence of an energy-momentum tensor with an anisotropic pressure
component. The time evolution of the spacetime is guided by the usual Friedmann
equations and the constraints on the hypersurface comprise a separated system
of equations that can be independently solved. Contrary to the apparent
behavior induced by some choices of coordinates, the metric we have obtained is
completely regular everywhere and is free of singularities (except the
well-known Friedmann singularity at $t=0$). The physical features of this
solution are elucidated by using the Quasi-Maxwellian equations (a set of third
order differential equations describing the dynamics of the gravitational field
in terms of the Weyl tensor). The motion of test particles is also analyzed in
order to confirm the maximal extension of the manifold under consideration.
These results indicate that the anisotropic pressure could mimic dark matter
effects on certain geodesic congruences keeping the cosmic flow unchanged.
