We show that for a strongly convergent sequence of purely loxodromic finitely
generated Kleinian groups with incompressible ends, Cannon-Thurston maps,
viewed as maps from a fixed base limit set to the Riemann sphere, converge
uniformly. For algebraically convergent sequences we show that there exist
examples where even pointwise convergence of Cannon-Thurston maps fails.
