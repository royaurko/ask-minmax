The algebra of invariants of d-tuples of n x n skew-symmetric matrices under
the action of the orthogonal group by simultaneous conjugation is considered
over an infinite field of characteristic different from two. For n=3 and d>0 a
minimal set of generators is established. A homogeneous system of parameters
(i.e., an algebraically independent set such that the algebra of invariants is
a finitely generated free module over subalgebra generated by this set) is
described for n=3 and d>0, for n=4 and d=2,3, for n=5 and d=2.
