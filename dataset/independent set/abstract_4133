Based on classical statistical thermodynamics, we develop a theoretical
approach that provides new insight into how macroscopic and microscopic
physical properties are bridged via crystal lattice for condensed mat- ters. We
find that in order to determine macroscopic physical properties and their
temperature dependence in equilibrium disordered state, information about a few
specially selected microscopic states, established from geometrical
characteristics of the crystal lattice, is sufficient. These special states are
found to be independent of constitument elements as well as of temperature,
which is in contrast to the standard conception in statistical thermodyanamics
where a set of microscopic states mainly contributing to determining
macroscopic physical properties depend on temperature and constituent elements.
Validity and applicability of the theoretical ap- proach is confirmed through
prediction of macroscopic physical properties in practical alloys, compared
with prediction by full thermodynamic simulation. The present findings provide
efficient and systematic prediction of macroscopic physical properties for
equilibrium disordered states based on those for special microscopic states
without any information of interactions for given system.
