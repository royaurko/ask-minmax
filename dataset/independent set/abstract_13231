We present a measurement of the flux of neutrino-induced upgoing muons
(<E_nu>~100 GeV) using the MACRO detector. The ratio of the number of observed
to expected events integrated over all zenith angles is 0.74 +/- 0.036 (stat)
+/- 0.046(systematic) +/- 0.13 (theoretical). The observed zenith distribution
for -1.0 < cos(theta) < -0.1 does not fit well with the no oscillation
expectation, giving a maximum probability for chi^2 of 0.1%. The acceptance of
the detector has been extensively studied using downgoing muons, independent
analyses and Monte-Carlo simulations. The other systematic uncertainties cannot
be the source of the discrepancies between the data and expectations. We have
investigated whether the observed number of events and the shape of the zenith
distribution can be explained by a neutrino oscillation hypothesis. Fitting
either the flux or zenith distribution independently yields mixing parameters
of sin^2 (2theta)=1.0 and delta m^2 of a few times 10^-3 eV^2. However, the
observed zenith distribution does not fit well with any expectations giving a
maximum probability for chi^2 of 5% for the best oscillation hypothesis, and
the combined probability for the shape and number of events is 17%. We conclude
that these data favor a neutrino oscillation hypothesis, but with unexplained
structure in the zenith distribution not easily explained by either the
statistics or systematics of the experiment.
