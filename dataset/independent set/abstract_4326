The independent component model is a latent variable model where the
components of the observed random vector are linear combinations of latent
independent variables. The aim is to find an estimate for a transformation
matrix back to independent components. In moment-based approaches third
cumulants are often neglected in favor of fourth cumulants, even though both
approaches have similar appealing properties. This paper considers the joint
use of third and fourth cumulants in finding independent components. First,
univariate cumulants are used as projection indices in search for independent
components (projection pursuit). Second, multivariate cumulant matrices are
jointly used to solve the problem. The properties of the estimates are
considered in detail through corresponding optimization problems, estimating
equations, algorithms and asymptotic statistical properties. Comparisons of the
asymptotic variances of different estimates in wide independent component
models show that in most cases symmetric projection pursuit approach using both
third and fourth squared cumulants is a safe choice.
