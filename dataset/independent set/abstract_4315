We prove a series of results on the size of distance sets corresponding to
sets in the Euclidean space. These distances are generated by bounded convex
sets and the results depend explicitly on the geometry of these sets. We also
use a diophantine mechanism to convert continuous results into distance set
estimates for discrete point sets.
