The topic of risk prevention and emergency response has become a key social
and political concern. One approach to address this challenge is to develop
Decision Support Systems (DSS) that can help emergency planners and responders
to detect emergencies, as well as to suggest possible course of actions to deal
with the emergency. Our research work comes in this framework and aims to
develop a DSS that must be generic as much as possible and independent from the
case study.
