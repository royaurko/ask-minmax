Moufang sets were introduced by Jacques Tits in order to understand isotropic
linear algebraic groups of relative rank one, but the notion is more general.
We describe a new class of Moufang sets, arising from so-called mixed groups of
type F4 in characteristic 2, obtained as the fixed point set under a suitable
involution.
