We develop the Pl\"unnecke-Ruzsa and Balog-Szemer\'edi-Gowers theory of sum
set estimates in the non-commutative setting, with discrete, continuous, and
metric entropy formulations of these estimates. We also develop a Freiman-type
inverse theorem for a special class of 2-step nilpotent groups, namely the
Heisenberg groups with no 2-torsion in their centre.
