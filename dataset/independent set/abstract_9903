We introduce a new type of closure operator on the set of relations,
max-implementation, and its weaker analog max-quantification. Then we show that
approximation preserving reductions between counting constraint satisfaction
problems (#CSPs) are preserved by these two types of closure operators.
Together with some previous results this means that the approximation
complexity of counting CSPs is determined by partial clones of relations that
additionally closed under these new types of closure operators. Galois
correspondence of various kind have proved to be quite helpful in the study of
the complexity of the CSP. While we were unable to identify a Galois
correspondence for partial clones closed under max-implementation and
max-quantification, we obtain such results for slightly different type of
closure operators, k-existential quantification. This type of quantifiers are
known as counting quantifiers in model theory, and often used to enhance first
order logic languages. We characterize partial clones of relations closed under
k-existential quantification as sets of relations invariant under a set of
partial functions that satisfy the condition of k-subset surjectivity. Finally,
we give a description of Boolean max-co-clones, that is, sets of relations on
{0,1} closed under max-implementations.
