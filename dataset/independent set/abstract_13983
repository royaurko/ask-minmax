An edge-face colouring of a plane graph with edge set $E$ and face set $F$ is
a colouring of the elements of $E \cup F$ such that adjacent or incident
elements receive different colours. Borodin proved that every plane graph of
maximum degree $\Delta\ge10$ can be edge-face coloured with $\Delta+1$ colours.
Borodin's bound was recently extended to the case where $\Delta=9$. In this
paper, we extend it to the case $\Delta=8$.
