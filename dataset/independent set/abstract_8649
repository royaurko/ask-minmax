We describe a self-homeomorphism $R$ of the Cantor set $X$ and then show that
its conjugacy class in the Polish group $H(X)$ of all homeomorphisms of $X$
forms a dense $G_\delta$ subset of $H(X)$. We also provide an example of a
locally compact, second countable topological group which has a dense conjugacy
class.
