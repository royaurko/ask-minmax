A poset has the non-messing-up property if it has two covering sets of
disjoint saturated chains so that for any labeling of the poset, sorting the
labels along one set of chains and then sorting the labels along the other set
yields a linear extension of the poset. The linear extension yielded by thus
twice sorting a labeled non-messing-up poset may be independent of which sort
was performed first. Here we characterize such sort-invariant labelings for
convex subposets of a cylinder. They are completely determined by avoidance of
a particular subpattern: a diamond of four elements whose smallest two labels
appear at opposite points.
