Existing data on Cu-nuclear spin relaxation reveal two independent relaxation
processes: the one that is temperature independent we link to incommensurate
peaks seen by neutrons, while the ''universal'' temperature dependent
contribution coincides with 1/{63}^T_{1}(T) for two-chain YBCO 124. We argue
that this new result substitutes for a ''pseudogap'' regime in a broad class of
high-T_c cuprates and stems from the 1st order phase transition that starts
well above the superconductivity T_c but becomes frustrated because of broken
electroneutrality in the CuO_2 plane.
