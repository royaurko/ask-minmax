Independent component analysis (ICA) has become a popular multivariate
analysis and signal processing technique with diverse applications. This paper
is targeted at discussing theoretical large sample properties of ICA unmixing
matrix functionals. We provide a formal definition of unmixing matrix
functional and consider two popular estimators in detail: the family based on
two scatter matrices with the independence property (e.g., FOBI estimator) and
the family of deflation-based fastICA estimators. The limiting behavior of the
corresponding estimates is discussed and the asymptotic normality of the
deflation-based fastICA estimate is proven under general assumptions.
Furthermore, properties of several performance indices commonly used for
comparison of different unmixing matrix estimates are discussed and a new
performance index is proposed. The proposed index fullfills three desirable
features which promote its use in practice and distinguish it from others.
Namely, the index possesses an easy interpretation, is fast to compute and its
asymptotic properties can be inferred from asymptotics of the unmixing matrix
estimate. We illustrate the derived asymptotical results and the use of the
proposed index with a small simulation study.
