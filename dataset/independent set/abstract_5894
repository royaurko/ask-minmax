This paper proposes new tests of conditional independence of two random
variables given a single-index involving an unknown finite-dimensional
parameter. The tests employ Rosenblatt transforms and are shown to be
distribution-free while retaining computational convenience. Some results from
Monte Carlo simulations are presented and discussed.
