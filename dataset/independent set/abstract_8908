The paper tries to extend results of the classical Descriptive Set Theory to
as many countably based T_0-spaces (cb_0-spaces) as possible. Along with
extending some central facts about Borel, Luzin and Hausdorff hierarchies of
sets we consider also the more general case of k-partitions. In particular, we
investigate the difference hierarchy of k-partitions and the fine hierarchy
closely related to the Wadge hierarchy.
