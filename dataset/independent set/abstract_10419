We calculate Ic(T) and Rn for both coherent and incoherent electron tunneling
across a c-axis break junction between nu=s,d_x^2-y^2-wave superconducting half
spaces, each with c-axis bandwidth 2J. Coherent quasiparticle tunneling only
occurs for voltages V<2J/e, leading to difficulties in measuring Rn for
underdoped samples. The coherent part of Ic(0) is independent of Delta_nu(0)
for J/Delta_nu(0)<<1, and can be large. Our results are discussed with regard
to recent experiments.
