If M is a Drinfeld module over a local function field L, we may view M as a
dynamical system, and consider its filled Julia set J. If J^0 is the connected
component of the identity, relative to the Berkovich topology, we give a
characterisation of the component module J/J^0 which is analogous to the
Kodaira-Neron characterisation of the special fibre of a Neron model of an
elliptic curve over a non-archimedean field. In particular, if L is the
fraction field of a discrete valuation ring, then the component module is
finite, and moreover trivial in the case of good reduction.
  In the context of global function fields, the filled Julia set may be
considered as an object over the ring of finite adeles. In this setting we
formulate a conjecture about the structure of the (finite) component module
which, if true, would imply Poonen's Uniform Boundedness Conjecture for torsion
on Drinfeld modules of a given rank over a given global function field.
Finally, we prove this conjecture for certain families of Drinfeld modules,
obtaining uniform bounds on torsion in some special cases.
