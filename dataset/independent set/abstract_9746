A cycle cover of a graph is a set of cycles such that every vertex is part of
exactly one cycle. An L-cycle cover is a cycle cover in which the length of
every cycle is in the set L.
  We investigate how well L-cycle covers of minimum weight can be approximated.
For undirected graphs, we devise a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that
achieves a constant approximation ratio for all sets L. On the other hand, we
prove that the problem cannot be approximated within a factor of 2-eps for
certain sets L.
  For directed graphs, we present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm
that achieves an approximation ratio of O(n), where $n$ is the number of
vertices. This is asymptotically optimal: We show that the problem cannot be
approximated within a factor of o(n).
  To contrast the results for cycle covers of minimum weight, we show that the
problem of computing L-cycle covers of maximum weight can, at least in
principle, be approximated arbitrarily well.
