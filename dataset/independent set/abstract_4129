The MiniBooNE Neutral Current Elastic (NCEL) cross section results are used
to extract limits in the $\Delta m^{2}-\sin^{2}\vartheta_{\mu s}$ plane for a
3+1 sterile neutrino model with a mass splitting $0.1 \leq \Delta m^{2} \leq
10.0$ eV$^{2}$. GENIE is used with a cross section model close to the one
employed by MiniBooNE to make event rate predictions using simulations on the
MiniBooNE target material CH$_{2}$. The axial mass is a free parameter in all
fits. Sterile modifications to the flux and changes to the cross section in the
simulation relate the two and allow limits to be set on sterile neutrino mixing
using cross section results. The large axial mass problem makes it necessary
for experiments to perform their own axial mass fits, but a prior fit to the
same dataset could mask a sterile oscillation signal if the sterile and cross
section model parameters are not independent. We find that for the NCEL dataset
there are significant correlations between the sterile and cross section model
parameters, making a fit to both models simultaneously necessary to get robust
results. Failure to do this results in stronger than warranted limits on the
sterile parameters. The general problems that the current uncertainty on
charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE) and NCEL cross sections at MiniBooNE
energies pose for sterile neutrino measurements are discussed.
