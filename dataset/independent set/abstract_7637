Let K be the face ring of the independence complex of a matroid. We show that
if T is a generic linear system of parameters, then K/T satisfies a weak form
of the Hard Lefschetz Theorem. As a result, the first half of the h-vector of
the complex satisfies inequalities similar to the g-theorem for simplicial
polytopes.
