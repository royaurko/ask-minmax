Some scientific publications are under suspicion of fabrication of data.
Since humans are bad random number generators, there might be some evidential
value in favor of fabrication in the statistical results as presented in such
papers. In case of ANOVA-Regression studies we present the evidential value of
the results of such a study in favor of the hypothesis of a dependence
structure in the underlying data, which indicates fabrication, versus the
hypothesis of independence, which is the ANOVA model assumption. Applications
of this approach are also presented.
