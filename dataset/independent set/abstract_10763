Using improved Ge and Si detectors, better neutron shielding, and increased
counting time, the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment has obtained
stricter limits on the cross section of weakly interacting massive particles
(WIMPs) elastically scattering from nuclei. Increased discrimination against
electromagnetic backgrounds and reduction of neutron flux confirm
WIMP-candidate events previously detected by CDMS were consistent with neutrons
and give limits on spin-independent WIMP interactions which are >2X lower than
previous CDMS results for high WIMP mass, and which exclude new parameter space
for WIMPs with mass between 8-20 GeV/c^2.
