Each straight infinite line defined by two vertices of a finite square point
lattice contains (covers) these two points and a - possibly empty - subset of
points that happen to be collinear to these. This work documents vertex subsets
of minimum order such that the sum of the infinite straight lines associated
with the edges of their complete subgraph covers the entire set of vertices
(nodes). This is an abstraction to the problem of sending a light signal to all
stations (receivers) in a square array with a minimum number of stations also
equipped with transmitters to redirect the light to other transmitters.
