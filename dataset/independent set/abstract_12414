The recently discovered resonance at 125 GeV has properties remarkably close
to those of the Standard Model Higgs boson. We perform model-independent fits
of all presently available data. The non- standard best-fits found in our
previous analyses remain favored with respect to the SM fit, mainly but not
only because the {\gamma}{\gamma} rate remains above the SM prediction.
