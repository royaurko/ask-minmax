For which groups G is it true that whenever we form a direct limit of G-sets,
dirlim_{i\in I} X_i, the set of its fixed points, (dirlim_I X_i)^G, can be
obtained as the direct limit dirlim_I(X_i^G) of the fixed point sets of the
given G-sets? An easy argument shows that this holds if and only if G is
finitely generated.
  If we replace ``group G'' by ``monoid M'', the answer is the less familiar
condition that the improper left congruence on M be finitely generated.
  Replacing our group or monoid with a small category E, the concept of set on
which G or M acts with that of a functor E --> Set, and the concept of fixed
point set with that of the limit of a functor, a criterion of a similar nature
is obtained. The case where E is a partially ordered set leads to a condition
on partially ordered sets which I have not seen before (pp.23-24, Def. 12 and
Lemma 13).
  If one allows the {\em codomain} category Set to be replaced with other
categories, and/or allows direct limits to be replaced with other kinds of
colimits, one gets a vast area for further investigation.
