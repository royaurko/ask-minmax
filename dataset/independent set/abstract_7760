Using the pseudomode method, we evaluate exactly time-dependent entanglement
for two independent qubits, each coupled to a non-Markovian structured
environment. Our results suggest a possible way to control entanglement sudden
death by modifying the qubit-pseudomode detuning and the spectrum of the
reservoirs. Particularly, in environments structured by a model of a
density-of-states gap which has two poles, entanglement trapping and prevention
of entanglement sudden death occur in the weak-coupling regime.
