Strong evidence exists that coronal loops as observed in EUV and soft X-rays
may not be monolithic isotropic structures, but can often be more accurately
modeled as bundles of independent strands. Modeling the observed active region
transient brightenings (ARTBs) within this framework allows exploration of the
energetic ramifications and characteristics of these stratified structures.
Here we present a simple method of detecting and modeling ARTBs observed with
the Hinode/X-Ray Telescope (XRT) as groups of 0-dimensional strands, which
allows us to probe parameter space to understand better the spatial and
temporal dependence of strand heating in impulsively heated loops. This
partially automated method can be used to analyze a large number of
observations to gain a statistical insight into the parameters of coronal
structures including the number of heating events required in a given model to
fit the observations. In this article we present the methodology, and
demonstrate its use in detecting and modeling ARTBs in a sample data set from
Hinode/XRT. These initial results show that in general, multiple heating events
are necessary to reproduce observed ARTBs, but the spatial dependence of these
heating events could not yet be established.
