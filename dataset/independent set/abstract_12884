Paper describes High Power Microwave research of combining GW peak power to
achieve MV/m and GV/m radiated fields in 1 to 500 GHz band. To achieve such
fields multiple independently triggered broadband GW sources, supplying power
to multiple spatially distributed broadband radiators/antennas are used. Single
TW array is used as an ultimate microwave weapon in 1 to 5 GHz range while
multiple TW arrays provide GV/m radiating field at plasma frequencies in 300
GHz range leading to fusion power.
