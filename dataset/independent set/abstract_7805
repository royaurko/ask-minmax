A multivariate version of Spearman's rho for testing independence is
considered. Its asymptotic efficiency is calculated under a general
distribution model specified by the dependence function. The efficiency
comparison study that involves other multivariate Spearman-type test statistics
is made. Conditions for Pitman optimality of the test are established. Examples
that illustrate the quality of the multivariate Spearman's test are included.
