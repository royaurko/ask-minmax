We present a coherent approach to the competition between thermodynamic
states in spatially inhomogeneous systems, such as the Edwards-Anderson spin
glass with a fixed coupling realization. This approach explains and relates
chaotic size dependence, ``dispersal of the metastate'', and for replicas:
non-independence, symmetry breaking, and overlap (non-)self-averaging.
