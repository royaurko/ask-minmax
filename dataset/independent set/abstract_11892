Coherent photonuclear isotope transmutation (CPIT) produces exclusively
radioactive isotopes (RIs) by coherent photonuclear reactions via E1 giant
resonances. Photons to be used are medium energy photons produced by laser
photons backscattered off GeV electrons. The cross sections are as large as 0.2
- 0.6 b, being independent of individual nuclides. A large fraction of photons
is effectively used for the photonuclear reactions, while the scattered GeV
electrons remain in the storage ring to be re-used. CPIT with medium energy
photons provides specific/desired RIs with the high rate and the high density
for nuclear science, molecular biology and for nuclear medicines.
