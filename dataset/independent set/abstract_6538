Larman showed that any closed subset of the plane with uncountable
vertical cross-sections has aleph_1 disjoint Borel uniformizing sets.
Here we show that Larman's result is best possible: there exist closed
sets with uncountable cross-sections which do not have more than
aleph_1 disjoint Borel uniformizations, even if the continuum is
much larger than aleph_1.  This negatively answers some questions of
Mauldin.  The proof is based on a result of Stern, stating that certain
Borel sets cannot be written as a small union of low-level Borel sets.
The proof of the latter result uses Steel's method of forcing with
tagged trees; a full presentation of this method, written in terms of
Baire category rather than forcing, is given here.
