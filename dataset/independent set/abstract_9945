We consider the setting of sequential prediction of arbitrary sequences based
on specialized experts. We first provide a review of the relevant literature
and present two theoretical contributions: a general analysis of the specialist
aggregation rule of Freund et al. (1997) and an adaptation of fixed-share rules
of Herbster and Warmuth (1998) in this setting. We then apply these rules to
the sequential short-term (one-day-ahead) forecasting of electricity
consumption; to do so, we consider two data sets, a Slovakian one and a French
one, respectively concerned with hourly and half-hourly predictions. We follow
a general methodology to perform the stated empirical studies and detail in
particular tuning issues of the learning parameters. The introduced aggregation
rules demonstrate an improved accuracy on the data sets at hand; the
improvements lie in a reduced mean squared error but also in a more robust
behavior with respect to large occasional errors.
