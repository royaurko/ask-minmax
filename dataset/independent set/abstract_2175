Let $A$ be an $(m \times n)$ integral matrix, and let $P=\{ x : A x \leq b\}$
be an $n$-dimensional polytope. The width of $P$ is defined as $ w(P)=min\{
x\in \mathbb{Z}^n\setminus\{0\} :\: max_{x \in P} x^\top u - min_{x \in P}
x^\top v \}$. Let $\Delta(A)$ and $\delta(A)$ denote the greatest and the
smallest absolute values of a determinant among all $r(A) \times r(A)$
sub-matrices of $A$, where $r(A)$ is the rank of a matrix $A$.
  We prove that if every $r(A) \times r(A)$ sub-matrix of $A$ has a determinant
equal to $\pm \Delta(A)$ or $0$ and $w(P)\ge (\Delta(A)-1)(n+1)$, then $P$
contains $n$ affine independent integer points. Also we have similar results
for the case of \emph{$k$-modular} matrices. The matrix $A$ is called
\emph{totally $k$-modular} if every square sub-matrix of $A$ has a determinant
in the set $\{0,\, \pm k^r :\: r \in \mathbb{N} \}$.
  When $P$ is a simplex and $w(P)\ge \delta(A)-1$, we describe a polynomial
time algorithm for finding an integer point in $P$.
  Finally we show that if $A$ is \emph{almost unimodular}, then integer program
$\max \{c^\top x :\: x \in P \cap \mathbb{Z}^n \}$ can be solved in polynomial
time. The matrix $A$ is called \emph{almost unimodular} if $\Delta(A) \leq 2$
and any $(r(A)-1)\times(r(A)-1)$ sub-matrix has a determinant from the set
$\{0,\pm 1\}$.
