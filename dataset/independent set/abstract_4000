Strictly finite-range (SFR) potentials are exactly zero beyond their finite
range. Single-particle energies and densities as well as S-matrix pole
trajectories are studied in a few SFR potentials suited for the description of
neutrons interacting with light and heavy nuclei. The SFR potentials considered
are the standard cut-off Woods--Saxon (CWS) potentials and two potentials
approaching zero smoothly: the SV potential introduced by Salamon and Vertse
and the SS potential of Sahu and Sahu. The parameters of these latter were set
so that the potentials may be similar to the CWS shape. The range of the SV and
SS potentials scales with the cube root of the mass number of the core like the
nuclear radius itself. For light nuclei a single term of the SV potential (with
a single parameter) is enough for a good description of the neutron-nucleus
interaction. The trajectories are compared with a bench-mark for which the
starting points (belonging to potential depth zero) can be determined
independently. Even the CWS potential is found to conform to this bench-mark if
the range is identified with the cutoff radius. For the CWS potentials some
trajectories show irregular shapes, while for the SV and SS potentials all
trajectories behave regularly.
