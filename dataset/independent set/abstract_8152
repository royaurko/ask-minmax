This is the story of the rediscovery of classical three-dimensional geometry,
especially the geometry of quadric surfaces, while studying the semigroup
$M_2(\mathbb R)$ of linear endomorphisms of a real plane. One of the surfaces
that appears prominently in this context is the hyperboloid of one sheet,
referred to as {\em spaghetti bundle} in \cite{Samu:88}. In this story the
spaghetti presents itself as the set of idempotents in $M_2(\mathbb R)$, the
cone emerges as the set of nilpotent elements and the hyperbolic paraboloid as
the set of semigroup-theoretic inverses of a singular element.
