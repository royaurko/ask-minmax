Consider estimating the n by p matrix of means of an n by p matrix of
independent normally distributed observations with constant variance, where the
performance of an estimator is judged using a p by p matrix quadratic error
loss function. A matrix version of the James-Stein estimator is proposed,
depending on a tuning constant. It is shown to dominate the usual maximum
likelihood estimator for some choices of of the tuning constant when n is
greater than or equal to 3. This result also extends to other shrinkage
estimators and settings.
