The study of essential and strongly essential variables in functions defined
on finite sets is a part of $k$-valued logic. We extend the main definitions
from functions to terms. This allows us to apply concepts and results of
Universal Algebra. On the basis of the concept of a separable set of variables
in a term we introduce a new notion of complexity of terms, algebras and
varieties and give examples.
