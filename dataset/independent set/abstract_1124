By separating data points close to a resonance into intervals, and fitting
all possible intervals to a simple pole with constant coherently added
background, we obtained a substantial number of convergent fits. After a
carefully chosen set of statistical constraints was imposed, we calculated the
average of a resonance pole position from the statistically acceptable results.
We used this method to find pole positions of Z and N(1440) resonances, and to
show that the strong discrepancy between the old and new measurements of the
Upsilon(11020) mass stems from specious comparison of the Upsilon(11020) pole
with its Breit-Wigner mass.
