Consider a class of functions of one real variable with the following
uniqueness property: if a function f(x) from the class vanishes on a set of
positive measure, then f is the zero function. In many instances, we would like
to have a quantitative version of this property, e.g. a lower bound for f(x)
outside a small exceptional set. Such estimates are well-known and useful for
polynomials and analytic functions. In this work we prove similar results for
the Denjoy-Carleman and the Bernstein classes of quasianalytic functions.
