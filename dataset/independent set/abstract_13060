Reverberant sound fields are often modeled as isotropic. However, it has been
observed that spatial properties change during the decay of the sound field
energy, due to non-isotropic attenuation in non-ideal rooms. In this letter, a
model for the spatial coherence between two sensors in a decaying reverberant
sound field is developed for rectangular rooms. The modeled coherence function
depends on room dimensions, surface reflectivity and orientation of the sensor
pair, but is independent of the position of source and sensors in the room. The
model includes the spherically isotropic (diffuse) and cylindrically isotropic
sound field models as special cases.
