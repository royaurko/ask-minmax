In this paper, we establish the first and the second-order asymptotics of
distributions of normalized maxima of independent and non-identically
distributed bivariate Gaussian triangular arrays, where each vector of the
$n$th row follows from a bivariate Gaussian distribution with correlation
coefficient being a monotone continuous function of $i/n$. Furthermore,
parametric inference for this unknown function is studied. Some simulation
study and real data sets analysis are also presented.
