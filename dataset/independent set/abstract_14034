In this paper, we introduce, for a multiplier $\chi$, a notion of generalized
power function $x\mapsto \Delta_{\chi}(x),$ defined on the homogeneous cone
${\mathcal{P}}$ of a Vinberg algebra ${\mathcal{A}}$. We then extend to
${\mathcal{A}}$ the famous Gindikin result, that is we determine the set of
multipliers $\chi$ such that the map $\theta \mapsto \Delta_{\chi}(\theta
^{-1})$, defined on ${\mathcal{P}}^{\ast}$, is the Laplace transform of a
positive measure $R_{\chi}$. We also determine the set of $\chi $ such that
$R_{\chi}$ generates an exponential family, and we calculate the variance
function of this family
