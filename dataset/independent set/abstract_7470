We investigate the excited stationary states of Bose-Einstein condensates
trapped in harmonic potentials. We derive simple analytical approximations of
the first few eigenstates of the associated time-independent one-dimensional
Gross-Pitaevskii equation and their energies. Our results are excited state
generalizations of the Thomas-Fermi approximation of the ground state.
