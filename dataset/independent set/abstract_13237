We discuss here what model independent information about properties of
neutrinos and of the sun can be obtained from future solar neutrino experiments
(SNO, Super-Kamiokande). It is shown that in the general case of transitions of
solar $\nu_e$'s into $\nu_\mu$ and/or $\nu_\tau$ the initial $^8\mathrm{B}$
neutrino flux can be measured by the observation of NC events. From the CC
measurements the $\nu_e$ survival probability can be determined as a function
of neutrino energy. The general case of transitions of solar $\nu_e$'s into
active as well as sterile neutrinos is considered. A number of relations
between measurable quantities the test of which will allow to answer the
question whether there are sterile neutrinos in the solar neutrino flux on the
earth are derived. Transitions of solar $\nu_e$'s into active and sterile
states due to neutrino mixing and Dirac magnetic moments or into active
left-handed neutrinos and active right-handed antineutrinos due to neutrino
mixing and Majorana transition magnetic moments are also considered. It is
shown that future solar neutrino experiments will allow to distinguish between
the cases of Dirac and Majorana magnetic moments.
