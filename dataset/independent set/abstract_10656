We propose an experimental method that allows for scaling of all the diagonal
correlation functions (such as the density and pair correlation function)
during the expansion of harmonically trapped cold atomic gases with arbitrary
interactions even if the trapping is anisotropic. To do this we require that
the interaction be tunable by the use of a Feshbach resonance and that the
trapping potential can be manipulated independently along the axial and radial
directions. This permits a much greater accuracy and resolution in measurements
of correlation functions. We explain the explicit control procedure, outline
the scaling ansatz that we use and briefly discuss the systems where it could
be applied as well as possible experimental obstacles to its implementation.
