We construct the evolution equations for the twist-3 chiral-odd spin
independent fracture functions in QCD. The Gribov-Lipatov reciprocity relation
is fulfilled at the one-loop level for the quasi-partonic two-particle cut
vertices only. It is found that the rang of the anomalous dimensions matrix is
infinite for any given moment of the three-parton fracture function as
distinguished from the case of DIS-distributions where the rang of the matrix
was finite and increases with the number of the moment. In the multicolour
limit $N_c \to \infty$ the evolution equation for the quark-gluon-quark
correlation function decouples from another equation in the system and becomes
homogeneous provided we discard the quark mass effects. This fact provides an
opportunity to find its analytic solution explicitly in nonlocal form similarly
to the DIS.
