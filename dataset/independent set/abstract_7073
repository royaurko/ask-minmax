A general method is described for detecting and analysing galaxy systems. The
multivariate geometrical structure of the sample is studied by using an
extension of the method which we introduced in a previous paper. The method is
based on an estimate of the probability density underlying a data sample. The
density is estimated by using an iterative and adaptive kernel estimator. The
used kernels have spherical symmetry, however we describe a method in order to
estimate the locally optimal shape of the kernels. We use the results of the
geometrical structure analysis in order to study the effects that is has on the
cluster parameter estimate. This suggests a possible way to distinguish between
structure and substructure within a sample. The method is tested by using
simulated numerical models and applied to two galaxy samples taken from the
literature. The results obtained for the Coma cluster suggest a core-halo
structure formed by a large number of geometrically independent systems. A
different conclusion is suggested by the results for the Cancer cluster
indicating the presence of at least two independent structures both containing
substructure. The dynamical consequences of the results obtained from the
geometrical analysis will be described in a later paper. Further applications
of the method are suggested and are currently in progress.
