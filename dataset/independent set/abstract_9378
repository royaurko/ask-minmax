We present measurements of the differential cross section and Lambda recoil
polarization for the gamma p to K+ Lambda reaction made using the CLAS detector
at Jefferson Lab. These measurements cover the center-of-mass energy range from
1.62 to 2.84 GeV and a wide range of center-of-mass K+ production angles.
Independent analyses were performed using the K+ p pi- and K+ p (missing pi -)
final-state topologies; results from these analyses were found to exhibit good
agreement. These differential cross section measurements show excellent
agreement with previous CLAS and LEPS results and offer increased precision and
a 300 MeV increase in energy coverage. The recoil polarization data agree well
with previous results and offer a large increase in precision and a 500 MeV
extension in energy range. The increased center-of-mass energy range that these
data represent will allow for independent study of non-resonant K+ Lambda
photoproduction mechanisms at all production angles.
