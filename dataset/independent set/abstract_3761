We provide a detailed, model-independent, study for CP violation effects
due to the T-odd top-quark electric dipole moment (EDM) and weak dipole
moment (WDM) in the top-quark pair production via $e^+e^-$ and two-photon
annihilation at a next $e^+e^-$ linear collider (NLC). There are two methods in
detecting CP violation effects in these processes. One method makes use of
measurements of various spin correlations in the final decay products of the
produced top-quark pair, while the other is to measure various CP-odd
polarization asymmetry effects of the initial states. In the $e^+e^-$ case only
the first method can be used, and in the $\gamma\gamma$ case both methods can
be employed. We provide a complete classification of angular correlations of
the $t$ and $\bar{t}$ decay products under CP and CP\tilde{T} which greatly
faciliate CP tests in the $e^+e^-$ mode. Concentrating on the second method
with the Compton back-scattered high-energetic laser light off the electron or
positron beam in the two-photon mode, we construct two CP-odd and
CP\tilde{T}-even initial polarization configurations and apply them to
investigating CP-violating effects due to the top-quark EDM. With a typical
set of experimental parameters at the NLC, we compare the 1-\sigma
sensitivities to the top-quark EDM and WDM in the $e^+e^-$ mode and the
two-photon mode. Some model expectation values of the T-odd parameters are
compared with the results.
