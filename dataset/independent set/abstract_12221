We have estimated the size of the light-shifts due to parity nonconservation
(PNC) interactions in different isotopes of Ba+ and Ra+ ions based on the work
of Fortson [Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2383 (1993)]. We have used the nuclear spin
independent (NSI) amplitudes calculated earlier by us [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96,
163003 (2006); Phys. Rev. A 78, 050501(R) (2008)] and we have employed the
third order many-body perturbation theory (MBPT(3)) in this work to estimate
the nuclear spin dependent (NSD) amplitudes in these ions. Ra+ is found to be
more favourable than Ba+ for measuring both the NSI and NSD PNC observables.
