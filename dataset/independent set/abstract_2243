The energy emission involved in a Gamma-Ray Burst evidently can be estimated
only provided that we know the distance to the source. The same is true for the
peak energy of the event in the source rest frame. Redshifts have been actually
measured only for about 40 events. In order to check if it is possible to
extend the $E_{peak}^{rest}$ - $E_{rad}$ relation originally found by
\citet{Am02} to a larger number of events, we make use of the pseudo-redshift
estimate proposed by \citet{Att03} and of the spectra published by
\citet{Band93}. We thus obtain a completely independent set of events which
indeed follows the same $E_{peak}^{rest}$ - $E_{rad}$ relation and confirms it.
