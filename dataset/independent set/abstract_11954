We study the persistent random walk of photons on a one-dimensional lattice
of random asymmetric transmittances. Each site is characterized by its
intensity transmittance t (t') for photons moving to the right (left)
direction. Transmittances at different sites are assumed independent,
distributed according to a given probability density Distribution. We use the
effective medium approximation and identify two classes of probability density
distribution of transmittances which lead to the normal diffusion of photons.
Monte Carlo simulations confirm our predictions.
