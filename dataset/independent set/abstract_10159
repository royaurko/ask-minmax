We prove an algebraic extension theorem for the computably enumerable sets,
$\mathcal{E}$. Using this extension theorem and other work we then show if $A$
and $\hat{A}$ are automorphic via $\Psi$ then they are automorphic via
$\Lambda$ where $\Lambda \restriction \L^*(A) = \Psi$ and $\Lambda \restriction
\E^*(A)$ is $\Delta^0_3$. We give an algebraic description of when an arbitrary
set $\Ahat$ is in the orbit of a \ce set $A$. We construct the first example of
a definable orbit which is not a $\Delta^0_3$ orbit. We conclude with some
results which restrict the ways one can increase the complexity of orbits. For
example, we show that if $A$ is simple and $\hat{A}$ is in the same orbit as
$A$ then they are in the same $\Delta^0_6$-orbit and furthermore we provide a
classification of when two simple sets are in the same orbit.
