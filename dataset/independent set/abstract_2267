We consider the statistical mechanics of a full set of two-dimensional
protein-like heteropolymers, whose thermodynamics is characterized by the
coil-to-globular ($T_\theta$) and the folding ($T_f$) transition temperatures.
For our model, the typical time scale for reaching the unique native
conformation is shown to scale as $\tau_f\sim F(M)\exp(\sigma/\sigma_0)$, where
$\sigma=1-T_f/T_\theta$, $M$ is the number of residues, and $F(M)$ scales
algebraically with $M$. We argue that $T_f$ scales linearly with the inverse of
entropy of low energy non-native states, whereas $T_\theta$ is almost
independent of it. As $\sigma\rightarrow 0$, non-productive intermediates
decrease, and the initial rapid collapse of the protein leads to structures
resembling the native state. Based solely on {\it accessible} information,
$\sigma$ can be used to predict sequences that fold rapidly.
