I compute the complete two-loop effective potential for the minimal
supersymmetric standard model in the Landau gauge. This enables an accurate
determination of the minimization conditions for the vacuum expectation values
of the Higgs fields. Checks on the result follow from supersymmetric limits and
from renormalization-scale invariance. The renormalization group equations for
the field-independent vacuum energy and the vacuum expectation values are also
presented. I provide numerical examples showing the improved accuracy and scale
dependence obtained with the full two-loop effective potential.
