We investigate the eigenvalue statistics of random Bernoulli matrices, where
the matrix elements are chosen independently from a binary set with equal
probability. This is achieved by initiating a discrete random walk process over
the space of matrices and analysing the induced random motion of the
eigenvalues - an approach which is similar to Dyson's Brownian motion model but
with important modifications. In particular, we show our process is described
by a Fokker-Planck equation, up to an error margin which vanishes in the limit
of large matrix dimension. The stationary solution of which corresponds to the
joint probability density function of certain well-known fixed trace Gaussian
ensembles.
