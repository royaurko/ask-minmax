We investigate the effect of a Quantum Gravity-induced minimal length on
neutrino oscillations. The minimal length is implemented in a phenomenological
framework, allowing us to make predictions independently of any fundamental
approach. We obtain clear minimal length signatures and discuss their
observability in current and future experiments. We present an overview over
other scenarios in which the minimal length leaves its signature and show new
results concerning minimal length thermodynamics.
