The magnetization and hole distribution of Mn clusters in (Ga,Mn)As are
investigated by all-electron total energy calculations using the projector
augmented wave method within the density-functional formalism. It is found that
the energetically most favorable clusters consist of Mn atoms surrounding one
center As atom. As the Mn cluster grows the hole band at the Fermi level splits
increasingly and the hole distribution gets increasingly localized at the
center As atom. The hole distribution at large distances from the cluster does
not depend significantly on the cluster size. As a consequence, the spin-flip
energy differences of distant clusters are essentially independent of the
cluster size. The Curie temperature $T_C$ is estimated directly from these
spin-flip energies in the mean field approximation. When clusters are present
estimated $T_C$ values are around 250 K independent of Mn concentration whereas
for a uniform Mn distribution we estimate a $T_C$ of about 600 K.
