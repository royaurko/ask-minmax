Particle correlations and fluctuations measured by RHIC experiments at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=130 GeV were discussed. The source size parameters were similar
to those measured at the CERN-SPS, and no long duration time of particle
emission were observed. It was pointed out that the dependences of longitudinal
and transverse radius parameters on the pair momentum are explained with a
single $m_T$ scaling function observed at the SPS energy. Fluctuation studies
of mean $p_{T}$ of charged particles and of mean $E_{T}$ in an electromagnetic
calorimeter found no significant non-statistical fluctuations by PHENIX, but
some indication in charge independent $<p_T>$ by STAR.
