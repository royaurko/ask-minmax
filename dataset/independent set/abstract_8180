A transcendental function usually returns transcendental values at algebraic
points. The (algebraic) exceptions form the so-called \emph{exceptional set},
as for instance the unitary set $\{0\}$ for the function $f(z) = e^z \,$,
according to the Hermite-Lindemann theorem. In this note, we give some explicit
examples of transcendental entire functions whose exceptional set are empty.
