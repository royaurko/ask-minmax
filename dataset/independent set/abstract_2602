For entangled states of light both the amount of entanglement and the
sensitivity to noise generally increase with the number of photons in the
state. The entanglement-sensitivity tradeoff is investigated for a particular
set of states, multi-dimensional entangled coherent states. Those states
possess an arbitrarily large amount of entanglement $E$ provided the number of
photons is at least of order $2^{2E}$. We calculate how fast that entanglement
decays due to photon absorption losses and how much entanglement is left. We
find that for very small losses the amount of entanglement lost is equal to
$2/\log(2)\approx 2.89$ ebits per absorbed photon, irrespective of the amount
of pure-state entanglement $E$ one started with. In contrast, for larger losses
it tends to be the remaining amount of entanglement that is independent of $E$.
This may provide a useful strategy for creating states with a fixed amount of
entanglement.
