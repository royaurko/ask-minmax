The DELPHI experiment at the LEP e+e- collider collected almost 700 pb^-1 at
centre-of-mass energies above the Z0 mass pole and up to 208 GeV. Those data
were used to search for SUSY in the Anomaly Mediated SUSY Breaking (AMSB)
scenario with a flavour independent common sfermion mass parameter. The
searches covered several possible signatures experimentally accessible at LEP,
with either the neutralino, the sneutrino or the stau being the Lightest
Supersymmetric Particle (LSP). They included: the search for nearly
mass-degenerate chargino and neutralino, which is a typical feature of AMSB;
the search for Standard-Model-like or invisibly decaying Higgs boson; the
search for stable staus; the search for cascade decays of SUSY particles
resulting in the LSP and a low multiplicity final state containing neutrinos.
No evidence of a signal was found, and thus constraints were set in the space
of the parameters of the model.
