The ground state of the S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferomagnet on kagome can be
viewed as a collection of fermionic spinons bound into small, heavy singlet
pairs. Low-energy magnetic excitations in this system correspond to breaking
the pairs into individual spinons. We calculate the structure factor for
inelastic neutron scattering from independent spinon pairs.
