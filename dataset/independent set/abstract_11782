An infinite particle system of independent jumping particles is considered.
Their constructions is recalled, further properties are derived, the relation
with hierarchical equations, Poissonian analysis, and second quantization are
discussed. The hydrodynamic limit for a general initial distribution satisfying
a mixing condition is derived. The large time asymptotic is computed under an
extra assumption.
