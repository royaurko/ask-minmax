There are 2^n possible resolutions of a smooth pseudodiagram with n
precrossings. If we consider piecewise-linear (PL) pseudodiagrams and
resolutions that themselves are PL, certain resolutions of the pseudodiagram
may not exist in three-space. We investigate this situation and its impact on
the weighted resolution set of PL pseudodiagrams as well as introduce a concept
specific to PL pseudodiagrams, the forcing number. Our main result classifies
the PL shadows whose weighted resolution sets differ from the weighted
resolution set that would exist in the smooth case.
