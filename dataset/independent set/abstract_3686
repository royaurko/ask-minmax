We study numerically the dependence of the critical magnetic Reynolds number
Rmc for the turbulent small-scale dynamo on the hydrodynamic Reynolds number
Re. The turbulence is statistically homogeneous, isotropic, and
mirror--symmetric. We are interested in the regime of low magnetic Prandtl
number Pm=Rm/Re<1, which is relevant for stellar convective zones, protostellar
disks, and laboratory liquid-metal experiments. The two asymptotic
possibilities are Rmc->const as Re->infinity (a small-scale dynamo exists at
low Pm) or Rmc/Re=Pmc->const as Re->infinity (no small-scale dynamo exists at
low Pm). Results obtained in two independent sets of simulations of MHD
turbulence using grid and spectral codes are brought together and found to be
in quantitative agreement. We find that at currently accessible resolutions,
Rmc grows with Re with no sign of approaching a constant limit. We reach the
maximum values of Rmc~500 for Re~3000. By comparing simulations with Laplacian
viscosity, fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-order hyperviscosity and Smagorinsky
large-eddy viscosity, we find that Rmc is not sensitive to the particular form
of the viscous cutoff. This work represents a significant extension of the
studies previously published by Schekochihin et al. 2004, PRL 92, 054502 and
Haugen et al. 2004, PRE, 70, 016308 and the first detailed scan of the
numerically accessible part of the stability curve Rmc(Re).
