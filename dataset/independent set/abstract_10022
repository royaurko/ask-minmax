In this work, we consider the numerical estimation of the probability for a
stochastic process to hit a set B before reaching another set A. This event is
assumed to be rare. We consider reactive trajectories of the stochastic
Allen-Cahn partial differential evolution equation (with double well potential)
in dimension 1. Reactive trajectories are defined as the probability
distribution of the trajectories of a stochastic process, conditioned by the
event of hitting B before A. We investigate the use of the so-called Adaptive
Multilevel Splitting algorithm in order to estimate the rare event and simulate
reactive trajectories. This algorithm uses a \emph{reaction coordinate} (a real
valued function of state space defining level sets), and is based on (i) the
selection, among several replicas of the system having hit A before B, of those
with maximal reaction coordinate; (ii) iteration of the latter step. We choose
for the reaction coordinate the average magnetization, and for B the minimum of
the well opposite to the initial condition. We discuss the context, prove that
the algorithm has a sense in the usual functional setting, and numerically test
the method (estimation of rare event, and transition state sampling).
