We show that cosmic-ray observations set a model-independent upper bound to
the flux of high-energy, > 10^14 eV, neutrinos produced by photo-meson (or p-p)
interactions in sources of size not much larger than the proton photo-meson (or
pp) mean-free-path. The bound applies, in particular, to neutrino production by
either AGN jets or GRBs. This upper limit is two orders of magnitude below the
flux predicted in some popular AGN jet models, but is consistent with our
predictions from GRB models. We discuss the implications of these results for
future km^2 high-energy neutrino detectors.
