The intersection volume of two independent 2-level cut Gaussian random fields
is proposed to model the open-cell microstructure of organic aerogels. The
experimentally measured X-ray scattering intensity, surface area and solid
thermal conductivity of both polymeric and colloidal organic aerogels can be
accounted for by the model.
