We revisit and extend previous work on neutrino mediated long range forces in
a backround at finite temperature. For Dirac neutrinos, we correct existing
results. We also give new results concerning spin-dependent as well as
spin-independent long range forces associated to Majorana neutrinos. An
interesting outcome of the investigation is that, for both types of neutrinos
whether massless or not, the effect of the relic neutrino heat bath is to
convert those forces into attractive ones in the supra-millimeter scale while
they stay repulsive within the sub-millimeter scale.
