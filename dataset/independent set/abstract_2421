The complete one-loop radiative corrections to third generation scalar
fermions into gauge bosons Z and W^\pm is considered. We focus on \wt{f}_2 \to
Z \wt{f}_1 and \wt{f}_i \to W^\pm \wt{f'}_j (f,f'=t,b). We include both
SUSY-QCD, QED and full electroweak corrections. It is found that the
electroweak corrections can be of the same order as the SUSY-QCD corrections.
The two sets of corrections interfere destructively in some region of parameter
space. The full one loop correction can reach 10% in some SUGRA scenario, while
in model independent analysis like general MSSM, the one loop correction can
reach 20% for large \tan\beta and large trilinear soft breaking terms A_b.
