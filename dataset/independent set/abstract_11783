We consider portfolio selection when decisions based on a dynamic risk
measure are affected by the use of a moving horizon, and the possible
inconsistencies that this creates. By giving a formal treatment of time
consistency which is independent of Bellman's equations, we show that there is
a new sense in which these decisions can be seen as consistent.
