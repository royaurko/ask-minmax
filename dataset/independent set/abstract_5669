We study domain distributions in the one-dimensional Ising model subject to
zero-temperature Glauber and Kawasaki dynamics. The survival probability of a
domain, $S(t)\sim t^{-\psi}$, and an unreacted domain, $Q_1(t)\sim
t^{-\delta}$, are characterized by two independent nontrivial exponents. We
develop an independent interval approximation that provides close estimates for
many characteristics of the domain length and number distributions including
the scaling exponents.
