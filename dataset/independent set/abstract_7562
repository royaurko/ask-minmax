The strategies recently developed to study Higgs boson properties at the LHC
are reviewed. It is shown how to obtain model-independent determinations of
couplings to fermions and gauge bosons by exploiting different production and
decay channels. We consider the case of Weak Boson Fusion Higgs production with
H decaying into b anti-b
