We show that there exist $(d-1)$ - Ahlfors regular compact sets $E \subset
\mathbb{R}^{d}, d\geq 2$ such that for any $t< d-1$, we have \[ \sup_T
\frac{\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(E\cap T)}{w(T)^t}<\infty \] where the supremum is over
all tubes $T$ with width $w(T) >0$. This settles a question of T. Orponen. The
sets we construct are random Cantor sets, and the method combines geometric and
probabilistic estimates on the intersections of these random Cantor sets with
affine subspaces.
