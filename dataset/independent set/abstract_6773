In this article, we consider the setting of single-valued, smoothly varying
directions of reflection and non-smooth time-dependent domains whose boundary
is H\"{o}lder continuous in time. In this setting, we prove existence and
uniqueness of strong solutions to stochastic differential equations with
oblique reflection. In the same setting, we also prove, using the theory of
viscosity solutions, a comparison principle for viscosity solutions to fully
nonlinear second-order parabolic partial differential equations and, as a
consequence, we obtain existence and uniqueness for this class of equations as
well. Our results are generalizations of two articles by Dupuis and Ishii to
the setting of time-dependent domains.
