In homotopy theory, exact sequences and spectral sequences consist of groups
and pointed sets, linked by actions. We prove that the theory of such exact and
spectral sequences can be established in a categorical setting which is based
on the existence of kernels and cokernels with respect to an assigned ideal of
null morphisms, a generalisation of abelian categories and Puppe-exact
categories.
