We review to what extent charge independence breaking (\emph{CIB}) in isospin
related reactions of the type $NN\to d\pi$ can or could be seen in existing
data. In doing this we present fits to global and threshold cross sections
including most recent data. Applying these we point out the probable
impossibility to make model independent predictions even based solely on the
different threshold energies and the well known $pp\to d\pi^+$. A possible
discrepancy is seen between the $np\to d\pi^0$ and $pp\to d\pi^+$ data, which
may require invoking explicitly isospin symmetry breaking interactions.
