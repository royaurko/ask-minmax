In a general time-dependent (3+1)-dimensional spherically symmetric
spacetime, the so-called Kodama vector is a naturally defined geometric
quantity that is timelike outside the evolving horizon and so defines a
preferred class of fiducial observers. However the Kodama vector does not by
itself define any preferred notion of time. We first extract as much
information as possible by invoking the "warped product" structure of
spherically symmetric spacetime to study the Kodama vector, and the associated
Kodama energy flux, in a coordinate independent manner. Using this formalism we
construct a general class of conservation laws, generalizing Kodama's energy
flux. We then demonstrate that a preferred time coordinate - which we shall
call Kodama time - can be introduced by taking the additional step of applying
the Clebsch decomposition theorem to the Kodama vector. We thus construct a
geometrically preferred coordinate system for any time-dependent spherically
symmetric spacetime, and explore its properties. We study the geometrically
preferred fiducial observers, and demonstrate that it is possible to define and
calculate a generalized notion of surface gravity that is valid throughout the
entire evolving spacetime. Furthermore, by building and suitably normalizing
set of radial null geodesics, we can show that this generalized surface gravity
passes several consistency tests and has a physically appropriate static limit.
