We analyze some relations between quasi-Hopf smash products and certain
twisted tensor products of quasialgebras. Along the way we obtain also some
results of independent interest, such as a duality theorem for finite
dimensional quasi-Hopf algebras and a universal property for generalized
diagonal crossed products.
