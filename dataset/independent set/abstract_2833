We have run two completely independent weak lensing analysis pipelines on a
set of realistic simulated images of a massive galaxy cluster with a singular
isothermal sphere profile (galaxy velocity dispersion sigma_v=1250 km/ sec).
The suite of images was constructed using the simulation tools developed by the
Dark Energy Survey. We find that both weak lensing pipelines can accurately
recover the velocity dispersion of our simulated clusters, suggesting that
current weak lensing tools are accurate enough for measuring the shear profile
of massive clusters in upcoming large photometric surveys. We also demonstrate
how choices of some cuts influence the final shear profile and sigma_v
measurement. Analogously to the STEP program, we make all of these cluster
simulation images publically available for other groups to analyze through
their own weak lensing pipelines.
