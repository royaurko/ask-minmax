Let f be a transcendental entire map that is subhyperbolic, i.e., the
intersection of the Fatou set F(f) and the postsingular set P(f) is compact and
the intersection of the Julia set J(f) and P(f) is finite. Assume that no
asymptotic value of f belongs to J(f) and that the local degree of f at all
points in J(f) is bounded by some finite constant. We prove that there is a
hyperbolic map g (of the form g(z)=f(bz) for some complex number b) with
connected Fatou set such that f and g are semiconjugate on their Julia sets.
Furthermore, we show that this semiconjugacy is a conjugacy when restricted to
the escaping set I(g) of g. In the case where f can be written as a finite
composition of maps of finite order, our theorem, together with recent results
on Julia sets of hyperbolic maps, implies that J(f) is a pinched Cantor
bouquet, consisting of dynamic rays and their endpoints. Our result also seems
to give the first complete description of topological dynamics of an entire
transcendental map whose Julia set is the whole complex plane.
