We report on work studying the properties of the sphaleron in models of the
electroweak interactions with two Higgs doublets in as model-independent a way
as possible: by exploring the physical parameter space described by the masses
and mixing angles of the Higgs particles. If one of the Higgs particles is
heavy, there can be several sphaleron solutions, distinguished by their
properties under parity and the behaviour of the Higgs field at the origin. In
general, these solutions are not spherically symmetric, although the departure
from spherical symmetry is small.
