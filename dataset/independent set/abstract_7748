The first-principles FLAPW-GGA calculations of the elastic properties of
recently discovered superconducting LiFeAs are reported. The independent
elastic constants (Cij), bulk modulus, compressibility, and shear modulus are
evaluated and discussed. Additionally, numerical estimates of the elastic
parameters of the polycrystalline LiFeAs ceramics are performed for the first
time.
