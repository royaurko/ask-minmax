We bound two global invariants of cusped hyperbolic manifolds: the length of
the shortest closed geodesic (the systole), and the radius of the biggest
embedded ball (the inradius). We give an upper bound for the systole, expressed
in terms of the dimension and simplicial volume. We find a positive lower bound
on the inradius independent of the dimension. These bounds are sharp in
dimension 3, realized by the Gieseking manifold. It provides a new
characterization of this manifold.
