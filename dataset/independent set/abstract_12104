We derive H\"older regularity estimates for operators associated with a time
independent Schr\"odinger operator of the form $-\Delta+V$. The results are
obtained by checking a certain condition on the function $T1$. Our general
method applies to get regularity estimates for maximal operators and square
functions of the heat and Poisson semigroups, for Laplace transform type
multipliers and also for Riesz transforms and negative powers
$(-\Delta+V)^{-\gamma/2}$, all of them in a unified way.
