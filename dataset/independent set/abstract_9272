This paper presents novel techniques for the synthesis of reversible networks
of Toffoli gates, as well as improvements to previous methods. Gate count and
technology oriented cost metrics are used. Our synthesis techniques are
independent of the cost metrics. Two new iterative synthesis procedure
employing Reed-Muller spectra are introduced and shown to complement earlier
synthesis approaches. The template simplification suggested in earlier work is
enhanced through introduction of a faster and more efficient template
application algorithm, updated (shorter) classification of the templates, and
presentation of the new templates of sizes 7 and 9. A novel ``resynthesis''
approach is introduced wherein a sequence of gates is chosen from a network,
and the reversible specification it realizes is resynthesized as an independent
problem in hopes of reducing the network cost. Empirical results are presented
to show that the methods are effective both in terms of the realization of all
3x3 reversible functions and larger reversible benchmark specifications.
