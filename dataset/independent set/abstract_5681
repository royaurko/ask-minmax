We present a new Monte Carlo algorithm that produces results of high accuracy
with reduced simulational effort. Independent random walks are performed
(concurrently or serially) in different, restricted ranges of energy, and the
resultant density of states is modified continuously to produce locally flat
histograms. This method permits us to directly access the free energy and
entropy, is independent of temperature, and is efficient for the study of both
1st order and 2nd order phase transitions. It should also be useful for the
study of complex systems with a rough energy landscape.
