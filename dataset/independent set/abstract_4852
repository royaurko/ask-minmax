Background: Significance analysis plays a major role in identifying and
ranking genes, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation regions, and
other high-throughput features for association with disease. We propose a new
approach, called gene set bagging, for measuring the stability of ranking
procedures using predefined gene sets. Gene set bagging involves resampling the
original high-throughput data, performing gene-set analysis on the resampled
data, and confirming that biological categories replicate. This procedure can
be thought of as bootstrapping gene-set analysis and can be used to determine
which are the most reproducible gene sets. Results: Here we apply this approach
to two common genomics applications: gene expression and DNA methylation. Even
with state-of-the-art statistical ranking procedures, significant categories in
a gene set enrichment analysis may be unstable when subjected to resampling.
Conclusions: We demonstrate that gene lists are not necessarily stable, and
therefore additional steps like gene set bagging can improve biological
inference of gene set analysis.
