Confounding of three binary-variables counterfactual model is discussed in
this paper. According to the effect between the control variable and the
covariate variable, we investigate three counterfactual models: the control
variable is independent of the covariate variable, the control variable has the
effect on the covariate variable and the covariate variable affects the control
variable. Using the ancillary information based on conditional independence
hypotheses, the sufficient conditions to determine whether the covariate
variable is an irrelevant factor or a confounder in each counterfactual model
are obtained.
