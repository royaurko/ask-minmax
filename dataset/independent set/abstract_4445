We parametrize in a model-independent way possible departures from the
minimal Standard Model predictions in the matter sector. We only assume the
symmetry breaking pattern of the Standard Model and that new particles are
sufficiently heavy so that the symmetry is non-linearly realized. Models with
dynamical symmetry breaking are generically of this type. We review in the
effective theory language to what extent the simplest models of dynamical
breaking are actually constrained and the assumptions going into the comparison
with experiment. Dynamical symmetry breaking models can be approximated at
intermediate energies by four-fermion operators. We present a complete
classification of the latter when new particles appear in the usual
representations of the $SU(2)_L\times SU(3)_c$ group as well as a partial
classification in the general case. We discuss the accuracy of the four-fermion
description by matching to a simple `fundamental' theory. The coefficients of
the effective lagrangian in the matter sector for dynamical symmetry breaking
models (expressed in terms of the coefficients of the four-quark operators) are
then compared to those of models with elementary scalars (such as the minimal
Standard Model). Contrary to a somewhat widespread belief, we see that the sign
of the vertex corrections is not fixed in dynamical symmetry breaking models.
This work provides the theoretical tools required to analyze, in a rather
general setting, constraints on the matter sector of the Standard Model.
