We investigate the recent - low redshift - expansion history of the universe
using the most recent observational data. Using only data from 42 measurements
of $f_{gas}$ in clusters, we found that cosmic acceleration could have already
peaked and we are witnessing now its slowing down. This effect, found
previously by Shafieloo, Sahni and Starobinsky in 2010 using supernova data (at
that time the Constitution SNIa sample) appears again using an independent
observational probe. We also discuss the result using the most recent Union 2.1
data set.
