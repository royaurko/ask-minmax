In this paper we prove {\it a priori bounds} for infinitely renormalizable
quadratic polynomials satisfying a ``molecule condition''. Roughly speaking,
this condition ensures that the renormalization combinatorics stay away from
the satellite types. These {\it a priori bounds} imply local connectivity of
the corresponding Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set at the corresponding
parameter values.
