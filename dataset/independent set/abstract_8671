In this note a very crude but simple approximation to the set of separable
states in an arbitrary simplex of commutative states is given using the fact
that on the lines connecting the maximally mixed state and an arbitrary pure
state the positivity of the partial transpose is both necessary and sufficient
condition for separability of states. The lower limit to the volume of
separable states in a simplex is slightly improved.
