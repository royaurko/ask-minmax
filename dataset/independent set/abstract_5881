We prove an analogue of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem (that the
exponentials of Q-linearly independent algebraic numbers are algebraically
independent) for commutative algebraic groups G without unipotent quotients,
over function fields. We concentrate on solutions to the the differential
algebraic relations satisfied by exp from LG to G.
