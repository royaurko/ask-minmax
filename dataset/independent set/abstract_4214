The cryogenic dark matter experiment CRESST-II aims at the direct detection
of WIMPs via elastic scattering off nuclei in scintillating CaWO$_4$ crystals.
We present a new, highly improved, detector design installed in the current run
of CRESST-II Phase 2 with an efficient active rejection of surface-alpha
backgrounds. Using CaWO$_4$ sticks to hold the target crystal a detector
housing with fully-scintillating inner surface could be realized. The presented
detector (TUM40) provides an excellent threshold of ${\sim}\,0.60\,$keV and a
resolution of $\sigma\,{\approx}\,0.090\,$keV (at 2.60$\,$keV). With
significantly reduced background levels, TUM40 sets stringent limits on the
spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section and probes a new region
of parameter space for WIMP masses below 3$\,$GeV/c$^2$. In this paper, we
discuss the novel detector design and the surface-alpha event rejection in
detail.
