In this paper we present a wavelet based algorithm that is able to detect
superimposed periodic signals in data with low signal-noise ratio. In this
context, the results given by classical period determination methods highly
depend on the intrinsic characteristics of each periodic signal, like amplitude
or profile. It is then difficult to detect the different periods present in the
data set. The results given by the wavelet based method for period
determination we present here are independent of the characteristics of the
signals.
