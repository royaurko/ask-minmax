A theory in which 16-dimensional curved Clifford space (C-space) provides a
realization of Kaluza-Klein theory is investigated. No extra dimensions of
spacetime are needed: "extra dimensions" are in C-space. We explore the spin
gauge theory in C-space and show that the generalized spin connection contains
the usual 4-dimensional gravity and Yang-Mills fields of the U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3)
gauge group. The representation space for the latter group is provided by
16-component generalized spinors composed of four usual 4-component spinors,
defined geometrically as the members of four independent minimal left ideals of
Clifford algebra.
