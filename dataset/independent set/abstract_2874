Dark matter (DM) has been searched for at colliders in a largely model
independent fashion by looking for an excess number of events involving a
single jet, or photon, and missing energy. We investigate the possibility of
looking for excesses in more inclusive jet channels. Events with multiple jets
contain more information and thus more handles to increase the signal to
background ratio. In particular, we adapt the recent CMS "razor" analysis from
a search for supersymmetry to a search for DM. We consider simplified models
where DM is a Dirac fermion that couples to the quarks of the Standard Model
(SM) through exchange of vector or axial-vector mediators or to gluons through
scalar exchange. We consider both light and heavy (leading to effective contact
interactions) mediators. Since the razor analysis requires multiple jets in the
final state, the data set is complementary to that used for the monojet search
and thus the bounds can be combined.
