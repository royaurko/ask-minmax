We give a description of the level sets in the higher dimensional
multifractal formalism for infinite conformal graph directed Markov systems. If
these systems possess a certain degree of regularity this description is
complete in the sense that we identify all values with non-empty level sets and
determine their Hausdorff dimension. This result is also partially new for the
finite alphabet case.
