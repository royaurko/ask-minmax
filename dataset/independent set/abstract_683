We investigate coordinate independent SO(9) vector states in SU(2) Matrix
theory. There are 36 vector states, and we determine what representations of
SU(2) they are decomposed into. Among them we find a unique set of states
transforming in adjoint representation. We show that this set of states can
appear as the linear term in the coordinate matrices in Taylor expansion of
zero energy bound state wavefunction around the origin i.e. it satisfies the
condition of full supersymmetry.
