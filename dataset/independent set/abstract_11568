Using a semi-classical approach and input from experiments on the
conductivity of graphene, we determine the electronic density dependence of the
electronic transport coefficients -- conductivity, thermal conductivity and
thermopower -- of doped graphene. Also the electronic density dependence of the
optical conductivity is obtained. Finally we show that the classical Hall
effect (low field) in graphene has the same form as for the independent
electron case, characterized by a parabolic dispersion, as long as the
relaxation time is proportional to the momentum.
