In a recent joint work with D.A. Goldston and C.Y. Yildirim we just missed by
a hairbreadth a proof that bounded gaps between primes occur infinitely often.
In the present work it is shown that adding to the primes a much thinner set,
called almost prime powers, the union of the set of primes and almost prime
powers contains already infinitely many bounded gaps. More precisely it is
shown that if we add to the set of primes either almost prime squares having
exactly two, nearly equal prime factors or if we add to the set of primes
almost prime cubes having exactly three, nearly equal prime factors, then the
resulting set contains already infinitely many bounded gaps.
