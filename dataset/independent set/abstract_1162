The Bariev model with open boundary conditions is introduced and analysed in
detail in the framework of the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method. Two classes
of independent boundary reflecting $K$-matrices leading to four different types
of boundary fields are obtained by solving the reflection equations. The models
are exactly solved by means of the algebraic nested Bethe ansatz method and the
four sets of Bethe ansatz equations as well as their corresponding energy
expressions are derived.
