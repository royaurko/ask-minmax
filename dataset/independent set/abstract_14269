This note addresses the question if and why the nuclear norm heuristic can
recover an impulse response generated by a stable single-real-pole system, if
elements of the upper-triangle of the associated Hankel matrix were given.
  Since the setting is deterministic, theories based on stochastic assumptions
for low-rank matrix recovery do not apply here. A 'certificate' which
guarantees the completion is constructed by exploring the structural
information of the hidden matrix. Experimental results and discussions
regarding the nuclear norm heuristic applied to a more general setting are also
given.
