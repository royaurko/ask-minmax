This announcement describes a probabilistic approach to cascades which, in
addition to providing an entirely probabilistic proof of the Kahane-Peyri\`ere
theorem for independent cascades, readily applies to general dependent
cascades. Moreover, this unifies various seemingly disparate cascade
decompositions, including Kahane's T-martingale decomposition and dimension
disintegration.
