We give bit-size estimates for the coefficients appearing in triangular sets
describing positive-dimensional algebraic sets defined over Q. These estimates
are worst case upper bounds; they depend only on the degree and height of the
underlying algebraic sets. We illustrate the use of these results in the
context of a modular algorithm. This extends results by the first and last
contributor, which were confined to the case of dimension 0. Our strategy is to get
back to dimension 0 by evaluation and inter- polation techniques. Even though
the main tool (height theory) remains the same, new difficulties arise to
control the growth of the coefficients during the interpolation process.
