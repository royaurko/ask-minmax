We investigate the typical cycle lengths, the total number of cycles, and the
number of finite cycles in random permutations whose probability involves cycle
weights. Typical cycle lengths and total number of cycles depend strongly on
the parameters, while the distributions of finite cycles are usually
independent Poisson random variables.
