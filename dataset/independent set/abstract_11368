Consider an $N\times N$ hermitian random matrix with independent entries, not
necessarily Gaussian, a so called Wigner matrix. It has been conjectured that
the local spacing distribution, i.e. the distribution of the distance between
nearest neighbour eigenvalues in some part of the spectrum is, in the limit as
$N\to\infty$, the same as that of hermitian random matrices from GUE. We prove
this conjecture for a certain subclass of hermitian Wigner matrices.
