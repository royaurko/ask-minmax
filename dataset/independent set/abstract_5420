During early 1980s, the so-called `escape time' method, developed to display
the Julia sets for complex dynamical systems, was exported to quaternions in
order to draw analogous pictures in this wider numerical field. Despite of the
fine results in the complex plane, where all topological configurations of
Julia sets have been successfully displayed, the `escape time' method fails to
render properly the non-filled-in variety of quaternionic Julia sets. So their
digital visualisation remained an open problem for several years. Both the
solution for extending this old method to non-filled-in quaternionic Julia sets
and its implementation into a program are explained here.
