We give a complete set of 19 independent effective dimension 5 interactions
involving the top and bottom quarks with the electroweak gauge bosons within
the context of the chiral Lagrangian. The anomalous operators contribute to the
leading energy power E^3 of the V_L V_L -> t\bar t or t\bar b amplitudes. We
also show the top quark production rates at the LHC and the LC via V_L V_L
fusion processes. If no anomalous production rate is found, then these
coefficients can be bound (based on the naive dimensional analysis) to be of
order 10^{-2} or 10^{-1}. This is about an order of magnitude more stringent
than the bounds for the next-to-leading order bosonic operators commonly
studied in V_L V_L -> V_L V_L scatterings. The effect on a CP-odd observable is
also briefly discussed.
