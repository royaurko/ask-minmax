Let A be a finite set with at least two elements. The composition of two
classes I and J of operations on A, is defined as the set of all compositions
of functions in I with functions in J. This binary operation gives a monoid
structure to the set E_A of all equational classes of operations on A. The set
E_A of equational classes of operations on A also constitutes a complete
distributive lattice under intersection and union. Clones of operations, i.e.
classes containing all projections and idempotent under class composition, also
form a lattice which is strictly contained in E_A. In the Boolean case |A|=2,
the lattice E_A contains uncountably many equational classes, but only
countably many of them are clones. The aim of this paper is to provide a better
understanding of this uncountable lattice of equational classes of Boolean
functions, by analyzing its "closed" intervals" [C_1,C_2], for clones C_1 and
C_2. For |A|=2, we give a complete classification of all such closed intervals
in terms of their size, and provide a simple, necessary and sufficient
condition characterizing the uncountable closed intervals of E_A.
