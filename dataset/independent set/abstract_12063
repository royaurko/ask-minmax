In MHD symmetric systems the equilibrium physical quantities are dependent on
two variables only. In this cases it is possible to find a magnetic surface
function that has the same symmetry. Under the assumption that the metric
determinant is also independent of a third, ignorable coordinate, a general MHD
equilibrium equation in curvilinear coordinates is deduced. This equation is
specially useful when non-orthogonal generalized coordinates are used.
