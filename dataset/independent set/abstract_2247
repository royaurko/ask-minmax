We use a very large simulation of the concordance LCDM cosmogony to study the
clustering of dark matter haloes. For haloes less massive than about
1e13Msun/h, the amplitude of the two-point correlation function on large scales
depends strongly on halo formation time. Haloes that assembled at high redshift
are substantially more clustered than those that assembled more recently. The
effect is a smooth function of halo formation time and its amplitude increases
with decreasing halo mass. At 1e11 Msun/h the ``oldest'' 10% of haloes are more
than 5 times more strongly correlated than the ``youngest'' 10%. This
unexpected result is incompatible with the standard excursion set theory for
structure growth, and it contradicts a fundamental assumption of the halo
occupation distribution models often used to study galaxy clustering, namely
that the galaxy content of a halo of given mass is statistically independent of
its larger scale environment.
