We consider the dynamics of a single probe brane on various cosmological
brane backgrounds. The on-shell condition of the static probe brane leads to
the supersymmetric intersection rules for static BPS configurations, though the
cosmological backgrounds do not preserve any supersymmetries. This is a
remarkable feature associated with the cosmological backgrounds because in the
static background the on-shell condition of the static brane gives no
constraint on the brane configuration. Furthermore, it follows that under this
condition there is no velocity-independent force for the probe brane even on
the cosmological backgrounds.
