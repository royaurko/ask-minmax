Particle production in Au+Au collisions has been measured in the PHOBOS
experiment at RHIC for a range of collision energies. Three empirical
observations have emerged from this dataset which require theoretical
examination. First, there is clear evidence of limiting fragmentation. Namely,
particle production in central Au+Au collisions, when expressed as $dN/d\eta'$
($\eta' \equiv \eta-y_{beam}$), becomes energy independent at high energy for a
broad region of $\eta'$ around $\eta'=0$. This energy-independent region grows
with energy, allowing only a limited region (if any) of longitudinal
boost-invariance. Second, there is a striking similarity between particle
production in e+e- and Au+Au collisions (scaled by the number of participating
nucleon pairs). Both the total number of produced particles and the
longitudinal distribution of produced particles are approximately the same in
e+e- and in scaled Au+Au. This observation was not predicted and has not been
explained. Finally, particle production has been found to scale approximately
with the number of participating nucleon pairs for $N_{part}>65$. This scaling
occurs both for the total multiplicity and for high $\pT$ particles (3 $<\pT<$
4.5 GeV/c).
