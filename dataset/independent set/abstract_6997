We define the Gabor wave front set $WF_G(u)$ of a tempered distribution $u$
in terms of rapid decay of its Gabor coefficients in a conic subset of the
phase space. We show the inclusion $$WF_G(a^w(x,D) u) \subseteq WF_G(u), u \in
\mathscr S'(\mathbb R^d), a \in S_{0,0}^0,$$ where $S_{0,0}^0$ denotes the
H\"ormander symbol class of order zero and parameter values zero. We compare
our definition with other definitions in the literature, namely the classical
and the global wave front sets of H\"ormander, and the $\cS$-wave front set of
Coriasco and Maniccia. In particular, we prove that the Gabor wave front set
and the global wave front set of H\"ormander coincide.
