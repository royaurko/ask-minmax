The paper presents an overview of the Spoken Language Translator (SLT)
system's hybrid language-processing architecture, focussing on the way in which
rule-based and statistical methods are combined to achieve robust and efficient
performance within a linguistically motivated framework. In general, we argue
that rules are desirable in order to encode domain-independent linguistic
constraints and achieve high-quality grammatical output, while corpus-derived
statistics are needed if systems are to be efficient and robust; further, that
hybrid architectures are superior from the point of view of portability to
architectures which only make use of one type of information. We address the
topics of ``multi-engine'' strategies for robust translation; robust bottom-up
parsing using pruning and grammar specialization; rational development of
linguistic rule-sets using balanced domain corpora; and efficient supervised
training by interactive disambiguation. All work described is fully implemented
in the current version of the SLT-2 system.
