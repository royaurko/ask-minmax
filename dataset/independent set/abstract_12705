In this paper, we first investigate several rigidity problems for
hypersurfaces in the warped product manifolds with constant linear combinations
of higher order mean curvatures as well as "weighted'' mean curvatures, which
extend the work \cite{Mon, Brendle,BE} considering constant mean curvature
functions. Secondly, we obtain the rigidity results for hypersurfaces in the
space forms with constant linear combinations of intrinsic Gauss-Bonnet
curvatures $L_k$. To achieve this, we develop some new kind of Newton-Maclaurin
type inequalities on $L_k$ which may have independent interest.
