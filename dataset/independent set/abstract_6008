We employ a SUSY-model-independent method to examine the remaining evidence
for the low mass dark matter. Using the XENON100's recent result of 224.6 live
days $\times$ 34kg exposure and PICASSO's result published in 2009, we have
obtained a constrain of couplings, $\| {{a_n}} \| < 0.6$ and $\| {{a_p}} \| <
1.0$, corresponding to the spin-dependent cross section of ${\sigma_n} < 5.6
\times {10^{- 38}}$cm$^{2}$ and ${\sigma_p} < 1.6 \times {10^{- 37}}$cm$^{2}$.
Spin-independent isospin violating dark matter model also failed to reconcile
the recent result from XENON100 with the positive results from DAMA and CoGeNT.
