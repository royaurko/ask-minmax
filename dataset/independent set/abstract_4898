We analyze the effect of disorder and notches on crack roughness in two
dimensions. Our simulation results based on large system sizes and extensive
statistical sampling indicate that the crack surface exhibits a universal local
roughness of $\zeta_{loc} = 0.71$ and is independent of the initial notch size
and disorder in breaking thresholds. The global roughness exponent scales as
$\zeta = 0.87$ and is also independent of material disorder. Furthermore, we
note that the statistical distribution of crack profile height fluctuations is
also independent of material disorder and is described by a Gaussian
distribution, albeit deviations are observed in the tails.
