We extend the insertion approach for calculating depletion potentials to the
case of non-spherical solutes. Instead of a brute-force calculation we suggest
to employ the recently developed curvature expansion of density profiles close
to complexly shaped walls. The approximations introduced in the calculation by
the use of the curvature expansion and of weight functions for non-spherical
objects can be tested independently. As an application for our approach we
calculate and discuss the depletion potential between two hard oblate
ellipsoids in a solvent of hard spheres. For this system we calculate the
entropic force and torque acting on the objects.
