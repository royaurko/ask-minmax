We present recent progress within the NNPDF parton analysis framework. After
a brief review of the results from the DIS NNPDF analysis, NNPDF1.0, we discuss
results from an updated analysis with independent parametrizations for the
strange and anti-strange distributions, denoted by NNPDF1.1. We examine the
phenomenological implications of this improved analysis for the strange PDFs.
