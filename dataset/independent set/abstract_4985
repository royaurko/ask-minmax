We study the impact of recent B-factories measurements and upper limit of
radiative and semileptonic rare B-decays. We present model independent
constraints on the relevant Wilson coefficients and show the impact on the
parameter space of some concrete realizations of the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model.
