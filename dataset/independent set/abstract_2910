A new channel coding approach was proposed in [1] for random multiple access
communication over the discrete-time memoryless channel. The coding approach
allows users to choose their communication rates independently without sharing
the rate information among each other or with the receiver. The receiver will
either decode the message or report a collision depending on whether reliable
message recovery is possible. It was shown that, asymptotically as the codeword
length goes to infinity, the set of communication rates supporting reliable
message recovery can be characterized by an achievable region which equals
Shannon's information rate region possibly without a convex hull operation. In
this paper, we derive achievable bounds on error probabilities, including the
decoding error probability and the collision miss detection probability, of
random multiple access systems with a finite codeword length. Achievable error
exponents are obtained by taking the codeword length to infinity.
