A tropical complete intersection curve C in R^(n+1) is a transversal
intersection of n smooth tropical hypersurfaces. We give a formula for the
number of vertices of C given by the degrees of the tropical hypersurfaces. We
also compute the genus of C (defined as the number of independent cycles of C)
when C is smooth and connected.
