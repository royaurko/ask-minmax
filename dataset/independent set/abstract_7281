We study the dynamics of the Forced Logistic Map in the cylinder. We compute
a bifurcation diagram in terms of the dynamics of the attracting set. Different
properties of the attracting set are considered, as the Lyapunov exponent and,
in the case of having a periodic invariant curve, its period and its
reducibility. This reveals that the parameter values for which the invariant
curve doubles its period are contained in regions of the parameter space where
the invariant curve is reducible. Then we present two additional studies to
explain this fact. In first place we consider the images and the preimages of
the critical set (the set where the derivative of the map w.r.t the
non-periodic coordinate is equal to zero). Studying these sets we construct
constrains in the parameter space for the reducibility of the invariant curve.
In second place we consider the reducibility loss of the invariant curve as
codimension one bifurcation and we study its interaction with the period
doubling bifurcation. This reveals that, if the reducibility loss and the
period doubling bifurcation curves meet, they do it in a tangent way.
