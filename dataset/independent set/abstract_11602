In this manuscript we present a comprehensive study on the multifractal
properties of high-frequency price fluctuations and instantaneous volatility of
the equities that compose Dow Jones Industrial Average. The analysis consists
about quantification of dependence and non-Gaussianity on the multifractal
character of financial quantities. Our results point out an equivalent
influence of dependence and non-Gaussianity on the multifractality of time
series. Moreover, we analyse l-diagrams of price fluctuations. In the latter
case, we show that the fractal dimension of these maps is basically independent
of the lag between price fluctuations that we assume.
