We compute the Hausdorff dimension of sets of very well approximable vectors
on rational quadrics. We use ubiquitous systems and the geometry of locally
symmetric spaces. As a byproduct we obtain the Hausdorff dimension of the set
of rays with a fixed maximal singular direction, which move away into one end
of a locally symmetric space at linear depth, infinitely many times.
