Force-clamp spectroscopy reveals the unfolding and disulfide bond rupture
times of single protein molecules as a function of the stretching force, point
mutations and solvent conditions. The statistics of these times reveal whether
the protein domains are independent of one another, the mechanical hierarchy in
the polyprotein chain, and the functional form of the probability distribution
from which they originate. It is therefore important to use robust statistical
tests to decipher the correct theoretical model underlying the process. Here we
develop multiple techniques to compare the well-established experimental data
set on ubiquitin with existing theoretical models as a case study. We show that
robustness against filtering, agreement with a maximum likelihood function that
takes into account experimental artifacts, the Kuiper statistic test and
alignment with synthetic data all identify the Weibull or stretched exponential
distribution as the best fitting model. Our results are inconsistent with
recently proposed models of Gaussian disorder in the energy landscape or noise
in the applied force as explanations for the observed non-exponential kinetics.
Since the physical model in the fit affects the characteristic unfolding time,
these results have important implications on our understanding of the
biological function of proteins.
