We give necessary and sufficient conditions that two sets of positive real
numbers must satisfy in order to be realizable as eigenemittances and projected
emittances of a beam matrix. The information provided by these conditions sets
limits on what one can to achieve when designing a beam line to perform
advanced emittance manipulations.
