We build convergent discretizations and semi-implicit solvers for the
Infinity Laplacian and the game theoretical $p$-Laplacian. The discretizations
simplify and generalize earlier ones. We prove convergence of the solution of
the Wide Stencil finite difference schemes to the unique viscosity solution of
the underlying equation. We build a semi-implicit solver, which solves the
Laplace equation as each step. It is fast in the sense that the number of
iterations is independent of the problem size. This is an improvement over
previous explicit solvers, which are slow due to the CFL-condition.
