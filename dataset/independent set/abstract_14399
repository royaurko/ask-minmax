In 1989, Godreche and Luck introduced the concept of local mixtures of
primitive substitution rules along the example of the well-known Fibonacci
substitution and foreshadowed heuristic results on the topological entropy and
the spectral type of the diffraction measure of associated point sets. In this
contribution, we present a generalisation of this concept by regarding the
so-called 'noble means families', each consisting of finitely many primitive
substitution rules that individually all define the same two-sided discrete
dynamical hull. We report about results in the randomised case on topological
entropy, ergodicity of the two-sided discrete hull, and the spectral type of
the diffraction measure of related point sets.
