We discuss an infinite class of metabelian Von Neumann rho-invariants. Each
one is a homomorphism from the monoid of knots to the real line. In general
they are not well defined on the concordance group. Nonetheless, we show that
they pass to well defined homomorphisms from the subgroup of the concordance
group generated by anisotropic knots. Thus, the computation of even one of
these invariants can be used to conclude that a knot is of infinite order. We
introduce a method to give a computable bound on these invariants. Finally we
compute this bound to get a new and explicit infinite set of twist knots which
is linearly independent in the concordance group and whose every member is of
algebraic order 2 .
