We give explicit constructions of sets S with the property that for each
integer k, there are at most g solutions to k=s_1+s_2, s_i\in S; such sets are
called Sidon sets if g=2 and generalized Sidon sets if g\ge 3. We extend to
generalized Sidon sets the Sidon-set constructions of Singer, Bose, and Ruzsa.
We also further optimize Koulantzakis' idea of interleaving several copies of a
Sidon set, extending the improvements of Cilleruelo & Ruzsa & Trujillo, Jia,
and Habsieger & Plagne. The resulting constructions yield the largest known
generalized Sidon sets in virtually all cases.
