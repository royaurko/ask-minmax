In this paper we extend Efimov's Theorem by proving that any complete surface
in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Gauss curvature bounded above by a negative constant
outside a compact set has finite total curvature, finite area and is properly
immersed. Moreover, its ends must be asymptotic to half-lines. We also give a
partial solution to Milnor's conjecture by studying isometric immersions in a
space form of complete surfaces which satisfy that outside a compact set they
have non positive Gauss curvature and the square of a principal curvature
function is bounded from below by a positive constant.
