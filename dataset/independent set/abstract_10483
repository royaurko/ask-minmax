Let Delta F be the free energy difference between two equilibrium states of a
system. An established method of numerically computing Delta F involves a
single, long ``switching simulation'', during which the system is driven
reversibly from one state to the other (slow growth, or adiabatic switching).
Here we study a method of obtaining the same result from numerous independent,
irreversible simulations of much shorter duration (fast growth). We illustrate
the fast growth method, computing the excess chemical potential of a
Lennard-Jones fluid as a test case, and we examine the performance of fast
growth as a practical computational tool.
