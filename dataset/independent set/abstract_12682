We study 2D discrete integrable equations of order 1 with respect to one
independent variable and $m$ with respect to another one. A generalization of
the multidimensional consistency property is proposed for this type of
equations. The examples are related to the B\"acklund--Darboux transformations
for the lattice equations of Bogoyavlensky type.
