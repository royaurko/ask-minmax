In this paper, we derive some new exact solutions of static wormholes in f(T)
gravity. We discuss independent cases of the pressure components including
isotropic and anisotropic pressure. Lastly we consider radial pressure
satisfying a barotropic equation of state. We also check the behavior of null
energy condition (NEC) for each case and observe that it is violated for the
anisotropic case, while it is satisfied for isotropic and barotropic cases.
