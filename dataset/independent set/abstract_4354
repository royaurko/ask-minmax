We study the expressive power of fragments of inclusion and independence
logic defined by restricting the number k of universal quantifiers in formulas.
Assuming the so-called strict semantics for these logics, we relate these
fragments of inclusion and independence logic to sublogics ESO_f(k\forall) of
existential second-order logic, which in turn are known to capture the
complexity classes NTIME_{RAM}(n^k).
