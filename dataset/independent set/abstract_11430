Differences in the photoproduction of mesons on the free proton and on nuclei
are expected to reveal changes in the properties of hadrons. Inclusive studies
of nuclear photoabsorption have provided evidence of medium modifications.
However, the results have not been explained in a model independent way. A
deeper understanding of the situation is anticipated from a detailed
experimental study of meson photoproduction from nuclei in exclusive reactions.
In the energy regime above the Delta(1232) resonance, the dominant double pion
production channels are of particular interest. Double pion photoproduction
from nuclei is also used to investigate the in-medium modification of
meson-meson interactions.
