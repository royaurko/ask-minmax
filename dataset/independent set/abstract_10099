Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Krein space with fundamental symmetry $J$. Along this
paper, the geometric structure of the set of $J$-normal projections
$\mathcal{Q}$ is studied. The group of $J$-unitary operators $\mathcal{U}_J$
naturally acts on $\mathcal{Q}$. Each orbit of this action turns out to be an
analytic homogeneous space of $\mathcal{U}_J$, and a connected component of
$\mathcal{Q}$. The relationship between $\mathcal{Q}$ and the set $\mathcal{E}$
of $J$-selfadjoint projections is analized: both sets are analytic submanifolds
of $L(\mathcal{H})$ and there is a natural real analytic submersion from
$\mathcal{Q}$ onto $\mathcal{E}$, namely $Q\mapsto QQ^\#$. The range of a
$J$-normal projection is always a pseudo-regular subspace. Then, for a fixed
pseudo-regular subspace $\mathcal{S}$, it is proved that the set of $J$-normal
projections onto $\mathcal{S}$ is a covering space of the subset of $J$-normal
projections onto $\mathcal{S}$ with fixed regular part.
