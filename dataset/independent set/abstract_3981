We rederive the results of our companion paper, for matching spacetime and
internal signature, by applying in detail the Dirac algorithm to the Palatini
action. While the constraint set of the Palatini action contains second class
constraints, by an appeal to the method of gauge unfixing, we map the second
class system to an equivalent first class system which turns out to be
identical to the first class constraint system obtained via the extension of
the ADM phase space performed in our companion paper. Central to our analysis
is again the appropriate treatment of the simplicity constraint. Remarkably,
the simplicity constraint invariant extension of the Hamiltonian constraint,
that is a necessary step in the gauge unfixing procedure, involves a correction
term which is precisely the one found in the companion paper and which makes
sure that the Hamiltonian constraint derived from the Palatini Lagrangian
coincides with the ADM Hamiltonian constraint when Gauss and simplicity
constraints are satisfied. We therefore have rederived our new connection
formulation of General Relativity from an independent starting point, thus
confirming the consistency of this framework.
