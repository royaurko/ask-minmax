A toy model is developed to capture "dance of pre-formed pairs" in the
pseudogap state of high temperature cuprate superconductors. The model is a
crude description of a hypothetical situation in which spin-driven spatial
organization of the pre-formed pairs is analyzed. Within a mean-field theory (a
slight generalization of Bragg-Williams theory) we examined the behaviour of
heat capacity and an "order parameter" which captures the short range
correlations between the pre-formed pairs. Below a transition temperature these
short range correlations enhance and leads to a long range order (spin-density
wave). This is examined through the breakdown of statistical independence.
