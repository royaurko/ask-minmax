We numerically investigate a particular type of spin solitons inside a
trapped atomic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with ferromagnetic
interactions. Within the mean field theory approximation, our study of the
solitonic dynamics shows that the solitonic wave function, its center of mass
motion, and the local spin evolutions are stable and are intimately related to
the domain structures studied recently in spin-1 $^{87}$Rb condensates. We
discuss a rotating reference frame wherein the dynamics of the solitonic local
spatial spin distribution become time independent.
