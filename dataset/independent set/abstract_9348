Let $A$ be the polynomial ring over $k$ (a field of characteristic zero) in
$n+1$ variables. The commuting derivations conjecture states that $n$ commuting
locally nilpotent derivations on $A$, linearly independent over $A$, must
satisfy $A^{D_1,...,D_m}=k[f]$ where $f$ is a coordinate. The conjecture can be
formulated as stating that a $(G_m)^n$-action on $k^{n+1}$ must have invariant
ring $k[f]$ where $f$ is a coordinate. In this paper we prove a statement
(theorem \ref{CDH2}) where we assume less on $A$ ($A$ is a {\sc UFD} over $k$
of transcendence degree $n+1$ satisfying $A^*=k$) and prove less
($A/(f-\alpha)$ is a polynomial ring for all but finitely many $\alpha$). Under
certain additional conditions (the $D_i$ are linearly independent modulo
$(f-\alpha)$ for each $\alpha\in k$) we prove that $A$ is a polynomial ring
itself and $f$ is a coordinate. This statement is proven even more generally by
replacing ``free unipotent action of dimension $n$'' for ``$G_a^n$-action''.
  We make links with the (Abhyankar-)Sataye conjecture and give a new
equivalent formulation of the Sataye conjecture.
