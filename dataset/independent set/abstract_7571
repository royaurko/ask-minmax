We present a method for extraction of detailed information on polarized quark
densities from semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering l+N -> l+h+X, in both
LO and NLO QCD without any assumptions about fragmentation functions and
polarized sea densities. The only symmetries utilised are charge conjugation
and isotopic spin invariance of strong interactions.
