The M{\o}ller energy complex of Schwarzschild black hole solution in several
coodinates are evaluated. Our results show that the M{\o}ller energy complex is
independent of not only the purely spatial transformation, but also the shift
of time coordinate. So, we could conclude that a shift of time coordinates will
not change the energy which is obtained by using the definition of M{\o}ller
energy complex.
