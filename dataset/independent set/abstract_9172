We present an argument in which the scale ~ 0.1 eV associated with neutrino
masses naturally appears in a a class of (very) large volume compactifications,
being tied to a supersymmetry scale of 10^3 GeV and a string scale of 10^11
GeV. The masses are of Majorana type and there is no right-handed neutrino
within the low-energy field theory. The suppression scale 10^14 GeV is
independent of the masses of the heavy states that are integrated out. These
kind of constructions appear naturally in Type IIB flux compactifications.
However, the arguments that lead to this result rely only on a few geometrical
features of the compactification manifold, and hence can be used independently
of string theory.
