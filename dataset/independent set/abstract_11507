We report an improved precision measurement of the Casimir force. The force
is measured between a large Al coated sphere and flat plate using an Atomic
Force Microscope. The primary experimental improvements include the use of
smoother metal coatings, reduced noise, lower systematic errors and independent
measurement of surface separations. Also the complete dielectric spectrum of
the metal is used in the theory. The average statistical precision remains at
the same 1% of the forces measured at the closest separation.
