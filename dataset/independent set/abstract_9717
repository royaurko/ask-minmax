Voyager 1 data from beyond the heliopause provide the first direct
measurements of the interstellar cosmic ray spectra below 1 GeVnuc. In this
paper we combine these Voyager measurements of H and He nuclei from 3-600
MeVnuc with higher energy measurements at 1 AU from the BESS and PAMELA
experiments up to 100 GeVnuc. Using a Weighted Leaky Box Model for propagation
in the galaxy, we obtain an excellent fit to these new Voyager observations and
the much higher energy spectra up to 100 GeVnuc by using source spectra which
are P-2.28, with the exponent independent of rigidity from low to high
rigidities; along with a rigidity dependence of the diffusion path length which
is P-0.5 at rigidities 1.00 GV, and possibly changing to P1.0 at lower
rigidities.
