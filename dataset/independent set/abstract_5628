Let $\mathbb{N}_0$ be the set of all non-negative integers and
$\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}_0)$ be its the power set. An integer additive
set-indexer (IASI) of a graph $G$ is an injective function $f:V(G)\to
\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}_0)$ such that the induced function $f^+:E(G) \to
\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}_0)$ defined by $f^+ (uv) = f(u)+ f(v)$ is also
injective, where $f(u)+f(v)$ is the sum set of $f(u)$ and $f(v)$. An integer
additive set-indexer $f$ is said to be a weak integer additive set-indexer
(weak IASI) if $|f^+(uv)|=\max(|f(u)|,|f(v)|)~\forall ~ uv\in E(G)$. The
minimum number of singleton set-labeled edges required for the graph $G$ to
admit an IASI is called the sparing number of the graph. In this paper, we
discuss the admissibility of weak IASI by a particular type of graph product
called the edge corona of two given graphs and determine the sparing number of
the edge corona of certain graphs.
