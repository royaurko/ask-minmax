Tanisaki introduced generating sets for the defining ideals of the schematic
intersections of the closure of conjugacy classes of nilpotent matrices with
the set of diagonal matrices. These ideals are naturally labeled by integer
partitions. Given such a partition $\lambda$, we define several methods to
produce a reduced generating set for the associated ideal $I_{\lambda}$. For
particular shapes we find nice generating sets. By comparing our sets with some
generating sets of $I_{\lambda}$ arising from a work of Weyman, we find a
counterexample to a related conjecture of Weyman.
