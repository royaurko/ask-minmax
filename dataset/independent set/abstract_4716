We report evidence for excess blue light from the Type Ia supernova SN~2012cg
at fifteen and sixteen days before maximum B-band brightness. The emission is
consistent with predictions for the impact of the supernova on a non-degenerate
binary companion. This is the first evidence for emission from a companion to a
normal SN~Ia. Sixteen days before maximum light, the B-V color of SN~2012cg is
0.2 mag bluer than for other normal SN~Ia. At later times, this supernova has a
typical SN~Ia light curve, with extinction-corrected M_B = -19.62 \pm 0.02 mag
and Delta m_{15}(B) = 0.86 \pm 0.02. Our data set is extensive, with photometry
in 7 filters from 5 independent sources. Early spectra also show the effects of
blue light, and high-velocity features are observed at early times. Near
maximum, the spectra are normal with a silicon velocity v_{Si} = -10,500 km/s.
Comparing the early data with models by Kasen (2010) favors a main-sequence
companion of about 6 solar masses. It is possible that many other SN Ia have
main-sequence companions that have eluded detection because the emission from
the impact is fleeting and faint.
