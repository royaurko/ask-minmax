MiniBooNE anti-neutrino charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE) data is compared
to model predictions. The main background of neutrino-induced events is
examined first, where three independent techniques are employed. Results
indicate the neutrino flux is consistent with a uniform reduction of $\sim$ 20%
relative to the largely uncertain prediction. After background subtraction, the
$Q^{2}$ shape of $\numub$ CCQE events is consistent with the model parameter
$M_{A}$ = 1.35 GeV determined from MiniBooNE $\numu$ CCQE data, while the
normalization is $\sim$ 20% high compared to the same prediction.
