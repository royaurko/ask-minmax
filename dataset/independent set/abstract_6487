We obtain a model independent expression for the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift
up to $\mathcal O (m_\mu \alpha^6, m_\mu \alpha^5 \frac{m_\mu^2}{m_\rho^2})$.
The hadronic effects are controlled by the chiral theory, which allows for
their model independent determination. We give their complete expression
including the pion and Delta particles. Out of this analysis and the
experimental measurement of the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift we determine the
electromagnetic proton radius: $r_p$=0.8412(15) fm. This number is at
6.8$\sigma$ variance with respect to the CODATA value. The parametric control
of the uncertainties allows us to obtain a model independent determination of
the error, which is dominated by hadronic effects.
