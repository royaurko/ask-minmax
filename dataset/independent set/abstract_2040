We present a number of complete sets of series expansion formulas for
neutrino oscillation probabilities in matter of constant density for three
flavors. In particular, we study expansions in the mass hierarchy parameter
$\alpha \equiv \Delta m_{21}^2/\Delta m_{31}^2$ and mixing parameter $s_{13}
\equiv \sin \theta_{13}$ up to second order and expansions only in $\alpha$ and
only in $s_{13}$ up to first order. For each type of expansion we also present
the corresponding formulas for neutrino oscillations in vacuum.We perform a
detailed analysis of the accuracy of the different sets of series expansion
formulas and investigate which type of expansion is most accurate in different
regions of the parameter space spanned by the neutrino energy E, the baseline
length L, and the expansion parameters $\alpha$ and $s_{13}$.We also present
the formulas for series expansions in $\alpha$ and in $s_{13}$ up to first
order for the case of arbitrary matter density profiles. Furthermore, it is
shown that in general all the 18 neutrino and antineutrino oscillation
probabilities can be expressed through just two independent probabilites.
