A cornerstone of the theory of cohomology jump loci is the Tangent Cone
theorem, which relates the behavior around the origin of the characteristic and
resonance varieties of a space. We revisit this theorem, in both the algebraic
setting provided by cdga models, and in the topological setting provided by
fundamental groups and cohomology rings. The general theory is illustrated with
several classes of examples from geometry and topology: smooth quasi-projective
varieties, complex hyperplane arrangements and their Milnor fibers,
configuration spaces, and elliptic arrangements.
