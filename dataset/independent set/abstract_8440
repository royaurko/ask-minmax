We establish the first pointwise ergodic theorems along thin sets of prime
numbers; a set with zero density with respect to the primes. For instance we
will be able to achieve this with the Piatetski-Shapiro primes. Our methods
will be robust enough to solve the ternary Goldbach problem for some thin sets
of primes.
