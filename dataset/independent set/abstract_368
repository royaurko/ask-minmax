We consider a stationary and ergodic source $p$ generated symbols $x_1 ...
x_t$ from some finite set $A$ and a null hypothesis $H_0$ that $p$ is Markovian
source with memory (or connectivity) not larger than $m, (m >= 0).$ The
alternative hypothesis $H_1$ is that the sequence is generated by a stationary
and ergodic source, which differs from the source under $H_0$. In particular,
if $m= 0$ we have the null hypothesis $H_0$ that the sequence is generated by
Bernoully source (or the hypothesis that $x_1 ...x_t$ are independent.) Some
new tests which are based on universal codes and universal predictors, are
suggested.
