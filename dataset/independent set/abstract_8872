We study the multiplicity sets of first order symbols associated with
differential operators on two dimensional surfaces. This work is inspired by
the phenomenon of conical refraction explained by the existence of
singularities in the Fresnel hyper-surface for Maxwell's equations on an
anisotropic crystal.
