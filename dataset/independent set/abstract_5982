We consider the discretized version of a (continuous-time) two-factor model
introduced by Benth and cocontributors for the electricity markets. For this model,
the underlying is the exponent of a sum of independent random variables. We
provide and test an algorithm, which is based on the celebrated
Foellmer-Schweizer decomposition for solving the mean-variance hedging problem.
In particular, we establish that decomposition explicitely, for a large class
of vanilla contingent claims. Interest is devoted in the choice of rebalancing
dates and its impact on the hedging error, regarding the payoff regularity and
the non stationarity of the log-price process.
