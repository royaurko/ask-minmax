Under various conditions, we establish Schauder estimates for both divergence
and non-divergence form second-order elliptic and parabolic equations involving
H\"older semi-norms not with respect to all, but only with respect to some of
the independent variables. A novelty of our results is that the coefficients
are allowed to be merely measurable with respect to the other independent
variables.
