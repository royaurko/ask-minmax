It is believed that soon after the Planck era, space time should have a
semi-classical nature. According to this, the escape from General Relativity
theory is unavoidable. Two geometric counter-terms are needed to regularize the
divergences which come from the expected value. These counter-terms are
responsible for a higher derivative metric gravitation. Starobinsky idea was
that these higher derivatives could mimic a cosmological constant. In this work
it is considered numerical solutions for general Bianchi I anisotropic
space-times in this higher derivative theory. The approach is ``experimental''
in the sense that there is no attempt to an analytical investigation of the
results. It is shown that for zero cosmological constant $\Lambda=0$, there are
sets of initial conditions which form basins of attraction that asymptote
Minkowski space. The complement of this set of initial conditions form basins
which are attracted to some singular solutions. It is also shown, for a
cosmological constant $\Lambda> 0$ that there are basins of attraction to a
specific de Sitter solution. This result is consistent with Starobinsky's
initial idea. The complement of this set also forms basins that are attracted
to some type of singular solution. Because the singularity is characterized by
curvature scalars, it must be stressed that the basin structure obtained is a
topological invariant, i.e., coordinate independent.
