We exhibit a set of edges (moves) and 2-cells (relations) making the complex
of pant decompositions on a surface a simply connected complex. Our
construction, unlike the previous ones, keeps the arguments concerning the
structural transformations independent from those deriving from the action of
the mapping class group. The moves and the relations turn out to be supported
in subsurfaces with 3g-3+n=1,2 (where g is the genus and n is the number of
boundary components), illustrating in this way the so called Grothendieck
principle.
