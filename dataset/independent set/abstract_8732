In this paper, we are interested in bounded, entire, solutions of the
Allen-Cahn equation which are defined in Euclidean space and whose zero set is
asymptotic to a given minimal cone. In particular, in dimension larger than or
equal to 8, we prove the existence of stable solutions of the Allen-Cahn
equation whose zero sets are not hyperplanes.
