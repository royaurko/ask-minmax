The frequency dependence of shot noise in mesoscopic diffusive contacts is
calculated with account taken of long-range Coulomb interaction and external
screening. While the low-frequency noise is 1/3 of noise of classical Poisson
process independently of the contact shape, the high-frequency noise tends to
the full classical value for long and narrow contacts because of strong
screening by the surrounding medium. In this case, the current fluctuations at
opposite ends of the contact are completely independent.
