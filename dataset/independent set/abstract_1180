We consider the logarithm of the characteristic polynomial of random
permutation matrices, evaluated on a finite set of different points. The
permutations are chosen with respect to the Ewens distribution on the symmetric
group. We show that the behavior at different points is independent in the
limit and are asymptotically normal. Our methods enables us to study more
general matrices, closely related to permutation matrices, and multiplicative
class functions.
