We propose a definition o meta-stability and obtain sufficient conditions for
a sequence of Markov processes on finite state spaces to be meta-stable. In the
reversible case, these conditions reduce to estimates of the capacity and the
measure of certain meta-stable sets. We prove that a class of condensed
zero-range processes with asymptotically decreasing jump rates is meta-stable.
