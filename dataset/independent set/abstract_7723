Relations connecting violation of any Bell inequalities and the
complementarity between visibility and distinguishability in the
interferometric experiments with different sources of decoherence are
presented. A boundary of local-realistic explanation of the which-way
complementarity is discussed in dependence on the choice of independent or
collective tests of nonlocality.
