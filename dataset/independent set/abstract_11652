We show that electron transport through a long multichannel wire, connected
to leads by tunnel junctions, at low temperatures and voltages is dominated by
inelastic cotunnelling. This mechanism results in experimentally observed
power-law dependence of conductance on temperature and voltage, in the
diffusive regime where usual Coulomb anomaly theory leads to exponentially low
conductance. The power-law exponent is proportional to the distance between
contacts.
