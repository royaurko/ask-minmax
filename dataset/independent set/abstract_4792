We prove the existence of an open and dense set D\subset? Homeo0(T2) (set of
toral homeomorphisms homotopic to the identity) such that the rotation set of
any element in D is a rational polygon. We also extend this result to the set
of axiom A dif- feomorphisms in Homeo0(T2). Further we observe the existence of
minimal sets whose rotation set is a non-trivial segment, for an open set in
Homeo0(T2).
