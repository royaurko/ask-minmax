The incidence algebra of a partially ordered set (poset) supports in a
natural way also a coalgebra structure, so that it becomes a m-weak bialgebra
even a m-weak Hopf algebra with M\"obius function as antipode. Here m-weak
means that multiplication and comultiplication are not required to be
coalgebra- or algebra-morphisms, respectively. A rich theory is obtained in
computing modulo an equivalence relation on the set of intervals in the poset.
