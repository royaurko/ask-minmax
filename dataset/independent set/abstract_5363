The effect of noise on self-similar set is studied. The iteratie procedure
used to generate the self-similar set is moidified by adding a stochastic
variable to the diameter of generating sets at each iteration. The noise may
causes the generating set to collapse to a point. Distribution functions are
found describing the probability that any generating set collapse. The effect
of chaotic disturbance on the iteration of self-similar set is studied. It is
shown that the iterative procedure which describes the self-similar set is
truncated under the influence of disturbance generated by the tent map.
Conditions which lead to truncation of any chaotic map are also obtained.
