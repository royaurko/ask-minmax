A new method of obtaining Abelian and Tauberian theorems for the integral of
the form $\int\limits_0^\infty K(\frac{t}{r}) d\mu(t)$ is proposed. It is based
on the use of limit sets of the measures. A version of Azarin's sets is
constructed for Radon's measures on the ray $(0,\infty)$. Abelian theorems of a
new type are proved in which asymptotic behavior of the integral is described
in terms of these limit sets. Using these theorems together with an improved
version of the well-known Carleman's theorem on analytic continuation, a
substantial improvement of the second Wiener Tauberian theorem is obtained.
