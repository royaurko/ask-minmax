We study the canonical structure of the topological 3D gravity with torsion,
assuming the anti-de Sitter asymptotic conditions. It is shown that the Poisson
bracket algebra of the canonical generators has the form of two independent
Virasoro algebras with classical central charges. In contrast to the case of
general relativity with a cosmological constant, the values of the central
charges are different from each other.
