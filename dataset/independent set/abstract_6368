We perform a comparative study of two methods of determining the survival
probabilities of low, intermediate, and high energy solar neutrinos that
emphasizes the general agreement between the Large Mixing Angle (LMA) solution
and extant solar neutrino data. The first analysis is oscillation
parameter-independent and the second analysis involves an approximate
calculation of the survival probabilities in the three energy ranges that
depends only on oscillation parameters. We show that future experiments like
BOREXino, CLEAN, Heron, LENS and MOON, that measure $pp$ and $^7$Be neutrinos,
will facilitate a stringent test of the LMA solution independently of the
Standard Solar Model (SSM), without recourse to earth-matter effects.
Throughout, we describe the role of SSM assumptions on our results. If the LMA
solution passes the test without needing to be modified, it may be possible to
establish that $\theta_x$ is nonzero at more than $2\sigma$ assuming the SSM
prediction for the $pp$ flux is correct.
