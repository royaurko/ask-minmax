Hadron spectra and other properties of quark systems are studied in the
framework of a non-relativistic spin-independent phenomenological model. The
chosen confining potential is harmonic, which allowed us to obtain analytical
solutions for both meson and baryon (of equal constituent quarks) spectra. The
introduced parameters are fixed from the low-lying levels of heavy quark
mesons. The requirement of flavor independence is imposed, and it restricts the
possible choices of inter-quark potentials. The hyper-spherical coordinates are
considered for the solution of the three-body problem.
