The \emph{regular independence number}, introduced by Albertson and Boutin in
1990, is the maximum cardinality of an independent set of $G$ in which all
vertices have equal degree in $G$. Recently, Caro, Hansberg and Pepper
introduced the concept of regular $k$-independence number, which is a natural
generalization of the regular independence number. A \emph{$k$-independent set}
is a set of vertices whose induced subgraph has maximum degree at most $k$. The
\emph{regular $k$-independence number} of $G$, denoted by $\alpha_{k-reg}(G)$,
is defined as the maximum cardinality of a $k$-independent set of $G$ in which
all vertices have equal degree in $G$. In this paper, the exact values of the
regular $k$-independence numbers of some special graphs are obtained. We also
get some lower and upper bounds for the regular $k$-independence number of
trees with given diameter, and the lower bounds for the regular
$k$-independence number of line graphs. For a simple graph $G$ of order $n$, we
show that $1\leq\alpha_{k-reg}(G)\leq n$ and characterize the extremal graphs.
The Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results for the regular $k$-independence number of
graphs are also obtained.
