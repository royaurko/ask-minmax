The universality of the metal-insulator transition in three-dimensional
disordered system is confirmed by numerical analysis of the scaling properties
of the electronic wave functions. We prove that the critical exponent $\nu$ and
the multifractal dimensions $d_q$ are independent on the microscopic definition
of the disorder and universal along the critical line which separates the
metallic and the insulating regime.
