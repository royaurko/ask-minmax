This paper presents the R package gRapHD for efficient selection of
high-dimensional undirected graphical models. The package provides tools for
selecting trees, forests and decomposable models minimizing information
criteria such as AIC or BIC, and for displaying the independence graphs of the
models. It has also some useful tools for analysing graphical structures. It
supports the use of discrete, continuous, or both types of variables
simultaneously.
