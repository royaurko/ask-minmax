The thermodynamics of the O(N) nonlinear sigma model in 1+1 dimensions is
studied. We calculate the finite temperature effective potential in leading
order in the 1/N expansion and show that at this order the effective potential
can be made finite by temperature independent renormalization. We will show
that this is not longer possible at next-to-leading order in 1/N. In that case
one can only renormalize the minimum of the effective potential in a
temperature independent way, which gives us finite physical quantities like the
pressure.
