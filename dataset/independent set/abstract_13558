We consider the spectral statistics of the sum H of two independent complex
Wishart matrices, each of which is correlated with a distinct given covariance
matrix. Such a setup appears frequently in multivariate statistics and enjoys
various applications. Only in the degenerate case of two equal covariance
matrices H reduces to a single rectangular correlated Wishart matrix, whose
spectral statistics is known. Our starting point are recent results by Kumar
for the distribution of the matrix H valid in the non-degenerate case. It is
given by a confluent hypergeometric function of matrix argument. In the
half-degenerate case, when one of the covariance matrices is proportional to
the identity, the joint probability density of the eigenvalues of H reduces to
a bi-orthogonal ensemble containing ordinary hypergeometric functions. We
compute all spectral k-point density correlation functions of H for arbitrary
size N. In the half-degenerate case they are given by a determinant of size k
of a kernel of certain bi-orthogonal functions. The latter follows from
computing the expectation value of a single characteristic polynomial. In the
non-degenerate case using superbosonisation techniques we compute the
generating function for the k-point resolvent given by the expectation value of
ratios of characteristic polynomials.
