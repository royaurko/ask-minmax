Extending a method of D. Wolke, we establish a general result on the large
sieve with sparse sets S of moduli which are in a sense well-distributed in
arithmetic progressions. We then use this result together with Fourier
techniques to obtain large sieve bounds for the case when S consists of
squares. These bounds improve a recent result by L. Zhao.
