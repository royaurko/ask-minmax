This paper is an introduction, in a simplified setting, to Lusztig's theory
of character sheaves. It develops a notion of character sheaves on reductive
Lie algebras which is more general then such notion of Lusztig, and closer to
Lusztig's theory of character sheaves on groups. The development is self
contained and independent of the characteristic $p$ of the ground field. The
results for Lie algebras are then used to give simple and uniform proofs for
some of Lusztig's results on groups.
