In these notes, we present the strategy employed by S. Leroy to attack the
nilpotent case of the Shafarevich conjecture. The projective case was treated
in a paper of L. Katzarkov but Leroy's proof is largely independant and works
in the K\"ahler setting as well. It is entirely based on the higher Albanese
manifolds constructed by R. Hain.
