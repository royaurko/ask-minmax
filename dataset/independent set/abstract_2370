Searches for neutral Higgs bosons produced at LEP in association with Z
bosons, in pairs and in the Yukawa process are presented in this paper. Higgs
boson decays into b quarks, tau leptons, or other Higgs bosons are considered,
giving rise to four-b, four-b+jets, six-b and four-tau final states, as well as
mixed modes with b quarks and tau leptons. The whole mass domain kinematically
accessible at LEP in these topologies is searched. The analysed data set covers
both the LEP1 and LEP2 energy ranges and exploits most of the luminosity
recorded by the DELPHI experiment. No convincing evidence for a signal is
found, and results are presented in the form of mass-dependent upper bounds on
coupling factors (in units of model-independent reference cross-sections) for
all processes, allowing interpretation of the data in a large class of models.
