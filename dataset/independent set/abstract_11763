We study the general properties of fluid spheres satisfying the heuristic
assumption that their areas and proper radius are equal (the Euclidean
condition). Dissipative and non-dissipative models are considered. In the
latter case, all models are necessarily geodesic and a subclass of the
Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi solution is obtained. In the dissipative case solutions
are non-geodesic and are characterized by the fact that all non-gravitational
forces acting on any fluid element produces a radial three-acceleration
independent on its inertial mass.
