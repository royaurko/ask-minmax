We propose a Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing and a Super-Replication
Theorem in a model-independent framework. We prove these theorems in the
setting of finite, discrete time and a market consisting of a risky asset S as
well as options written on this risky asset. As a technical condition, we
assume the existence of a traded option with a super-linearly growing
payoff-function, e.g., a power option. This condition is not needed when
sufficiently many vanilla options maturing at the horizon T are traded in the
market.
