We report a measurement of the mass of the top quark in lepton+jets final
states of ppbar->ttbar data corresponding to 2.6 fb^{-1} of integrated
luminosity collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider.
Using a matrix element method, we combine an insitu jet energy calibration with
our standard jet energy scale derived in studies of {\gamma}+jet and dijet
events and employ a novel flavor-dependent jet response correction to measure a
top-quark mass of mt = 176.01 +/- 1.64 GeV. Combining this result with our
previous result obtained on an independent data set, we measure a top-quark
mass of mt = 174.94 +/- 1.49 GeV for a total integrated luminosity of 3.6
fb^{-1}.
