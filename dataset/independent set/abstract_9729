This research resolves a long-standing problem on the electromagnetic
response of self-complementary metallic screens with checkerboardlike geometry.
Although Babinet's principle implies that they show a frequency-independent
response, this unusual characteristic has not been observed yet due to the
singularities of the metallic point contacts in the checkerboard geometry. We
overcome this difficulty by replacing the point contacts with resistive sheets.
The proposed structure is prepared and characterized by terahertz time-domain
spectroscopy. It is experimentally confirmed that the resistive checkerboard
structures exhibit a flat transmission spectrum over 0.1--1.1 THz. It is also
demonstrated that self-complementarity can eliminate even the
frequency-dependent transmission characteristics of resonant metamaterials.
