We study the Coulomb drag transresistivity between graphene layers employing
the finite temperature density response function. We analyze the Coulomb
coupling between the two layers and show that a universal scaling behavior,
independent of the interlayer distance can be deduced. We argue that this
universal behavior may be experimentally observable in a system of two carbon
nanotubes of large radius.
