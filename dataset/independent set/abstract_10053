New concepts of rough natural number systems are introduced in this research
paper from both formal and less formal perspectives. These are used to improve
most rough set-theoretical measures in general Rough Set theory (\textsf{RST})
and to represent rough semantics. The foundations of the theory also rely upon
the axiomatic approach to granularity for all types of general \textsf{RST}
recently developed by the present contributor. The latter theory is expanded upon in
this paper. It is also shown that algebraic semantics of classical \textsf{RST}
can be obtained from the developed dialectical counting procedures. Fuzzy set
theory is also shown to be representable in purely granule-theoretic terms in
the general perspective of solving the contamination problem that pervades this
research paper. All this constitutes a radically different approach to the
mathematics of vague phenomena and suggests new directions for a more realistic
extension of the foundations of mathematics of vagueness from both foundational
and application points of view. Algebras corresponding to a concept of
\emph{rough naturals} are also studied and variants are characterised in the
penultimate section.
