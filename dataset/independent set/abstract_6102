A brief introduction to the theory of ordered sets and lattice theory is
given. To illustrate proof techniques in the theory of ordered sets, a
generalization of a conjecture of Daykin and Daykin, concerning the structure
of posets that can be partitioned into chains in a ``strong'' way, is proved.
The result is motivated by a conjecture of Graham's concerning probability
correlation inequalities for linear extensions of finite posets.
