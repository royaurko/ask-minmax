A possible model independent test of the theoretically calculated nuclear
matrix elements of $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay is proposed. The test can be
accomplished if $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay of three (or more) nuclei is observed.
The selection of the nuclei for the next generation of $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay
experiments should be done taking into account {\it also} considerations
regarding the possibility to test the nuclear matrix element calculations.
