We construct covariant coordinate transformations on the fuzzy sphere and
utilize these to construct a covariant map from a gauge theory on the fuzzy
sphere to a gauge theory on the ordinary sphere. We show that this construction
coincides with the Seiberg-Witten map on the Moyal plane in the appropriate
limit. The analysis takes place in the algebra and is independent of any
star-product representation.
