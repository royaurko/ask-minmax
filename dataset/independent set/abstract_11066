We study an important contribution to the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the
electron (or quarks) at the two-loop level due to the $W$-EDM in the recently
proposed scenario of split supersymmetry. This contribution is independent of
the Higgs mass, and it can enhance the previous estimation of the electron
(neutron) EDM by $20-50%$ ($40-90%$). Our formula is new in its analytical
form.
