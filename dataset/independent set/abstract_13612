A set of recurrence relations for on-shell two-loop self-energy diagrams with
one mass is presented, which allows to reduce the diagrams with arbitrary
indices (powers of scalar propagators) to a set of the master integrals. The
SHELL2 package is used for the calculation of special types of diagrams. A
method of calculation of higher order \epsilon-expansion of master integrals is
demonstrated.
