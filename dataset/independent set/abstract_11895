We use configuration interaction and many-body perturbation theory techniques
to calculate spin-independent and spin-dependent parts of the parity
nonconserving amplitudes of the transitions between the $6s^2 \ ^1$S$_0$ ground
state and the $6s5d \ ^3$D$_1$ excited state of $^{171}$Yb and $^{173}$Yb. The
results are presented in a form convenient for extracting spin-dependent
interaction constants (such as, e.g., anapole moment) from the measurements.
