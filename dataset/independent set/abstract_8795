For an iterated function system (IFS) of simillitidues, we define two graphs
on the representing symbolic space. We show that if the self-similar set $K$
has positive Lebesgue measure or the IFS satisfies the weak separation
condition, then the graphs are hyperbolic, moreover the hyperbolic boundaries
are homeomorphic to the self-similar sets.
