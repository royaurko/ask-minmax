We show that the group of homeomorphisms of the Cantor set $H(K)$ has ample
generics, that is, for every $m$ the diagonal conjugacy action
$g\cdot(h_1,h_2,..., h_m)=(gh_1g^{-1},gh_2g^{-1},..., gh_mg^{-1})$ of $H(K)$ on
$H(K)^m$ has a comeager orbit. This answers a question of Kechris and Rosendal.
We show that the generic tuple in $H(K)^m$ can be taken to be the limit of a
certain projective Fraisse family. We also present a proof of the existence of
the generic homeomorphism of the Cantor set in the context of the projective
Fraisse theory.
