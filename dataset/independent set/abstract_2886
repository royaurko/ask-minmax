We present a new family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) convolutional
codes that can be designed using ordered sets of progressive differences. We
study their properties and define a subset of codes in this class that have
some desirable features, such as fixed minimum distance and Tanner graphs
without short cycles. The design approach we propose ensures that these
properties are guaranteed independently of the code rate. This makes these
codes of interest in many practical applications, particularly when high rate
codes are needed for saving bandwidth. We provide some examples of coded
transmission schemes exploiting this new class of codes.
