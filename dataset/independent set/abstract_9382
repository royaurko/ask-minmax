One of the important goals for future neutrino telescopes is to identify the
flavors of astrophysical neutrinos and therefore determine the flavor ratio.
The flavor ratio of astrophysical neutrinos observed on the Earth depends on
both the initial flavor ratio at the source and flavor transitions taking place
during propagations of these neutrinos. We propose a model independent
parametrization for describing the above flavor transitions. A few flavor
transition models are employed to test our parametrization. The observational
test for flavor transition mechanisms through our parametrization is discussed.
