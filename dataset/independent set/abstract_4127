Recently, a fast alternating minimization algorithm for total variation image
deblurring (FTVd) has been presented by Wang, Yang, Yin, and Zhang [{\em SIAM
J. Imaging Sci.}, 1 (2008), pp. 248--272]. The method in a nutshell consists of
a discrete Fourier transform-based alternating minimization algorithm with
periodic boundary conditions and in which two fast Fourier transforms (FFTs)
are required per iteration. In this paper, we propose an alternating
minimization algorithm for the continuous version of the total variation image
deblurring problem. We establish convergence of the proposed continuous
alternating minimization algorithm. The continuous setting is very useful to
have a unifying representation of the algorithm, independently of the discrete
approximation of the deconvolution problem, in particular concerning the
strategies for dealing with boundary artifacts. Indeed, an accurate restoration
of blurred and noisy images requires a proper treatment of the boundary. A
discrete version of our continuous alternating minimization algorithm is
obtained following two different strategies: the imposition of appropriate
boundary conditions and the enlargement of the domain. The first one is
computationally useful in the case of a symmetric blur, while the second one
can be efficiently applied for a nonsymmetric blur. Numerical tests show that
our algorithm generates higher quality images in comparable running times with
respect to the Fast Total Variation deconvolution algorithm.
