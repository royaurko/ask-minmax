If the preimage of a four-point set under a meromorphic function belongs to
the real line, then the image of the real line is contained in a circle in the
Riemann sphere. We include an application of this result to holomorphic
dynamics: if the Julia set of a rational function is contained in a smooth
curve then it is contained in a circle.
