The scaling limit of large simple outerplanar maps was established by
Caraceni using a bijection due to Bonichon, Gavoille and Hanusse. The present
paper introduces a new bijection between outerplanar maps and trees decorated
with ordered sequences of edge-rooted dissections of polygons. We apply this
decomposition in order to provide a new, short proof of the scaling limit that
also applies to the general setting of first-passage percolation. We obtain
sharp tail-bounds for the diameter and recover the asymptotic enumeration
formula for outerplanar maps. Our methods also enable us treat subclasses such
as bipartite outerplanar maps.
