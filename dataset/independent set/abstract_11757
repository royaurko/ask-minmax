This paper presents an agent-oriented approach to build a decision support
system aimed at helping emergency managers to detect and to manage risks. We
stress the flexibility and the adaptivity characteristics that are crucial to
build a robust and efficient system, able to resolve complex problems. The
system should be independent as much as possible from the subject of study.
Thereby, an original approach based on a mechanism of perception,
representation, characterisation and assessment is proposed. The work described
here is applied on the RoboCupRescue application. Experimentations and results
are provided.
