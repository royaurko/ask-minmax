This paper presents a novel technique for process discovery. In contrast to
the current trend, which only considers an event log for discovering a process
model, we assume two additional inputs: an independence relation on the set of
logged activities, and a collection of negative traces. After deriving an
intermediate net unfolding from them, we perform a controlled folding giving
rise to a Petri net which contains both the input log and all
independence-equivalent traces arising from it. Remarkably, the derived Petri
net cannot execute any trace from the negative collection. The entire chain of
transformations is fully automated. A tool has been developed and experimental
results are provided that witness the significance of the contribution of this
paper.
