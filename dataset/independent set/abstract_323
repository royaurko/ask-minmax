The usual development of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) assumes that
jumps and time intervals are a two-dimensional set of independent and
identically distributed random variables. In this paper we address the
theoretical setting of non-independent CTRW's where consecutive jumps and/or
time intervals are correlated. An exact solution to the problem is obtained for
the special but relevant case in which the correlation solely depends on the
signs of consecutive jumps. Even in this simple case some interesting features
arise such as transitions from unimodal to bimodal distributions due to
correlation. We also develop the necessary analytical techniques and
approximations to handle more general situations that can appear in practice.
