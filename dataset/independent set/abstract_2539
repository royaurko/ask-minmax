We address, in a three-dimensional spatial setting, both the viscous and the
standard Cahn-Hilliard equation with a nonconstant mobility coefficient. As it
was shown in J.W. Barrett and J.W. Blowey, Math. Comp., 68 (1999), 487-517, one
cannot expect uniqueness of the solution to the related initial and boundary
value problems. Nevertheless, referring to J. Ball's theory of generalized
semiflows, we are able to prove existence of compact quasi-invariant global
attractors for the associated dynamical processes settled in the natural
"finite energy" space. A key point in the proof is a careful use of the energy
equality, combined with the derivation of a "local compactness" estimate for
systems with supercritical nonlinearities, which may have an independent
interest. Under growth restrictions on the configuration potential, we also
show existence of a compact global attractor for the semiflow generated by the
(weaker) solutions to the nonviscous equation characterized by a "finite
entropy" condition.
