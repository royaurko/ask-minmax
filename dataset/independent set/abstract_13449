We consider stochastic discrete event dynamic systems that have time
evolution represented with two-dimensional state vectors through a vector
equation that is linear in terms of an idempotent semiring. The state
transitions are governed by second-order random matrices that are assumed to be
independent and identically distributed. The problem of interest is to evaluate
the mean growth rate of state vector, which is also referred to as the mean
cycle time of the system, under various assumptions on the matrix entries. We
give an overview of early results including a solution for systems determined
by matrices with independent entries having a common exponential distribution.
It is shown how to extend the result to the cases when the entries have
different exponential distributions and when some of the entries are replaced
by zero. Finally, the mean cycle time is calculated for systems with matrices
that have one random entry, whereas the other entries in the matrices can be
arbitrary nonnegative and zero constants. The random entry is always assumed to
have exponential distribution except for one case of a matrix with zero row
when the particular form of the matrix makes it possible to obtain a solution
that does not rely on exponential distribution assumptions.
