A set of 1.4 million biomedical papers was analyzed with regards to how often
articles are mentioned on Twitter or saved by users on Mendeley. While Twitter
is a microblogging platform used by a general audience to distribute
information, Mendeley is a reference manager targeted at an academic user group
to organize scholarly literature. Both platforms are used as sources for
so-called altmetrics to measure a new kind of research impact. This analysis
shows in how far they differ and compare to traditional citation impact metrics
based on a large set of PubMed papers.
