We present a portable four-channel atomic magnetometer array operating in the
spin exchange relaxation-free regime. The magnetometer array has several design
features intended to maximize its suitability for biomagnetic measurement,
specifically foetal magnetocardiography, such as a compact modular design, and
fibre coupled lasers. The modular design allows the independent positioning and
orientation of each magnetometer, in principle allowing for non-planar array
geometries. Using this array in a magnetically shielded room, we acquire adult
magnetocadiograms. These measurements were taken with a 6-11 fT Hz^(-1/2)
single-channel baseline sensitivity that is consistent with the independently
measured noise level of the magnetically shielded room.
