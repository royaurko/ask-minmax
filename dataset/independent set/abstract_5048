We define a time dependent empirical process based on $n$ independent
fractional Brownian motions and establish strong approximations to it by
Gaussian processes. They lead to strong approximations and functional laws of
the iterated logarithm for the quantile or inverse of this empirical process.
They are obtained via time dependent Bahadur--Kiefer representations.
