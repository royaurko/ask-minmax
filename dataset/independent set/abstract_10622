It is shown that the density of two {\it initially independent} condensates
which are allowed to expand and overlap can show interferences as a function of
time due to interparticle interaction. Using many-body theory, explicit
expressions for the density are given which are exact in the weak interaction
limit. General working equations are discussed which reproduce exactly the
density in this limit. Illustrative examples are presented.
