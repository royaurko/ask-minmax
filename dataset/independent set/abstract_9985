We obtain upper and lower bounds for running times of exponential time
algorithms for the detection of weak backdoor sets of 3CNF formulas,
considering various base classes. These results include (omitting polynomial
factors), (i) a 4.54^k algorithm to detect whether there is a weak backdoor set
of at most k variables into the class of Horn formulas; (ii) a 2.27^k algorithm
to detect whether there is a weak backdoor set of at most k variables into the
class of Krom formulas. These bounds improve an earlier known bound of 6^k. We
also prove a 2^k lower bound for these problems, subject to the Strong
Exponential Time Hypothesis.
