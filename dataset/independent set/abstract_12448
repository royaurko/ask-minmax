Random graphs are matrices with independent 0, 1 elements with probabilities
determined by a small number of parameters. One of the oldest model is the
Rasch model where the odds are ratios of positive numbers scaling the rows and
columns. Later Persi Diaconis with his coworkers rediscovered the model for
symmetric matrices and called the model beta. Here we give goodnes-of-fit tests
for the model and extend the model to a version of the block model introduced
by Holland, Laskey, and Leinhard.
