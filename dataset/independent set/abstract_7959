A completely elementary and self-contained proof of convergence of Gaussian
multiplicative chaos is given. The argument shows further that the limiting
random measure is nontrivial in the entire subcritical phase $(\gamma <
\sqrt{2d})$ and that the limit is universal (i.e., the limiting measure is
independent of the regularisation of the underlying field)
