In a recent paper Dajka, et.al., [J. Phys. A \textbf{40}, F879 (2007)]
predicted that some composite systems can be entangled forever even if coupled
with a thermal bath. We analyze the transient entanglement of a
single-Cooper-pair box biased by a classical voltage and irradiated by a
quantized field and find the unusual feature that the phase-damped cavity can
lead to a long-lived entanglement. The results show an asymptotic value of the
idempotency defect (concurrence) which embodies coherence loss (entanglement
survival), independent of the interaction development by dependent critically
on environment.
