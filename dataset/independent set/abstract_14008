It is well known that for $a>4$, the dynamical behaviors of the logistic map
$f_a(x)=ax(1-x)$ on the maximal invariant compact set are "simple" which could
be clearly explained by the theories of hyperbolic dynamics and symbolic
dynamics. Is it possible that similar phenomena could be observed in general
real polynomial maps? In this paper, we study this problem by investigating the
real polynomial map $f_a(x)=ag(x)$, where $a$ is a parameter, and $g$ is a
real-coefficient polynomial, which has at least two different real zeros or
only one real zero.
