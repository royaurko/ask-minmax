We establish large deviation principles and phase transition results for both
quenched and annealed settings of nearest-neighbor random walks with constant
drift in random nonnegative potentials on $\mathbb Z^d$. We complement the
analysis of \cite{Zer}, where a shape theorem on the Lyapunov functions and a
large deviation principle in absence of the drift are achieved for the quenched
setting.
