We obtain the general solution for non-extremal 3-charge dilatonic rotating
black holes in the U(1)^3 gauged five-dimensional N=2 supergravity coupled to
two vector multiplets, in the case where the two rotation parameters are set
equal. These solutions encompass all the previously-known extremal solutions,
and, by setting the three charges equal, the recently-obtained non-extremal
solutions of N=2 gauged five-dimensional pure supergravity.
