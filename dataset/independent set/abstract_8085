According to the method, suggested in our previous work (nlin/0509012) and
based on the consideration of the specially coupled systems, the possibility of
physical realization of the phenomena of complex analytic dynamics (such as
Mandelbrot and Julia sets) is discussed. It is shown, that unlike the case of
discrete maps or differential systems with periodic driving, investigated in
mentioned work, there are some difficulties in attempts to obtain the
Mandelbrot set for the coupled autonomous continuous systems. A system of
coupled autonomous R\"{o}ssler oscillators is considered as an example.
