We investigate the possibility of electrostatic potential saturation, which
may lead to the phenomenon of effective charge saturation. The system under
study is a uniformly charged infinite plane immersed in an arbitrary
electrolyte made up of several micro-species. To describe the electric double
layer, we use a generic density functional theory in which the local
micro-ionic density profiles are arbitrary functions of the local electrostatic
potential. A necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for saturation,
whereby the electrostatic potential created by the plane becomes independent of
its bare charge, provided the latter is large enough.
