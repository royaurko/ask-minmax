Two parties wish to carry out certain distributed computational tasks, and
they are given access to a source of correlated random bits. It allows the
parties to act in a correlated manner, which can be quite useful. But what
happens if the shared randomness is not perfect? In this work, we initiate the
study of the power of different sources of shared randomness in communication
complexity. This is done in the setting of simultaneous message passing (SMP)
model of communication complexity, which is one of the most suitable models for
studying the resource of shared randomness. Toward characterising the power of
various sources of shared randomness, we introduce a measure for the quality of
a source - we call it collision complexity. Our results show that the collision
complexity tightly characterises the power of a (shared) randomness resource in
the SMP model.
  Of independent interest is our demonstration that even the weakest sources of
shared randomness can in some cases increase the power of SMP substantially:
the equality function can be solved very efficiently with virtually any
nontrivial shared randomness.
