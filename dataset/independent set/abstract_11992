Coherent x-ray diffractive imaging is extended to high resolution strain
analysis in crystalline nanostructured devices. The application potential is
demonstrated by determining the strain distribution in (Ga,Mn)As/GaAs
nanowires. By separating diffraction signals in reciprocal spaces, individual
parts of the device could be reconstructed independently by our inversion
procedure. We demonstrate the method to be effective for material specific
reconstruction of strain distribution in highly integrated devices.
