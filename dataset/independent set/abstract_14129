The problem of spin-0 and spin-1 bosons in the background of a general mixing
of minimal and nonminimal vector inversely linear potentials is explored in a
unified way in the context of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory. It is shown that
spin-0 and spin-1 bosons behave effectively in the same way. An orthogonality
criterion is set up and it is used to determine uniquely the set of solutions
as well as to show that even-parity solutions do not exist.
