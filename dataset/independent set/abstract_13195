We put forward a new model-independent reconstruction scheme for dark energy
which utilises the expected geometrical features of the luminosity-distance
relation. The important advantage of this scheme is that it does not assume
explicit ansatzes for cosmological parameters but only some very general
cosmological properties via the geometrical features of the reconstructed
luminosity-distance relation. Using the recently released supernovae data by
the Supernova Legacy Survey together with a phase space representation, we show
that the reconstructed luminosity-distance curves best fitting the data
correspond to a slightly varying dark energy density with the Universe
expanding slightly slower than the Lambda CDM model. However, the Lambda CDM
model fits the data at 1 sigma significance level and the fact that our best
fitting luminosity-distance curve is lower than that of the corresponding
Lambda CDM model could be due to systematics. The transition from an
accelerating to a decelerating expansion occurs at a redshift larger than
z=0.35. Interpreting the dark energy as a minimally coupled scalar field we
also reconstruct the scalar field and its potential. We constrain
$\Omega_{m_0}$ using the baryon acoustic oscillation peak in the SDSS luminous
red galaxy sample and find that the best fit is obtained with
$\Omega_{m_0}=0.27$, in agreement with the CMB data.
