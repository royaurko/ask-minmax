In 1979 Frankl conjectured that in a finite non-trivial union-closed
collection of sets there has to be an element that belongs to at least half the
sets. We show that this is equivalent to the conjecture that in a finite
non-trivial graph there are two adjacent vertices each belonging to at most
half of the maximal stable sets. In this graph formulation other special cases
become natural. The conjecture is trivially true for non-bipartite graphs and
we show that it holds also for the classes of chordal bipartite graphs,
subcubic bipartite graphs, bipartite series-parallel graphs and bipartitioned
circular interval graphs.
