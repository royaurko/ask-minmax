We derive exact analytic expressions for the distributions of eigenvalues and
singular values for the product of an arbitrary number of independent
rectangular Gaussian random matrices in the limit of large matrix dimensions.
We show that they both have power-law behavior at zero and determine the
corresponding powers. We also propose a heuristic form of finite size
corrections to these expressions which very well approximates the distributions
for matrices of finite dimensions.
