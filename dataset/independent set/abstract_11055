We review a number of results for the spectrum and inclusive decays of heavy
quarkonium systems which can be derived from QCD under well controlled
approximations. They essentially follow from the hierarchy of scales in these
systems, which can be efficiently exploited using non-relativistic effective
field theories. In particular, we discuss under which conditions
non-relativistic potential models emerge as effective theories of QCD.
