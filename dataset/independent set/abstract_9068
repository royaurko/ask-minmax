The data collected by DELPHI in 1998 at the centre-of-mass energy of 189 GeV
have been used to update the search for charginos nearly mass-degenerate with
the lightest supersymmetric particle, which is assumed to be the lightest
neutralino. Mass differences below \Delta M = 3 GeV/c^2 are considered. No
excess of events with respect to the Standard Model expectation has been
observed, and exclusions in the plane of \Delta M versus chargino mass are
given. The new \Delta M independent lower limit on the mass of the chargino is
62.4 GeV/c^2 in the higgsino scenario (which includes the gaugino mass
unification scenario), if all sfermions are heavier than the lightest chargino.
In the approximation of large sfermion masses the limit is 59.8 GeV/c^2,
independently of the field content.
