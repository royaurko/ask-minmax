Mesoscopic fluctuations of two-port conductance and four-port resistance
between Hall plateaus are studied within a realistic model for a
two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field and a smooth
disordered potential. The two-port conductance distribution $P(g)$ is concave
between $g=0$ and $g=1$ and is nearly flat between $g=0.2$ and $g=0.8$. These
characteristics are consistent with recent observations. The distribution is
found to be sharply peaked near the end-points $g=0$ and $g=1$. The
distribution functions for the three independent resistances in a four-port
Hall bar geometry are, on the other hand, characterized by a central peak and a
relatively large width.
