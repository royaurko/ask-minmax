Using dispersion theoretic techniques, we consider coherent long range forces
arising from double pseudoscalar exchange among fermions. We find that Yukawa
type coupling leads to $1/r^3$ spin independent attractive potentials whereas
derivative coupling renders $1/r^5$ spin independent repulsive potentials.
