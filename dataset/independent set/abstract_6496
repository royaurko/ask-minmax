We present the systematic results for three dimensional fragmentation
functions defined via the quark-quark correlator for hadrons with spin 0, 1/2
and 1 respectively. These results are presented in terms of a spin independent
part, a vector polarization dependent part and a tensor polarization dependent
part. For spin 0 hadrons, only the spin independent part is needed, for spin
1/2 hadron, the polarization independent and vector polarization dependent
parts are present, while for spin 1 hadrons, all the three parts exist. We
discuss the general properties of these fragmentation functions and also
present the corresponding results when transverse momentum is integrated.
