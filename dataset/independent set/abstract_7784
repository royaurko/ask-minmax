A new database from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) of galaxy
Distances (NED-D), normally the source for the newest precision-based
estimates, provides access to the oldest redshift-independent extragalactic
distances in the publication record. Two new surprises emerge when the early
distance estimates are placed in chronological order. Both discoveries credited
to Hubble based on these distances had in fact been made earlier. Hubble
however, proved the case.
