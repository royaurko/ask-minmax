We study connected sum at infinity on smooth, open manifolds. This operation
requires a choice of proper ray in each manifold summand. In favorable
circumstances, the connected sum at infinity operation is independent of ray
choices. For each m at least 3, we construct an infinite family of pairs of
m-manifolds on which the connected sum at infinity operation yields distinct
manifolds for certain ray choices. We use cohomology algebras at infinity to
distinguish these manifolds.
