In this paper, we study network coding capacity for random wireless networks.
Previous work on network coding capacity for wired and wireless networks have
focused on the case where the capacities of links in the network are
independent. In this paper, we consider a more realistic model, where wireless
networks are modeled by random geometric graphs with interference and noise. In
this model, the capacities of links are not independent. We consider two
scenarios, single source multiple destinations and multiple sources multiple
destinations. In the first scenario, employing coupling and martingale methods,
we show that the network coding capacity for random wireless networks still
exhibits a concentration behavior around the mean value of the minimum cut
under some mild conditions. Furthermore, we establish upper and lower bounds on
the network coding capacity for dependent and independent nodes. In the second
one, we also show that the network coding capacity still follows a
concentration behavior. Our simulation results confirm our theoretical
predictions.
