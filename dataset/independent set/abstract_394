We study quasiminimal classes, i.e. abstract elementary classes (AECs) that
arise from a quasiminimal pregeometry structure. For these classes, we develop
an independence notion, and in particular, a theory of independence in
$\M^{eq}$. We then generalize Hrushovski's Group Configuration Theorem to our
setting. In an attempt to generalize Zariski geometries to the context of
quasiminimal classes, we give the axiomatization for Zariski-like structures,
and as an application of our group configuration theorem, show that groups can
be found in them assuming that the pregeometry obtained from the bounded
closure operator is non-trivial. Finally, we study the cover of the
multiplicative group of an algebraically closed field and show that it provides
an example of a Zariski-like structure.
