Since an old observation by Beenakker et al, the evaluation of QCD processes
in dimensional reduction has repeatedly led to terms that seem to violate the
QCD factorization theorem. We reconsider the example of the process gg->ttbar
and show that the factorization problem can be completely resolved. A natural
interpretation of the seemingly non-factorizing terms is found, and they are
rewritten in a systematic and factorized form. The key to the solution is that
the D- and (4-D)-dimensional parts of the 4-dimensional gluon have to be
regarded as independent partons.
