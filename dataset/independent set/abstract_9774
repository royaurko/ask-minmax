A semialgebraic bijection from the field of p-adic numbers to itself minus
one point is constructed. Semialgebraic p-adic sets are classified up to
semialgebraic bijection. A cell decomposition theorem for restricted analytic
p-adic maps is proven, in analogy with the cell decomposition theorem for
polynomial maps by Denef. This cell decomposition is used to show that a
certain algebra (built up with analytic and subanalytic p-adic functions) is
closed under p-adic integration. This solves a conjecture of Denef on
parametrized analytic p-adic integrals. Local (analytic) singular series are
shown to be in this algebra. Subanalytic p-adic sets are classified up to
subanalytic bijection. Multivariate Kloosterman sums are studied modulo powers
of p. A qualitative decay rate is obtained when this power goes to infinity.
This is a multivariate analogue of a result of Igusa's. Also Presburger groups
are studied. A dimension for Presburger sets is defined, Presburger sets are
classified up to definable bijection, and elimination of imaginaries is proven.
Grothendieck rings of several classes of valued fields are calculated.
