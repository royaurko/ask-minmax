We present a partonic Monte Carlo event generator that can be used for
calculating the group independent kinematical functions of any infrared safe
four-jet observable at NLO accuracy. As an example, we calculate the
differential distribution of the $\Pi_1$ and $\Pi_4$ Fox-Wolfram moments. We
find large K factors (K $>$ 2). The effect of the radiative correction is to
increase the overall normalization, but not to reduce the renormalization scale
dependence significantly.
