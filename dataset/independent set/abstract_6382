We show that an independent family of uniformly distributed random
permutation matrices is asymptotically *-free from an independent family of
square complex Gaussian matrices and from an independent family of complex
Wishart matrices, and that in both cases the convergence in *-distribution
actually holds almost surely. An immediate consequence is that, if the rows of
a GUE matrix are randomly permuted, then the resulting (non self-adjoint)
random matrix has a *-distribution which is asymptotically circular; similarly,
a random permutation of the rows of a complex Wishart matrix results in a
random matrix which is asymptotically *-distributed like an R-diagonal element
from free probability theory.
