The solar photospheric oxygen abundance is still widely debated. Adopting the
solar chemical composition based on the "low" oxygen abundance, as determined
with the use of three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical model atmospheres,
results in a well-known mismatch between theoretical solar models and
helioseismic measurements that is so far unresolved. We carry out an
independent redetermination of the solar oxygen abundance by investigating the
center-to-limb variation of the OI IR triplet lines at 777 nm in different sets
of spectra with the help of detailed synthetic line profiles based on 3D
hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmospheres and 3D non-LTE line formation
calculations with NLTETD. The idea is to simultaneously derive the oxygen
abundance,A(O), and the scaling factor SH that describes the cross-sections for
inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen relative the classical Drawin
formula. The best fit of the center-to-limb variation of the triplet lines
achieved with the CO5BOLD 3D solar model is clearly of superior quality
compared to the line profile fits obtained with standard 1D model atmospheres.
Our best estimate of the 3D non-LTE solar oxygen abundance is A(O) = 8.76 +/-
0.02, with the scaling factor SH in the range between 1.2 and 1.8. All 1D
non-LTE models give much lower oxygen abundances, by up to -0.15 dex. This is
mainly a consequence of the assumption of a $\mu$-independent microturbulence.
