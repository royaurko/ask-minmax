When two independently-prepared Bose-Einstein condensates are released from
their corresponding traps, the absorbtion image of the overlapping clouds
presents an interference pattern. Here we analyze a model introduced by
Javanainen and Yoo (J. Javanainen and S. M. Yoo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 161
(1996)), who considered two atomic condensates described by plane waves
propagating in opposite directions. We present an analytical argument for the
measurement-induced breaking of the relative phase symmetry in this system,
demonstrating how the phase gets localized after a large enough number of
detection events.
