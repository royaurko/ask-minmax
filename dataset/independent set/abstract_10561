Large populations of globally-coupled identical maps subjected to independent
additive noise are shown to undergo qualitative changes as the features of the
stochastic process are varied. We show that for strong coupling, the collective
dynamics can be described in terms of a few effective macroscopic degrees of
freedom, whose deterministic equations of motion are systematically derived
through an order parameter expansion.
