The idea of changing our energy system from a hierarchical design into a set
of nearly independent microgrids becomes feasible with the availability of
small renewable energy generators. The smart microgrid concept comes with
several challenges in research and engineering targeting load balancing,
pricing, consumer integration and home automation. In this paper we first
provide an overview on these challenges and present approaches that target the
problems identified. While there exist promising algorithms for the particular
field, we see a missing integration which specifically targets smart
microgrids. Therefore, we propose an architecture that integrates the presented
approaches and defines interfaces between the identified components such as
generators, storage, smart and \dq{dumb} devices.
