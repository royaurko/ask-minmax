We study the resonant set of a two-level Schr\"odinger operator with a linear
conical intersection. This model operator can be decomposed into a direct sum
of first order systems on the real half-line. For these ordinary differential
systems we locally construct exact WKB solutions, which are connected to global
solutions, amongst which are resonant states. The main results are a
generalized Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition and an asymptotic
description of the set of resonances as a distorted lattice.
