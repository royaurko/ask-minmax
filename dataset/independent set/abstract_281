This paper describes a new feature set, called the extended directional
features (EDF) for use in the recognition of online handwritten strokes. We use
EDF specifically to recognize strokes that form a basis for producing
Devanagari script, which is the most widely used Indian language script. It
should be noted that stroke recognition in handwritten script is equivalent to
phoneme recognition in speech signals and is generally very poor and of the
order of 20% for singing voice. Experiments are conducted for the automatic
recognition of isolated handwritten strokes. Initially we describe the proposed
feature set, namely EDF and then show how this feature can be effectively
utilized for writer independent script recognition through stroke recognition.
Experimental results show that the extended directional feature set performs
well with about 65+% stroke level recognition accuracy for writer independent
data set.
