On an infinite set some closure operators are finitary (algebraic) while
others are not. We can generalize this idea for a complete algebraic lattice
letting the compact elements act as the finite sets. With this in mind, we will
consider the set of algebraic closure operators on such a lattice. We will show
this set forms a complete lattice that is also an algebraic lattice.
