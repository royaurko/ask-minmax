Small non-spherical perturbations of a spherically symmetric but
time-dependent background spacetime can be used to model situations of
astrophysical interest, for example the production of gravitational waves in a
supernova explosion. We allow for perfect fluid matter with an arbitrary
equation of state p=p(rho,s), coupled to general relativity. Applying a general
framework proposed by Gerlach and Sengupta, we obtain covariant field
equations, in a 2+2 reduction of the spacetime, for the background and a
complete set of gauge-invariant perturbations, and then scalarize them using
the natural frame provided by the fluid. Building on previous work by Seidel,
we identify a set of true perturbation degrees of freedom admitting free
initial data for the axial and for the l>1 polar perturbations. The true
degrees of freedom are evolved among themselves by a set of coupled wave and
transport equations, while the remaining degrees of freedom can be obtained by
quadratures. The polar l=0,1 perturbations are discussed in the same framework.
They require gauge fixing and do not admit an unconstrained evolution scheme.
