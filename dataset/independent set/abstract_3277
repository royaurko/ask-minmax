Growth hormone (GH) constitutes a set of closely related protein isoforms. In
clinical practice, the disagreement of test results between commercially
available ligand-binding assays is still an ongoing issue, and incomplete
knowledge about the particular function of the different forms leaves an
uncertainty of what should be the appropriate measurand. Mass spectrometry is
promising to be a way forward. Not only is it capable of providing SI-traceable
reference values for the calibration of current GH-tests, but it also offers an
independent approach to highly reliable mass-selective quantification of
individual GH-isoforms. This capability may add to reliability in doping
control too. The article points out why and how.
