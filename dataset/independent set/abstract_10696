A complete description of the linearized gravitational field on a flat
background is given in terms of gauge-independent quasilocal quantities. This
is an extension of the results from gr-qc/9801068. Asymptotic spherical
quasilocal parameterization of the Weyl field and its relation with Einstein
equations is presented. The field equations are equivalent to the wave
equation. A generalization for Schwarzschild background is developed and the
axial part of gravitational field is fully analyzed. In the case of axial
degree of freedom for linearized gravitational field the corresponding
generalization of the d'Alembert operator is a Regge-Wheeler equation. Finally,
the asymptotics at null infinity is investigated and strong peeling property
for axial waves is proved.
