We study the possibility for the process $pp \rightarrow p\gamma p
\rightarrow pW^-t(W^+\bar t)X$ with anomalous Wtb couplings in a model
independent effective Lagrangian approach at the LHC. We find 95% confidence
level bounds on the anomalous coupling parameters for various values of the
integrated luminosity. The improved constraints on the anomalous Wtb couplings
have been obtained compared to current limits.
