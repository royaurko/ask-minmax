We generalize the construction of affine polar graphs in two different ways
to obtain new partial difference sets and amorphic association schemes. The
first generalization uses a combination of quadratic forms and uniform
cyclotomy. In the second generalization we replace the quadratic form in the
affine polar graph construction by higher degree homogeneous functions that are
$p$-ary weakly regular bent. The negative Latin square type partial difference
sets arising from the first generalization are new.
