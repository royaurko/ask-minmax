We study products of Borel sets in compact groups which are "small" with
respect to certain connected abelian subgroups and show that these sets must
"reduce" to very regular subsets of "nicer" groups. We also establish a general
principle which roughly asserts that if a pair of Borel sets in a compact group
has a small product set which is not small with respect to the identity
component of the group, then the pair must be "locally" invariant under an open
subgroup. Our main theorem generalizes a classical theorem of Kneser (recently
extended by Griesmer) to certain non-abelian compact groups. We also mention a
few applications of our main result to products of large infinite subsets of
countable amenable groups.
