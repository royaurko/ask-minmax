In this note we report some model-independent bounds involving transition
form factors for $ \Omb \rightarrow \Omc $ and $ \Omb \rightarrow \Omc ^* $ and
the nonperturbative matrix elements of the $ \Omb $ system. They are derived by
using operator product expansion (OPE) in Heavy Quark Effective Theory .
