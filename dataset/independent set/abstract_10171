By representing the range of fair betting odds according to a pair of
confidence set estimators, dual probability measures on parameter space called
frequentist posteriors secure the coherence of subjective inference without any
prior distribution. The closure of the set of expected losses corresponding to
the dual frequentist posteriors constrains decisions without arbitrarily
forcing optimization under all circumstances. This decision theory reduces to
those that maximize expected utility when the pair of frequentist posteriors is
induced by an exact or approximate confidence set estimator or when an
automatic reduction rule is applied to the pair. In such cases, the resulting
frequentist posterior is coherent in the sense that, as a probability
distribution of the parameter of interest, it satisfies the axioms of the
decision-theoretic and logic-theoretic systems typically cited in support of
the Bayesian posterior. Unlike the p-value, the confidence level of an interval
hypothesis derived from such a measure is suitable as an estimator of the
indicator of hypothesis truth since it converges in sample-space probability to
1 if the hypothesis is true or to 0 otherwise under general conditions.
