To re-examine the rich cluster $\Omega$ value the CNOC Cluster Survey has
observed 16 high X-ray luminosity clusters in the redshift range 0.17 to 0.55,
obtaining approximately 2600 velocities in their fields. Directly adding all
the K and evolution corrected $r$ band light to $M_r(0)=-18.5$, about
$0.2L_\ast$, and correcting for the light below the limit, the average
mass-to-light ratio of the clusters is $283\pm27h\msun/\lsun$ and the average
mass per galaxy is $3.5\pm0.4\times10^{12}h^{-1}\msun$. The clusters are
consistent with having a universal $M_v/L$ value (within the errors of about
20\%) independent of their velocity dispersion, mean color of their galaxies,
blue galaxy content, redshift, or mean interior density. Using field galaxies
within the same data set, with the same corrections, we find that the closure
mass-to-light, $\rho_c/j$, is $1160\pm130h\msun/\lsun$ and the closure mass per
galaxy, $\rho_c/\phi(>0.2L_\ast)$, is $13.2\pm1.9\times10^{12}h^{-1}\msun$.
Under the assumptions that the galaxies are distributed like the mass and that
the galaxy luminosities and numbers are statistically conserved, which these
data indirectly support, $\Omega_0=0.20\pm0.04\pm0.09$ where the errors are,
respectively, the $1\sigma$ internal and an estimate of the $1\sigma$
systematic error resulting from the luminosity normalization.
