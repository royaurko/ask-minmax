We study languages over infinite alphabets equipped with some structure that
can be tested by recognizing automata. We develop a framework for studying such
alphabets and the ensuing automata theory, where the key role is played by an
automorphism group of the alphabet. In the process, we generalize nominal sets
due to Gabbay and Pitts.
