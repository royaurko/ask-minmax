We consider the Higgs sector in extensions of the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model by higher-dimension operators in the superpotential and the
K\"ahler potential, in the context of Higgs searches at the LHC 7 TeV run. Such
an effective field theory (EFT) approach, also referred to as BMSSM, allows for
a model-independent description that may correspond to the combined effects of
additional supersymmetric sectors, such as heavy singlets, triplets or gauge
bosons, in which the supersymmetry breaking mass splittings can be treated as a
perturbation. We consider the current LHC dataset, based on about $1-2 {\rm
fb}^{-1}$ of data to set exclusion limits on a large class of BMSSM models. We
also present projections for integrated luminosities of 5 and 15 fb$^{-1}$,
assuming that the ATLAS and CMS collaborations will combine their results in
each channel. Our study shows that the majority of the parameter space will be
probed at the $2\sigma$ level with 15 fb$^{-1}$ of data. A non-observation of a
Higgs boson with about 10 fb$^{-1}$ of data will point towards a Higgs SUSY
spectrum with intermediate $\tan \beta$ ($\approx$ a few to 10) and a light
SM-like Higgs with somewhat enhanced couplings to bottom and tau pairs. We
define a number of BMSSM benchmark scenarios and analyze the possible
exclusion/discovery channels and the projected required luminosity to probe
them. We also discuss the results of the EFT framework for two specific models,
one with a singlet superfield and one with SU(2)$_L$ triplets.
