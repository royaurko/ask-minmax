We found a simple procedure for the solution of the time - independent
Schrodinger equation in one dimension without making any approximation. The
wave functions are always periodic. Two difficulties may be encountered: one is
to solve the equation E=U(x), where E and U(x) are the total and potential
energies, respectively, and the other is to calculate the integral of the
square root of U(x). If these calculations cannot be made analytically, it
should then be performed by numerical methods. To find the energy and the wave
function of the ground state, there is no need to calculate this integral, it
is sufficient to find the classical turning points, that is to solve the
equation E=U(x).
