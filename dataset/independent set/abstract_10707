We describe a formalism for studying spherically symmetric collapse of the
massless scalar field in any spacetime dimension, and for any value of the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$. The formalism is used for numerical
simulations of gravitational collapse in four spacetime dimensions with
negative $\Lambda$. We observe critical behaviour at the onset of black hole
formation, and find that the critical exponent is independent of $\Lambda$.
