It is shown that the superalgebra of observables of the rational Calogero
model based on the root system of I_2(n) type possesses [(n+1)/2] supertraces.
Model with three-particle interaction based on the root system G_2 belongs to
this class of models and its superalgebra of observables has 3 independent
supertraces.
