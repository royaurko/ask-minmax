In this paper we present a minimalistic model sufficient for current
asymmetries in molecules. In particular, we search for an interaction on the
molecule which causes current asymmetries independent of additional assumptions
or the precise form of its environment. To this end we first discuss earlier
proposals and clarify the importance of additional assumptions. We then present
a minimal model of a strongly polarizable molecule which shows a strongly
asymmetric I/V calculated within time dependent DMRG.
