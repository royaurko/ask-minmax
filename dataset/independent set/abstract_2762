The number of brown dwarfs (BDs) now identified tops 700. Yet our
understanding of these cool objects is still lacking, and models are struggling
to accurately reproduce observations. What is needed is a method of calibrating
the models, BDs whose properties (e.g. age, mass, distance, metallicity) that
can be independently determined can provide such calibration. The ability to
calculate properties based on observables is set to be of vital importance if
we are to be able to measure the properties of fainter, more distant
populations of BDs that near-future surveys will reveal, for which ground based
spectroscopic studies will become increasingly difficult. We present here the
state of the current population of age benchmark brown dwarfs.
