The paper deals with on-line regression settings with signals belonging to a
Banach lattice. Our algorithms work in a semi-online setting where all the
inputs are known in advance and outcomes are unknown and given step by step. We
apply the Aggregating Algorithm to construct a prediction method whose
cumulative loss over all the input vectors is comparable with the cumulative
loss of any linear functional on the Banach lattice. As a by-product we get an
algorithm that takes signals from an arbitrary domain. Its cumulative loss is
comparable with the cumulative loss of any predictor function from Besov and
Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. We describe several applications of our setting.
