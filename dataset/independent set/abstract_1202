Recently Knutsen found criteria for the curves in a complete linear system
$|\mathcal{L}|$ on a smooth surface $X$ in a nodal K-trivial threefold $Y_0$ to
deform to a scheme of finitely many smooth isolated curves in a general
deformation $Y_t$ of $Y_0$. In this article we develop new methods to check
whether the set of nodes of $Y_0$ imposes independent conditions on
$|\mathcal{L}|$. As an application, we find new smooth isolated curves in
complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds.
