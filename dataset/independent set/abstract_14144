We study the set of the representable numbers in base
$q=pe^{i\frac{2\pi}{n}}$ with $\rho>1$ and $n\in \mathbb N$ and with digits in
a arbitrary finite real alphabet $A$. We give a geometrical description of the
convex hull of the representable numbers in base $q$ and alphabet $A$ and an
explicit characterization of its extremal points. A characterizing condition
for the convexity of the set of representable numbers is also shown.
