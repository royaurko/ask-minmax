We analyze the chiral restoration and deconfinement transitions in the
framework of a non-local chiral quark model which includes terms leading to the
quark wave function renormalization, and takes care of the effect of gauge
interactions by coupling the quarks with the Polyakov loop. Non-local
interactions are described by considering both a set of exponential form
factors, and a set of form factors obtained from a fit to the mass and
renormalization functions obtained in lattice calculations.
