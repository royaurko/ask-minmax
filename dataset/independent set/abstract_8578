We present LO, NLO and NNLO sets of parton distribution functions (PDFs) of
the proton determined from global analyses of the available hard scattering
data. These MMHT2014 PDFs supersede the `MSTW2008' parton sets, but are
obtained within the same basic framework. We include a variety of new data
sets, from the LHC, updated Tevatron data and the HERA combined H1 and ZEUS
data on the total and charm structure functions. We also improve the
theoretical framework of the previous analysis. These new PDFs are compared to
the `MSTW2008' parton sets. In most cases the PDFs, and the predictions, are
within one standard deviation of those of MSTW2008. The major changes are the
$u-d$ valence quark difference at small $x$ due to an improved parameterisation
and, to a lesser extent, the strange quark PDF due to the effect of certain LHC
data and a better treatment of the $D \to \mu$ branching ratio. We compare our
MMHT PDF sets with those of other collaborations; in particular with the
NNPDF3.0 sets, which are contemporary with the present analysis.
