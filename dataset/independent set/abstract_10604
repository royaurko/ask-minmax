We report measurements of the electron transport through atomic-scale
constrictions and tunnel junctions between ferromagnetic electrodes. Structures
are fabricated using a combination of e-beam lithography and controlled
electromigration. Sample geometries are chosen to allow independent control of
electrode bulk magnetizations. As junction size is decreased to the single
channel limit, conventional anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) increases in
magnitude, approaching the size expected for tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR)
upon tunnel junction formation. Significant mesoscopic variations are seen in
the magnitude and sign of the magnetoresistance, and no evidence is found of
large ballistic magnetoresistance effects.
