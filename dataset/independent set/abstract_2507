The notion of B-convexity for operator spaces, which a priori depends on a
set of parameters indexed by $\Sigma$, is defined. Some of the classical
characterizations of this geometric notion for Banach spaces are studied in
this new context. For instance, an operator space is $B_{\Sigma}$-convex if and
only if it has $\Sigma$-subtype. The class of uniformly non-$L^1(\Sigma)$
operator spaces, which is also the class of $B_{\Sigma}$-convex operator
spaces, is introduced. Moreover, an operator space having non-trivial
$\Sigma$-type is $B_{\Sigma}$-convex. However, the converse is false. The row
and column operator spaces are nice counterexamples of this fact, since both
are Hilbertian. In particular, this result shows that a version of the
Maurey-Pisier theorem does not hold in our context. Some other examples of
Hilbertian operator spaces will be treated. In the last part of this paper, the
independence of $B_{\Sigma}$-convexity with respect to $\Sigma$ is studied.
This provides some interesting problems which will be posed.
