The N-dimensional Hamiltonian H formed by a curved kinetic term (depending on
a function f), a central potential (depending on a function U), a Dirac
monopole term, and N centrifugal terms is shown to be quasi-maximally
superintegrable for any choice of the functions f and U. This result is proven
by making use of the underlying sl(2,R)-coalgebra symmetry of H in order to
obtain a set of (2N-3) functionally independent integrals of the motion, that
are explicitly given. Such constants of the motion are "universal" since all of
them are independent of both f and U. This Hamiltonian describes the motion of
a particle on any ND spherically symmetric curved space (whose metric is
specified by a function f) under the action of an arbitrary central potental U,
and includes simultaneously a monopole-type contribution together with N
centrifugal terms that break the spherical symmetry. Moreover, we show that two
appropriate choices for U provide the "intrinsic" oscillator and the KC
potentials on these curved manifolds. As a byproduct, the MIC-Kepler, the
Taub-NUT and the so called multifold Kepler systems are shown to belong to this
class of superintegrable Hamiltonians, and new generalizations thereof are
obtained. The Kepler and oscillator potentials on N-dimensional generalizations
of the four Darboux surfaces are discussed as well.
