We consider a geometrically finite discrete group of conformal
transformations of the sphere. Further we consider distributions which are
supported on the limit set and are invariant with conformal weight. We estimate
their regularity in terms of the conformal weight, the Hausdorff dimension of
the limit set, and the maximal rank of the cusps of the group.
