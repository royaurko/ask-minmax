We investigate measurement-based entanglement purification protocols (EPP) in
the presence of local noise and imperfections. We derive a universal,
protocol-independent threshold for the required quality of the local resource
states, where we show that local noise per particle of up to 24% is tolerable.
This corresponds to an increase of the noise threshold by almost an order of
magnitude, based on the joint measurement-based implementation of sequential
rounds of few-particle EPP. We generalize our results to multipartite EPP,
where we encounter similarly high error thresholds.
