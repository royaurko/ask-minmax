Traffics are defined as elements of Voiculescu's non commutative spaces
(called non commutative random variables), for which we specify more structure.
We define a new notion of free product in that context. It is weaker than
Voiculescu's free product and encodes the independence of complex random
variables. This free product models the limits of independent random matrices
invariant by conjugation by permutation matrices. We generalize known theorems
of asymptotic freeness (for Wigner, unitary Haar, uniform permutation and
deterministic matrices) and present examples of random matrices that converges
in non commutative law and are not asymptotically free in the sense of
Voiculescu.
  Our approach provides some additional applications. Firstly, the convergence
in distribution of traffics is related to two notions of convergence of graphs,
namely the weak local convergence of Benjamini and Schramm and the convergence
of graphons of Lovasz. These connections give descriptions of the limiting
eigenvalue distributions of large graphs with uniformly bounded degree and
random matrices with variance profile.
  Moreover, we prove a new central limit theorems for the normalized sum of non
commutative random variables. It interpolates Voiculescu's and de
Moivre-Laplace central limit theorems.
