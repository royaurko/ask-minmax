In this paper, we establish a spatial central limit theorem for a large class
of supercritical branching, not necessarily symmetric, Markov processes with
spatially dependent branching mechanisms satisfying a second moment condition.
This central limit theorem generalizes and unifies all the central limit
theorems obtained recently in \cite{RSZ2} for supercritical branching symmetric
Markov processes. To prove our central limit theorem, we have to carefully
develop the spectral theory of nonsymmetric strongly continuous semigroups
which should be of independent interest.
