In this paper, we present a polynomial dynamic programming algorithm that
tests whether a $n$-vertex directed tree $T$ has an upward planar embedding
into a convex point-set $S$ of size $n$. Further, we extend our approach to the
class of outerplanar digraphs. This nontrivial and surprising result implies
that any given digraph can be efficiently tested for an upward planar embedding
into a given convex point set.
