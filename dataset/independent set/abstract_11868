There has been much recent interest in modelling epidemics on networks,
particularly in the presence of substantial clustering. Here, we develop
pairwise methods to answer questions that are often addressed using epidemic
models, in particular: on the basis of potential observations early in an
outbreak, what can be predicted about the epidemic outcomes and the levels of
intervention necessary to control the epidemic? We find that while some results
are independent of the level of clustering (early growth predicts the level of
`leaky' vaccine needed for control and peak time, while the basic reproductive
ratio predicts the random vaccination threshold) the relationship between other
quantities is very sensitive to clustering.
