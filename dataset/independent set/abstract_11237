We consider the class of Beltrami fields (eigenfields of the curl operator)
on three-dimensional Riemannian solid tori: such vector fields arise as steady
incompressible inviscid fluids and plasmas. Using techniques from contact
geometry, we construct an integer-valued index for detecting closed orbits in
the flow which are topologically inessential (they have winding number zero
with respect to the solid torus). This index is independent of the Riemannian
structure, and is computable entirely from a C^1 approximation to the vector
field on any meridional disc of the solid torus.
