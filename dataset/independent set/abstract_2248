We present a new method to parameterize Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia)
multi-color light curves. The method was developed in order to analyze the
large number of SN Ia multi-color light curves measured in current
high-redshift projects. The technique is based on empirically modeling SN Ia
luminosity variations as a function of phase, wavelength, a shape parameter,
and a color parameter. The model is trained with a sample of well measured
nearby SN Ia and then tested with an independent set of supernovae by building
an optimal luminosity distance estimator combining the supernova rest-frame
luminosity, shape parameter and color reconstructed with the model. The
distances we measure using B- and V-band data show a dispersion around the
Hubble line comparable or lower than obtained with other methods. With this
model, we are able to measure distances using U- and B-band data with a
dispersion around the Hubble line of 0.16 +- 0.05.
