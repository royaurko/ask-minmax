First a formula for the number of zeros of the orthogonal polynomial in the
intervals is presented. Then a criteria about the appearance of a zero in a gap
is given. Finally a necessary and sufficient condition is derived such that the
zeros of the orthogonal polynomials have given accumulation points in the gaps.
As a consequence it follows that every point from the gaps is an accumulation
point of the zeros of the orthogonal polynomials, if the harmonic measures of
the intervals are linearly independent over the rationals. If the harmonic
measures are rational then there is a finite number of accumulation points
only.
