Let $D$ be the differentiation operator $Df=f'$ acting on the Fr\'echet space
$\H$ of all entire functions in one variable with the standard (compact-open)
topology. It is known since 1950's that the set $H(D)$ of hypercyclic vectors
for the operator $D$ is non-empty. We treat two questions raised by Aron,
Conejero, Peris and Seoane-Sep\'ulveda whether the set $H(D)$ contains (up to
the zero function) a non-trivial subalgebra of $\H$ or an infinite dimensional
closed linear subspace of $\H$. In the present article both questions are
answered affirmatively.
