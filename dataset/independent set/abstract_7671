Let $Q_n(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} A_{i}x^{i}$ be a random algebraic polynomial where
the coefficients $A_0,A_1,... $ form a sequence of centered Gaussian random
variables. Moreover, assume that the increments $\Delta_j=A_j-A_{j-1}$,
$j=0,1,2,...$ are independent, $A_{-1}=0$. The coefficients can be considered
as $n$ consecutive observations of a Brownian motion. We study the asymptotic
behaviour of the expected number of local maxima of $Q_n(x)$ below level
$u=O(n^k)$, for some $k>0$.
