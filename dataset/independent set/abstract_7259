In this paper, we study the H\"older regularity of set-indexed stochastic
processes defined in the framework of Ivanoff-Merzbach. The first key result is
a Kolmogorov-like H\"older-continuity Theorem derived from the approximation of
the indexing collection by a nested sequence of finite subcollections.
Increments for set-indexed processes are usually not simply written as
$X_U-X_V$, hence we considered different notions of H\"older-continuity. Then,
the localization of these properties leads to various definitions of H\"older
exponents.
  In the case of Gaussian processes, almost sure values are proved for these
exponents, uniformly along the sample paths. As an application, the local
regularity of the set-indexed fractional Brownian motion and the set-indexed
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process are proved to be constant, with probability one.
