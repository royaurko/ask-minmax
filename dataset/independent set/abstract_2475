It was recently proposed that our universe could naturally come to be
dominated by 3-branes and 7-branes if the universe is ten-dimensional. In this
paper, we explicitly demonstrate that gravity can be localized on the
intersection of three 7-branes in AdS10 to give four-dimensional gravity. We
derive the exact relations among the tensions of the branes, and show that they
apply independently of the precise distribution of energy within the
necessarily thickened branes. We demonstrate this with several technical
sections showing a simple formula for the curvature tensor of a diagonal metric
with isometries as well as for the curvature at a gravitational singularity. We
also demonstrate a subtlety in applying Stoke's Theorem to this set-up.
