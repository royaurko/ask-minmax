We present the first set of quenched QCD measurements using the recently
parametrized fixed-point Dirac operator D^FP. We also give a general and
practical construction of covariant densities and conserved currents for chiral
lattice actions. The measurements include (a) hadron spectroscopy, (b)
corrections of small chiral deviations, (c) the renormalized quark condensate
from finite-size scaling and, independently, spectroscopy, (d) the topological
susceptibility, (e) small eigenvalue distributions and random matrix theory,
and (f) local chirality of near-zero modes and instanton-dominance.
