There has been great interest in applying the results of statistical
mechanics to single molecule experiements. Recent work has highlighted
so-called non-equilibrium work-energy relations and Fluctuation Theorems which
take on an equilibrium-like (time independent) form. Here I give a very simple
heuristic example where an equilibrium result (the barometric law for colloidal
particles) arises from theory describing the {\em thermodynamically}
non-equilibrium phenomenon of a single colloidal particle falling through
solution due to gravity. This simple result arises from the fact that the
particle, even while falling, is in {\em mechanical} equilibrium (gravitational
force equal the viscous drag force) at every instant. The results are
generalized by appeal to the central limit theorem. The resulting time
independent equations that hold for thermodynamically non-equilibrium (and even
non-stationary) processes offer great possibilities for rapid determination of
thermodynamic parameters from single molecule experiments.
