We construct a family of chaotic dynamical systems with explicit broad
distributions, which always violate the central limit theorem. In particular,
we show that the superposition of many statistically independent, identically
distributed random variables obeying such chaotic process converge in density
to Levy's stable laws in a full range of the index parameters. The theory
related to the connection between deterministic chaos and non-Gaussian
distributions gives us a systematic view of the purely mechanical generation of
Levy's stable laws.
