The scaling laws of the achievable communication rates and the corresponding
upper bounds of distributed reception in the presence of an interfering signal
are investigated. The scheme includes one transmitter communicating to a remote
destination via two relays, which forward messages to the remote destination
through reliable links with finite capacities. The relays receive the
transmission along with some unknown interference. We focus on three common
settings for distributed reception, wherein the scaling laws of the capacity
(the pre-log as the power of the transmitter and the interference are taken to
infinity) are completely characterized. It is shown in most cases that in order
to overcome the interference, a definite amount of information about the
interference needs to be forwarded along with the desired message, to the
destination. It is exemplified in one scenario that the cut-set upper bound is
strictly loose. The results are derived using the cut-set along with a new
bounding technique, which relies on multi letter expressions. Furthermore,
lattices are found to be a useful communication technique in this setting, and
are used to characterize the scaling laws of achievable rates.
