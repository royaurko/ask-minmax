In our recent paper, we classified plane symmetric kinematic self-similar
perfect fluid and dust solutions of the second, zeroth and infinite kinds.
However, we have missed some solutions during the process. In this short
communication, we add up those missing solutions. We have found a total of
seven solutions, out of which five turn out to be independent and cannot be
found in the earlier paper
