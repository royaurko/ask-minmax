A point set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ is universal for a class $\cal G$ if
every graph of ${\cal G}$ has a planar straight-line embedding on $S$. It is
well-known that the integer grid is a quadratic-size universal point set for
planar graphs, while the existence of a sub-quadratic universal point set for
them is one of the most fascinating open problems in Graph Drawing. Motivated
by the fact that outerplanarity is a key property for the existence of small
universal point sets, we study 2-outerplanar graphs and provide for them a
universal point set of size $O(n \log n)$.
