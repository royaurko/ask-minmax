Are (set)-consensus objects necessary? This paper answer is negative.
  We show that the availability of consensus objects can be replaced by
restricting the set of runs we consider. In particular we concentrate of the
set of runs of the Immediate-Snapshot-Model (IIS), and given the object we
identify this restricted subset of IIS runs.
  We further show that given an $(m,k)$-set consensus, an object that provides
$k$-set consensus among $m$ processors, in a system of $n$, $n>m$ processors,
we do not need to use the precise power of the objects but rather their
effective cumulative set consensus power. E.g. when $n=3, m=2,$ and $k=1$ and
all the 3 processors are active then we only use 2-set consensus among the 3
processors, as if 2-processors consensus is not available. We do this until at
least one of the 3 processors obtains an output. We show that this suggests a
new direction in the design of algorithms when consensus objects are involved.
