Various upper and lower bounds are provided for the (angular) Kronecker
constants of sets of integers. Some examples are provided where the bounds are
attained. It is proved that 5=16 bounds the angular Kronecker constants of
3-element sets of positive integers. However, numerous examples suggest that
the minimum upper bound is 1=4 for 3-element sets of positive integers.
