We recalculate the next-to-leading order Altarelli-Parisi kernel using a
method which relates it to the splitting amplitudes describing the collinear
factorization properties of scattering amplitudes. The method breaks up the
calculation of the kernel into individual pieces which have an independent
physical interpretation.
