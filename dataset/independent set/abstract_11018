Using the most general, model independent effective Hamiltonian, the rare B_s
->\gamma \nu \bar{\nu} decay with polarized photon is studied. The sensitivity
of the branching ratio and photon polarization to the new Wilson coefficients
are investigated. It is shown that these physical observables are sensitive to
the vector and tensor type interactions, which would be useful in search of new
physics.
