two-dimensional granular superconducting network at the percolation threshold
under the influence of an external perpendicular magnetic field. By numerical
simulations on the full nonlinear problem, we determine the scaling exponent
for the magnetic susceptibility. Further, we report on the scaling properties
of the current distribution. The scaling of the current is found to be
independent of the value of the magnetic field. Our results are in
contradiction with previous numerical results based on linearized equations. We
find a value for the susceptibility exponent which does not agree with existing
theoretical suggestions, but agrees perfectly with renormalization group
calculations.
