We show that anomalous diffusion can result when the steps of a random walk
are not statistically independent. We present an algorithm that counts all the
possible paths of particles diffusing on random graphs with arbitrary degree
distribution. Using this to calculate the mean square displacement, we show
that in sharp contrast to continua, random walks on random graphs can exhibit
anomalous behavior and yet have well-defined and predictable properties.
