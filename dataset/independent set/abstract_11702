Let $(X_t,t\geq0)$ be a continuous time simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$
($d\geq3$), and let $l_T(x)$ be the time spent by $(X_t,t\geq0)$ on the site
$x$ up to time $T$. We prove a large deviations principle for the $q$-fold
self-intersection local time $I_T=\sum_{x\in\mathbb{Z}^d}l_T(x)^q$ in the
critical case $q=\frac{d}{d-2}$. When $q$ is integer, we obtain similar results
for the intersection local times of $q$ independent simple random walks.
