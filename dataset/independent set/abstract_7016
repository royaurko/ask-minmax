We continue here the investigation of the relationship between the
intersection of a pair of subgroups of a Kleinian group, and in particular the
limit set of that intersection, and the intersection of the limit sets of the
subgroups. Of specific interest is the extent to which the intersection of the
limit sets being non-empty implies that the intersection of the subgroups is
non-trivial. We present examples to show that a conjecture of Susskind, stating
that the intersection of the sets of conical limit points of subgroups $\Phi$
and $\Theta$ of a Kleinian group $\Gamma$ is contained in the limit set of
$\Phi\cap \Theta$, is as sharp as can reasonably be expected. We further show
that Susskind's conjecture holds most of the time.
