Motivated by the problem of identifying correlations between genes or
features of two related biological systems, we propose a model of \emph{feature
selection} in which only a subset of the predictors $X_t$ are dependent on the
multidimensional variate $Y$, and the remainder of the predictors constitute a
"noise set" $X_u$ independent of $Y$. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we
investigated the relative performance of two methods: thresholding and
singular-value decomposition, in combination with stochastic optimization to
determine "empirical bounds" on the small-sample accuracy of an asymptotic
approximation. We demonstrate utility of the thresholding and SVD feature
selection methods to with respect to a recent infant intestinal gene expression
and metagenomics dataset.
