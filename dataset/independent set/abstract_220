We establish new results on sets of recurrence and van der Corput sets in Z^k
which refine and unify some of the previous results obtained by Sarkozy,
Furstenberg, Kamae and Mendes France, and Bergelson and Lesigne. The proofs
utilize a general equidistribution result involving prime powers which is of
independent interest.
