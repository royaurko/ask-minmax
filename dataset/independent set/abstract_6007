We show that linear probing requires 5-independent hash functions for
expected constant-time performance, matching an upper bound of [Pagh et al.
STOC'07]. More precisely, we construct a 4-independent hash functions yielding
expected logarithmic search time.
  For (1+{\epsilon})-approximate minwise independence, we show that \Omega(log
1/{\epsilon})-independent hash functions are required, matching an upper bound
of [Indyk, SODA'99].
  We also show that the very fast 2-independent multiply-shift scheme of
Dietzfelbinger [STACS'96] fails badly in both applications.
