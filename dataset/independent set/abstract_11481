Experimentally obtained and analyzed fine structure of statistical
distributions for two physically independent processes: alpha-decay rate
fluctuations of Pu-239 sample in Pushchino (Moscow region, Russia) and
equilibrium voltage fluctuations (Johnson noise) from metal-film resistor in
Tbilisi (Georgia). Special investigation of histograms shape similarity in
these processes demonstrated majority of previously studied effects, called -
macroscopic fluctuations. Offered qualitative model of the observed effects.
