The $r$-neighbour bootstrap process on a graph $G$ starts with an initial set
$A_0$ of "infected" vertices and, at each step of the process, a healthy vertex
becomes infected if it has at least $r$ infected neighbours (once a vertex
becomes infected, it remains infected forever). If every vertex of $G$
eventually becomes infected, then we say that $A_0$ percolates.
  We prove a conjecture of Balogh and Bollob\'{a}s which says that, for fixed
$r$ and $d\to\infty$, every percolating set in the $d$-dimensional hypercube
has cardinality at least $\frac{1+o(1)}{r}\binom{d}{r-1}$. We also prove an
analogous result for multidimensional rectangular grids. Our proofs exploit a
connection between bootstrap percolation and a related process, known as weak
saturation. In addition, we improve the best known upper bound for the minimum
size of a percolating set in the hypercube. In particular, when $r=3$, we prove
that the minimum cardinality of a percolating set in the $d$-dimensional
hypercube is $\left\lceil\frac{d(d+3)}{6}\right\rceil+1$ for all $d\geq3$.
