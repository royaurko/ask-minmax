The FIRAS data are independently recalibrated using the WMAP data to obtain a
CMB temperature of 2.7260 +/- 0.0013. Measurements of the temperature of the
cosmic microwave background are reviewed. The determination from the
measurements from the literature is cosmic microwave background temperature of
2.72548 +/- 0.00057 K.
