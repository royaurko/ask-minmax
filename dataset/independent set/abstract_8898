In recent years, new classes of convex functions have been introduced in
order to generalize the results and to obtain new estimations. We also
introduce the concept of harmonically convex functions on the co-ordinates.
Also, we establish some inequalities of Hermit-Hadamard type as S.S. Dragomir'
s results in Theorem 2 and other Hermit-Hadamard type inequalities for these
classes of functions.
