Eternal and m-eternal domination are concerned with using mobile guards to
protect a graph against infinite sequences of attacks at vertices. Eternal
domination allows one guard to move per attack, whereas more than one guard may
move per attack in the m-eternal domination model. Inequality chains consisting
of the domination, eternal domination, m-eternal domination, independence, and
clique covering numbers of graph are explored in this paper. Among other
results, we characterize bipartite and triangle-free graphs with domination and
eternal domination numbers equal to two, trees with equal m-eternal domination
and clique covering numbers, and two classes of graphs with equal domination,
eternal domination and clique covering numbers.
