{\it We study the class of all rearrangement-invariant (=r.i.) function
spaces $E$ on $[0,1]$ such that there exists $0<q<1$ for which $ \Vert
\sum_{_{k=1}}^n\xi_k\Vert_{E}\leq Cn^{q}$, where $\{\xi_k\}_{k\ge 1}\subset E$
is an arbitrary sequence of independent identically distributed symmetric
random variables on $[0,1]$ and $C>0$ does not depend on $n$. We completely
characterize all Lorentz spaces having this property and complement classical
results of Rodin and Semenov for Orlicz spaces $exp(L_p)$, $p\ge 1$. We further
apply our results to the study of Banach-Saks index sets in r.i. spaces.
