We propose a simple method to calculate the pion form factor at not very
large momentum transfers, which combines the technique of the QCD sum rules
with the description of the pion in terms of the set of wave functions of
increasing twist. This approach allows one to calculate the soft (end point)
contribution to the form factor in a largely model-independent way. Our results
confirm existing expectations that the soft contribution remains important at
least up to the momentum transfers of order 10 GeV$^2$, and suggest that it
comes from the region of relatively small transverse separations of order 1
GeV$^{-1}$.
