We review recent progress of the HAL QCD method which was recently proposed
to investigate hadron interactions in lattice QCD. The strategy to extract the
energy-independent non-local potential in lattice QCD is explained in detail.
The method is applied to study nucleon-nucleon, nucleon-hyperon,
hyperon-hyperon and meson-baryon interactions. Several extensions of the method
are also discussed.
