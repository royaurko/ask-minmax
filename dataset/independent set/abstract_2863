This paper offers a natural stochastic semantics of Networks of Priced Timed
Automata (NPTA) based on races between components. The semantics provides the
basis for satisfaction of probabilistic Weighted CTL properties (PWCTL),
conservatively extending the classical satisfaction of timed automata with
respect to TCTL. In particular the extension allows for hard real-time
properties of timed automata expressible in TCTL to be refined by performance
properties, e.g. in terms of probabilistic guarantees of time- and cost-bounded
properties. A second contribution of the paper is the application of
Statistical Model Checking (SMC) to efficiently estimate the correctness of
non-nested PWCTL model checking problems with a desired level of confidence,
based on a number of independent runs of the NPTA. In addition to applying
classical SMC algorithms, we also offer an extension that allows to efficiently
compare performance properties of NPTAs in a parametric setting. The third
contribution is an efficient tool implementation of our result and applications
to several case studies.
