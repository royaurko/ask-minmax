It is well-known that waves propagating under the influence of a scattering
potential develop ``tails''. However, the study of late-time tails has so far
been restricted to time-independent backgrounds. In this paper we explore the
late-time evolution of spherical waves propagating under the influence of a
{\it time-dependent} scattering potential. It is shown that the tail structure
is modified due to the temporal dependence of the potential. The analytical
results are confirmed by numerical calculations.
