We study point sets arising from cut-and-project constructions. An important
class is weak model sets, which include squarefree numbers and visible lattice
points. For such model sets, we give a non-trivial upper bound on their pattern
entropy in terms of the volume of the window boundary in internal space. This
proves a conjecture by R.V. Moody.
