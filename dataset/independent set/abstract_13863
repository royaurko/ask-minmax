Consistent interactions that can be added to a free, Abelian gauge theory
comprising a collection of BF models and a set of three-form gauge fields are
constructed from the deformation of the solution to the master equation based
on specific cohomological techniques. Under the hypotheses of smooth, local, PT
invariant, Lorentz covariant, and Poincare invariant interactions, supplemented
with the requirement on the preservation of the number of derivatives on each
field with respect to the free theory, we obtain that the deformation procedure
modifies the Lagrangian action, the gauge transformations as well as the
accompanying algebra.
