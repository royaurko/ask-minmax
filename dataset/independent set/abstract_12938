Biomolecular systems like molecular motors or pumps, transcription and
translation machinery, and other enzymatic reactions can be described as Markov
processes on a suitable network. We show quite generally that in a steady state
the dispersion of observables like the number of consumed/produced molecules or
the number of steps of a motor is constrained by the thermodynamic cost of
generating it. An uncertainty $\epsilon$ requires at least a cost of
$2k_BT/\epsilon^2$ independent of the time required to generate the output.
