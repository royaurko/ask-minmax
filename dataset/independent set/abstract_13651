Suppose that lambda = mu^+. We consider two aspects of the square property
on subsets of lambda. First, we have results which show e.g. that for aleph_0
<= kappa =cf (kappa)< mu, the equality cf([mu]^{<= kappa}, subseteq)= mu is a
sufficient condition for the set of elements of lambda whose cofinality is
bounded by kappa, to be split into the union of mu sets with squares.
Secondly, we introduce a certain weak version of the square property and prove
that if mu is a strong limit, then this weak square property holds on lambda
without any additional assumptions
