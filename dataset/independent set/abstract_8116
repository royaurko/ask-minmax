We study convex sets C of finite (but non-zero volume in Hn and En. We show
that the intersection of any such set with the ideal boundary of Hn has
Minkowski (and thus Hausdorff) dimension of at most (n-1)/2, and this bound is
sharp. In the hyperbolic case we show that for any k <= (n-1)/2 there is a
bounded section S of C through any prescribed point p, and we show an upper
bound on the radius of the ball centered at p containing such a section. We
show similar bounds for sections through the origin of convex body in En, and
give asymptotic estimates as 1 << k << n.
