Theory of scattering of massive chiral fermions in bilayer graphene by radial
symmetric potential is developed. It is shown that in the case when the
electron wavelength is much larger than the radius of the potential the
scattering cross-section is proportional to the electron wavelength. This leads
to the mobility independent on the electron concentration. In contrast with the
case of single-layer, neutral and charged defects are, in general, equally
relevant for the resistivity of the bilayer graphene.
