In the paper, we prove that a Moran set is homeomorphic to the hyperbolic
boundary of the representing symbolic space in the sense of Gromov, which
generalizes the results of Lau and Wang [Indiana U. Math. J. {\bf 58} (2009),
1777-1795]. Moreover, by making use of this, we establish the Lipschitz
equivalence of a class of Moran sets.
