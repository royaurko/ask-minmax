Traditional learning-based coreference resolvers operate by training the
mention-pair model for determining whether two mentions are coreferent or not.
Though conceptually simple and easy to understand, the mention-pair model is
linguistically rather unappealing and lags far behind the heuristic-based
coreference models proposed in the pre-statistical NLP era in terms of
sophistication. Two independent lines of recent research have attempted to
improve the mention-pair model, one by acquiring the mention-ranking model to
rank preceding mentions for a given anaphor, and the other by training the
entity-mention model to determine whether a preceding cluster is coreferent
with a given mention. We propose a cluster-ranking approach to coreference
resolution, which combines the strengths of the mention-ranking model and the
entity-mention model, and is therefore theoretically more appealing than both
of these models. In addition, we seek to improve cluster rankers via two
extensions: (1) lexicalization and (2) incorporating knowledge of anaphoricity
by jointly modeling anaphoricity determination and coreference resolution.
Experimental results on the ACE data sets demonstrate the superior performance
of cluster rankers to competing approaches as well as the effectiveness of our
two extensions.
