We study the proximity-induced superconductivity effect in a double-stranded
DNA by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and taking into account the
effect of thermal fluctuations of the twist angle between neighboring base
pairs. We show that the electron conductance is spin-dependent and the
conductance of spin up (down) increases (decreases) due to the spin-orbit
coupling. It is found that, for T<100K, the band gap energy is
temperature-independent and it decreases due to the SOC. In addition, by
solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and local gap parameter equation
self-consistently, we find the critical temperature at which transition to
superconductivity can take place.
