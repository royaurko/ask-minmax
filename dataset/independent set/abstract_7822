In this talk I review the New Physics reach of semileptonic beta decay
experiments, and their interplay with LHC searches. Assuming the new particles
are heavy enough we can use an Effective Field Theory approach to analyze the
LHC searches, what allows us to perform a direct and model-independent
comparison with low-energy experiments.
