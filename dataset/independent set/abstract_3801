We classify Lie-Poisson brackets that are formed from Lie algebra extensions.
The problem is relevant because many physical systems owe their Hamiltonian
structure to such brackets. A classification involves reducing all brackets to
a set of normal forms, independent under coordinate transformations, and is
achieved with the techniques of Lie algebra cohomology. For extensions of order
less than five, we find that the number of normal forms is small and they
involve no free parameters. A special extension, known as the Leibniz
extension, is shown to be the unique ``maximal'' extension.
  We derive a general method of finding Casimir invariants of Lie-Poisson
bracket extensions. The Casimir invariants of all brackets of order less than
five are explicitly computed, using the concept of `coextension.' We obtain the
Casimir invariants of Leibniz extensions of arbitrary order. We also offer some
physical insight into the nature of the Casimir invariants of compressible
reduced magnetohydrodynamics.
  We make use of the methods developed to study the stability of extensions for
given classes of Hamiltonians. This helps to elucidate the distinction between
semidirect extensions and those involving cocycles. For compressible reduced
magnetohydrodynamics, we find the cocycle has a destabilizing effect on the
steady-state solutions.
