By setting up appropriate uniform convergence structures, we are able to
reformulate the Order Completion Method of Oberguggenberger and Rosinger in a
setting that more closely resembles the usual topological constructions for
solving PDEs. As an application, we obtain existence and uniqueness results for
the solutions of arbitrary continuous, nonlinear PDEs.
