We consider a Quantum Computer with n quantum-bits (`qubits'), where each
qubit is coupled independently to an environment affecting the state in a
dephasing or depolarizing way. For mixed states we suggest a quantification for
the property of showing {\it quantum} uncertainty on the macroscopic level. We
illustrate in which sense a large parameter can be seen as an indicator for
large entanglement and give hypersurfaces enclosing the set of separable
states. Using methods of the classical theory of maximum likelihood estimation
we prove that this parameter is decreasing with 1/\sqrt{n} for all those states
which have been exposed to the environment.
  Furthermore we consider a Quantum Computer with perfect 1-qubit gates and
2-qubit gates with depolarizing error and show that any state which can be
obtained from a separable initial state lies inbetween a family of pairs of
certain hypersurfaces parallel to those enclosing the separable ones.
