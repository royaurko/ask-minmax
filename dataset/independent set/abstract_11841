Let $B$ be a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H=1/6$. It is
known that the symmetric Stratonovich-style Riemann sums for $\int
g(B(s))\,dB(s)$ do not, in general, converge in probability. We show, however,
that they do converge in law in the Skorohod space of c\`adl\`ag functions.
Moreover, we show that the resulting stochastic integral satisfies a change of
variable formula with a correction term that is an ordinary It\^o integral with
respect to a Brownian motion that is independent of $B$.
