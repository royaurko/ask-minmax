Certain causal models involving unmeasured variables induce no independence
constraints among the observed variables but imply, nevertheless, inequality
contraints on the observed distribution. This paper derives a general formula
for such instrumental variables, that is, exogenous variables that directly
affect some variables but not all. With the help of this formula, it is
possible to test whether a model involving instrumental variables may account
for the data, or, conversely, whether a given variables can be deemed
instrumental.
