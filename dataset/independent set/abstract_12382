Process of preheating for supersymmetric hybrid model of inflation is
generally analyzed in two different ways known as parametric resonance and
tachyonic preheating. In a common frame-work, we study both the processes from
the decay or growth of homogeneous inflaton field and inhomogeneous waterfall
field. We find that these two processes in SUSY hybrid F-term inflation are not
parameter independent; rather one process will be more preferable than the
other depending on the values of parameters and Fourier mode of the waterfall
field. Parameters of the inflationary potential are constrained from the
observed CMB data and these constrains help us to identify the process of
preheating responsible for this model.
