We consider the tracer diffusion $D_{rr}$ that arises from the run-and-tumble
motion of low Reynolds number swimmers, such as bacteria. Assuming a dilute
suspension, where the bacteria move in uncorrelated runs of length $\lambda$,
we obtain an exact expression for $D_{rr}$ for dipolar swimmers in three
dimensions, hence explaining the surprising result that this is independent of
$\lambda$. We compare $D_{rr}$ to the contribution to tracer diffusion from
entrainment.
