We study two-body correlations in systems of identical bosons. We use a
Faddeev type of decomposition of the wave function where all pairs of particles
are treated equally. We focus on a new multi-particle Efimov effect at large
scattering length, where infinitely many loosely bound many-body states appear.
A confining external trap only allows a finite number of such spatially
extended negative energy states inside the trap. The stability of a Bose
condensate is determined by the decay into these model independent intermediate
states which in turn decay into dimers.
