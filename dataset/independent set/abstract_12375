In this paper we obtain the chord length distribution function for any
regular polygon. From this function we conclude the density function and the
distribution function of the distance between two uniformly and independently
distributed random points in the regular polygon. The method to calculate the
chord length distribution function is quite different from those of Harutyunyan
and Ohanyan, uses only elementary methods and provides the result with only a
few natural case distinctions.
