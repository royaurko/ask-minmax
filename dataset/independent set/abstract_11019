The mass of the bottom quark is analyzed in the context of QCD finite energy
sum rules. In contrast to the conventional approach, we use a large momentum
expansion of the QCD correlator including terms to order \alpha
_{s}^{2}(m_{b}^{2}/q^{2})^{6} with the upsilon resonances from e^{+}e^{-}
annihilation data as main input. A stable result m_{b}(m_{b})=4.19\pm 0.05 GeV}
for the bottom quark mass is obtained. This result agrees with the independent
calculations based on the inverse moment analysis.
