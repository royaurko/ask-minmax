We reexamine the current direct dark matter data including the recent
CDMSlite and LUX data, assuming that the dark matter consists of light WIMPs,
with mass close to 10 GeV/$c^2$ with spin-independent and isospin-conserving or
isospin-violating interactions. We compare the data with a standard model for
the dark halo of our galaxy and also in a halo-independent manner. In our
standard-halo analysis, we find that for isospin-conserving couplings, CDMSlite
and LUX together exclude the DAMA, CoGeNT, CDMS-II-Si, and CRESST-II possible
WIMP signal regions. For isospin-violating couplings instead, we find that a
substantial portion of the CDMS-II-Si region is compatible with all exclusion
limits. In our halo-independent analysis, we find that for isospin-conserving
couplings, the situation is of strong tension between the positive and negative
results, as it was before the LUX and CDMSlite bounds, which turn out to
exclude the same possible WIMP signals as previous limits. For
isospin-violating couplings, we find that LUX and CDMS-II-Si bounds together
exclude or severely constrain the DAMA, CoGeNT and CRESST-II possible WIMP
signals.
