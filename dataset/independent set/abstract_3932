We consider a single hop interference network with $K$ transmitters and $J$
receivers, all having $M$ antennas. Each transmitter emits an independent
message and each receiver requests an arbitrary subset of the messages. This
generalizes the well-known $K$-user $M$-antenna interference channel, where
each message is requested by a unique receiver. For our setup, we derive the
degrees of freedom (DoF) region. The achievability scheme generalizes the
interference alignment schemes proposed by Cadambe and Jafar. In particular, we
achieve general points in the DoF region by using multiple base vectors and
aligning all interferers at a given receiver to the interferer with the largest
DoF. As a byproduct, we obtain the DoF region for the original interference
channel. We also discuss extensions of our approach where the same region can
be achieved by considering a reduced set of interference alignment constraints,
thus reducing the time-expansion duration needed. The DoF region for the
considered system depends only on a subset of receivers whose demands meet
certain characteristics. The geometric shape of the DoF region is also
discussed.
