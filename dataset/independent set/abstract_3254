We discuss the construction of gaugings in recent models of E7 Extended
Geometries, focusing on the two inequivalent SL(8) truncations of the theory.
In these sectors the conditions for the generation of gaugings in the 36, 36',
420 and 420' representations of E7 can be compactly expressed in terms of
objects which are in the fundamental representation of SL(8), making the search
of solutions simpler. As an application we discuss the generation of SO(8)
gaugings. In particular we show how the internal generalized vielbein for the
seven sphere recently found by Nicolai et al. can be derived in a completely
independent setting and we also prove that neither of these sectors is able to
generate the new SO(8) dyonic gaugings, at least if the so called section
conditions are implemented.
