The pseudorapidity densities of transverse energy, the charged particle
multiplicity and their ratios, $E_T/N_{ch}$, are estimated at mid-rapidity, in
a statistical-thermal model based on chemical freeze-out criteria, for a wide
range of energies from GSI-AGS-SPS to RHIC. It has been observed that in
nucleus-nucleus collisions, $E_T/N_{ch}$ increases rapidly with beam energy and
remains approximately constant at about a value of 800 MeV for beam energies
from SPS to RHIC. $E_T/N_{ch}$ has been observed to be almost independent of
centrality at all measured energies. The statistical-thermal model describes
the energy dependence as well as the centrality independence, qualitatively
well. The values of $E_T/N_{ch}$ are related to the chemical freeze-out
criterium, $E/N \approx 1 GeV$ valid for primordial hadrons. We have studied
the variation of the average mass $(<MASS>), N_{decays}/N_{primordial},
N_{ch}/N_{decays}$ and $E_T/N_{ch}$ with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ for all freeze-out
criteria discussed in literature. These observables show saturation around SPS
and higher $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, like the chemical freeze-out temperature
($T_{ch}$).
