Two ubiquitous aspects of large-scale data analysis are that the data often
have heavy-tailed properties and that diffusion-based or spectral-based methods
are often used to identify and extract structure of interest. Perhaps
surprisingly, popular distribution-independent methods such as those based on
the VC dimension fail to provide nontrivial results for even simple learning
problems such as binary classification in these two settings. In this paper, we
develop distribution-dependent learning methods that can be used to provide
dimension-independent sample complexity bounds for the binary classification
problem in these two popular settings. In particular, we provide bounds on the
sample complexity of maximum margin classifiers when the magnitude of the
entries in the feature vector decays according to a power law and also when
learning is performed with the so-called Diffusion Maps kernel. Both of these
results rely on bounding the annealed entropy of gap-tolerant classifiers in a
Hilbert space. We provide such a bound, and we demonstrate that our proof
technique generalizes to the case when the margin is measured with respect to
more general Banach space norms. The latter result is of potential interest in
cases where modeling the relationship between data elements as a dot product in
a Hilbert space is too restrictive.
