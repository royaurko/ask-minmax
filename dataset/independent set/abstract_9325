We use a power expansion representation of plane elasticity complex
potentials due to Kolossov and Muskhelishvili, to compute the elastic fields
induced by a localized plastic deformation event. Far from its center, the
dominant contributions correspond to first order singularities of quadrupolar
and dipolar symmetry which can be associated respectively to pure deviatoric
and pure volumetric plastic strain of an equivalent circular inclusion.
Constructing holomorphic functions from the displacement field and its
derivatives, it is possible to define path independent Cauchy integrals which
capture the amplitudes of these singularities. Analytical expressions and
numerical tests on simple finite element data are presented. The development of
such numerical tools is of direct interest for the identification of local
structural reorganizations which are believed to be the key mechanisms for
plasticity of amorphous materials.
