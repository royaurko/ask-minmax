A two-mode single-atom laser is considered, with the aim of generating
entanglement in macroscopic light. Two transitions in the four-level gain
medium atom independently interact with the two cavity modes, while two other
transitions are driven by control laser fields. Atomic relaxation as well as
cavity losses are taken into account. We show that this system is a source of
macroscopic entangled light over a wide range of control parameters and initial
states of the cavity field.
