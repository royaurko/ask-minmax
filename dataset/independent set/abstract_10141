We introduce a generalization of Selman's P-selectivity that yields a more
flexible notion of selectivity, called (polynomial-time) multi-selectivity, in
which the selector is allowed to operate on multiple input strings. Since our
introduction of this class, it has been used to prove the first known (and
optimal) lower bounds for generalized selectivity-like classes in terms of
EL_2, the second level of the extended low hierarchy. We study the resulting
selectivity hierarchy, denoted by SH, which we prove does not collapse. In
particular, we study the internal structure and the properties of SH and
completely establish, in terms of incomparability and strict inclusion, the
relations between our generalized selectivity classes and Ogihara's P-mc
(polynomial-time membership-comparable) classes. Although SH is a strictly
increasing infinite hierarchy, we show that the core results that hold for the
P-selective sets and that prove them structurally simple also hold for SH. In
particular, all sets in SH have small circuits; the NP sets in SH are in Low_2,
the second level of the low hierarchy within NP; and SAT cannot be in SH unless
P = NP. Finally, it is known that P-Sel, the class of P-selective sets, is not
closed under union or intersection. We provide an extended selectivity
hierarchy that is based on SH and that is large enough to capture those
closures of the P-selective sets, and yet, in contrast with the P-mc classes,
is refined enough to distinguish them.
