We prove that externally definable sets in first order NIP theories have
honest definitions, giving a new proof of Shelah's expansion theorem. Also we
discuss a weak notion of stable embeddedness true in this context. Those
results are then used to prove a general theorem on dependent pairs, which in
particular answers a question of Baldwin and Benedikt on naming an
indiscernible sequence.
