We investigate the notions of strict independence and strict non-forking, and
establish basic properties and connections between the two. In particular it
follows from our investigation that in resilient theories strict non-forking is
symmetric. Based on this study, we develop notions of weight which characterize
NTP2, dependence and strong dependence. Many of our proofs rely on careful
analysis of sequences that witness dividing. We prove simple characterizations
of such sequences in resilient theories, as well as of Morley sequences which
are witnesses. As a by-product we obtain information on types co-dominated by
generically stable types in dependent theories. For example, we prove that
every Morley sequence in such a type is a witness.
