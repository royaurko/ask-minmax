The problem of computation of the joint (generalized) spectral radius of
matrix sets has been discussed in a number of publications. In the paper an
iteration procedure is considered that allows to build numerically Barabanov
norms for the irreducible matrix sets and simultaneously to compute the joint
spectral radius of these sets.
