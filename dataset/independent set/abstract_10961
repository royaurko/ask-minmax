Higgs boson production via weak boson fusion at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider has the capability to determine the dominant CP nature of a Higgs
boson, via the tensor structure of its coupling to weak bosons. This
information is contained in the azimuthal angle distribution of the two
outgoing forward tagging jets. The technique is independent of both the Higgs
boson mass and the observed decay channel.
