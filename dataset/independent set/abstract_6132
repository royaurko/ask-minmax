Compact locally maximal hyperbolic sets are studied via geometrically defined
functional spaces that take advantage of the smoothness of the map in a
neighborhood of the hyperbolic set. This provides a self-contained theory that
not only reproduces all the known classical results but gives also new insights
on the statistical properties of these systems.
