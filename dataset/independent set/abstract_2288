When a large number N of independent diffusing particles are placed upon a
site of a d-dimensional Euclidean lattice randomly occupied by a concentration
c of traps, what is the m-th moment <t^m_{j,N}> of the time t_{j,N} elapsed
until the first j are trapped? An exact answer is given in terms of the
probability Phi_M(t) that no particle of an initial set of M=N, N-1,..., N-j
particles is trapped by time t. The Rosenstock approximation is used to
evaluate Phi_M(t), and it is found that for a large range of trap
concentracions the m-th moment of t_{j,N} goes as x^{-m} and its variance as
x^{-2}, x being ln^{2/d} (1-c) ln N. A rigorous asymptotic expression (dominant
and two corrective terms) is given for <t^m_{j,N}> for the one-dimensional
lattice.
