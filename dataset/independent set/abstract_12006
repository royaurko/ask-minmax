It is shown that the Majorana phases of the neutrino mixing matrix cannot
have any effect in neutrino oscillations, contrary to the argument presented in
arXiv:0912.5266. It is also shown that in a charged-current weak interaction
process it is not possible to create a coherent superposition of different
flavor neutrinos which is independent of the associated charged leptons.
