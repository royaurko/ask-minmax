In dynamical systems composed of interacting parts, conditional exponents,
conditional exponent entropies and cylindrical entropies are shown to be well
defined ergodic invariants which characterize the dynamical selforganization
and statitical independence of the constituent parts. An example of interacting
Bernoulli units is used to illustrate the nature of these invariants.
