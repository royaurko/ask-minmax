In this paper we study the harmonic functions and the Dirichlet
eigenfunctions of the Hata set, and their restrictions to the interval $[0,1]$,
its main edge. We prove that these restrictions of the harmonic functions are
singular, \ie monotone and with zero derivatives almost everywhere, and provide
numerical evidence that this is also the case for the eigenfunctions.
