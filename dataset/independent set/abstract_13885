We study some subsets of rational points in an algebraic groups defined by
open conditions on their projection in the finite adeles points. Using adelic
mixing we are able to prove an equidistribution's result for the projection of
these sets in the real points. As an application, we study the existence and
the repartition of rational unitary matrices having a given denominator. We
prove a local-global principle for this problem and the equirepartition of the
sets of denominator n-matrices when they are not empty. Then we study the more
complicated case of non simply-connected groups applying it to quadratic forms.
