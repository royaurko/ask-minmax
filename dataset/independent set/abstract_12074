We prove almost sharp upper bounds for the L^p norms of eigenfunctions of the
full ring of invariant differential operators on a compact locally symmetric
space. Our proof combines techniques from semiclassical analysis with harmonic
theory on reductive groups, and makes use of new asymptotic bounds for
spherical functions that are of independent interest.
