We provide new results on the vanishing of local cohomology modules supported
at ideals of minors of matrices over arbitrary commutative Noetherian rings. In
the process, we compute the local cohomology of rings of polynomials with
integer coefficients---supported at generic determinantal ideals---and also
obtain results on F-modules and D-modules that are likely to be of independent
interest.
