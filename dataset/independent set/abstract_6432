We consider both velocity-dependent and velocity-independent contributions to
spin-dependent (SD) and spin-independent (SI) nuclear scattering (including
one-loop corrections) of WIMPless dark matter, in the case where the dark
matter candidate is a Majorana fermion. We find that spin-independent
scattering arises only from the mixing of exotic squarks, or from
velocity-dependent terms. Nevertheless (and contrary to the case of MSSM
neutralino WIMPs), we find a class of models which cannot be detected through
SI scattering, but can be detected at IceCube/DeepCore through SD scattering.
We study the detection prospects for both SI and SD detection strategies for a
large range of Majorana fermion WIMPless model parameters.
