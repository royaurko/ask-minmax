We give a simple description of the natural bijection between the set of
FLOTW bipartitions and the set of Uglov bipartitions (which generalizes the set
of Kleshchev bipartitions). These bipartitions, which label the crystal graphs
of irreducible $\mathcal{U}\_v({\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}\_e})$-modules of level two,
naturally appear in the context of the modular representation theory of Hecke
algebras of type $B\_n$.
