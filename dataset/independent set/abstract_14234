We report electrical measurements of a single arsenic dopant atom in the
tunnel-barrier of a silicon SET. As well as performing electrical
characterization of the individual dopant, we study series electrical transport
through the dopant and SET. We measure the triple points of this hybrid double
dot, using simulations to support our results, and show that we can tune the
electrostatic coupling between the two sub-systems.
