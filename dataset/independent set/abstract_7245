Let $Q$ be a finite set of points in the plane. For any set $P$ of points in
the plane, $S_{Q}(P)$ denotes the number of similar copies of $Q$ contained in
$P$. For a fixed $n$, Erd\H{o}s and Purdy asked to determine the maximum
possible value of $S_{Q}(P)$, denoted by $S_{Q}(n)$, over all sets $P$ of $n$
points in the plane. We consider this problem when $Q=\triangle$ is the set of
vertices of an isosceles right triangle. We give exact solutions when $n\leq9$,
and provide new upper and lower bounds for $S_{\triangle}(n)$.
