Categorical universal algebra can be developed either using Lawvere theories
(single-sorted finite product theories) or using monads, and the category of
Lawvere theories is equivalent to the category of finitary monads on Set. We
show how this equivalence, and the basic results of universal algebra, can be
generalized in three ways: replacing Set by another category, working in an
enriched setting, and by working with another class of limits than finite
products.
  An important special case involves working with sifted-colimit-preserving
monads rather than filtered-colimit-preserving ones.
