Recent data on the proton F_2 structure function in the resonance region
suggest that local quark-hadron duality works remarkably well for each of the
low-lying resonances, including the elastic, to rather low values of Q^2. We
derive model-independent relations between structure functions at x ~ 1 and
elastic electromagnetic form factors, and predict the x -> 1 behavior of
nucleon polarization asymmetries and the neutron to proton structure function
ratios from available data on nucleon electric and magnetic form factors.
