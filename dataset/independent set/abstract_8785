For a dynamical system we will construct various invariant sets starting from
its conserved quantities. We will give conditions under which certain solutions
of a nonlinear system are also solutions for a simpler dynamical system, for
example when they are solutions for a linear dynamical system. We will apply
these results to the example of Toda lattice.
