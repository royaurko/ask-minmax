Navier-Stokes equations are investigated in a functional setting in 3D open
sets, bounded or not, without assuming any regularity of the boundary. The main
idea is to find a correct definition of the Stokes operator in a suitable
Hilbert space of divergence-free vectors and apply the Fujita-Kato method, a
fixed point procedure, to get a local strong solution.
