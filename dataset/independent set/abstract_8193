We present a symbolic-numeric approach for the analysis of a given set of
noisy data, represented as a finite set $\X$ of limited precision points.
Starting from $\X$ and a permitted tolerance $\varepsilon$ on its coordinates,
our method automatically determines a low degree monic polynomial whose
associated variety passes close to each point of $\X$ by less than the given
tolerance $\varepsilon$.
