We present results for the b \bar b spectrum obtained using an
O(M_bv^6)-correct non-relativistic lattice QCD action, where M_b denotes the
bare b-quark mass and v^2 is the mean squared quark velocity. Propagators are
evaluated on SESAM's three sets of dynamical gauge configurations generated
with two flavours of Wilson fermions at beta = 5.6. These results, the first of
their kind obtained with dynamical Wilson fermions, are compared to a quenched
analysis at equivalent lattice spacing, beta = 6.0. Using our three sea-quark
values we perform the ``chiral'' extrapolation to m_eff = m_s/3, where m_s
denotes the strange quark mass. The light quark mass dependence is found to be
small in relation to the statistical errors. Comparing the full QCD result to
our quenched simulation we find better agreement of our dynamical data with
experimental results in the spin-independent sector but observe no unquenching
effects in hyperfine-splittings. To pin down the systematic errors we have also
compared quenched results in different ``tadpole'' schemes as well as using a
lower order action. We find that spin-splittings with an O(M_bv^4) action are
O(10%) higher compared to O(M_bv^6) results. Relative to the results obtained
with the plaquette method the Landau gauge mean link tadpole scheme raises the
spin splittings by about the same margin so that our two improvements are
opposite in effect.
