When it comes to industrial organizations, current collaboration efforts in
software engineering research are very often kept in-house, depriving these
organizations off the skills necessary to build independent collaborative
research. The current trend, towards empirical software engineering research,
requires certain standards to be established which would guide these
collaborative efforts in creating a strong partnership that promotes
independent, evidence-based, software engineering research. This paper examines
key enabling factors for an efficient and effective industry-academia
collaboration in the software testing domain. A major finding of the research
was that while technology is a strong enabler to better collaboration, it must
be complemented with industrial openness to disclose research results and the
use of a dedicated tooling platform. We use as an example an automated test
generation approach that has been developed in the last two years
collaboratively with Bombardier Transportation AB in Sweden.
