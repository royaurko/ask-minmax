The paper contains a systematic, model-independent treatment of electric
dipole (E1) transitions in heavy quarkonium. Within the effective field theory
framework of potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD), we derive the complete
set of relativistic corrections of relative order v^2 both for weakly and
strongly-coupled quarkonia. The result supports and complements former results
from potential model calculations.
