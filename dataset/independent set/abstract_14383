The normalized spectral representation of a max-stable process on a compact
set is the unique representation where all spectral functions share the same
supremum. Among the class of equivalent spectral representations of a process,
the normalized spectral representation plays a distinctive role as a solution
of two optimization problems in the context of an efficient simulation of
max-stable processes. Our approach has the potential of considerably reducing
the simulation time of max-stable processes.
