Space environment is so complex and changeable that an accurate model of
spacecraft rendezvous is difficult to obtain, which consequently complicates
the rendezvous control task. In order to realize the robust stability as well
as to optimize the time and fuel cost of the rendezvous process, a linearized
rendezvous model with parametric uncertainty and a partially independent robust
controller are proposed in this paper. In-plane and out-of-plane motion models
are established separately in the presence of external disturbance and
non-circularity of the target's orbit. The partially independent controller is
integrated with an in-plane robust guaranteed cost controller and an
out-of-plane robust $H_{\infty}$ controller. A numerical rendezvous example is
presented to illustrate the usefulness and advantages of the partially
independent robust control scheme.
