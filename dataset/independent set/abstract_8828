Using a probabilistic interpretation of resonant states, we propose a formula
useful to calculate the lifetime of a resonance using square-integrable real
basis-set expansion techniques. Our approach does not require an estimation of
the density of states. The method is illustrated with calculations of $s$ and
$p$ resonant-state energies and lifetimes.
