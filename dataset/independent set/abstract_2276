Scaling laws that describe the structure of river networks are shown to
follow from three simple assumptions. These assumptions are: (1) river networks
are structurally self-similar, (2) single channels are self-affine, and (3)
overland flow into channels occurs over a characteristic distance (drainage
density is uniform). We obtain a complete set of scaling relations connecting
the exponents of these scaling laws and find that only two of these exponents
are independent. We further demonstrate that the two predominant descriptions
of network structure (Tokunaga's law and Horton's laws) are equivalent in the
case of landscapes with uniform drainage density. The results are tested with
data from both real landscapes and a special class of random networks.
