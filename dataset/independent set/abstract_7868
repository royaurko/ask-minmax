We consider the spectrum of birth and death chains on a $n$-path. An
iterative scheme is proposed to compute any eigenvalue with exponential
convergence rate independent of $n$. This allows one to determine the whole
spectrum in order $n^2$ elementary operations. Using the same idea, we also
provide a lower bound on the spectral gap, which is of the correct order on
some classes of examples.
