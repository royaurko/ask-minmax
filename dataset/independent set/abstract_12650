Results on CP violation searches in charm decays performed by the LHCb
experiment are reviewed. These include an update of the measurement of the
difference in time-integrated {\em CP} asymmetry between $D^0\to K^-K^+$ and
$D^0\to \pi^-\pi^+$ using $D^0$ from prompt $D^{*+}, a measurement of the same
observable using an independent sample of $D^0$ from semileptonic B decays, and
CP violation searches performed on charged $D$ mesons. All results have been
released since FPCP 2012.
