In this paper, we consider 2-dimensional precubical sets, which can be used
to model systems of two concurrently executing processes. From the point of
view of concurrency theory, two precubical sets can be considered equivalent if
their geometric realizations have the same directed homotopy type relative to
the extremal elements in the sense of P. Bubenik. We give easily verifiable
conditions under which it is possible to reduce a 2-dimensional precubical set
to an equivalent smaller one by collapsing an edge or eliminating a square and
one or two free faces. We also look at some simple standard examples in order
to illustrate how our results can be used to construct small models of
2-dimensional precubical sets.
