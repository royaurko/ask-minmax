We compare a few types of high energy reactions which seem to be practical
for polarimetry at RHIC. Coulomb-nuclear interference (CNI) in pp elastic
scattering leads to a nearly energy-independent left-right asymmetry A_N(t) at
small t. The systematical uncertainty of this method is evaluated to be ~ 10%.
The CNI in proton-nucleus elastic scattering is predicted to result in larger
values of A_N(t) and occurs at larger momentum transfer than in pp elastic
scattering. This energy independent asymmetry can be used for the polarimetry.
As an absolute polarimeter one can use elastic pp scattering on a fixed target
at large |t| ~ 1 - 1.5 GeV^2, where A_N(t) is reasonably large and nearly
energy independent. Although it cannot be reliably calculated, one can
calibrate the polarimeter by measuring the polarisation of the recoil protons.
