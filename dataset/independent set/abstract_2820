In this article we study global-in-time Strichartz estimates for the
Schr\"odinger evolution corresponding to long-range perturbations of the
Euclidean Laplacian. This is a natural continuation of a recent article of the
third contributor, where it is proved that local smoothing estimates imply
Strichartz estimates. In the aforementioned paper, the third contributor proved the
local smoothing estimates for small perturbations of the Laplacian. Here we
consider the case of large perturbations in three increasingly favorable
scenarios: (i) without non-trapping assumptions we prove estimates outside a
compact set modulo a lower order spatially localized error term, (ii) with
non-trapping assumptions we prove global estimates modulo a lower order
spatially localized error term, and (iii) for time independent operators with
no resonance or eigenvalue at the bottom of the spectrum we prove global
estimates for the projection onto the continuous spectrum.
