In perturbative calculations the masses of the Higgs, the Ws and the Z are
usually determined from the pole position of the corresponding gauge-dependent
propagators. In full non-perturbative lattice calculations it is much more
direct to instead investigate the bound state spectrum with its
gauge-independent meaning, which then contains bound states of Higgses and/or
Ws and Zs. It is possible to extend the perturbative definition of the Higgs
mass also to such a full non-perturbative setting by determining the respective
full non-perturbative propagators of the Higgs, the Ws, and the Z, and analyze
their analytic structure. This helps connecting the Higgs properties indirectly
with gauge-invariant physics. This is here studied, using lattice gauge theory,
for the case of a W-Z-Higgs system.
