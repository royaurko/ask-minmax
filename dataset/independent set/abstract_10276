We demonstrate that the evolution of the QSO luminosity density with epoch
displays a striking similarity to the cosmological evolution of the field
galaxy star formation rate, recently derived from a number of independent
surveys. The QSO luminosity density at 2800A is approximately one-fortieth that
implied by the star formation rate in galaxies throughout the past 11 Gigayears
(z<4). This similarity suggests that a substantial fraction of the QSO
luminosity may be closely linked to the star formation process and its
evolution with cosmic time.
