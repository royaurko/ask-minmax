We show that, in the semiclassical limit and whenever the elements of the
Hamiltonian matrix are random enough, the eigenvectors of strongly chaotic
time-independent systems in ordered bases can on average be exponentially
localized across the energy shell and decay faster than exponentially outside
the energy shell. Typically however, matrix elements are strongly correlated
leading to deviations from such behavior.
