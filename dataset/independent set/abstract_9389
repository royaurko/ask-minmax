We propose a scale dependent analytic approximation to the exact linear
growth of density perturbations in Scalar-Tensor (ST) cosmologies. In
particular, we show that on large subhorizon scales, in the Newtonian gauge,
the usual scale independent subhorizon growth equation does not describe the
growth of perturbations accurately, as a result of scale-dependent relativistic
corrections to the Poisson equation. A comparison with exact linear numerical
analysis indicates that our approximation is a significant improvement over the
standard subhorizon scale independent result on large subhorizon scales. A
comparison with the corresponding results in the Synchronous gauge demonstrates
the validity and consistency of our analysis.
