The Adler sum rule states that the integral over energy of a difference of
neutrino-nucleon and antineutrino-nucleon structure functions is a constant,
independent of the four-momentum transfer squared. This constancy is a
consequence of the local commutation relations of the time components of the
hadronic weak current, which follow from the underlying quark structure of the
standard model.
