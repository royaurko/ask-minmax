We present an overview of the meaningful aggregation functions mapping
ordinal scales into an ordinal scale. Three main classes are discussed, namely
order invariant functions, comparison meaningful functions on a single ordinal
scale, and comparison meaningful functions on independent ordinal scales. It
appears that the most prominent meaningful aggregation functions are lattice
polynomial functions, that is, functions built only on projections and minimum
and maximum operations.
