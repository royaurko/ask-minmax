The problem of whether $m$th-powers with or without zero in a finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$ form a difference set has been extensively studied, and is
related to many topics, such as flag transitive finite projective planes. In
this paper new necessary and sufficient conditions are established including
those via system of polynomial equations on Gauss sums. The contributor thereby
solves the problem for even $q$ which is neglected in the literature, and
extend the nonexistence list for even $m$s' up to $22$. Moreover, conjectures
toward the complete classification are posed.
