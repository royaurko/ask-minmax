We use recurrences (alias difference equations) to prove the longstanding
conjecture that the two most important permutation statistics, namely the
number of inversions and the major index, are asymptotically
joint-independently-normal. We even derive more-precise-than needed asymptotic
formulas for the (normalized) mixed moments. This is the fully revised second
edition, incorportating the many insightful comments of nine conscientious
NON-anonymous referees listed under the contributors' names. This article is
exclusively published in the on-line journal "Personal Journal of Shalosh B.
Ekhad and Doron Zeilberger" and this arxiv.
