SDE's must be solved in the "anti-Ito" sense when their coefficients are
independent. While the "noise-induced drift" matters for the sample paths, it
is absent in the Fokker-Planck equation, which takes a particularly simple form
and is invariant under changes of the variables. Pure noise yields martingale
solutions.
