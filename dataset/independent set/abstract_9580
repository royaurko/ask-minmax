For information transmission a discrete time channel with independent
additive Gaussian noise is used. There is also feedback channel with
independent additive Gaussian noise, and the transmitter observes without delay
all outputs of the forward channel via that feedback channel. Transmission of
nonexponential number of messages is considered and the achievable decoding
error exponent for such a combination of channels is investigated. It is shown
that for any finite noise in the feedback channel the achievable error exponent
is better than similar error exponent of the no-feedback channel. Method of
transmission/decoding used in the paper strengthens the earlier method used by
contributors for BSC. In particular, for small feedback noise, it allows to get the
gain of 23.6% (instead of 14.3% earlier for BSC).
