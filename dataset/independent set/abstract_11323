This paper presents explicit expressions for algebraic Gauss hypergeometric
functions. We consider solutions of hypergeometric equations with the
tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral monodromy groups. Conceptually, we
pull-back such a hypergeometric equation onto its Darboux curve so that the
pull-backed equation has a cyclic monodromy group. Minimal degree of the
pull-back coverings is 4, 6 or 12 (for the three monodromy groups,
respectively). In explicit terms, we replace the independent variable by a
rational function of degree 4, 6 or 12, and transform hypergeometric functions
to radical functions.
