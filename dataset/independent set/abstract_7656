In this appendix, we observe that our March preprint on Serre's conjecture
was indeed correct: the only "missing argument" follows automatically from a
result of Bockle and Ramakrishna. Thus, we get a proof of the level 1 weight 2
case of Serre's conjecture (a result that has been also proved independently by
Khare and Wintenberger).
