In this paper we prove that the affine Schur algebra $\whS(n,r)$ is affine
quasi-hereditary. This result is then applied to show that $\whS(n,r)$ has
finite global dimension and its centralizer subquotient algebras are Laurent
polynomial algebras. We also use the result to give a parameter set of simple
$\whS(n,r)$-modules and identify this parameter set with that given in
\cite{DDF}.
