In this paper we show that the agglomeration of rows or columns of a
contingency table with a hierarchical clustering algorithm yields statistical
models defined through toric ideals. In particular, starting from the classical
independence model, the agglomeration process adds a linear part to the toric
ideal generated by the $2 \times 2$ minors.
