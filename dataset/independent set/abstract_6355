A recently proposed regularization-independent method is used for the first
time to solve the renormalized fermion Schwinger-Dyson equation numerically in
quenched QED$_4$. The Curtis-Pennington vertex is used to illustrate the
technique and to facilitate comparison with previous calculations which used
the alternative regularization schemes of modified ultraviolet cut-off and
dimensional regularization. Our new results are in excellent numerical
agreement with these, and so we can now conclude with confidence that there is
no residual regularization dependence in these results. Moreover, from a
computational point of view the regularization independent method has enormous
advantages, since all integrals are absolutely convergent by construction, and
so do not mix small and arbitrarily large momentum scales. We analytically
predict power law behaviour in the asymptotic region, which is confirmed
numerically with high precision. The successful demonstration of this efficient
new technique opens the way for studies of unquenched QED to be undertaken in
the near future.
