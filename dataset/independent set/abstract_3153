We introduce two remarkable identities written in terms of single commutators
and anticommutators for any three elements of arbitrary associative algebra.
One is a consequence of other (fundamental identity). From the fundamental
identity, we derive a set of four identities (one of which is the Jacobi
identity) represented in terms of double commutators and anticommutators. We
establish that two of the four identities are independent and show that if the
fundamental identity holds for an algebra, then the multiplication operation in
that algebra is associative. We find a generalization of the obtained results
to the super case and give a generalization of the fundamental identity in the
case of arbitrary elements. For nondegenerate even symplectic (super)manifolds,
we discuss analogues of the fundamental identity.
