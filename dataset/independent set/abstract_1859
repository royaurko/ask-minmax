A finite stack of thin superconducting tapes, all carrying a fixed current I,
can be approximated by an anisotropic superconducting bar with critical current
density Jc=Ic/2aD, where Ic is the critical current of each tape, 2a is the
tape width, and D is the tape-to-tape periodicity. The current density J must
obey the constraint \int J dx = I/D, where the tapes lie parallel to the x axis
and are stacked along the z axis. We suppose that Jc is independent of field
(Bean approximation) and look for a solution to the critical state for
arbitrary height 2b of the stack. For c<|x|<a we have J=Jc, and for |x|<c the
critical state requires that Bz=0. We show that this implies \partial
J/\partial x=0 in the central region. Setting c as a constant (independent of
z) results in field profiles remarkably close to the desired one (Bz=0 for
|x|<c) as long as the aspect ratio b/a is not too small. We evaluate various
criteria for choosing c, and we show that the calculated hysteretic losses
depend only weakly on how c is chosen. We argue that for small D/a the
anisotropic homogeneous-medium approximation gives a reasonably accurate
estimate of the ac losses in a finite Z stack. The results for a Z stack can be
used to calculate the transport losses in a pancake coil wound with
superconducting tape.
