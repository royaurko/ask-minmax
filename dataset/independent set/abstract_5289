The concepts of exterior and boundary in multiset topological space are
introduced. We further established few relationships between the concepts of
boundary, closure, exterior and interior of an M- set. These concepts have been
pigeonholed by other existing notions viz., open sets, closed sets, clopen sets
and limit points. The necessary and sufficient condition for a multiset to have
an empty exterior is also discussed.
