PolyChord is a novel nested sampling algorithm tailored for high dimensional
parameter spaces. In addition, it can fully exploit a hierarchy of parameter
speeds such as is found in CosmoMC and CAMB. It utilises slice sampling at each
iteration to sample within the hard likelihood constraint of nested sampling.
It can identify and evolve separate modes of a posterior semi-independently and
is parallelised using openMPI. PolyChord is available for download at:
