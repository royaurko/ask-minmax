Clusters are excellent test benches for verification and improvement of
stellar evolution theory. The recent detection of solar-like oscillations in
G-K giants in the open cluster NGC6819 with Kepler provides us with independent
constraints on the masses and radii of stars on the red giant branch, as well
as on the distance to clusters and their ages. We present, for NGC6819,
evolutionary models by considering rotation-induced mixing ; and the
theoretical low-l frequencies of our stellar models.
