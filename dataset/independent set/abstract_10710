More than 30 years of lunar laser ranging has produced several key tests of
gravitational theory, including confirmation that bodies fall in external
gravity at rates independent of their internal gravitational binding energy,
and that Newton's G is constant to a part in 10^12 per year precision. The
fitting of LLR data depends on the entire scope of 1/c^2 order features of the
gravitational equation of motion, including non-linearity, gravitomagnetism,
and inductive inertial forces.
