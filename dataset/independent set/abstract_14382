In this report we describe the implementation and approach developed during
the GENIUS Project. The GENIUS project is about the generation of usable user
interfaces. It tries to cope with issues related to automatic generation where,
usually end-user complain about the poor quality (in term of usability) of
generated UI. To solve this issue GENIUS relies on Model-Driven Engineering
principles and several MDE tools. Notably, it consists in a set of metamodels
specific to the interaction, a set of model transformation embedding usability
criteria and an environment for model execution/ interpretation.
