Darboux transformations in one independent variable have found numerous
applications in various field of mathematics and physics. In this paper we show
that the extension of these transformations to two dimensions can be used to
decouple systems of Schrodinger equations and provide explicit representation
for three classes of such systems. We show also that there is an elegant
relationship between these transformations and analytic complex matrix
functions.
