Double Special Relativity theories are the relativistic theories in which the
transformations between inertial observers are characterized by two
observer-independent scales of the light speed and the Planck length. We study
two main examples of these theories and want to show that these theories are
not the new theories of relativity, but only are re-descriptions of Einstein's
special relativity in the non-conventional coordinates.
