Several analyses of the cosmic microwave background map made by the satellite
WMAP suggest that the global shape of a spatial section of the Universe is that
of a Poincare dodecahedral space. A summary of some of these analyses and a
description of independent tests which should be able to either increase
confidence in the hypothesis or else refute it to extremely high significance
will be presented.
