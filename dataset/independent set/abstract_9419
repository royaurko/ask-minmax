We have developed a theoretical description of how of an asteroid's
polarization-phase curve will be affected by the removal of the dust from the
surface due to a size-dependent phenomenon such as radiation pressure-driven
escape of levitated particles. We test our calculations against new
observations of four small (D ~ 1 km) near-Earth asteroids [(85236), (142348),
(162900) and 2006 SZ_217] obtained with the Dual Beam Imaging Polarimeter on
the University of Hawaii's 2.2 m telescope, as well as previous observations of
(25143) Itokawa and (433) Eros. We find that the polarization of the light
reflected from an asteroid is controlled by the mineralogical and chemical
composition of the surface and is independent of dust particle. The relation
between the slope of the polarization-phase curve beyond the inversion angle
and the albedo of an asteroid is thus independent of the surface regolith size
distribution and is valid for both Main Belt and Near-Earth asteroids.
