Using all recent data on the differential cross sections and spin observables
for the reaction $\gamma p \to K^+ \Lambda$, an energy-independent partial-wave
analysis is performed. The analysis requires multipoles up to $L = 2$; there is
no evidence that the fit requires multipoles with $L=3$. At present the
available data allow us to extract the dominant multipoles only. These are
compatible with the multipoles obtained in the energy-dependent fit. This
result supports the reliability of the Bonn-Gatchina energy-dependent results.
