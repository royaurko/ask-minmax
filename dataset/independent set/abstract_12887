Excess Fermi GeV emission around the Galactic Centre has been interpreted as
a possible signature of annihilating dark matter. Here we analyse three aspects
of this claim: its spectral cutoff, the correlation between the spectral shape
of the purported signal and known noise components, and its brightness profile.
Experimentally, the correlations that exist between the GeV excess and known
sources of noise make it difficult to conclude that a dark matter signal claim
can be made without independent direct detection confirmation. As a possible
way forward, we introduce three criteria that could potentially help to
validate a dark matter annihilation signal in gamma rays.
