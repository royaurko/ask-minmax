In this paper my prime objective is to analyze the constraints on a
sub-Planckian excursion of a single inflaton field within Effective Field
Theory framework in a model independent fashion. For a generic single field
inflationary potential, using the various parameterization of the primordial
power spectrum I have derived the most general expression for the field
excursion in terms of various inflationary observables, applying the
observational constraints obtained from recent Planck 2015 and Planck 2015
+BICEP2/Keck Array data. By explicit computation I have reconstructed the
structural form of the inflationary potential by constraining the Taylor
expansion coefficients appearing in the generic expansion of the potential
within the Effective Field Theory. Next I have explicitly derived, a set of
higher order inflationary consistency relationships, which would help us to
break the degeneracy between various class of inflationary models by
differentiating them. I also provided two simple examples of Effective Theory
of inflation- inflection-point model and saddle-point model to check the
compatibility of the prescribed methodology in the light of Planck 2015 and
Planck 2015 +BICEP2/Keck Array data. Finally, I have also checked the validity
of the prescription by estimating the cosmological parameters and fitting the
theoretical CMB TT, TE and EE angular power spectra with the observed data
within the multipole range $2<l<2500$.
