In this paper we address two points concerning the Sachs-Wolfe effect: (i)
the gauge independence of the observable temperature anisotropy, and (ii) a
gauge-invariant expression of the effect considering the most general situation
of hydrodynamic perturbations. The first result follows because the gauge
transformation of the temperature fluctuation at the observation event only
contributes to the isotropic temperature change which, in practice, is absorbed
into the definition of the background temperature. Thus, we proceed without
fixing the gauge condition, and express the Sachs-Wolfe effect using the
gauge-invariant variables.
