We report on a study of topological properties of Fibonacci quasicrystals.
Chern numbers which label the dense set of spectral gaps, are shown to result
from the underlying palindromic symmetry. Topological and spectral features are
related to the two independent phases of the scattering matrix: the total phase
shift describing the frequency spectrum and the chiral phase sensitive to
topological features. Conveniently designed gap modes with spectral properties
directly related to the Chern numbers allow to scan these phases. An effective
topological Fabry-Perot cavity is presented.
