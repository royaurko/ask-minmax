We summarize the results of solar neutrino experiments and update a solar
model independent analysis of solar neutrino data. We discuss the implications
of helioseismology on solar models and predicted solar neutrino fluxes. Finally
, we discuss the potential of new experiments for detecting specific signatures
of the proposed solutions to the solar neutrino puzzle.
