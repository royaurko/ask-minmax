We study higher-dimensional neutrino mass operators in a low energy theory
that contains a second Higgs doublet, the two Higgs doublet model. The
operators are relevant to underlying theories in which the lowest
dimension-five mass operators would not be induced. We list the independent
operators with dimension up to nine with the help of Young tableau. Also listed
are the lowest dimension seven operators that involve gauge bosons and violate
the lepton number by two units. We briefly mention some of possible
phenomenological implications.
