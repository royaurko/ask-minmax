By considering the large-N Ginzburg-Landau model, compactified in one of the
spatial dimensions, we determine the beta-function and find an infrared stable
fixed point for a superconducting film for dimensions $4<D<6$. We find that
this fixed point is independent of the film thickness ($L$). For the physical
dimension D=3 we conclude that if a transition exists it is not a second order
one.
