The geometry of spinning codimension-two branes in AdS spacetime is analyzed
in three and higher dimensions. The construction of non-extremal solutions is
based on identifications in the covering of AdS space by isometries that have
fixed points. The discussion focuses on the cases where the parameters of
spinning states can be related to the velocity of a boosted static
codimension-two brane. The resulting configuration describes a single spinning
brane, or a set of intersecting branes, each one produced by an independent
identification. The nature of the singularity is also examined, establishing
that the AdS curvature acquires one in the form of a Dirac delta distribution.
The stability of the branes is studied in the framework of Chern-Simons AdS
supergravity. A class of branes, characterized by one free parameter, are shown
to be stable when the BPS conditions are satisfied. In 3D, these stable branes
are extremal, while in higher dimensions, the BPS branes are not the extremal
ones.
