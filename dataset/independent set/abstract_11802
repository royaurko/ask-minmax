We study long-range percolation on the hierarchical lattice of order $N$,
where any edge of length $k$ is present with probability
$p_k=1-\exp(-\beta^{-k} \alpha)$, independently of all other edges. For fixed
$\beta$, we show that the critical value $\alpha_c(\beta)$ is non-trivial if
and only if $N < \beta < N^2$. Furthermore, we show uniqueness of the infinite
component and continuity of the percolation probability and of
$\alpha_c(\beta)$ as a function of $\beta$. This means that the phase diagram
of this model is well understood.
