One-loop quark contributions to the dimension-four gluon condensate term in
the operator product expansion (OPE) of the scalar glueball correlation
function are calculated in the MS-bar scheme in the chiral limit of $n_f$ quark
flavours. The presence of quark effects is shown not to alter the cancellation
of infrared (IR) singularities in the gluon condensate OPE coefficients. The
dimension-four gluonic condensate term represents the leading power corrections
to the scalar glueball correlator and, therein, the one-loop logarithmic
contributions provide the most important condensate contribution to those QCD
sum-rules independent of the low-energy theorem (the subtracted sum-rules).
