A construction of the tangent dg Lie algebra of a sheaf of operad algebras on
a site is presented. The requirements on the site are very mild; the
requirements on the algebra are more substantial. A few applications including
the description of deformatins of a scheme and equivariant deformations are
considered.
  The construction is based upon a model structure on the category of
presheaves which should be of an independent interest.
