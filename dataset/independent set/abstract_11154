The spontaneous symmetry breaking associated to the tearing of a random
surface, where large dynamical holes fill the surface, was recently analized
obtaining a non-universal critical exponent on a border phase. Here the issue
of universality is explained by an independent analysis. The one hole sector of
the model is useful to manifest the origin of the (limited) non-universal
behaviour, that is the existence of two inequivalent critical points.
