A generalized parameterization of the Skyrme effective force is discussed.
Preliminary results are presented for infinite symmetric and asymmetric nuclear
matter. In particular, it is shown that an enlarged density dependence based on
two terms allows to choose independently the incompressibility and the
isoscalar effective mass.
