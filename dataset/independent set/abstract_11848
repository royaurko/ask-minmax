The MiniBooNE experiment is a $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_\mu\to\bar\nu_e$
appearance neutrino oscillation experiment at Fermilab. The neutrino mode
oscillation analysis shows an excess of $\nu_e$ candidate events in the
low-energy region. These events are analyzed under the SME formalism, utilizing
the short baseline approximation. The preliminary result shows the time
independent solution is favored. The relationship with the SME parameters
extracted from the LSND experiment is discussed. The systematic error analysis
and antineutrino mode analysis are outlined.
