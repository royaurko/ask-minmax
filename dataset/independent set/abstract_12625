Reactor antineutrino experiments have the ability to search for neutrino
oscillations independent of reactor flux predictions using a relative
measurement of the neutrino flux and spectrum across a range of baselines. The
range of accessible oscillation parameters are determined by the baselines of
the detector arrangement. We examine the sensitivity of short-baseline
experiments with more than one detector and discuss the optimization of a
second, far detector. The extended reach in baselines of a 2-detector
experiment will improve sensitivity to short-baseline neutrino oscillations
while also increasing the ability to distinguish between 3+1 mixing and other
non-standard models.
