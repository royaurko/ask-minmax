These notes are dedicated to the study of the complexity of several classes
of separable Banach spaces. We compute the complexity of the Banach-Saks
property, the alternating Banach-Saks property, the complete continuous
property, and the LUST property. We also show that the weak Banach-Saks
property, the Schur property, the Dunford-Pettis property, the analytic
Radon-Nikodym property, the set of Banach spaces whose set of unconditionally
converging operators is complemented in its bounded oper- ators, the set of
Banach spaces whose set of weakly compact operators is complemented in its
bounded operators, and the set of Banach spaces whose set of Banach-Saks opera-
tors is complemented in its bounded operators, are all non Borel in SB. At
last, we give several applications of those results to non-universality
results.
