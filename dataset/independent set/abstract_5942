We present a workable model for the fermion-photon vertex, which is expressed
solely in terms of functions that appear in the fermion propagator and
independent of the angle between the relative momenta, and does not explicitly
depend on the covariant-gauge parameter. It nevertheless produces a critical
coupling for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking that is practically independent
of the covariant-gauge parameter and an anomalous magnetic moment distribution
for the dressed fermion that agrees in important respects with realistic
numerical solutions of the inhomogeneous vector Bethe-Salpeter equation.
