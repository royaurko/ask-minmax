We consider probabilistic multinomial probit classification using Gaussian
process (GP) priors. The challenges with the multiclass GP classification are
the integration over the non-Gaussian posterior distribution, and the increase
of the number of unknown latent variables as the number of target classes
grows. Expectation propagation (EP) has proven to be a very accurate method for
approximate inference but the existing EP approaches for the multinomial probit
GP classification rely on numerical quadratures or independence assumptions
between the latent values from different classes to facilitate the
computations. In this paper, we propose a novel nested EP approach which does
not require numerical quadratures, and approximates accurately all
between-class posterior dependencies of the latent values, but still scales
linearly in the number of classes. The predictive accuracy of the nested EP
approach is compared to Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) approximations with various benchmark data sets. In the
experiments nested EP was the most consistent method with respect to MCMC
sampling, but the differences between the compared methods were small if only
the classification accuracy is concerned.
