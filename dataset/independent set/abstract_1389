In this paper we address the problem of visual quality of images
reconstructed from block-wise random projections. Independent reconstruction of
the blocks can severely affect visual quality, by displaying artifacts along
block borders. We propose a method to enforce smoothness across block borders
by modifying the sensing and reconstruction process so as to employ partially
overlapping blocks. The proposed algorithm accomplishes this by computing a
fast preview from the blocks, whose purpose is twofold. On one hand, it allows
to enforce a set of constraints to drive the reconstruction algorithm towards a
smooth solution, imposing the similarity of block borders. On the other hand,
the preview is used as a predictor of the entire block, allowing to recover the
prediction error, only. The quality improvement over the result of independent
reconstruction can be easily assessed both visually and in terms of PSNR and
SSIM index.
