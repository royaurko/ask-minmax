A signed permutation \pi = \pi_1\pi_2 \ldots \pi_n in the hyperoctahedral
group B_n is a word such that each \pi_i \in {-n, \ldots, -1, 1, \ldots, n} and
{|\pi_1|, |\pi_2|, \ldots, |\pi_n|} = {1,2,\ldots,n}. An index i is a peak of
\pi if \pi_{i-1}<\pi_i>\pi_{i+1} and P_B(\pi) denotes the set of all peaks of
\pi. Given any set S, we define P_B(S,n) to be the set of signed permutations
\pi \in B_n with P_B(\pi) = S. In this paper we are interested in the
cardinality of the set P_B(S,n). In 2012, Billey, Burdzy and Sagan investigated
the analogous problem for permutations in the symmetric group, S_n. In this
paper we extend their results to the hyperoctahedral group; in particular we
show that #P_B(S,n) = p(n)2^{2n-|S|-1} where p(n) is the same polynomial found
in by Billey, Burdzy and Sagan which leads to the explicit computation of
interesting special cases of the polynomial p(n). In addition we have extended
these results to the case where we add \pi_0=0 at the beginning of the
permutations, which gives rise to the possibility of a peak at position 1, for
both the symmetric and the hyperoctahedral groups.
