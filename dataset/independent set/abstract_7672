We prove that every sufficiently long simple permutation contains two long
almost disjoint simple subsequences. This result has applications to the
enumeration of restricted permutations. For example, it immediately implies a
result of Bona and (independently) Mansour and Vainshtein that for any r, the
number of permutations with at most r copies of 132 has an algebraic generating
function.
