The edge Hall conductivity is shown to be an integer multiple of $e^2/h$
which is almost surely independent of the choice of the disordered
configuration. Its equality to the bulk Hall conductivity given by the
Kubo-Chern formula follows from K-theoretic arguments. This leads to
quantization of the Hall conductance for any redistribution of the current in
the sample. It is argued that in experiments at most a few percent of the total
current can be carried by edge states.
