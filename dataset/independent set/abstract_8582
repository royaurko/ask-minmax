A set of equations describing the rotational motion of the Earth relative to
the GCRS is formulated in the approximation of rigidly rotating multipoles. The
external bodies are supposed to be mass monopoles. The derived set of formulas
is supposed to form the theoretical basis for a practical post-Newtonian theory
of Earth precession and nutation.
