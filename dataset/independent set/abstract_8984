Let $\Omega$ be an open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $C^1$-boundary. Let
$\Sigma$ be the skeleton of $\Omega$, that is, the set $\Sigma$ consists of
points where the distance function to $\partial\Omega$ is not differentiable.
This paper characterizes the cut locus (ridge) $\overline{\Sigma}$, which is
the closure of $\Sigma$, by introducing the lower semicontinuous envelope of
radius of curvature of the boundary $\partial\Omega$.
