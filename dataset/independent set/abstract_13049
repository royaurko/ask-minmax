Physical anomalous dimensions are a formulation of the DGLAP evolution of
Deep Inelastic structure functions which is independent of factorization scheme
and -scale. In this proceedings we provide an outlook on possible applications,
in particular in the search of saturation effects. As an original contribution
we present a short study of the renormalization scale dependence of physical
evolved structure functions for large initial scale $Q_0^2=30$GeV$^2$
