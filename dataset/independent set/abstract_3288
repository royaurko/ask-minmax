We present a physical parameterization of the leading effects beyond the SM
(BSM), that give us, at present, the best way to constrain heavy new-physics at
low-energies. We call these effects that constrain all possible interactions at
the dimension 6 level, BSM Primary effects; there are 8 primaries related to
Higgs physics, 3 related to Triple Gauge Couplings and 7 related to Z- pole
measurements at LEP. Starting from these experimentally measurable deformations
(and not operators), we construct the dimension 6 Lagrangian in a bottom up
way. We, thus, show that other BSM effects are not independent from the primary
ones and we provide the explicit correlations. We also discuss the theoretical
expectation for the size of these BSM primaries in some well-motivated BSM
theories.
