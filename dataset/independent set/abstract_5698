Spatiotemporal properties of seismicity are investigated for a worldwide (WW)
catalog and for Southern California in the stationary case (SC), showing a
nearly universal scaling behavior. Distributions of distances between
consecutive earthquakes (jumps) are magnitude independent and show two
power-law regimes, separated by jump values about 200 km (WW) and 15 km (SC).
Distributions of waiting times conditioned to the value of jumps show that both
variables are correlated in general, but turn out to be independent when only
short or long jumps are considered. Finally, diffusion profiles reflect the
shape of the jump distribution.
