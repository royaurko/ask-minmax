An extrinsic curvature surface model is investigated by Monte Carlo
simulations on a disk. We found that the model undergoes a first-order
transition separating the smooth phase from the collapsed phase. The results in
this paper together with the previous ones suggest that the order of the
transition is independent of whether the surface is compact (closed) or
non-compact (open).
