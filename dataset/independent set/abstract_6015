This paper describes a formal system of belief revision developed by Wolfgang
Spohn and shows that this system has a parallel implementation that can be
derived from an influence diagram in a manner similar to that in which Bayesian
networks are derived. The proof rests upon completeness results for an
axiomatization of the notion of conditional independence, with the Spohn system
being used as a semantics for the relation of conditional independence.
