In a series of three lectures, I review the theory and phenomenology of heavy
quark masses and mixing angles and the status of their determination. In
addition, I give an introduction to heavy quark symmetry, with the main
emphasis on the development of heavy quark effective field theory and its
application to obtain a model-independent determination of $|V_{cb}|$.
