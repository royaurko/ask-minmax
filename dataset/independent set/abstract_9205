A radiation-ball solution which is identified as a Reissner-Nordstrom black
hole is found out. The radiation-ball, which is derived by analyzing the
backreaction of the Hawking radiation into space-time, consists of radiation
trapped in a ball by a deep gravitational potential and of a singularity. The
Hawking radiation is regarded as a leak-out of the radiation from the ball. The
gravitational potential becomes deep as the charge becomes large, however, the
basic structure of the ball is independent of the charge. The extremal-charged
black hole corresponds with the fully frozen ball by the infinite red-shift.
The total entropy of the radiation in the ball, which is independent of the
charge, obeys the area-law and is near the Bekenstein entropy.
