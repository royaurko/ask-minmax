While the numerical methods which utilizes partitions of equal-size,
including the box-counting method, remain the most popular choice for computing
the generalized dimension of multifractal sets, two mass- oriented methods are
investigated by applying them to the one-dimensional generalized Cantor set. We
show that both mass-oriented methods generate relatively good results for
generalized dimensions for important cases where the box-counting method is
known to fail. Both the strengths and limitations of the methods are also
discussed.
