We study the behavior of Iwasawa invariants among ordinary deformations of a
fixed residual Galois representation taking values in a reductive algebraic
group G. In particular, under the assumption that these Selmer groups are
cotorsion modules over the Iwasawa algebra, we show that the vanishing of the
mu invariant is independent of the deformation, while the lambda invariant
depends only on the ramification. This generalizes work of Greenberg-Vatsal and
Emerton-Pollack and the contributor in the case G = GL(2).
