Given a graph $G$ and an integer $r\geq 1$, let $\mathcal{I}^{(r)}(G)$ denote
the family of independent sets of size $r$ of $G$. For a vertex $v$ of $G$, let
$\mathcal{I}^{(r)}_v(G)$ denote the family of independent sets of size $r$ that
contain $v$. This family is called an $r$-star. Then $G$ is said to be $r$-EKR
if no pairwise intersecting subfamily of $\mathcal{I}^{(r)}(G)$ is bigger than
the largest $r$-star, and if every maximum size pairwise intersecting subfamily
of $\mathcal{I}^{(r)}(G)$ is an $r$-star, then $G$ is said to be strictly
$r$-EKR. Let $\mu(G)$ denote the minimum size of a maximal independent set of
$G$. Holroyd and Talbot conjectured that if $2r \leq \mu(G)$, then $G$ is
$r$-EKR and strictly $r$-EKR if $2r < \mu(G)$.
  An elongated claw is a tree in which one vertex is designated the root and no
vertex other than the root has degree greater than 2. A depth-two claw is an
elongated claw in which every vertex of degree~1 is at distance 2 from the
root. We show that if $G$ is a depth-two claw, then $G$ is $r$-EKR if $2r \leq
\mu(G)$ and strictly $r$-EKR if $2r < \mu(G)$, confirming the conjecture of
Holroyd and Talbot for this family. We also show that if $G $ is an elongated
claw with $n$ leaves and at least one leaf adjacent to the root, then $G$ is
$r$-EKR if $2r \leq n$.
