We obtain new bounds for the magnetic dipole moments of the tau lepton. These
limits on the magnetic couplings of the tau to the electroweak gauge bosons
(gamma, W, Z) are set in a model independent way using the most general
effective Lagrangian with the SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y symmetry. Comparison with data
from the most precise experiments at high energies shows that the present
limits are more stringent than the previous published ones. For the anomalous
magnetic moment the bounds are, for the first time, within one order of
magnitude of the standard model prediction.
