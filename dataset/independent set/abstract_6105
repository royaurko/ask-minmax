This paper characterizes which subsets of C^n can be the set of positions of
n points on a linkage in the complex plane C. For example, assuming compactness
they are just compact semialgebraic sets. Noncompact configuration spaces are
semialgebraics sets invariant under the Euclidean group, with compact quotient.
