We give a short introduction to the concept of low energy supersymmetric
models and their phenomenological predictions. In view of the future LEP II
results we have to parametrize these predictions in a model independent way
without too many simplifying assumptions. The study must therefore include
models with {\it non--universal} soft supersymmetry breaking terms. We show
that such non--universalities might have significant influence on the
properties of these models.
