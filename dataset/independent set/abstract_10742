For certain models, the energy of the universe which includes the energy of
both the matter and the gravitational fields is obtained by using the
quasilocal energy-momentum in teleparallel gravity. It is shown that in the
case of the Bianchi type I and II universes, not only the total energy but also
the quasilocal energy-momentum for any region vanishes independently of the
three dimensionless coupling constants of teleparallel gravity.
