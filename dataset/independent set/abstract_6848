We systematically investigate the complexity of model checking the
existential positive fragment of first-order logic. In particular, for a set of
existential positive sentences, we consider model checking where the sentence
is restricted to fall into the set; a natural question is then to classify
which sentence sets are tractable and which are intractable. With respect to
fixed-parameter tractability, we give a general theorem that reduces this
classification question to the corresponding question for primitive positive
logic, for a variety of representations of structures. This general theorem
allows us to deduce that an existential positive sentence set having bounded
arity is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if each sentence is equivalent
to one in bounded-variable logic. We then use the lens of classical complexity
to study these fixed-parameter tractable sentence sets. We show that such a set
can be NP-complete, and consider the length needed by a translation from
sentences in such a set to bounded-variable logic; we prove superpolynomial
lower bounds on this length using the theory of compilability, obtaining an
interesting type of formula size lower bound. Overall, the tools, concepts, and
results of this article set the stage for the future consideration of the
complexity of model checking on more expressive logics.
