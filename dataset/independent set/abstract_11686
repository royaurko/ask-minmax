We study suppression of superconductivity by disorder in d-wave
superconductors, and predict the existence of (at least) two sequential low
temperature transitions as a function of increasing disorder: a d -wave to
-wave, and then an s-wave to metal transition. This is a universal property of
the system which is independent of the sign of the interaction constant in the
s-channel
