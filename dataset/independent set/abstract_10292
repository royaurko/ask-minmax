We reconstruct the trajectories of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) -
observed by the AGASA experiment - in the Galactic magnetic field assuming that
all particles have the same charge. We then study correlations between the
reconstructed events and BL Lacs. The correlations have significance below
10^{-3} in the case of particles with charge +1. In the case of charge -1 the
correlations are absent. We interpret this as evidence that protons are present
in the flux of UHECR. Observed correlation provides an independent evidence
that BL Lacs emit UHECR.
