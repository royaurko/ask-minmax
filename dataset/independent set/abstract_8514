We propose a flexible class of estimates for "common change in the mean" sets
in spatio-temporal data. We rely on a scan type approach by subdividing the
spatial observations into suitable overlapping regions to which classical CUSUM
(cumulative sums) estimates may then be applied separately. The aggregated
"local" estimates are used to construct consistent "global" estimates of the
change set(s) by taking the overlapping structure into account. The domain and
the change regions may have irregular shapes and the suggested procedure is
especially suited for estimation of multiple change regions. The performance is
demonstrated in a simulation study.
