Let $G(V, E)$ be a simple connected graph, with $|E| = \epsilon.$ In this
paper, we define an edge-set graph $\mathcal G_G$ constructed from the graph
$G$ such that any vertex $v_{s,i}$ of $\mathcal G_G$ corresponds to the $i$-th
$s$-element subset of $E(G)$ and any two vertices $v_{s,i}, v_{k,m}$ of
$\mathcal G_G$ are adjacent if and only if there is at least one edge in the
edge-subset corresponding to $v_{s,i}$ which is adjacent to at least one edge
in the edge-subset corresponding to $v_{k,m}$ where $s,k$ are positive
integers. It can be noted that the edge-set graph $\mathcal G_G$ of a graph $G$
id dependent on both the structure of $G$ as well as the number of edges
$\epsilon.$ We also discuss the characteristics and properties of the edge-set
graphs corresponding to certain standard graphs.
