For a set of asymptotically flat black holes with arbitrary charges and
masses, all initially at rest and well-separated, we prove the following
extremum principle: the extremal charge configuration ($|q_i|=m_i$ for each
black hole) can be derived by extremizing the total energy, for variations of
the black hole apparent horizon areas, at fixed charges and fixed Euclidean
separations. If all charges have the same sign, this result is a variational
principle that reinterprets the static equilibrium of the
Majumdar-Papapetrou-Hartle-Hawking solution as an extremum of total energy,
rather than as a balance of forces; this result augments a list of related
variational principles for static black holes, and is consistent with the
independently known BPS energy minimum.
