We propose a geometric construction of a first order physical space
parametrix for solutions to covariant, tensorial wave equations on a curved
background. We describe its applications to a large data breakdown criterion in
General Relativity and also give a new gauge independent proof of the
Eardley-Moncrief result on large data global existence result for the
3+1-dimensional Yang-MIlls equations.
