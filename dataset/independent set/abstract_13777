The unipotent subgroup of a finite group of Lie type over a prime field Z/pZ
comes equipped with a natural set of generators; the properties of the Cayley
graph associated to this set of generators have been much studied. In the
present paper, we show that the diameter of this Cayley graph is bounded above
and below by constant multiples of np + n^2 log p, where n is the rank of the
associated Lie group. This generalizes a result of the first contributor, which
treated the case of SL_n(Z/pZ). (Keywords: diameter, Cayley graph, finite
