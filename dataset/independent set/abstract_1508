A recently proposed axiom system for Andr\'e's central translation structures
is improved upon. First, one of its axioms turns out to be dependent (derivable
from the other axioms). Without this axiom, the axiom system is indeed
independent. Second, whereas most of the original independence models were
infinite, finite independence models are available. Moreover, the independence
proof for one of the axioms employed proof-theoretic techniques rather than
independence models; for this axiom, too, a finite independence model exists.
For every axiom, then, there is a finite independence model. Finally, the axiom
system (without its single dependent axiom) is not only independent, but
completely independent.
