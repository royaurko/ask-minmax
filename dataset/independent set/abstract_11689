Several hundred million tau decays have been studied with the BaBar detector
at the PEP-II e+e- collider at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Recent
results on Charged Current Lepton Universality and two independent measurements
of |V_{us}| using tau- -> e- nubar nu, mu- nubar nu, pi- nu, K- nu and KS0 pi-
nu decays, and a search for Second Class Current in tau- -> pi- omega nu decays
are presented, where the charge conjugate decay modes are also implied.
