The invariance of extensions of the Standard Model under the full
SU(3)XSU(2)XU(1) gauge group can be used to classify general vector bosons and
to write their interactions in a model-independent fashion. This description is
useful for both direct and indirect searches. We comment on electroweak
precision limits and show some simple applications to Higgs and top physics.
