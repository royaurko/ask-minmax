We first review reasons why dark matter is an interesting issue in connection
with star clusters. Next we consider to what extent the presence of dark matter
is consistent with their dynamics and structure. We review various
model-dependent and model-independent methods which have been applied to two
well studied clusters, NGC 6397 and 47 Tuc. We suggest that about half of the
mass in each object is still unobserved, possibly in the form of a mixture of
low-mass stars and white dwarfs.
