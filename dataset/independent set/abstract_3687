The high-frequency peaked BL Lac PKS 2005-489 (z=0.071) was observed in 2003
and 2004 with the H.E.S.S. stereoscopic array of imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov
telescopes in Namibia. A signal was detected at the 6.7 sigma level in the 2004
observations (24.2 hrs live time), but not in the 2003 data set (27.3 hrs live
time). PKS 2005-489 is the first blazar independently discovered by H.E.S.S. to
be an emitter of VHE photons, and only the second such blazar in the Southern
Hemisphere. The integral flux above 200 GeV observed in 2004 is (6.9 +/- 1.0
+/- 1.4) x 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to ~2.5% of the flux
observed from the Crab Nebula. The 99% upper limit on the flux in 2003, I(>200
GeV) < 5.2 x 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, is smaller than the flux measured
in 2004, suggesting an increased level of activity in 2004. However, the data
show no evidence for significant variability on any time scale less than a
year. An energy spectrum is measured and is characterized by a very soft power
law (photon index = 4.0 +/- 0.4).
