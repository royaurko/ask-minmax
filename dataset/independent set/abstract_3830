We propose a physically motivated parametrization for the unpolarized
generalized parton distributions, H and E, valid at both zero and non-zero
values of the skewness variable, \zeta. Our approach follows a previous
detailed study of the \zeta=0 case where H and E were determined using
constraints from simultaneous fits of the experimental data on both the nucleon
elastic form factors and the deep inelastic structure functions in the non
singlet sector. Additional constraints at \zeta \neq 0 are provided by lattice
calculations of the higher moments of generalized parton distributions. We
illustrate a method for extracting generalized parton distributions from
lattice moments based on a reconstruction using sets of orthogonal polynomials.
The inclusion in our fit of data on Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering is also
discussed. Our method provides a step towards a model independent extraction of
generalized distributions from the data. It also provides an alternative to
double distributions based phenomenological models in that we are able to
satisfy the polynomiality condition by construction, using a combination of
experimental data and lattice, without resorting to any specific mathematical
construct.
