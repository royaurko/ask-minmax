The long-standing deficit of measured versus predicted solar neutrino fluxes
is re-examined in light of possible astrophysical solutions. In the last
decade, solar neutrino flux and helioseismic measurements have greatly
strengthened the case for non-astrophysical solutions. But some model-
independent tests remain open.
