A general, practical method for handling sparse data that avoids held-out
data and iterative reestimation is derived from first principles. It has been
tested on a part-of-speech tagging task and outperformed (deleted)
interpolation with context-independent weights, even when the latter used a
globally optimal parameter setting determined a posteriori.
