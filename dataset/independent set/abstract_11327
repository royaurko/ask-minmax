Intuitively, a pluralist solution is one in which a single question receives
multiple answers. Such pluralist solutions have been proposed in many widely
disparate contexts. This paper restates the concept of pluralism with greater
precision; distinguishes it from, and establishes its independence of, some
other notions with which it is frequently confused; and briefly lays out some
of the benefits that this more nuanced approach to pluralism may yield for the
debates in which it may be invoked.
