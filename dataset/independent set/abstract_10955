We derive an explicit and model-independent representation for the skewed
quark distribution of the pion in the limit of large momentum transfer. Our
result is expressed in terms of the conventional pion distribution amplitudes
and complies with known properties of skewed parton distributions such as
symmetry and polynomiality conditions. The continuity of the result at the
points \pm \xi is manifest, whereas its derivatives exhibit discontinuities.
