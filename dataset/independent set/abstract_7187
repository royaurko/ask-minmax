A remarkable theorem of R. C. James is the following: suppose that $X$ is a
Banach space and $C \subseteq X$ is a norm bounded, closed and convex set such
that every linear functional $x^* \in X^*$ attains its supremum on $C$; then
$C$ is a weakly compact set. Actually, this result is significantly stronger
than this statement; indeed, the proof can be used to obtain other surprising
results. For example, suppose that $X$ is a separable Banach space and $S$ is
a norm separable subset of the unit ball of $X^*$ such that for each $x \in X$
there exists $x^* \in S$ such that $x^*(x) = \|x\|$ then $X^*$ is itself norm
separable . If we call $S$ a support set, in this case, with respect to the
entire space $X$, one can ask questions about the size and structure of a
support set, a support set not only with respect to $X$ itself but perhaps
with respect to some other subset of $X$@. We analyze one particular case of
this as well as give some applications.
