We consider a Laplace operator on a random graph consisting of infinitely
many loops joined symmetrically by intervals of unit length. The arc lengths of
the loops are considered to be independent, identically distributed random
variables. The integrated density of states of this Laplace operator is shown
to have discontinuities provided that the distribution of arc lengths of the
loops has a nontrivial pure point part. Some numerical illustrations are also
presented.
