We study the order dimension of the lattice of closed sets for a convex
geometry. Further, we prove the existence of large convex geometries realized
by planar point sets that have very low order dimension. We show that the
planar point set of Erdos and Szekeres from 1961 which is a set of 2^(n-2)
points and contains no convex n-gon has order dimension n - 1 and any larger
set of points has order dimension strictly larger than n - 1.
