In usual scale-free networks of Barabasi-Albert type, a newly added node
selects randomly m neighbors from the already existing network nodes,
proportionally to the number of links these had before. Then the number N(k) of
nodes with k links each decays as 1/k^gamma where gamma=3 is universal, i.e.
independent of m. Now we use a limited directedness in the construction of the
network, as a result of which the exponent gamma decreases from 3 to 2 for
increasing m.
