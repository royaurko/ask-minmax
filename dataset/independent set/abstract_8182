Let $\Lambda$ be an isolated non-trival transitive set of a $C^1$ generic
diffeomorphism $f\in\Diff(M)$. We show that the space of invariant measures
supported on $\Lambda$ coincides with the space of accumulation measures of
time averages on one orbit. Moreover, the set of points having this property is
residual in $\Lambda$ (which implies the set of irregular$^+$ points is also
residual in $\Lambda$). As an application, we show that the non-uniform
hyperbolicity of irregular$^+$ points in $\Lambda$ with totally 0 measure
(resp., the non-uniform hyperbolicity of a generic subset in $\Lambda$)
determines the uniform hyperbolicity of $\Lambda$.
