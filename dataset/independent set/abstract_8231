Thomason's Homotopy Colimit Theorem has been extended to bicategories and
this extension can be adapted, through the delooping principle, to a
corresponding theorem for diagrams of monoidal categories. In this version, we
show that the homotopy type of the diagram can be also represented by a genuine
simplicial set nerve associated with it. This suggests the study of a homotopy
colimit theorem, for diagrams $\b$ of braided monoidal categories, by means of
a simplicial set {\em nerve of the diagram}. We prove that it is weak homotopy
equivalent to the homotopy colimit of the diagram, of simplicial sets, obtained
from composing $\b$ with the geometric nerve functor of braided monoidal
categories.
