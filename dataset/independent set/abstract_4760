In this article, we deal with several notions in dynamical systems. Firstly,
we prove that both closure function and orbital function are idempotent on
set-valued dynamical systems. And we show that the compact limit set of a
connected set is also connected. Furthermore, we prove that the $\Omega$-limit
set of a compact set is quasi-attracting.
