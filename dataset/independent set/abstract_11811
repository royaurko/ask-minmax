MP is a package of ANSI Standard Fortran (ANS X3.9-1966) subroutines for
performing multiple-precision floating-point arithmetic and evaluating
elementary and special functions. The subroutines are machine independent and
the precision is arbitrary, subject to storage limitations. The User's Guide
describes the routines and their calling sequences, example and test programs,
use of the Augment precompiler, and gives installation instructions for the
package.
