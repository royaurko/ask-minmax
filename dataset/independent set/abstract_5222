Cellular Automata (CA) are discrete dynamical systems and an abstract model
of parallel computation. The limit set of a cellular automaton is its maximal
topological attractor. A well know result, due to Kari, says that all
nontrivial properties of limit sets are undecidable. In this paper we consider
properties of limit set dynamics, i.e. properties of the dynamics of Cellular
Automata restricted to their limit sets. There can be no equivalent of Kari's
Theorem for limit set dynamics. Anyway we show that there is a large class of
undecidable properties of limit set dynamics, namely all properties of limit
set dynamics which imply stability or the existence of a unique subshift
attractor. As a consequence we have that it is undecidable whether the cellular
automaton map restricted to the limit set is the identity, closing, injective,
expansive, positively expansive, transitive.
