The purpose of this note is to extend the improved proof of the no-ghost
theorem for the bosonic and Neveu-Schwarz dual resonance models, presented in
my article Nuclear Physics B286 (1987) 61, to cover the Ramond fermion string.
As in that paper, the improvement involves the identification of an efficient
basis for string state space and a self-contained proof, based on the
super-Virasoro algebra, of the linear independence of the basis elements. We
use our results to calculate the BRST cohomology for this system.
