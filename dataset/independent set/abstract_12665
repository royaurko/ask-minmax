Recently a new observable to study halo nuclei was introduced, based on the
ratio between breakup and elastic angular cross sections. This new observable
is shown by the analysis of specific reactions to be independent of the
reaction mechanism and to provide nuclear-structure information of the
projectile. Here we explore the details of this ratio method, including the
sensitivity to binding energy and angular momentum of the projectile. We also
study the reliability of the method with breakup energy. Finally, we provide
guidelines and specific examples for experimentalists who wish to apply this
method.
