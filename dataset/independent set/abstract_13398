We present the analysis of the CoRoT star 105288363, a new Blazhko RR Lyrae
star of type RRab (f0 = 1.7623 c/d), observed with the CoRoT space craft during
the second long run in direction of the galactic center (LRc02, time base 145
d). The CoRoT data are characterized by an excellent time sampling and a low
noise amplitude of 0.07 mmag in the 2-12 c/d range and allow us to study not
only the fine details of the variability of the star but also long-term changes
in the pulsation behaviour and the stability of the Blazhko cycle. We use,
among other methods, standard Fourier analysis techniques and O-C diagrams to
investigate the pulsational behavior of the Blazhko star 105288363. In addition
to the frequency pattern expected for a Blazhko RR Lyrae star, we find an
independent mode (f1 = 2.984 c/d) showing a f0/f1 ratio of 0.59 which is
similar to that observed in other Blazhko RR Lyrae stars. The bump and hump
phenomena are also analysed, with their variations over the Blazhko cycle. We
carefully investigated the strong cycle-to-cycle changes in the Blazhko
modulation (PB = 35.6 d), which seem to happen independently and partly
diametrically in the amplitude and the phase modulation. Furthermore, the
phasing between the two types of modulation is found to change during the
course of the observations.
