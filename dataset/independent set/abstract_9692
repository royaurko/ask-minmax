For random polynomials with i.i.d. (independent and identically distribu-ted)
zeros following any common probability distribution $\mu$ with support
contained in the unit circle, the empirical measures of the zeros of their
first and higher order derivatives will be proved to converge weakly to $\mu$
a.s. (almost sure(ly)). This, in particular, completes a recent work of
Subramanian on the first order derivative case where $\mu$ was assumed to be
non-uniform. The same a.s. weak convergence will also be shown for polar and
Sz.-Nagy's generalized derivatives, on some mild conditions.
