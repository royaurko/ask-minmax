Based on the technique of integration within an ordered product (IWOP) of
operators we introduce the Fresnel operator for converting Caldirola-Kanai
Hamiltonian into time-independent harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. The Fresnel
operator with the parameters A,B,C,D corresponds to classical optical Fresnel
transformation, these parameters are the solution to a set of partial
differential equations set up in the above mentioned converting process. In
this way the exact wavefunction solution of the Schr\"odinger equation governed
by the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian is obtained, which represents a squeezed
number state. The corresponding Wigner function is derived by virtue of the
Weyl ordered form of the Wigner operator and the order-invariance of Weyl
ordered operators under similar transformations. The method used here can be
suitable for solving Schr\"odinger equation of other time-dependent
oscillators.
