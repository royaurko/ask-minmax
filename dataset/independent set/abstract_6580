The McMullen-Sullivan holomorphic motion for topologically conjugate, complex
polynomials with connected Julia set follows level sets of the Bottcher
coordinate. The Buzzard-Verma holomorphic motion for hyperbolic, unstably
connected, polynomial diffeomorphisms of C^2 follows level sets of the
Bedford-Smillie solenoid map. It follows that this solenoid map is a conjugacy
for those Henon maps that are perturbations of (one-dimensional) hyperbolic
maps with connected Julia set.
