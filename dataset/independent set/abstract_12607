Linear relations, containing measurement errors in input and output data, are
taken into account in this paper. Parameters of these so-called
errors-in-variables (EIV) models can be estimated by minimizing the total least
squares (TLS) of the input-output disturbances. Such an estimate is highly
non-linear. Moreover in some realistic situations, the errors cannot be
considered as independent by nature. Weakly dependent (\alpha- and \phi-mixing)
disturbances, which are not necessarily stationary nor identically distributed,
are considered in the EIV model. Asymptotic normality of the TLS estimate is
proved under some reasonable stochastic assumptions on the errors. Derived
asymptotic properties provide necessary basis for the validity of
block-bootstrap procedures.
