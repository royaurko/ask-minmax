Recall that in a laminar family, any two sets are either disjoint or
contained one in the other. Here, a parametrized weakening of this condition is
introduced. Let us say that a set system $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^X$ is
$t$-laminar if $A,B \in \mathcal{F}$ with $|A \cap B| \ge t$ implies $A
\subseteq B$ or $B \subseteq A$. We obtain very close asymptotic bounds in
terms of $n$ on the maximum size of a $2$-laminar family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq
2^{[n]}$. A construction for $3$-laminar families and a crude analysis for
general $t$ are also given.
