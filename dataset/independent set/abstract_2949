We revisit the reactor antineutrino anomaly using the recent reactor flux
independent determination of sizable theta?13 by considering the full set of
the absolute reactor electron antineutrino flux measurements. When normalized
to the predicted flux of Mueller et al. [1], the new world average, after
including results from Palo Verde, Chooz, and Double Chooz, is 0.959 +- 0.009
(experiment uncertainty) +- 0.027 (flux systematics). Including the data with
kilometer baseline, the new world average is only about 1.4 sigma lower than
the unity, weakening the significance of the reactor antineutrino anomaly. The
upcoming results from Daya Bay, RENO, and the Double Chooz will provide further
information about this issue.
