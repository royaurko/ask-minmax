A set-indexer of a graph $G$ is an injective set-valued function $f:V(G)
\rightarrow2^{X}$ such that the function
$f^{\oplus}:E(G)\rightarrow2^{X}-\{\emptyset\}$ defined by $f^{\oplus}(uv) =
f(u){\oplus} f(v)$ for every $uv{\in} E(G)$ is also injective, where $2^{X}$ is
the set of all subsets of $X$ and $\oplus$ is the symmetric difference of sets.
An integer additive set-indexer is defined as an injective function
$f:V(G)\rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0}$ such that the induced function $f^+:E(G)
\rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0}$ defined by $f^+ (uv) = f(u)+ f(v)$ is also
injective. A graph $G$ which admits an IASI is called an IASI graph. An IASI
$f$ is said to be a weak IASI if $|f^+(uv)|=max(|f(u)|,|f(v)|)$ and an IASI $f$
is said to be a strong IASI if $|f^+(uv)|=|f(u)| |f(v)|$ for all $u,v\in V(G)$.
In this paper, we discuss about a special type of integer additive set-indexers
called arithmetic integer additive set-indexer and establish some results on
this type of integer additive set-indexers. We also check the admissibility of
arithmetic integer additive set-indexer by certain graphs associated with a
given graph.
