We consider a quotient space of the Bers boundary of Teichm\"{u}ller space,
which we call the reduced Bers boundary, by collapsing each quasi-conformal
deformation space into a point. This reduced Bers boundary turns out to be
independent of the basepoint, and the action of the mapping class group on the
Teichm\"{u}ller space extends continuously to this boundary. We show that every
auto-homeomorphism on the reduced Bers boundary comes from an extended mapping
class. We also give a way to determine the limit in the reduced Bers boundary
up to some ambiguity for parabolic curves for a given sequence in the
Teichm\"{u}ller space, by generalising the Thurston compactification.
