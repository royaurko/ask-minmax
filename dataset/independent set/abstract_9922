We review the current status of the global DGLAP analysis of nuclear parton
distribution functions, nPDFs, focusing on the recent EPS09 analysis, whose
output, EPS09NLO, is the best-constrained NLO nPDF set on the market. Collinear
factorization is found to work very well in the kinematical region studied.
With the error sets released in the EPS09 package one can compute how the
nPDF-related uncertainties propagate into factorizable nuclear hard-process
cross sections. A comparison with the other existing NLO nPDF sets is shown,
and the BRAHMS forward-$\eta$ hadron data from d+Au collisions are discussed in
the light of the EPS09 nPDFs and their error sets.
