We propose and analyze a novel dual-gate Spin Field Effect Transistor
(SpinFET) with half-metallic ferromagnetic source and drain contacts. The
transistor has two gate pads that can be biased independently. It can be
switched ON or OFF with a few mV change in the differential bias between the
two pads, resulting in extremely low dynamic power dissipation during
switching. The ratio of ON to OFF conductance remains fairly large (~ 60) up to
a temperature of 10 K. This device also has excellent inverter characteristics,
making it attractive for applications in low power and high density Boolean
logic circuits.
