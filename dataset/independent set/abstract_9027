In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. B 66, 012501 (2002)], torque data measured on a
MgB2 single crystal in fields from 10 to 60 kOe at 10 K were presented. The
contributors obtained the anisotropy gamma by fitting a theoretical expression to
the data and concluded that the anisotropy is field independent gamma \approx
4.3. They also reported the observation of "intrinsic pinning", which they take
as experimental evidence for the occurence of superconductivity in the boron
layers. In this comment, we discuss the range of validity of the theoretical
expression used by the contributors and show that the conclusion of a field
independent anisotropy does not hold. Furthermore, we present torque data
measured on two crystals of MgB2, establishing the extrinsic nature of the peak
in the irreversible torque observed in some crystals.
