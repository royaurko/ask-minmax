V. Ginzburg, and independently R. Bocklandt and L. Le Bruyn, defined an
infinite-dimensional "necklace" Lie algebra canonically associated to any
quiver. Following suggestions of V. Turaev, P. Etingof, and Ginzburg, we define
a cobracket and prove that it defines a Lie bialgebra structure. We then
present a Hopf algebra quantizing this Lie bialgebra, and prove that it is a
Hopf algebra satisfying the PBW property. We present representations into
spaces of differential operators on representations of the quiver, which
quantize the trace representations of the Lie algebra given by Ginzburg.
