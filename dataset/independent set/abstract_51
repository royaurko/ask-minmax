Ramras conjectured that the maximum size of an independent set in the
discrete cube containing equal numbers of sets of even and odd size is 2^(n-1)
- (n-1 choose (n-1)/2) when n is odd. We prove this conjecture, and find the
analogous bound when n is even. The result follows from an isoperimetric
inequality in the cube.
