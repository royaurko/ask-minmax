We characterize a weighted norm inequality which corresponds to the embedding
of a class of absolutely continuous functions into the fractional order Sobolev
space. The auxiliary result of the paper is of independent interest. It
comprises of several types of necessary and sufficient conditions for the
boundedness of the Hardy--Steklov operator (an integral operator with two
variable boundaries of integration) in weighted Lebesgue spaces.
