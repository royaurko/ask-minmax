Model-independent predictions for excitation energies, semileptonic form
factors and electromagnetic decay rates of isoscalar heavy baryons and their
low energy excited states are discussed in terms of the combined heavy quark
and large $N_c$ expansion. At leading order, the observables are completely
determined in terms of the known excitation energy of the first excited state
of $\Lambda_c$. At next-to-leading order in the combined expansion all heavy
baryon observables can be expressed in a model-independent way in terms of two
experimentally measurable quantities. We list predictions at leading and
next-to-leading order.
