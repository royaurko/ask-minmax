Opportunistic Spatial Orthogonalization (OSO) is a cognitive radio scheme
that allows the existence of secondary users and hence increases the system
throughput, even if the primary user occupies all the frequency bands all the
time. Notably, this throughput advantage is obtained without sacrificing the
performance of the primary user, if the interference margin is carefully
chosen. The key idea is to exploit the spatial dimensions to orthogonalize
users and hence minimize interference. However, unlike the time and frequency
dimensions, there is no universal basis for the set of all multi-dimensional
spatial channels, which motivated the development of OSO. On one hand, OSO can
be viewed as a multi-user diversity scheme that exploits the channel randomness
and independence. On the other hand, OSO can be interpreted as an opportunistic
interference alignment scheme, where the interference from multiple secondary
users is opportunistically aligned at the direction that is orthogonal to the
primary user's signal space. In the case of multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) channels, the OSO scheme can be interpreted as "riding the peaks" over
the eigen-channels, and ill-conditioned MIMO channel, which is traditionally
viewed as detrimental, is shown to be beneficial with respect to the sum
throughput. Throughput advantages are thoroughly studied, both analytically and
numerically.
