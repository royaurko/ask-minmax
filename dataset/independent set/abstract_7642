Generalized eigenfunctions of the 3-dimensional relativistic Schr\"odinger
operator $\sqrt{\Delta} + V(x)$ with $|V(x)|\le C < x >^{{-\sigma}}$, $\sigma >
1$, are considered. We show that the generalized eigenfunctions can be
expressed as the sum of plane waves and solutions to the time-independent
relativistic Schr\"odinger equation with the radiation condition. If $\sigma
>3$, then we can give pointwise estimates of the differences between the sums
and the solutions.
