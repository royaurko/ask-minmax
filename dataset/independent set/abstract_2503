We study a simple but compelling model of $n$ interacting agents via
time-dependent, unidirectional communication. The model finds wide application
in a variety of fields including synchronization, swarming and distributed
decision making. In the model, each agent updates his current state based upon
the current information received from other agents. Necessary and/or sufficient
conditions for the convergence of the individual agents' states to a common
value are presented, extending recent results reported in the literature.
Unlike previous, related studies, the approach of the present paper does not
rely on algebraic graph theory and is of a completely nonlinear nature. It is
rather surprising that with these nonlinear tools, extensions may be obtained
even for the linear cases discussed in the literature. The proof technique
consists of a blend of graph-theoretic and system-theoretic tools integrated
within a formal framework of set-valued Lyapunov theory and may be of
independent interest. Further, it is also observed that more communication does
not necessarily lead to better convergence and may eventually even lead to a
loss of convergence, even for the simple models discussed in the present paper.
