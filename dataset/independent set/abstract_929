We study various dynamical properties (winding angles, areas) of a set of
harmonically bound Brownian particles (monomers), one endpoint of this chain
being kept fixed at the origin 0. In particular, we show that, for long times
t, the areas {A_i} enclosed by the monomers scale like t^{1/2}, with correlated
gaussian distributions. This is at variance with the winding angles {\theta_i}
around fixed points that scale like t and are distributed according to
independent Cauchy laws.
