For symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebra $\textbf{g}$, Lusztig introduced the
modified quantized enveloping algebra $\dot{\textbf{U}}(\textbf{g})$ and its
canonical basis in [12]. In this paper, for finite and affine type symmetric
Lie algebra $\textbf{g}$ we define a set which depend only on the root category
and prove that there is a bijection between the set and the canonical basis of
$\dot{\textbf{U}}(\textbf{g})$, where the root category is the $T^2$-orbit
category of the derived category of Dynkin or tame quiver. Our method bases on
one theorem of Lin, Xiao and Zhang in [9], which gave the PBW-basis of
$\textbf{U}^+(\textbf{g})$.
