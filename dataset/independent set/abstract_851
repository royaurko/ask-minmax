Three interrelated questions concerning Kerr spacetime late-time scalar-field
tails are considered numerically, specifically the evolutions of generic and
non-generic initial data sets, the excitation of "up" modes, and the resolution
of an apparent paradox related to the superposition principle. We propose to
generalize the Barack-Ori formula for the decay rate of any tail multipole
given a generic initial data set, to the contribution of any initial multipole
mode. Our proposal leads to a much simpler expression for the late-time power
law index. Specifically, we propose that the late-time decay rate of the
$Y_{\ell m}$ spherical harmonic multipole moment because of an initial
$Y_{\ell' m}$ multipole is independent of the azimuthal number $m$, and is
given by $t^{-n}$, where $n=\ell'+\ell+1$ for $\ell<\ell'$ and $n=\ell'+\ell+3$
for $\ell\ge\ell'$. We also show explicitly that the angular symmetry group of
a multipole does not determine its late-time decay rate.
