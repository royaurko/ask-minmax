In this paper we study the scattering theory of the classical hyperbolic
Sutherland model associated with the C(n) root system. We prove that for any
values of the coupling constants the scattering map has a factorized form. As a
byproduct of our analysis, we propose a Lax matrix for the rational C(n)
Ruijsenaars-Schneider-van Diejen model with two independent coupling constants,
thereby setting the stage to establish the duality between the hyperbolic C(n)
Sutherland and the rational C(n) Ruijsenaars-Schneider-van Diejen models.
