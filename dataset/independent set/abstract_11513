The relativistic phase-space representation by means of the usual position
and momentum operators for a class of observables with Weyl symbols independent
of charge variable (i.e. with any combination of position and momentum) is
proposed. The dynamical equation coincides with its analogue in the non-local
theory (generalization of the Newton-Wigner position operator approach) under
conditions when particles creation is impossible. Differences reveal themselves
in specific constraints on possible initial conditions.
