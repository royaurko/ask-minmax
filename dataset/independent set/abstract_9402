We analyze the conventional perturbative treatment of sphaleron-induced
baryon number washout relevant for electroweak baryogenesis and show that it is
not gauge-independent due to the failure of consistently implementing the
Nielsen identities order-by-order in perturbation theory. We provide a
gauge-independent criterion for baryon number preservation in place of the
conventional (gauge-dependent) criterion needed for successful electroweak
baryogenesis. We also review the arguments leading to the preservation
criterion and analyze several sources of theoretical uncertainties in obtaining
a numerical bound. In various beyond the standard model scenarios, a realistic
perturbative treatment will likely require knowledge of the complete two-loop
finite temperature effective potential and the one-loop sphaleron rate.
