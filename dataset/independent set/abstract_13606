We examine the semiclassical content of SU(3) Yang Mills theory on the
lattice at finite temperature. Employing the cooling method, a set of classical
fields is generated from a Monte Carlo ensemble. Various operators are used to
inspect this set with respect to topological properties. We find pseudoparticle
fields, so-called caloron solutions, possessing the remarkable features of
(superpositions of) Kraan-van Baal solutions, i.e. extensions of
Harrington-Shepard calorons to generic values of the holonomy.
