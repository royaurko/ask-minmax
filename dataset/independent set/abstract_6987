Richard Guy asked for the largest set of points which can be placed in the
plane so that their pairwise distances are rational numbers. In this article,
we consider such a set of rational points restricted to a given hyperbola.
  To be precise, for rational numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ such that the
quantity $D = \bigl(a \, d - b \, c \bigr) / \bigl(2 \, a^2 \bigr)$ is defined
and nonzero, we consider rational distance sets on the conic section $a \, x \,
y + b \, x + c \, y + d = 0$. We show that, if the elliptic curve $Y^2 = X^3 -
D^2 \, X$ has infinitely many rational points, then there are infinitely many
sets consisting of four rational points on the hyperbola such that their
pairwise distances are rational numbers. We also show that any rational
distance set of three such points can always be extended to a rational distance
set of four such points.
