Let n be an even positive integer and F be the field \GF(2). A word in F^n is
called balanced if its Hamming weight is n/2. A subset C \subseteq F^n$ is
called a balancing set if for every word y \in F^n there is a word x \in C such
that y + x is balanced. It is shown that most linear subspaces of F^n of
dimension slightly larger than 3/2\log_2(n) are balancing sets. A
generalization of this result to linear subspaces that are "almost balancing"
is also presented. On the other hand, it is shown that the problem of deciding
whether a given set of vectors in F^n spans a balancing set, is NP-hard. An
application of linear balancing sets is presented for designing efficient
error-correcting coding schemes in which the codewords are balanced.
