For researching the association between coal enterprise management and return
in financial market, this paper applies the method of time difference relevance
and PageRank method to seek the leader-index of a stock set containing 21 coal
enterprises in A-share market and score those stocks. Based on the return in
2011, the asynchronism of the return series is revealed and presents a
hierarchical structure of our stock set. Finally, we compare the result with
the firm-level variables and discuss the relation between them. The results
show that those large coal enterprises with a good management condition always
present an antecedence of stock return; there is a significant positive
association between company scale and the score given by PageRank method.
