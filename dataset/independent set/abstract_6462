The statistical properties of the fractional part of the random energy of a
spectral component of black-body radiation have been analysed in the frame of
classical Kolmogorovian probability theory. Besides the integer part of the
energy (which satisfies the well-known Planck-Bose distribution), the
realizations of its fractional part (related to 'round-off errors') has been
represented by binary sequences, like z = 0.001011000010.... It has been shown
that the binary variables realized by the 0-s and 1-s at different positions
are independent. From the condition of independence the original distribution
of the fractional part z can be recovered. If these binary variables have the
same distribution, then they describe a temperature-independent random energy,
whose expectation value is just the zero-point energy. Thus, the zero-point
fluctuation can be considered as a physical representative of an ideal random
number generator.
