A mode-coupling theory for dense polymeric systems is developed which
unifyingly incorporates the segmental cage effect relevant for structural
slowing down and polymer chain conformational degrees of freedom. An ideal
glass transition of polymer melts is predicted which becomes molecular-weight
independent for large molecules. The theory provides a microscopic
justification for the use of the Rouse theory in polymer melts, and the results
for Rouse-mode correlators and mean-squared displacements are in good agreement
with computer simulation results.
