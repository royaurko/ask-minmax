A Monte Carlo algorithm is said to be adaptive if it automatically calibrates
its current proposal distribution using past simulations. The choice of the
parametric family that defines the set of proposal distributions is critical
for good performance. In this paper, we present such a parametric family for
adaptive sampling on high-dimensional binary spaces. A practical motivation for
this problem is variable selection in a linear regression context. We want to
sample from a Bayesian posterior distribution on the model space using an
appropriate version of Sequential Monte Carlo. Raw versions of Sequential Monte
Carlo are easily implemented using binary vectors with independent components.
For high-dimensional problems, however, these simple proposals do not yield
satisfactory results. The key to an efficient adaptive algorithm are binary
parametric families which take correlations into account, analogously to the
multivariate normal distribution on continuous spaces. We provide a review of
models for binary data and make one of them work in the context of Sequential
Monte Carlo sampling. Computational studies on real life data with about a
hundred covariates suggest that, on difficult instances, our Sequential Monte
Carlo approach clearly outperforms standard techniques based on Markov chain
exploration.
