Determination of the nuclear parton distributions within the framework of
perturbative QCD, the DGLAP equations in particular, is discussed. Scale and
flavour dependent nuclear effects in the parton distributions are compared with
the scale and flavour independent parametrizations of HIJING and of the Hard
Probe Collaboration. A comparison with the data from deep inelastic
lepton-nucleus scattering and the Drell-Yan process in proton-nucleus
collisions is shown.
