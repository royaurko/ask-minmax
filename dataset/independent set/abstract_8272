In this paper, we prove a limit set intersection theorem in relatively
hyperbolic groups. Our approach is based on a study of dynamical quasiconvexity
of relatively quasiconvex subgroups. Using dynamical quasiconvexity, many
well-known results on limit sets of geometrically finite Kleinian groups are
derived in general convergence groups. We also establish dynamical
quasiconvexity of undistorted subgroups in finitely generated groups with
nontrivial Floyd boundary.
