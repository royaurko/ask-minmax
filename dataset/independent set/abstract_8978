We consider an important class of self-assembly problems and using the
formalism of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive a set of design principles
for growing controlled assemblies far from equilibrium. The design principles
constrain the set of structures that can be obtained under non-equilibrium
conditions. Our central result provides intuition for how equilibrium
self-assembly landscapes are modified under finite non-equilibrium drive.
