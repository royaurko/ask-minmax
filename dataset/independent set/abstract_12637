In this paper, we investigate first the asymptotics of the minima of
elliptical triangular arrays. Motivated by the findings of Kabluchko (Extremes
14 (2011) 285-310), we discuss further the asymptotic behaviour of the maxima
of elliptical triangular arrays with marginal distribution functions in the
Gumbel or Weibull max-domain of attraction. We present an application
concerning the asymptotics of the maximum and the minimum of independent
spherical processes.
