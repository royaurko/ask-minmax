Tribimaximal leptonic mixing is a mass-independent mixing scheme consistent
with the present solar and atmospheric neutrino data. By conveniently
decomposing the effective neutrino mass matrix associated to it, we derive
generic predictions in terms of the parameters governing the neutrino masses.
We extend this phenomenological analysis to other mass-independent mixing
schemes which are related to the tribimaximal form by a unitary transformation.
We classify models that produce tribimaximal leptonic mixing through the group
structure of their family symmetries in order to point out that there is often
a direct connection between the group structure and the phenomenological
analysis. The type of seesaw mechanism responsible for neutrino masses plays a
role here, as it restricts the choices of family representations and affects
the viability of leptogenesis. We also present a recipe to generalize a given
tribimaximal model to an associated model with a different mass-independent
mixing scheme, which preserves the connection between the group structure and
phenomenology as in the original model. This procedure is explicitly
illustrated by constructing toy models with the transpose tribimaximal,
bimaximal, golden ratio, and hexagonal leptonic mixing patterns.
