We develop a dynamical formulation of one-dimensional scattering theory where
the reflection and transmission amplitudes for a general, possibly complex and
energy-dependent, scattering potential are given as solutions of a set of
dynamical equations. By decoupling and partially integrating these equations,
we reduce the scattering problem to a second order linear differential equation
with universal initial conditions that is equivalent to an initial-value
time-independent Schrodinger equation. We give explicit formulas for the
reflection and transmission amplitudes in terms of the solution of either of
these equations and employ them to outline an inverse-scattering method for
constructing finite-range potentials with desirable scattering properties at
any prescribed wavelength. In particular, we construct optical potentials
displaying threshold lasing, anti-lasing, and unidirectional invisibility.
