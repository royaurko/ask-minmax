Noneqiuilibrium dynamics of rotating droplets are studied by molecular
dynamics simulations. Small deviations from the theoretical prediction are
observed when the size of a droplet is small, and the deviations become smaller
as the size of the droplet increases. The characteristic timescale of the
deformation is observed, and we find (i) the deformation timescale is almost
independent of the rotating velocity with for small frequency and (ii) the
deformation timescale becomes shorter as temperature increases. A simple model
is proposed to explain the deformation dynamics of droplets.
