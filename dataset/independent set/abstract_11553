Computer games are motivating and beneficial in learning different
educational skills. Most people use their fingers, hands, and arms when using a
computer game. However, for people with motor disabilities this task can be a
barrier. We present a new Sudoku game for people whose motion is impaired,
called Sudoku 4ALL. With this special interface a person can control the game
with the voice or with a single switch. Our research aims to cautiously search
for issues that might be appropriate for computational support and to build
enabling technologies that increase individuals' functional independence in a
game environment.
