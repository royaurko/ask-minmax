The concentration inequality approach for normal approximation by Stein's
method is generalized to the multivariate setting. We use this approach to
prove a non-smooth function distance for multivariate normal approximation for
standardized sums of $k$-dimensional independent random vectors $W=\sum_{i=1}^n
X_i$ with an error bound of order $k^{1/2}\gamma$ where $\gamma=\sum_{i=1}^n
E|X_i|^3$. For sums of locally dependent (unbounded) random vectors, we obtain
a fourth moment bound which is typically of order $O_k(1/\sqrt{n})$, as well as
a third moment bound which is typically of order $O_k(\log n/\sqrt{n})$.
