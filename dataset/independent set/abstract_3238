We show a new proof for the fact that when $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ are
infinite cardinals satisfying $\lambda ^ \kappa = \lambda$, the cofinality of
the set of all functions from $\lambda$ to $\kappa$ ordered by everywhere
domination is $2^\lambda$. An earlier proof was a consequence of a result about
independent families of functions. The new proof follows directly from the main
theorem we present: for every $A \subseteq \lambda$ there is a function $f:
{^\kappa \lambda} \to \kappa$ such that whenever $M$ is a transitive model of
$\textrm{ZF}$ such that ${^\kappa \lambda} \subseteq M$ and some $g: {^\kappa
\lambda} \to \kappa$ in $M$ dominates $f$, then $A \in M$. That is,
"constructibility can be reduced to domination".
