We analyze the data and discuss their implications for the microscopic origin
of the low frequency flux noise in superconducting circuits. We argue that this
noise is produced by spins at the superconductor insulator boundary whose
dynamics is due to RKKY interaction. We show that this mechanism explains size
independence of the noise, different frequency dependences of the spectra
reported in large and small SQUIDs and gives the correct intensity for
realistic parameters.
