The hadroproduction of lepton pairs with mass $Q$ and finite transverse
momentum $Q_T$ is dominated by quark-gluon scattering in the region $Q_T >
Q/2$. This feature provides a new independent method for constraining the gluon
density with data at hadron collider energies. Predictions are provided at the
energy of the LHC.
