We investigate the existence and properties of effective potentials in
time-dependent density functional theory. We outline conditions for a general
solution of the corresponding Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems. We
define the set of potentials and v-representable densities, give a proof of
existence of the effective potentials under certain restrictions, and show the
set of v-representable densities to be independent of the interaction.
