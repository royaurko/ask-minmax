We detail the enumeration of all two-intersection sets of the
five-dimensional projective space over the field of order 3 that are invariant
under an element of order 7, which include the examples of Hill (1973) and
Gulliver (1996). Up to projective equivalence, there are 6635 such
two-intersection sets.
