We consider the prospects for studying spin-independent isospin-violating
dark matter-nucleon interactions with neutrinos from dark matter annihilation
in the Sun, with a focus on IceCube/DeepCore (IC/DC). If dark matter-nucleon
interactions are isospin violating, IC/DC's reach in the spin-independent cross
section may be competitive with current direct detection experiments for a wide
range of dark matter masses. We also compare IC/DC's sensitivity to that of
next generation argon, germanium, neon and xenon based detectors.
