The Racah algebra, a quadratic algebra with two independent generators, is
central in the analysis of superintegrable models and encodes the properties of
the Racah polynomials. It is the algebraic structure behind the su(1,1) Racah
problem as it is realized by the intermediate Casimir operators arising in the
addition of three irreducible su(1,1) representations. It has been shown that
this Racah algebra can also be obtained from quadratic elements in the
enveloping algebra of su(2). The correspondence between these two realizations
is here explained and made explicit.
