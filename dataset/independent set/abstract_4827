In \cite{J}, Theorem 4.2, Jockusch proves that for any computable k-coloring
of pairs of integers, there is an infinite $\Pi^0_2$ homogeneous set. The proof
uses a countable collection of $\Pi^0_2$ sets as potential infinite homogeneous
sets. In a remark preceding the proof, Jockusch states without proof that it
can be shown that there is no computable way to prove this result with a finite
number of $\Pi^0_2$ sets. We provide a proof of this latter fact.
