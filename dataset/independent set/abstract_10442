We consider a zero-field Ising model defined on a quasiperiodic graph, the
so-called Labyrinth tiling. Exact information about the critical behaviour is
obtained from duality arguments and the subclass of models which yield
commuting transfer matrices. For the latter, the magnetization is independent
of the position and the phase transition between ordered and disordered phase
belongs to the Onsager universality class. In order to obtain information about
the generic case, we calculate the magnetization for a series of couplings by
standard Monte-Carlo methods.
