We consider a quasi-regular Dirichlet form. We show that a bounded signed
measure charges no set of zero capacity associated with the form iff it can be
decomposed into the sum of an integrable function and a bounded linear
functional on the domain of the form. The decomposition allows one to describe
explicitly the set of bounded measures charging no sets of zero capacity for
interesting classes of Dirichlet forms. By way of illustration, some examples
are given.
