In contrast with the notion of complexity, a set $A$ is called anti-complex
if the Kolmogorov complexity of the initial segments of $A$ chosen by a
recursive function is always bounded by the identity function. We show that, as
for complexity, the natural arena for examining anti-complexity is the
weak-truth table degrees. In this context, we show the equivalence of
anti-complexity and other lowness notions such as r.e.\ traceability or being
weak truth-table reducible to a Schnorr trivial set. A set $A$ is anti-complex
if and only if it is reducible to another set $B$ with \emph{tiny use}, whereby
we mean that the use function for reducing $A$ to $B$ can be made to grow
arbitrarily slowly, as gauged by unbounded nondecreasing recursive functions.
This notion of reducibility is then studied in its own right, and we also
investigate its range and the range of its uniform counterpart.
