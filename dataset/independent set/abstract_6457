We use Gaussian Processes to map the expansion history of the universe in a
model independent manner from the Union2.1 supernovae data and then apply these
reconstructed results to solve for the growth history. By comparing this to
BOSS and WiggleZ large scale structure data we examine whether growth is
determined wholly by expansion, with the measured gravitational growth index
testing gravity without assuming a model for dark energy. A further model
independent analysis looks for redshift dependent deviations of growth from the
general relativity solution without assuming the growth index form. Both
approaches give results consistent with general relativity.
