This paper introduces the new data-dependent multiplier bootstrap for
non-parametric analysis of survival data, possibly subject to competing risks.
The new resampling procedure includes both the general wild bootstrap and the
weird bootstrap as special cases. The data may be subject to independent
right-censoring and left-truncation. We rigorously prove asymptotic correctness
which has in particular been pending for the weird bootstrap. As a consequence,
pointwise as well as time-simultaneous inference procedures for, amongst
others, the classical survival setting are deduced. We report simulation
results and a real data analysis of the cumulative cardiovascular event
probability. The simulation results suggest that both the weird bootstrap and
use of non-standard multipliers in the wild bootstrap may perform preferably.
