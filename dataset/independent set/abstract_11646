The chemical reactions are very complex, and include oscillation,
condensation, catalyst and self-organization, etc. In these case changes of
entropy may increase or decrease. The second law of thermodynamics is based on
an isolated system and statistical independence. If fluctuations magnified due
to internal interactions exist in the system, entropy will decrease possibly.
In chemical reactions there are various internal interactions, so that some
ordering processes with decrease of entropy are possible on an isolated system.
For example, a simplifying Fokker-Planck equation is solved, and the hysteresis
as limit cycle is discussed.
