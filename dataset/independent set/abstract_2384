We examine the calculation of the critical temperature $T_c$ for the
restoration of a spontaneously broken symmetry. Motivated by a set of recently
developed gauge dependence identities, we give a gauge and parameterization
independent definition of this temperature in terms of the physical mass of the
scalar particle as determined by the propagator pole. As an explicit
illustration, we consider the Abelian Higgs model in the unitary gauge, where
the usual definition of the critical temperature based upon the effective
potential leads to an erroneous result. We show how the gauge invariant
definition reproduces the correct result as found in the ``renormalizable''
parameterizations.
