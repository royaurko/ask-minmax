We propose a systematic methodology for defining tournament solutions as
extensions of maximality. The central concepts of this methodology are maximal
qualified subsets and minimal stable sets. We thus obtain an infinite hierarchy
of tournament solutions, which encompasses the top cycle, the uncovered set,
the Banks set, the minimal covering set, the tournament equilibrium set, the
Copeland set, and the bipartisan set. Moreover, the hierarchy includes a new
tournament solution, the minimal extending set, which is conjectured to refine
both the minimal covering set and the Banks set.
