Let G=(V,E) be a graph and K a set of terminal vertices of G. Assume that the
edges of G are failing independently with given probabilities. The K-terminal
reliability R(G,K) is the probability that all vertices in K are mutually
connected. In this article we propose an efficient splitting formula for R(G,K)
at a separating vertex set of G by lattice theoretic methods.
