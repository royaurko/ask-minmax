We show that the qualitative picture of the phase diagram which includes the
non-uniform chiral phase and 2SC superconducting phase is independent of the
considered regularization schemes. We also demonstrate that the quantitative
results agree with each other reasonably for the set of so called
"relativistic" regularization schemes. On the other hand the "non-relativistic"
momentum cut-off is clearly differ from the others.
