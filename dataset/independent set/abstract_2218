We develop the white dwarf luminosity function (LF) of the old open cluster
NGC 188 in order to determine a lower limit to the age of the cluster by using
the faint end of the cooling sequence.
  To produce an extensive sequence of the cooling white dwarfs we imaged four
contiguous HST-WFPC2 fields in the center of the cluster in the F555W and F814W
filters. After imposing selection criteria on the detected objects we found a
white dwarf cooling sequence (down to V ~26.5) including 28 candidate white
dwarfs in the cluster. The exposures are not deep enough to reach the end of
this sequence, but the results of our analysis allow us to establish a lower
limit to the age of the cluster independently of the isochrone fit to the
cluster turnoff.
  The most ancient white dwarfs found are ~4 Gyr old, an age that is set solely
by the photometric limit of our data. Classical methods provide an estimate of
\~7 Gyr (Sarajedini et al., 1999).
