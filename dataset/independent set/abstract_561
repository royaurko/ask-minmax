We propose a new framework for categorifying skew-symmetrizable cluster
algebras. Starting from an exact stably 2-Calabi-Yau category C endowed with
the action of a finite group G, we construct a G-equivariant mutation on the
set of maximal rigid G-invariant objects of C. Using an appropriate cluster
character, we can then attach to these data an explicit skew-symmetrizable
cluster algebra. As an application we prove the linear independence of the
cluster monomials in this setting. Finally, we illustrate our construction with
examples associated with partial flag varieties and unipotent subgroups of
Kac-Moody groups, generalizing to the non simply-laced case several results of
Gei\ss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer.
