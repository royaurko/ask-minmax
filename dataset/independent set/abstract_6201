We present a new construction of gradient-like vector fields in the setting
of Morse theory on a complex analytic stratification. We prove that the
ascending and descending sets for these vector fields possess cell
decompositions satisfying the dimension bounds conjectured by M. Goresky and R.
MacPherson. Similar results by C.-H. Cho and G. Marelli have recently appeared
in arXiv:0908.1862.
