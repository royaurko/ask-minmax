We analyze anew experiments on the NMR in cuprates and find an important
information on their phase separation and its stripe character hidden in the
dependence of $1/^{63}T_{1}$ on degree of doping. In a broad class of materials
$1/^{63}T_{1}$ is the sum of two terms: the temperature independent one
attributed to ``incommensurate'' stripes that occur at external doping, and an
``universal'' temperature dependent term ascribed to moving metallic and AF
sub-phases. We argue that the frustrated first order phase transition in a
broad temperature interval bears a dynamical character.
