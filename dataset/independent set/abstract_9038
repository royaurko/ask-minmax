Phase space can be constructed for $N$ equal and distinguishable subsystems
that could be (probabilistically) either {\it weakly} (or {\it "locally"})
correlated (e.g., independent, i.e., uncorrelated), or {\it strongly} (or {\it
globally}) correlated. If they are locally correlated, we expect the
Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy $S_{BG} \equiv -k \sum_i p_i \ln p_i$ to be {\it
extensive}, i.e., $S_{BG}(N)\propto N $ for $N \to\infty$. In particular, if
they are independent, $S_{BG}$ is {\it strictly additive}, i.e., $S_{BG}(N)=N
S_{BG}(1), \forall N$. However, if the subsystems are globally correlated, we
expect, for a vast class of systems, the entropy $S_q\equiv k [1- \sum_i
p_i^q]/(q-1)$ (with $S_1=S_{BG}$) for some special value of $q\ne1$ to be the
one which extensive (i.e., $S_q(N)\propto N $ for $N \to\infty$).
