We give two explicit sets of generators of the group of functions over QQ on
the modular curve X1(N) supported on the cusps.
  The first set of generators is essentially the set of defining equations of
X1(n) for n <= N/2. It satisfies the same recurrence relation as the elliptic
division polynomials, so this set of algebraic functions can be written down
explicitly. Our result proves a conjecture of Maarten Derickx and Mark van
Hoeij.
  The second set of generators is explicit in terms of classical analytic
functions known as Siegel functions.
  Our proof consists of two parts. First, we relate our two sets of generators.
Second, we use q-expansions and Gauss' lemma for power series to prove that our
functions generate the full group of modular functions. The second part of the
proof is partially inspired by a proof of Kubert and Lang.
