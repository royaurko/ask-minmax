We prove several facts concerning Lipschitz percolation, including the
following. The critical probability p_L for the existence of an open Lipschitz
surface in site percolation on Z^d with d\ge 2 satisfies the improved bound p_L
\le 1-1/[8(d-1)]. Whenever p > p_L, the height of the lowest Lipschitz surface
above the origin has an exponentially decaying tail. The lowest surface is
dominated stochastically by the boundary of a union of certain independent,
identically distributed random subsets of Z^d. As a consequence, for p
sufficiently close to 1, the connected regions of Z^{d-1} above which the
surface has height 2 or more exhibit stretched-exponential tail behaviour.
