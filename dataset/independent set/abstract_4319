In this study, after given the definition of soft sets and their basic
operations we define convex soft sets which is an important concept for
operation research, optimization and related problems. Then, we define concave
soft sets and give some properties for the concave sets. For these, we will use
definition and properties of convex-concave fuzzy sets in literature. We also
give different some properties for the convex and concave soft sets.
