Topological insulators are characterized by specially protected conduction on
their outer boundaries. We show that the protected edge conduction exhibited by
2-D topological insulators (and also Chern insulators) is independent of
non-magnetic boundary disorder. In particular, the edge states residing inside
the bulk gap remain conducting even when edge state inhomogeneities destroy the
characteristic linear Dirac relation between energy and momentum. The main
effects of boundary disorder on the in-gap states are to decrease the Fermi
velocity, increase the density of states, pull the states into the disordered
region if spin is conserved, and at very large disorder shift the states to the
boundary between the disordered edge and the clean bulk. These effects, which
may be useful for device engineering, are controlled by a resonance between the
disordered edge and the bulk bands. The resonance's energy is set by the bulk
band width; protection of the in-gap edge states' plane-wave character is
controlled by the bulk band width, not the bulk band gap.
