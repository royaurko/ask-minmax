Much research has been done on structures equivalent to topological or
simplicial groups. In this paper, we consider instead simplicial monoids. In
particular, we show that the usual model category structure on the category of
simplicial monoids is Quillen equivalent to an appropriate model category
structure on the category of simplicial spaces with a single point in degree
zero. In this second model structure, the fibrant objects are reduced Segal
categories. We then generalize the proof to relate simplicial categories with a
fixed object set to Segal categories with the same fixed set in degree zero.
