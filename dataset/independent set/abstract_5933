In this note we evaluate the expected waiting time to complete a collection
of coupons, in the case of coupons which arrives in groups of constant size,
independently and with unequal probabilities. As an application we will be able
to determine the expected number of samples of dimension g that we have to draw
independently in order to observe all the types of individuals in a given
population.
