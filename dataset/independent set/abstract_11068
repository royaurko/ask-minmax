We compute the shear viscosity and the electrical conductivity in gauge
theories with massive fermions at leading order in the large N_f expansion. The
calculation is organized using the 1/N_f expansion of the 2PI effective action
to next-to-leading order. We show explicitly that the calculation is gauge
fixing independent and consistent with the Ward identity. We find that these
transport coefficients depend in a nontrivial manner on the coupling constant
and fermion mass. For large mass, both the shear viscosity and the electrical
conductivity go to zero.
