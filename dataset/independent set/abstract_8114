Using the complete orthonormal basis sets of nonrelativistic and
quasirelativistic orbitals introduced by the contributor in previous papers for
particles with arbitrary spin the new analytical relations for the -component
relativistic tensor wave functions and tensor Slater orbitals in coordinate,
momentum and four-dimensional spaces are derived, where. The relativistic
tensor function sets are expressed through the corresponding nonrelativistic
and quasirelativistic orbitals. The analytical formulas for overlap integrals
over relativistic tensor Slater orbitals with the same screening constants in
coordinate space are also derived.
