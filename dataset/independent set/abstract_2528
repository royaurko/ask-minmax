We prove the appearance of an explicit lower bound on the solution to the
full Boltzmann equation in the torus for a broad family of collision kernels
including in particular long-range interaction models, under the assumption of
some uniform bounds on some hydrodynamic quantities. This lower bound is
independent of time and space. When the collision kernel satisfies Grad's
cutoff assumption, the lower bound is a global Maxwellian and its asymptotic
behavior in velocity is optimal, whereas for non-cutoff collision kernels the
lower bound we obtain decreases exponentially but faster than the Maxwellian.
Our results cover solutions constructed in a spatially homogeneous setting, as
well as small-time or close-to-equilibrium solutions to the full Boltzmann
equation in the torus. The constants are explicit and depend on the a priori
bounds on the solution.
