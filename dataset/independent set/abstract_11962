I present an algorithm based on sector decomposition and Mellin-Barnes
techniques to power expand Feynman integrals. The coefficients of this
expansion are given in terms of finite integrals that can be calculated
numerically. I show in an example the benefit of this method for getting the
full analytic power expansion from differential equations by providing the
correct ansatz for the solution. For method of regions the presented algorithm
provides a numerical check, which is independent from any power counting
argument.
