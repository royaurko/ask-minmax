Particle correlations and particle multiplicity distributions cannot be
approached independently: a unified description of correlations and
multiplicity distributions is always needed in order to understand the
underlying dynamics in high energy collisions. In this light, we review the
most recent and interesting results on rapidity and momentum correlations,
emphasising the possibilities of measurements with the ALICE detector.
