In this paper, we study inference for chains of variable order under two
distinct contamination regimes. Consider we have a chain of variable memory on
a finite alphabet containing zero. At each instant of time an independent coin
is flipped and if it turns head a contamination occurs. In the first regime a
zero is read independent of the value of the chain. In the second regime, the
value of another chain of variable memory is observed instead of the original
one. Our results state that the difference between the transition probabilities
of the original process and the corresponding ones of the contaminated process
may be bounded above uniformly. Moreover, if the contamination probability is
small enough, using a version of the Context algorithm we are able to recover
the context tree of the original process through a contaminated sample.
