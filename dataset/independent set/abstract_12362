We study the exact and optimal repair of multiple failures in codes for
distributed storage. More particularly, we examine the use of interference
alignment to build exact scalar minimum storage coordinated regenerating codes
(MSCR). We show that it is possible to build codes for the case of k = 2 and d
> k by aligning interferences independently but that this technique cannot be
applied as soon as k > 2 and d > k. Our results also apply to adaptive
regenerating codes.
