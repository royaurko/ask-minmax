Using the Cloudy_3D code (Morisset, this conference), we run a set of models
to build a catalog of emission line profiles of PNe. The goal is to cover the
main morphologies (spherical, ellipsoidal, bipolar, thin or thick shells) and
to compute profiles changing the orientation of the nebula, the expansion
velocity law (including or not turbulence), the position/size of the aperture.
The results is a huge set of profiles and PV-diagrams that can be compared to
observations as a help to derive morpho-kinematical properties of real objects.
