We consider the moments of the volume of the symmetric convex hull of
independent random points in an $n$-dimensional symmetric convex body. We
calculate explicitly the second and fourth moments for $n$ points when the
given body is $B_q^n$ (and all of the moments for the case $q = 2$), and derive
from these the asymptotic behavior of the expected volume of a random simplex
in those bodies.
