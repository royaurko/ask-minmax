We present a proposal for performing model-independent jets plus missing
energy searches. Currently, these searches are optimized for mSUGRA and are
consequently not sensitive to all kinematically-accessible regions of parameter
space. We show that the reach of these searches can be broadened by setting
limits on the differential cross section as a function of the total visible
energy and the missing energy. These measurements only require knowledge of the
relevant Standard Model backgrounds and can be subsequently used to limit any
theoretical model of new physics. We apply this approach to an example where
gluinos are pair-produced and decay to the LSP through a single-step cascade,
and show how sensitivity to different gluino masses is altered by the presence
of the decay chain. The analysis is closely based upon the current searches
done at the Tevatron and our proposal requires only small modifications to the
existing techniques. We find that within the MSSM, the gluino can be as light
as 125 GeV. The same techniques are applicable to jets and missing energy
searches at the Large Hadron Collider.
