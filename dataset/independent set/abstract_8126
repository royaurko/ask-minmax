Let T be a C^2-expanding self-map of a compact, connected, smooth, Riemannian
manifold M. We correct a minor gap in the proof of a theorem from the
literature: the set of points whose forward orbits are nondense has full
Hausdorff dimension. Our correction allows us to strengthen the theorem.
Combining the correction with Schmidt games, we generalize the theorem in
dimension one: given a point x in M, the set of points whose forward orbit
closures miss x is a winning set.
