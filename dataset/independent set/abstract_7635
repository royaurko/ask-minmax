We consider resonances in the semi-classical limit, generated by a single
closed hyperbolic orbit, for an operator on ${\bf R}^2$. We determine all such
resonancess in a domain independent of the semi-classical parameter As an
application we determine all resonances generated by a saddle point in a fixed
disc around the critical energy.
