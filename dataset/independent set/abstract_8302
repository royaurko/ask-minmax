A locally recoverable code (LRC code) is a code over a finite alphabet such
that every symbol in the encoding is a function of a small number of other
symbols that form a recovering set. Bounds on the rate and distance of such
codes have been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper we derive
upper bounds on the rate and distance of codes in which every symbol has $t\geq
1$ disjoint recovering sets.
