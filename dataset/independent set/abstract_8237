Computing a polygon defining a set of planar points is a classical problem of
modern computational geometry. In laboratory experiments we demonstrate that a
concave hull, a connected alpha-shape without holes, of a finite planar set is
approximated by slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We represent planar points
with sources of long-distance attractants and short-distance repellents and
inoculate a piece of plasmodium outside the data set. The plasmodium moves
towards the data and envelops it by pronounced protoplasmic tubes.
