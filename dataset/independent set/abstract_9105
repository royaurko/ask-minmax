If massive neutrinos possess magnetic moments, a magnetic field can cause a
spin flip. In the case of Dirac neutrinos the spin flip converts an active
neutrino into a sterile one and vice versa. By contrast, if neutrinos are
Majorana particles, a spin flip converts them to a neutrino of a different
flavor. We examine the behavior of neutrinos in a random magnetic field as it
occurs, for instance, in certain astronomical objects, such as an active
galactic nucleus. Both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos behave ergodically:
independently of their initial density matrix, they tend towards an
equipartition of the helicity states. As a result, about half of the Dirac
neutrinos produced becomes sterile. For Majorana neutrinos, there will be an
approximate equipartition of flavors, independently of the production
mechanism.
