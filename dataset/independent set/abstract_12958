Practical applications of multivariate kernel density estimators in more than
three dimensions suffer a great deal from the well-known curse of
dimensionality: convergence slows down as dimension increases. We propose an
estimator that avoids the curse of dimensionality by assuming a simplified vine
copula model. We prove the estimator's consistency and show that the speed of
convergence is independent of dimension. Simulation experiments illustrate the
large gain in accuracy compared with the classical multivariate kernel density
estimator --- even when the true density does not belong to the class of
simplified vines. Lastly, we give an application of the estimator to a
classification problem from astrophysics.
