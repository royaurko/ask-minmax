Small crystallites form when finite quantal systems are set highly rotating.
This crystallization is independent of the statistics of the particles, and
occurs for both trapped bosons and fermions. The spin degree of freedom does
not change the tendency for localization. In a highly rotating state, the
strongly correlated bosonic and fermionic systems approach to that of classical
particles.
