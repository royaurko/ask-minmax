Angular correlations of ultra-high energy cosmic rays with cosmologically
distant sources may provide clues to these mysterious events. We compare cosmic
ray tracks with energies above $ 10^{20}eV$ to a compilation of radio-loud
compact QSO positions. The statistical method emphasizes invariant quantities
and a test of {\it statistical independence} of track and source distributions.
Statistical independence is ruled out by several independent statistics at
confidence levels of less that $10^{-3}$ ($99.9% $.), indicating that track
directions and QSO source positions are correlated at a highly significant
level.
