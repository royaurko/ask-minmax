The crease set of an event horizon is studied in a spacetime with discrete or
continuous symmetry. It determines possible topologies on spatial sections of
an event horizon. We thereby investigate the classification of stable
topological structure of the crease sets in a spacetime with any symmetry. In
practice, we show the classification of the crease set in axially symmetric
spacetime. By that we realize the topological structure of axially symmetric
event horizons. We will finc that many new topological structures become stable
which is not stable without symmetry.
