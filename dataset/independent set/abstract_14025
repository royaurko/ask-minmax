We consider directed acyclic {\em sum-networks} with $m$ sources and $n$
terminals where the sources generate symbols from an arbitrary alphabet field
$F$, and the terminals need to recover the sum of the sources over $F$. We show
that for any co-finite set of primes, there is a sum-network which is solvable
only over fields of characteristics belonging to that set. We further construct
a sum-network where a scalar solution exists over all fields other than the
binary field $F_2$. We also show that a sum-network is solvable over a field if
and only if its reverse network is solvable over the same field.
