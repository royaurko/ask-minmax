We propose a new variant of the semiclassical quantisation with two
independent parameters. The first one is proportional to the Planck constant as
usually and the second one is connected with a deviation of the given potential
from a very wide and important class of them for which an exact condition can
be constructed. The accuracy is estimated for a number of special cases
