Inflationary cosmology is developed in the second Randall-Sundrum braneworld
scenario, where the accelerated expansion arises through potentials that are
too steep to drive inflation in conventional cosmology. A relationship between
the scalar and tensor perturbation spectra is derived that is independent of
both the inflaton potential and the brane tension. It is found that a single
field with an inverse power law potential can act as both the inflaton and the
quintessence field for suitable values of the brane tension.
