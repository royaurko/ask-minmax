We present an independent calculation of that part of the O(\alpha_s^2)
contribution to the decay width \Gamma(\bar B -> X_s \gamma) which arises from
the self-interference term of the electromagnetic dipole operator O_7. Using a
different method, we find complete agreement with a previous calculation. This
NNLL contribution is an important ingredient for the complete NNLL prediction
of \Gamma(\bar B -> X_s \gamma) which will resolve the charm quark mass
ambiguity appearing at NLL accuracy.
