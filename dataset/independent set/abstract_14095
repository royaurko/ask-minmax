We study the relation between a complex projective set C in CP^n and the set
R in RP^(2n+1) defined by viewing each equation of C as a pair of real
equations. Once C is presented by quadratic equations, we can apply a spectral
sequence to efficiently compute the homology of R; using the fact that the
(Z_2)-cohomology of R is a free H*(C)-module with two generators we can in
principle reconstruct the homology of C. Explicit computations for the
intersection of two complex quadrics are presented.
