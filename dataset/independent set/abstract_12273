We propose a class of observables constructed from lepton energy
distribution, which are independent of the velocity of the parent particle if
it is scalar or unpolarized. These observables may be used to measure
properties of various particles in the LHC experiments. We demonstrate their
usage in a determination of the Higgs boson mass.
