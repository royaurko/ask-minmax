We present single and binary black hole simulations that follow the moving
puncture paradigm of simulating black-hole spacetimes without excision, and use
moving boxes mesh refinement. Focussing on binary black hole configurations
where the simulations cover roughly two orbits, we address five major issues
determining the quality of our results: numerical discretization error, finite
extraction radius of the radiation signal, physical appropriateness of initial
data, gauge choice and computational performance. We also compare results we
have obtained with the BAM code described here with the independent LEAN code.
