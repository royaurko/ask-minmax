In the first part of this paper, we study the properties of some particular
plurisubharmonic functions, namely the toric ones. The main result of this part
is a precise description of their multiplier ideal sheaves, which generalizes
the algebraic case studied by Howald. In the second part, almost entirely
independent of the first one, we generalize the notion of the adjoint ideal
sheaf used in algebraic geometry to the analytic setting. This enables us to
give an analogue of Howald's theorem for adjoint ideals attached to monomial
ideals. Finally, using the local Ohsawa-Takegoshi-Manivel theorem, we prove the
existence of the so-called generalized adjunction exact sequence, which enables
us to recover a weak version of the global extension theorem of Manivel, for
compact K\"ahler manifolds.
