A new kind of tridimensional scalar optical beams is introduced. These beams
are called Lorentz beams because the form of their transverse pattern in the
source plane is the product of two independent Lorentz functions. Closed-form
expression of free-space propagation under paraxial limit is derived and pseudo
non-diffracting features pointed out. Moreover, as the slowly varying part of
these fields fulfils the scalar paraxial wave equation, it follows that there
exist also Lorentz-Gauss beams, i.e. beams obtained by multipying the original
Lorentz beam to a Gaussian apodization function. Although the existence of
Lorentz-Gauss beams can be shown by using two different and independent ways
obtained recently from Kiselev [Opt. Spectr. 96, 4 (2004)] and Gutierrez-Vega
et al. [JOSA A 22, 289-298, (2005)], here we have followed a third different
approach, which makes use of Lie's group theory, and which possesses the merit
to put into evidence the symmetries present in paraxial Optics.
