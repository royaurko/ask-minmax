We give a method to construct pseudo-trace functions for vertex operator
algebras satisfying Zhu's finiteness condition not through higher Zhu's
algebras and apply our method to the Z_2-orbifold model associated with d-pairs
of symplectic fermions. For d=1, we determine the dimension of the space of
one-point functions. For d>1, we construct 2^{2d-1}+3 linearly independent
one-point functions and study their values at the vacuum vector.
