In 1970, Hirsch asked what kind of compact invariant sets could be part of a
hyperbolic set. Here we obtain that, in case such an invariant set is a 3D
manifold, it is a connected sum of tori with handles quotiented by involutions.
Moreover, if the manifold is orientable, the involutions are all trivial.
  In 1975, Ma{\~n}{\'e} characterized hyperbolic dynamics restricted to
manifolds and called them quasi Anosov. We also classify here quasi-Anosov
dynamics in 3D-manifolds.
