Subspace clustering (SC) is a promising clustering technology to identify
clusters based on their associations with subspaces in high dimensional spaces.
SC can be classified into hard subspace clustering (HSC) and soft subspace
clustering (SSC). While HSC algorithms have been extensively studied and well
accepted by the scientific community, SSC algorithms are relatively new but
gaining more attention in recent years due to better adaptability. In the
paper, a comprehensive survey on existing SSC algorithms and the recent
development are presented. The SSC algorithms are classified systematically
into three main categories, namely, conventional SSC (CSSC), independent SSC
(ISSC) and extended SSC (XSSC). The characteristics of these algorithms are
highlighted and the potential future development of SSC is also discussed.
