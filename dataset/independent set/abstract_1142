When performing a full calculation within the Standard Model or its
extensions, it is crucial that one utilizes a consistent set of signs for the
gauge couplings and gauge fields. Unfortunately, the literature is plagued with
differing signs and notations. We present all Standard Model Feynman rules,
including ghosts, in a convention-independent notation, and we table the
conventions in close to 40 books and reviews.
