Let N, N' and N'' be point processes such that N' is obtained from N by
homogeneous independent thinning and N''= N- N'. We give a new elementary proof
that N' and N'' are independent if and only if N is a Poisson point process. We
present some applications of this result to test if a homogeneous point process
is a Poisson point process.
