Configurational states that are to be associated, according to Goldstein,
with the basins in the potential energy landscape cannot be characterized by
any particular basin identifier such as the basin minima, the lowest barrier,
the most probable energy barrier, etc. since the basin free energy turns out to
be independent of the energies of these identifiers. Thus, our analysis
utilizes basin free energies to characterize configurational states. When the
basin identifier energies are monotonic, we can express the equilibrium basin
free energy as a function of an equilibrium basin identifier energy, as we
explain, but it is not necessarily unique.
