We discuss the correlated systematic theoretical uncertainties that may be
ascribed to the next-to-leading order QCD theory used to predict the one-jet
inclusive cross section in hadron collisions. We estimate the magnitude of
these errors as functions of the jet transverse momentum and rapidity. The
total theoretical error is decomposed into a set of functions of transverse
momentum and rapidity that give a model for statistically independent
contributions to the error. This representation can be used to include the
systematic theoretical errors in fits to the experimental data.
