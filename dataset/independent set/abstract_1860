An (upward) skip-free Markov chain with the set of nonnegative integers as
state space is a chain for which upward jumps may be only of unit size; there
is no restriction on downward jumps. In a 1987 paper, Brown and Shao
determined, for an irreducible continuous-time skip-free chain and any d, the
passage time distribution from state 0 to state d. When the nonzero eigenvalues
nu_j of the generator are all real, their result states that the passage time
is distributed as the sum of d independent exponential random variables with
rates nu_j. We give another proof of their theorem. In the case of
birth-and-death chains, our proof leads to an explicit representation of the
passage time as a sum of independent exponential random variables. Diaconis and
Miclo recently obtained the first such representation, but our construction is
much simpler.
  We obtain similar (and new) results for a fastest strong stationary time T of
an ergodic continuous-time skip-free chain with stochastically monotone
time-reversal started in state 0, and we also obtain discrete-time analogs of
all our results.
  In the paper's final section we present extensions of our results to more
general chains.
