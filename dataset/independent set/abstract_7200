We prove that there does not exist a subset of the plane S that meets every
isometric copy of the vertices of the unit square in exactly one point. We give
a complete characterization of all three point subsets F of the reals such that
there does not exists a set of reals S which meets every isometric copy of F in
exactly one point. A finite set X in the plane is Jackson iff for every subset
S of the plane there exists an isometric copy Y of X such that Y does not meets
S in exactly one point. These results are related to the open problem:
  Q. (Steve Jackson) Is every finite set X in the plane of two or more points
Jackson?
