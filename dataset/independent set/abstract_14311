We study tropical geometry in the global setting using Berkovich's
deformation retraction. We state and prove the generalized balancing conditions
in this setting. Starting with a strictly semi-stable formal scheme, we
calculate certain sheaves of vanishing cycles using analytic \'etale
cohomology, then we interpret the tropical weights via these cycles. We obtain
the balancing condition for tropical curves on the skeleton associated to the
formal scheme in terms of the intersection theory on the special fiber. Our
approach works over any complete discrete valuation field.
