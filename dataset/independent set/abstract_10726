In order to discuss the well-posed initial value formulation of the
teleparallel gravity and apply it to numerical relativity a symmetric
hyperbolic system in the self-dual teleparallel gravity which is equivalent to
the Ashtekar formulation is posed. This system is different from the ones in
other works by that the reality condition of the spatial metric is included in
the symmetric hyperbolicity and then is no longer an independent condition. In
addition the constraint equations of this system are rather simpler than the
ones in other works.
