We study stability of interacting nonlinear systems with time-delayed
communications, using contraction theory and a simplified wave variable design
inspired by robotic teleoperation. We show that contraction is preserved
through specific time-delayed feedback communications, and that this property
is independent of the values of the delays. The approach is then applied to
group cooperation with linear protocols, where it shown that synchronization
can be made robust to arbitrary time delays.
