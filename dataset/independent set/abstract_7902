We establish a moderate deviation principle for processes with independent
increments under certain growth conditions for the characteristics of the
process. Using this moderate deviation principle, we give a new proof for
Strassen's functional law of the iterated logarithm. In particular, we show
that any square-integrable L\'evy process satisfies Strassen's law.
