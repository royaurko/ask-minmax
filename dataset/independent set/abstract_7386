We consider the set of forms of a toric variety over an arbitrary field:
those varieties which become isomorphic over a field extension. In contrast to
most previous work, we do not necessarily fix a specific torus or its action in
advance. We define an injective map from the set of forms of a toric variety to
a non-abelian second cohomology set, which generalizes the usual Brauer class
of a Severi-Brauer variety. Additionally, we define a map from the set of forms
of a toric variety to the set of forms of a separable algebra along similar
lines to a construction of A. Merkurjev and I. Panin. This generalizes both a
result of M. Blunk for del Pezzo surfaces of degree 6, and the standard
bijection between Severi-Brauer varieties and central simple algebras.
