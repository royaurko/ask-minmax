Model independent constraints on the mass of an extra neutral gauge boson and
its couplings to charged leptons are given for the $e^-e^-$ option of a future
linear collider. Analytic exclusion limits are derived in the Born
approximation. The results are compared with those of the $e^+e^-$ mode. The
influence of radiative corrections is discussed.
