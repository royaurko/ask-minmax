We show that a sequence of birth-and-death chains, given by lazy random walks
in a (transient) environment (RWRE) on [0; n], exhibits a cutoff in the
ballistic regime but does not exhibit a cutoff in the (interior of) the
subballistic regime. We investigate the growth of the mixing times for this
model. As an important step in the proof, we derive bounds for the quenched
expectation and the quenched variance of the hitting times of the RWRE, which
are of independent interest.
