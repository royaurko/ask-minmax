Let CBV denote the Banach algebra of all continuous real-valued functions of
bounded variation, defined in [0,1]. We show that the set of strongly singular
functions in CBV is nonseparably spaceable. We also prove that certain families
of singular functions constitute strongly c-algebrable sets. The argument is
based on a new general criterion of strong c-algebrability.
