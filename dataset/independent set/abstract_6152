Let X be an analytic set defined by polynomials whose coefficients
a_1,...,a_s are holomorphic functions. We formulate conditions such that for
all sequences {a_(1,n)},...,{a_(s,n)} of holomorphic functions converging
locally uniformly to a_1,...,a_s respectively the following holds true. If
a_(1,n),...,a_(s,n) satisfy the conditions then the sequence of the sets {X_n}
obtained by replacing a_j by a_(j,n) in the polynomials, converge to X.
