We study the 'goldstini' scenario of Cheung, Nomura, and Thaler, in which
multiple independent supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking sectors lead to multiple
would-be goldstinos, changing collider and cosmological phenomenology. In
supergravity, potentially large corrections to the previous prediction of twice
the gravitino mass for goldstini masses can arise when their scalar partners
are stabilized far from the origin. Considerations arising from the complexity
of realistic string compactifications indicate that many of the independent
SUSY-breaking sectors should be conformally sequestered or situated in warped
Randall-Sundrum-like throats, further changing the predicted goldstini masses.
If the sequestered hidden sector is a metastable SUSY-breaking sector of the
Intriligator-Seiberg-Shih (ISS) type then multiple goldstini can originate from
within a single sector, along with many supplementary 'modulini', all with
masses of order twice the gravitino mass. These fields can couple to the
Supersymmetric Standard Model (SSM) via the 'Goldstino Portal'. Collider
signatures involving SSM sparticle decays can provide strong evidence for
warped-or-conformally-sequestered sectors, and of the ISS mechanism of SUSY
breaking. Along with axions and photini, the Goldstino Portal gives another
potential window to the hidden sectors of string theory.
