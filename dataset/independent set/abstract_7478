A chemical system consisting of two species, one of which evolves
deterministically and independently of the other, which in turn is driven by
the dynamics of the former and by an additional multiplicative Gaussian white
noise, displays a $1/f$ noise for intermediate to large frequencies. A novel
mechanism responsible for the $1/f$ noise is suggested.
