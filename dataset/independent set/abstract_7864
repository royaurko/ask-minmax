We present the current status of the Tevatron charge asymmetry and its sister
asymmetry at the LHC. The relation between both is elucidated, using as
framework the collider-independent asymmetries they originate from. Other
related observables, such as the t tbar differential distribution and top
polarisation, are also discussed.
