We apply the Lee-Suzuki iteration method to calculate the linked-folded
diagram series for a new Nijmegen local NN potential. We obtain an exact
starting-energy-independent effective two-body interaction for a multi-shell,
no-core, harmonic-oscillator model space. It is found that the resulting
effective-interaction matrix elements can be well approximated by the Brueckner
G-matrix elements evaluated at starting energies selected in a simple way.
These starting energies are closely related to the energies of the initial
two-particle states in the ladder diagrams. The ``exact'' and approximate
effective interactions are used to calculate the energy spectrum of 6Li in
order to test the utility of the approximate form.
