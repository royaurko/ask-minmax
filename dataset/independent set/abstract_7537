A review of light-cone, covariant and gauge-invariant wave-functions of
mesons is presented. They are basic non-perturbative objects needed for hard
exclusive processes and for the method of light-cone QCD sum rules. The
emphasis is on the vector mesons and a new (model-independent) way of computing
the mass corrections of vector-meson wave functions is given.
