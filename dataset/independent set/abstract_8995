The He3 abundance is not constrained by helioseismic data. Mixing of He3
inside the solar core by processes not included in the solar standard model
(SSM) has been recently proposed as possible solution to the solar neutrino
problem. We have performed a model independent analysis of solar neutrino
fluxes using practically arbitrary He3 mixing. In addition, we have been
simultaneously varying within very wide ranges the temperature in the neutrino
production zone and the astrophysical factors, S17 and S34, of the p+Be7 and
He3+He4 cross sections. Seismic data are used as constraints, but the solar-
luminosity constraint is not imposed. It is demonstrated that even allowing He3
abundances higher by factors up to 16 than in the SSM, temperatures 5% (or
more) lower, the astrophysical factor S17 up to 40% higher, and varying S34 in
the range (-20% ,+40%), the best fit is still more than 5 sigmas away from the
observed fluxes. We conclude that practically arbitrary He3 mixing combined
with independent variations of temperature and cross-sections cannot explain
the observed solar neutrino fluxes.
