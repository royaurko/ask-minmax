We show that a simple rate-and-state theory accounts for most features of
both time-independent and time-dependent plasticity in a spatially
inhomogeneous situation, specifically, a circular hole in a large stressed
plate. Those features include linear viscoelastic flow at small applied
stresses, strain hardening at larger stresses, and a dynamic transition to
viscoplasticity at a yield stress. In the static limit, this theory predicts
the existence of a plastic zone near the hole for some but not all ranges of
parameters. The rate-and-state theory also predicts dynamic failure modes that
we believe may be relevant to fracture mechanics.
