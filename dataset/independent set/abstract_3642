We have refined the estimate of the primordial level of $^7$Li abundance to
an accuracy better than 10%, based on high-precision Li abundances for
metal-poor halo stars, and a recent model of post-BBN (Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis) chemical evolution that provides a quantitative explanation of
the detected gentle ascent of the Spite Plateau for stars with metallicities
[Fe/H]$ > -3$. Our maximum likelihood analysis obtains an estimate for the
primordial Li abundance of $A({\rm Li})_p=2.07^{+0.16}_{-0.04}$, after taking
into account possible systematic errors in the estimation of Li abundances,
with the exception of a still-controversial issue regarding stellar depletion.
The inferred value of $\eta$ (the baryon-to-photon number-density ratio in the
universe) based on this estimate is more consistent with that derived from the
set of reported ``low He'' + ``high D'' from extragalactic sites than that
derived from reported ``high He'' + ``low D'' measurements. Since, within
current models of stellar depletion processes, it is difficult to account for
the observed very small scatter of Li abundance in metal-poor stars, our
estimate of $A({\rm Li})_p$ should be taken as an independent constraint on the
baryonic mass density parameter in the universe, giving $\Omega_b
h^2=(0.64-1.4)\times 10^{-2}$ with $h=H_0/100$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$.
