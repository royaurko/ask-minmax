Recommender systems are popular in e-commerce as they suggest items of
interest to users. Researchers have addressed the cold-start problem where
either the user or the item is new. However, the situation with both new user
and new item has seldom been considered. In this paper, we propose a cold-start
recommendation approach to this situation based on granular association rules.
Specifically, we provide a means for describing users and items through
information granules, a means for generating association rules between users
and items, and a means for recommending items to users using these rules.
Experiments are undertaken on a publicly available dataset MovieLens. Results
indicate that rule sets perform similarly on the training and the testing sets,
and the appropriate setting of granule is essential to the application of
granular association rules.
