It is proved that the simplex is a strict local minimum for the volume
product, P(K)=min(vol(K) vol(K^z)), K^z is the polar body of K with respect to
z, the minimum is taken over z in the interior of K, in the Banach-Mazur space
of n-dimensional (classes of ) convex bodies. Linear local stability in the
neighborhood of the simplex is proved as well. The proof consists of an
extension to the non-symmetric setting of methods that were recently introduced
by Nazarov, Petrov, Ryabogin and Zvavitch, as well as proving results of
independent interest, concerning stability of square order of volumes of polars
of non-symmetric convex bodies.
