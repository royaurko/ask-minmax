Inferences about the evolution of continuous traits based on reconstruction
of ancestral states has often been considered more error-prone than analysis of
independent contrasts. Here we show that both methods in fact yield identical
estimators for the correlation coefficient and regression gradient of
correlated traits, indicating that reconstructed ancestral states are a valid
source of information about correlated evolution. We show that the independent
contrast associated with a pair of sibling nodes on a phylogenetic tree can be
expressed in terms of the maximum likelihood ancestral state function at those
nodes and their common parent. This expression gives rise to novel formulae for
independent contrasts for any model of evolution admitting of a local
likelihood function. We thus derive new formulae for independent contrasts
applicable to traits evolving under directional drift, and use simulated data
to show that these directional contrasts provide better estimates of
evolutionary model parameters than standard independent contrasts, when traits
in fact evolve with a directional tendency.
