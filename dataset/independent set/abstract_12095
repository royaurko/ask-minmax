We study the accelerated expansion of the universe by using the kinematic
approach. In this context, we parameterize the deceleration parameter, q(z), in
a model independent way. Assuming three simple parameterizations we reconstruct
q(z). We do the joint analysis with combination of latest cosmological data
consisting of standard candles (Supernovae Union2 sample), standard ruler
(CMB/BAO), cosmic clocks (age of passively evolving galaxies) and Hubble (H(z))
data. Our results support the accelerated expansion of the universe.
