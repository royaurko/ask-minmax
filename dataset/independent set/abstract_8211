We prove that for any $n$ there is a pair $(P_1 ^n , P_2 ^n )$ of
nonisomorphic ordered sets such that $P_1 ^n $ and $P_2 ^n $ have equal maximal
and minimal decks, equal neighborhood decks, and there are $n+1$ ranks $k_0 ,
\ldots , k_n $ such that for each $i$ the decks obtained by removing the points
of rank $k_i $ are equal. The ranks $k_1 , \ldots , k_n $ do not contain
extremal elements and at each of the other ranks there are elements whose
removal will produce isomorphic cards. Moreover, we show that such sets can be
constructed such that only for ranks $1$ and $2$, both without extremal
elements, the decks obtained by removing the points of rank $r_i $ are not
equal.
