We construct six unitary trace invariants for 2 by 2 quaternionic matrices
which separate the unitary similarity classes of such matrices, and show that
this set is minimal. We prove two quaternionic versions of a well known
characterization of triangularizable subalgebras of matrix algebras over an
algebraically closed field. Finally we consider the problem of describing the
semi-algebraic set of pairs (X,Y) of quaternionic n by n matrices which are
simultaneously triangularizable. Even the case n=2, which we analyze in more
detail, remains unsolved.
