The Weinberg theorem, the Adler self consistency zero, the Goldberger and
Treiman relation and the Gell-Mann Oakes and Renner relation are proved
analytically in full detail for Quark Models. These proofs are independent of
the particular quark-quark interaction, and they are displayed with Feynman
diagrams in a compact notation. I assume the ladder truncation, which is
natural in the Quark Model, and also detail the diagrams that must be included
in each relation. Off mass shell and finite size effects are included in the
quark-antiquark pion Bethe Salpeter vertices. The axial and vector Ward
identities, for the quark propagator and for the ladder, exactly cancel any
model dependence.
