We present weak lensing shear catalogs for 139 square degrees of data taken
during the Science Verification (SV) time for the new Dark Energy Camera
(DECam) being used for the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We describe our object
selection, point spread function estimation and shear measurement procedures
using two independent shear pipelines, IM3SHAPE and NGMIX, which produce
catalogs of 2.12 million and 3.44 million galaxies respectively. We detail a
set of null tests for the shear measurements and find that they pass the
requirements for systematic errors at the level necessary for weak lensing
science applications using the SV data. We also discuss some of the planned
algorithmic improvements that will be necessary to produce sufficiently
accurate shear catalogs for the full 5-year DES, which is expected to cover
5000 square degrees.
