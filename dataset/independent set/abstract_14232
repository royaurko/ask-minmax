If EE is a set of matroids, then ex(EE) denotes the set of matroids that have
no minor isomorphic to a member of EE. If EE' is a subset of EE, we say that
EE' is /superfluous/ if ex(EE - EE') - ex(EE) contains only finitely many
3-connected matroids. We characterize the superfluous subsets of six well-known
collections of excluded minors.
