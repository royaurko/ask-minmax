Within the framework of three lepton families I present a transparent
analytical relationship between the neutrino mixing and CP-violating parameters
in vacuum and thos in matter. Such a model- and parametrization-independent
result will be particularly useful to recast the fundamental lepton flavor
mixing matrix from the future long-baseline neutrino experiments.
