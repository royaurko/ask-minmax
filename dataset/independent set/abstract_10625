Quantum corrections to the electrical conduction of magnetic semiconductors
are comparatively unexplored. We report measurements of time-dependent
universal conductance fluctuations (TDUCF) and magnetic field dependent
universal conductance fluctuations (MFUCF) in micron-scale structures
fabricated from two different In$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As thin films. TDUCF and MFUCF
increasing in magnitude with decreasing temperature are observed. At 4 K and
below, TDUCF are suppressed at finite magnetic fields independent of field
orientation.
