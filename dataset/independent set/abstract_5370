Bing-Whitehead Cantor sets were introduced by DeGryse and Osborne in
dimension three and greater to produce examples of Cantor sets that were non
standard (wild), but still had simply connected complement. In contrast to an
earlier example of Kirkor, the construction techniques could be generalized to
dimensions bigger than three. These Cantor sets in $S^{3}$ are constructed by
using Bing or Whitehead links as stages in defining sequences. Ancel and
Starbird, and separately Wright characterized the number of Bing links needed
in such constructions so as to produce Cantor sets. However it was unknown
whether varying the number of Bing and Whitehead links in the construction
would produce non equivalent Cantor sets. Using a generalization of geometric
index, and a careful analysis of three dimensional intersection patterns, we
prove that Bing-Whitehead Cantor sets are equivalently embedded in $S^3$ if and
only if their defining sequences differ by some finite number of Whitehead
constructions. As a consequence, there are uncountably many non equivalent such
Cantor sets in $S^{3}$ constructed with genus one tori and with simply
connected complement.
