Let $M_n = (\xi_{ij})_{1 \leq i,j \leq n}$ be a real symmetric random matrix
in which the upper-triangular entries $\xi_{ij}, i<j$ and diagonal entries
$\xi_{ii}$ are independent. We show that with probability tending to 1, $M_n$
has no repeated eigenvalues. As a corollary, we deduce that the Erd{\H
o}s-Renyi random graph has simple spectrum asymptotically almost surely,
answering a question of Babai.
