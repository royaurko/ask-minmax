We discuss charge symmetry and charge independence breaking in an effective
field theory approach for few-nucleon systems. We systematically introduce
strong isospin-violating and electromagnetic operators in the theory. The
charge dependence observed in the nucleon-nucleon scattering lengths is due to
one-pion exchange and one electromagnetic four-nucleon contact term. This gives
a parameter free expression for the charge dependence of the corresponding
effective ranges, which is in agreement with the rather small and uncertain
empirical determinations. We also compare the low energy phase shifts of the
$nn$ and the $np$ system.
