As the global HIV pandemic enters its fourth decade, increasing numbers of
surveillance sites have been established which allows countries to look into
the epidemics at a finer scale, e.g. at sub-national levels. Currently, the
epidemic models have been applied independently to the sub-national areas
within countries. However, the availability and quality of the data vary
widely, which leads to biased and unreliable estimates for areas with very few
data. We propose to overcome this issue by introducing the dependence of the
parameters across areas in a mixture model. The joint distribution of the
parameters in multiple areas can be approximated directly from the results of
independent fits without needing to refit the data or unpack the software. As a
result, the mixture model has better predictive ability than the independent
model as shown in examples of multiple countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
