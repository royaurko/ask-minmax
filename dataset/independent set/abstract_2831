A two-user symmetric Gaussian Interference Channel (IC) is considered in
which a noiseless unidirectional link connects one encoder to the other. Having
a constant capacity, the additional link provides partial cooperation between
the encoders. It is shown that the available cooperation can dramatically
increase the sum-capacity of the channel. This fact is proved based on
comparison of proposed lower and upper bounds on the sum-capacity. Partitioning
the data into three independent messages, namely private, common, and
cooperative ones, the transmission strategy used to obtain the lower bound
enjoys a simple type of Han-Kobayashi scheme together with a cooperative
communication scheme. A Genie-aided upper bound is developed which incorporates
the capacity of the cooperative link. Other upper bounds are based on the
sum-capacity of the Cognitive Radio Channel and cut-set bounds. For the strong
interference regime, the achievablity scheme is simplified to employ common
and/or cooperative messages but not the private one. Through a careful analysis
it is shown that the gap between these bounds is at most one and two bits per
real dimension for strong and weak interference regimes, respectively.
Moreover, the Generalized Degrees-of-Freedom of the channel is characterized.
