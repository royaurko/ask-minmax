We answer a question raised by Hindry and Ratazzi concerning the intersection
between cyclotomic extensions of a number field $K$ and extensions of $K$
generated by torsion points of an abelian variety over $K$. We prove that, if
we assume the Mumford-Tate conjecture, then a weak version of the property
$(\mu)$ they introduced holds for any abelian variety, while the same is not
true - independently of Mumford-Tate - for a slightly stronger version of the
property they also considered.
