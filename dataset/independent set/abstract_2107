We study families $\Phi$ of coverings which are faithful for the Hausdorff
dimension calculation on a given set $E$ (i. e., special relatively narrow
families of coverings leading to the classical Hausdorff dimension of an
arbitrary subset of $E$) and which are natural generalizations of comparable
net-coverings. They are shown to be very useful for the determination or
estimation of the Hausdorff dimension of sets and probability measures.
  We give general necessary and sufficient conditions for a covering family to
be faithful and new techniques for proving faithfulness/non-faithfulness for
the family of cylinders generated by expansions of real numbers. Motivated by
applications in the multifractal analysis of infinite Bernoulli convolutions,
we study in details the Cantor series expansion and prove necessary and
sufficient conditions for the corresponding net-coverings to be faithful. To
the best of our knowledge this is the first known sharp condition of the
faithfulness for a class of covering families containing both faithful and
non-faithful ones.
  Applying our results, we characterize fine fractal properties of probability
measures with independent digits of the Cantor series expansion and show that a
class of faithful net-coverings essentially wider that the class of comparable
ones. We construct, in particular, rather simple examples of faithful families
$\mathcal{A}$ of net-coverings which are "extremely non-comparable" to the
Hausdorff measure.
