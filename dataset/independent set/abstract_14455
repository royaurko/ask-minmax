We use the light-front coupled-cluster (LFCC) method to compute the
odd-parity massive eigenstate of $\phi_{1+1}^4$ theory. A standard Fock-space
truncation of the eigenstate yields a finite set of linear equations for a
finite number of wave functions. The LFCC method replaces Fock-space truncation
with a more sophisticated truncation; the eigenvalue problem is reduced to a
finite set of nonlinear equations without any restriction on Fock space, but
with restrictions on the Fock wave functions. We compare our results with those
obtained with a Fock-space truncation.
