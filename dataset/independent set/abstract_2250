A method to compute several scalar quantities of Cosmic Microwave Background
maps on the sphere is presented. We consider here four type of scalars: the
Hessian matrix scalars, the distortion scalars, the gradient related scalars
and the curvature scalars. Such quantities are obtained directly from the
spherical harmonic coefficients (alm) of the map. We also study the probability
density function of these quantities for the case of a homogeneous and
isotropic Gaussian field, which are functions of the power spectrum of the
initial field. From these scalars it is posible to construct a new set of
scalars which are independent of the power spectrum of the field. We test our
results using simulations and find a good agreement between the theoretical
probability density functions and those obtained from simulations. Therefore,
these quantities are proposed to investigate the presence of non-Gaussian
features in CMB maps. Finally, we show how to compute the scalars in presence
of anisotropic noise and realistic masks.
