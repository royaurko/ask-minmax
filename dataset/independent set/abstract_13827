For a graph $G$ and $S\subset V(G)$, if $G - S$ is acyclic, then $S$ is said
to be a decycling set of $G$. The size of a smallest decycling set of $G$ is
called the decycling number of $G$. The purpose of this paper is a
comprehensive review of recent results and several open problems on this graph
parameter. Results to be reviewed include recent work on decycling numbers of
cubes, grids and snakes. A structural description of graphs with a fixed
decycling number based on connectivity is also presented. Graphs with small
decycling numbers are characterized.
