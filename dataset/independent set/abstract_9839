The goal of this paper is to characterize the best achievable performance for
the problem of estimating an unknown parameter having a sparse representation.
Specifically, we consider the setting in which a sparsely representable
deterministic parameter vector is to be estimated from measurements corrupted
by Gaussian noise, and derive a lower bound on the mean-squared error (MSE)
achievable in this setting. To this end, an appropriate definition of bias in
the sparse setting is developed, and the constrained Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is
obtained. This bound is shown to equal the CRB of an estimator with knowledge
of the support set, for almost all feasible parameter values. Consequently, in
the unbiased case, our bound is identical to the MSE of the oracle estimator.
Combined with the fact that the CRB is achieved at high signal-to-noise ratios
by the maximum likelihood technique, our result provides a new interpretation
for the common practice of using the oracle estimator as a gold standard
against which practical approaches are compared.
