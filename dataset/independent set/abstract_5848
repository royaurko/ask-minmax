We present a method for full spatial phase and amplitude control of a laser
beam using a twisted nematic liquid crystal display combined with a spatial
filter. By spatial filtering we combine four neighboring pixels into one
superpixel. At each superpixel we are able to independently modulate the phase
and the amplitude of light. We demonstrate experimentally the independent phase
and amplitude modulation using this novel technique. Our technique does not
impose special requirements on the spatial light modulator and allows precise
control of fields even with imperfect modulators.
