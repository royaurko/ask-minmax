The diffusion of an overdamped Brownian particle in a tilted periodic
potential is known to exhibit a pronounced enhancement over the free thermal
diffusion within a small interval of tilt-values. Here we show that weak
disorder in the form of small, time-independent deviations from a strictly
spatially periodic potential may further boost this diffusion peak by orders of
magnitude. Our general theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with
experimental observations.
