We present a new proof of the Manin-Mumford conjecture about torsion points
on algebraic subvarieties of abelian varieties. Our principle, which admits
other applications, is to view torsion points as rational points on a complex
torus and then compare (i) upper bounds for the number of rational points on a
transcendental analytic variety (Bombieri-Pila-Wilkie) and (ii) lower bounds
for the degree of a torsion point (Masser), after taking conjugates. In order
to be able to deal with (i), we discuss (Thm. 2.1) the semi-algebraic curves
contained in an analytic variety supposed invariant for translations by a full
lattice, which is a topic with some independent motivation.
