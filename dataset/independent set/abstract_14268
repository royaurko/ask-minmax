A radio $k$-labeling of a connected graph $G$ is an assignment $c$ of non
negative integers to the vertices of $G$ such that $$|c(x) - c(y)| \geq k+1 -
d(x,y),$$ for any two vertices $x$ and $y$, $x\ne y$, where $d(x,y)$ is the
distance between $x$ and $y$ in $G$. In this paper, we study radio labelings of
distance graphs, i.e., graphs with the set $\Z$ of integers as vertex set and
in which two distinct vertices $i, j \in \Z$ are adjacent if and only if $|i -
j| \in D$.
