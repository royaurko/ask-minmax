We apply the equivalent theory to orthorhombic anisotropic materials and
provide a general unit-cell design criterion for achieving a length-independent
retrieval of the effective material parameters from a single layer of unit
cells. We introduce a graphical retrieval method and phase unwrapping
techniques. The graphical method utilizes the linear regression technique. Our
method can reduce the uncertainty of experimental measurements and the
ambiguity of phase unwrapping. Moreover, the graphical method can
simultaneously determine the bulk values of the six effective material
parameters, permittivity and permeability tensors, from a single layer of unit
cells.
