We show that there is a polynomial-time approximation scheme for computing
Nash equilibria in anonymous games with any fixed number of strategies (a very
broad and important class of games), extending the two-strategy result of
Daskalakis and Papadimitriou 2007. The approximation guarantee follows from a
probabilistic result of more general interest: The distribution of the sum of n
independent unit vectors with values ranging over {e1, e2, ...,ek}, where ei is
the unit vector along dimension i of the k-dimensional Euclidean space, can be
approximated by the distribution of the sum of another set of independent unit
vectors whose probabilities of obtaining each value are multiples of 1/z for
some integer z, and so that the variational distance of the two distributions
is at most eps, where eps is bounded by an inverse polynomial in z and a
function of k, but with no dependence on n. Our probabilistic result specifies
the construction of a surprisingly sparse eps-cover -- under the total
variation distance -- of the set of distributions of sums of independent unit
vectors, which is of interest on its own right.
