Changes in the transverse momentum distributions with beam energy are studied
using the Tsallis distribution as a parameterization. The dependence of the
Tsallis parameters q, T and the volume on beam energy is determined. The
Tsallis parameter q shows a weak but clear increase with beam energy with the
highest value being approximately 1.15. The Tsallis temperature and volume are
consistent with being independent of beam energy within experimental
uncertainties.
