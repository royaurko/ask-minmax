Model-independent parametrisations of modified gravity have attracted a lot
of attention over the past few years; numerous combinations of experiments and
observables have been suggested to constrain these parameterisations, and
future surveys look very promising. Galaxy Clusters have been mentioned, but
not looked at as extensively in the literature as some other probes. Here we
look at adding Galaxy Clusters into the mix of observables and examine whether
they could improve the constraints on the modified gravity parameters. In
particular, we forecast the constraints from combining the Planck CMB spectrum
and SZ cluster catalogue and a DES-like Weak Lensing survey. We've found that
adding cluster counts improves the constraints obtained from combining CMB and
WL data.
