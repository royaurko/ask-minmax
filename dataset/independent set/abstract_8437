Concepts of graph theory have applications in many areas of computer science
including data mining, image segmentation, clustering, image capturing,
networks, etc . An interval-valued fuzzy set is a generalization of the notion
of a fuzzy set. Interval-valued fuzzy models give more precision, flexibility
and compatibility to the system as compared to the fuzzy models. In this paper,
we introduce the concept of antipodal interval - valued fuzzy graph and self
median interval-valued fuzzy graph of the given interval-valued fuzzy graph. We
investigate isomorphism properties of antipodal interval - valued fuzzy graphs.
