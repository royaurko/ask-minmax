I review the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis within the framework of a
string motivated supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model with large
flavor-independent CP-violating phases. Possible implications for the Higgs
sector are considered in correlation with the properties of the right-handed
stop. I also comment on the compatibility of supersymmetric electroweak
baryogenesis with various CP-violating observables.
