We introduce Smale-Vietoris diffeomorphisms that include the classical
DE-mappings with Smale solenoids. We describe the correspondence between basic
sets of axiom A Smale-Vietoris diffeomorphisms and basic sets of nonsingular
axiom A endomorphisms. For Smale-Vietoris diffeomorphisms of 3-manifolds, we
prove the uniqueness of nontrivial solenoidal basic set. We construct a
bifurcation between different types of solenoidal basic sets which can be
considered as a destruction (or birth) of Smale solenoid.
