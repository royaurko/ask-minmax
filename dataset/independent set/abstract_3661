We have obtained high quality FORS1/VLT optical spectra of 85 disk HII
regions several nearby spiral galaxies. Our sample of metal-rich HII regions
with metallicities close to solar and higher reveal the presence of Wolf-Rayet
(WR) stars in 27 objects from the blue WR bump and 15 additional candidate WR
regions. This provides for the first time a large set of metal-rich WR regions.
  Approximately half of the WR regions also show broad CIV emission attributed
to WR stars of the WC subtype (...). The WR regions show quite clear trends
between their observed WR features and the Hbeta emission line. Detailed
synthesis models are presented to understand/interpret these observations.

  The availability of a fairly large sample of metal-rich WR regions allows us
to improve existing estimates of the upper mass cut-off of the IMF in a robust
way and independently of detailed modeling: from the observed maximum Hbeta
equivalent width of the WR regions we derive a LOWER LIMIT for M_up of 60-90
Msun in the case of a Salpeter slope and larger values for steeper IMF slopes.
  From our direct probe of the massive star content we conclude that there is
at present no evidence for systematic variations of the upper mass cut-off of
the IMF in metal-rich environments, in contrast to some claims based on
indirect nebular diagnostics. (abridged abstract)
