Entropic uncertainty relations, based on sums of entropies of probability
distributions arising from different measurements on a given pure state, can be
seen as a generalization of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation that is in many
cases a more useful way to quantify incompatibility between observables. Of
particular interest are relationships between `mutually unbiased' observables,
which are maximally incompatible. Lower bounds on the sum of entropies for sets
of two such observables, and for complete sets of observables within a space of
given dimension, have been found. This paper explores relations in the
intermediate regime of large, but far from complete, sets of unbiased
observables.
