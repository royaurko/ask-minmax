Monte Carlo simulation provides a powerful tool for understanding and
exploring thermodynamic phase equilibria in many-particle interacting systems.
Among the most physically intuitive simulation methods is Gibbs ensemble Monte
Carlo (GEMC), which allows direct computation of phase coexistence curves of
model fluids by assigning each phase to its own simulation cell. When one or
both of the phases can be modeled virtually via an analytic free energy
function [M. Mehta and D. A. Kofke, Molecular Physics 79, 39 (1993)], the GEMC
method takes on new pedagogical significance as an efficient means of analyzing
fluctuations and illuminating the statistical foundation of phase behavior in
finite systems. Here we extend this virtual GEMC method to binary fluid
mixtures and demonstrate its implementation and instructional value with two
applications: (1) a lattice model of simple mixtures and polymer blends and (2)
a free-volume model of a complex mixture of colloids and polymers. We present
algorithms for performing Monte Carlo trial moves in the virtual Gibbs
ensemble, validate the method by computing fluid demixing phase diagrams, and
analyze the dependence of fluctuations on system size. Our open-source
simulation programs, coded in the platform-independent Java language, are
suitable for use in classroom, tutorial, or computational laboratory settings.
