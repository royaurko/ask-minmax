We have constructed an epsilon-finite basis of master integrals for all new
types of one-scale tadpoles which appear in the calculation of the four-loop
QCD corrections to the electroweak rho-parameter. Using transformation rules
from the epsilon-finite basis to the standard minimal-number-of-lines basis, we
obtain as a by-product analytical expressions for few leading terms of the
epsilon-expansion of all members of the standard basis. The new master
integrals have been computed with the help of the Pade method and by use of
difference equations independently.
