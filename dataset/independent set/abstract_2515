Initially a car is placed with probability p at each site of the
two-dimensional integer lattice. Each car is equally likely to be East-facing
or North-facing, and different sites receive independent assignments. At odd
time steps, each North-facing car moves one unit North if there is a vacant
site for it to move into. At even time steps, East-facing cars move East in the
same way. We prove that when p is sufficiently close to 1 traffic is jammed, in
the sense that no car moves infinitely many times. The result extends to
several variant settings, including a model with cars moving at random times,
and higher dimensions.
