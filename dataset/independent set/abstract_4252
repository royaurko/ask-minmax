The XENON100 experiment is the second phase of the XENON program for the
direct detection of the dark matter in the universe. The XENON100 detector is a
two-phase Time Projection Chamber filled with 161 kg of ultra pure liquid
xenon. The results from 224.6 live days of dark matter search with XENON100 are
presented. No evidence for dark matter in the form of WIMPs is found, excluding
spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross sections above 2 $\times$
10$^{-45}$ cm$^2$ for a 55 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP at 90% confidence level (C.L.). The
most stringent limit is established on the spin-dependent WIMP-neutron
interaction for WIMP masses above 6 GeV/c$^2$, with a minimum cross section of
3.5 $\times$ 10$^{-40}$ cm$^2$ (90% C.L.) for a 45 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP. The same
dataset is used to search for axions and axion-like-particles. The best limits
to date are set on the axion-electron coupling constant for solar axions,
$g_{Ae}$ < 7.7 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ (90% C.L.), and for axion-like-particles,
$g_{Ae}$ < 1 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ (90% C.L.) for masses between 5 and 10
keV/c$^2$.
