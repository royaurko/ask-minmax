This paper investigates a natural generalization of the kappa-mu fading
channel in which the line-of-sight (LOS) component is subject to shadowing.
This fading distribution has a clear physical interpretation, good analytical
properties and unifies the one-side Gaussian, Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Ricean,
kappa-mu and Ricean shadowed fading distributions. The three basic statistical
characterizations, i.e. probability density function (PDF), cumulative
distribution function (CDF) and moment generating function (MGF), of the
kappa-mu shadowed distribution are obtained in closed-form. Then, it is also
shown that the sum and maximum distributions of independent but arbitrarily
distributed kappa-mu shadowed variates can be expressed in closed-form. This
set of new statistical results is finally applied to the performance analysis
of several wireless communication systems.
