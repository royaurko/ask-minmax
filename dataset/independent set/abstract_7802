This paper is concerned with nanowords, a generalization of links, introduced
by Turaev. It is shown that the system of bigraded homology groups is an
invariant of nanowords by introducing a new notion. This paper gives two
examples which show the independence of this invariant from some of Turaev's
homotopy invariants.
