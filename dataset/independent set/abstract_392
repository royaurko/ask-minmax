Setting a proper margin is crucial for not only delivering the required
radiation dose to a target volume, but also reducing the unnecessary radiation
to the adjacent organs at risk. This study investigated the independent
one-dimensional symmetric and asymmetric margins between the clinical target
volume (CTV) and the planning target volume (PTV) for linac-based
single-fraction frameless stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
