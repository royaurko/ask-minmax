Differential operators of Schrodinger type are considered on metric Cayley
graphs of free groups with a minimal set of M generators. The potential and
edge lengths may vary with the M edge types. Using novel methods, a set of M
multipliers depending on the spectral parameter is found. These multipliers are
used to construct the resolvent and characterize the spectrum
