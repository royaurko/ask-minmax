The performance of the V-BLAST approach, which utilizes successive
interference cancellation (SIC) with optimal ordering, over independent
Nakagami-m fading channels is studied. Systems with two transmit and n receive
antennas are employed whereas the potential erroneous decision of SIC is also
considered. In particular, tight closed-form bound expressions are derived in
terms of the average symbol error rate (ASER) and the outage probability, in
case of binary and rectangular M-ary constellation alphabets. The mathematical
analysis is accompanied with selected performance evaluation and numerical
results, which demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.
