We present a method to compute, by numerical simulations of lattice QCD, the
light-cone wave functions which enter exclusive processes at large momentum
transfer, such as electromagnetic elastic scatterings, or exclusive
semi-leptonic decays as B -> pi (B -> rho) and radiative decays as B -> K*
gamma. The method is based on first principles and does not require any model
assumption.
