We present a number of lower bounds for the h-vectors of k-CM, broken circuit
and independence complexes. These lead to bounds on the coefficients of the
characteristic and reliability polynomials of matroids. The main techniques are
the use of series and parallel constructions on matroids and the short
simplicial h-vector for pure complexes.
