The color mixing of mesons propagating in a nucleus is studied with the help
of a color-octet Pomeron partner present in the two-gluon model of the Pomeron.
For a simple model with four meson-nucleon channels, color mixings are found to
be absent for pointlike mesons and very small for small mesons. These results
seem to validate the absorption model with two independent color components
used in recent analyses of the nuclear absorption of $J/\psi$ mesons produced
in nuclear reactions.
