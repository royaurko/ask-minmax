In each Menger manifold $M$ we construct: (i) a closed nowhere dense subset
$M_0$ which is homeomorphic to $M$ and is universal nowhere dense in the sense
that for each nowhere dense set $A\subset M$ there is a homeomorphism $h$ of
$M$ such that $h(A)\subset M_0$; (ii) a meager $F_\sigma$-set $\Sigma_0\subset
M$ which is universal meager in the sense that for each meager subset $B\subset
M$ there is a homeomorphism $h$ of $M$ such that $h(B)\subset \Sigma_0$.
  Also we prove that any two universal meager $F_\sigma$-sets in $M$ are
ambiently homeomorphic.
