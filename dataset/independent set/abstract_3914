From observations collected with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we report the detection of Zeeman signatures on
the low-mass classical TTauri star (cTTS) V2247Oph. Profile distortions and
circular polarisation signatures detected in photospheric lines can be
interpreted as caused by cool spots and magnetic regions at the surface of the
star. The large-scale field is of moderate strength and highly complex;
moreover, both the spot distribution and the magnetic field show significant
variability on a timescale of only one week, as a likely result of strong
differential rotation. Both properties make V2247Oph very different from the
(more massive) prototypical cTTS BPTau; we speculate that this difference
reflects the lower mass of V2247Oph.
  During our observations, V2247Oph was in a low-accretion state, with emission
lines showing only weak levels of circular polarisation; we nevertheless find
that excess emission apparently concentrates in a mid-latitude region of strong
radial field, suggesting that it is the footpoint of an accretion funnel.
  The weaker and more complex field that we report on V2247Oph may share
similarities with those of very-low-mass late-M dwarfs and potentially explain
why low-mass cTTSs rotate on average faster than intermediate mass ones. These
surprising results need confirmation from new independent data sets on V2247Oph
and other similar low-mass cTTSs.
