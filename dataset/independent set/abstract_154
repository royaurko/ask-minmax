The Soft Gamma Repeater 1806-20 produced patterns of bursts during its 1983
outburst that indicate multiple independent energy accumulation sites, each
driven by a continuous power source, with sudden, incomplete releases of the
accumulated energy. The strengths of the power sources and their durations of
activity vary over several orders of magnitude.
