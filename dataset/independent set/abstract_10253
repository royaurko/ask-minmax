Inflationary models predict a definite, model independent, angular dependence
for the three-point correlation function of $\Delta T/T$ at large angles
(greater than $\sim 1^\circ$) which we calculate. The overall amplitude is
model dependent and generically unobservably small, but may be large in some
specific models. We compare our results with other models of nongaussian
fluctuations.
