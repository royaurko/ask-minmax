We present a meta-analysis of independent studies on the potential
implication in the occurrence of coronary heart disease (CHD) of the
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the -308 position of the tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene. We use Bayesian analysis to integrate
independent data sets and to infer statistically robust measurements of
correlation. Bayesian hypothesis testing indicates that there is no preference
for the hypothesis that the -308 TNF-alpha SNP is related to the occurrence of
CHD, in the Caucasian or in the Asian population, over the null hypothesis. As
a measure of correlation, we use the probability of occurrence of CHD
conditional on the presence of the SNP, derived as the posterior probability of
the Bayesian meta-analysis. The conditional probability indicates that CHD is
not more likely to occur when the SNP is present, which suggests that the -308
TNF-alpha SNP is not implicated in the occurrence of CHD.
