We consider diffraction of Delone sets in Euclidean space. We show that the
set of Bragg peaks with high intensity is always Meyer (if it is relatively
dense). We use this to provide a new characterization for Meyer sets in terms
of positive and positive definite measures. Our results are based on a careful
study of positive definite measures, which may be of interest in its own right.
