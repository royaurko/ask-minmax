Dark matter particles that couple primarily to leptons are only weakly
constrained by data from direct detection experiments and the LHC. However,
models of this kind necessarily generate effective four-lepton contact
interactions at the tree- or one-loop-level, which can be probed in $e^+e^-$
collisions. In this work, precise data from LEP is used to derive limits on
leptophilic dark matter in a model-independent framework. The bounds turn out
to be competitive with, and in some cases exceed, limits from mono-photon
events. We also extrapolate our results to ILC energies and luminosities. We
show that ILC data for contact interactions may be able to set the strongest
limits on TeV-scale leptophilic dark matter for couplings $g\gtrsim 1$ of the
mediators.
