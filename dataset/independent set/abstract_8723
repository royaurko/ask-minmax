In this paper I prove that for a polynomial of degree $d$ with a Cantor Julia
set $J$, the Julia set can be understood as the simplest possible quotiont of
the one sided shift space $\Sigma_d$ with dynamics given by the shift. Here
simplest possible means that, the projection $\pi: \Sigma_d \Rightarrow J$ is
as injective as possible.
