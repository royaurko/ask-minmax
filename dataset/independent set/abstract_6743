The ternary Cantor set $C$, constructed by George Cantor in 1883, is probably
the best known example of a perfect nowhere-dense set in the real line, but as
we will see later, it is not the only one. The present article we will explore
the richness, the peculiarities and the generalities that has $C$ and explore
some variants and generalizations of it. For a more systematic treatment the
Cantor like sets we refer to our previous paper.
