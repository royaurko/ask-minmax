CP violation at low energy is investigated at the tau electromagnetic vertex.
High statistics at B factories, and on top of the Upsilon resonances, allows a
detailed investigation of CP-odd observables related to the tau-pair
production. The contribution of the tau electric dipole moment is considered in
detail. We perform an analysis independent from the high energy data by means
of correlation and linear spin observables at low energy. We show that
different CP-odd asymmetries, associated to the normal-transverse and
normal-longitudinal correlation terms can be measured at low energy
accelerators, both at resonant and non resonant energies. These observables
allow to put stringent and independent bounds to the tau electric dipole moment
that are competitive with other high or low energy results.
