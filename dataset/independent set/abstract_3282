The Lonely Runner Conjecture was posed independently by Wills and Cusick and
has many applications in different mathematical fields, such as diophantine
approximation. This well-known conjecture states that for any set of runners
running along the unit circle with constant different speeds and starting at
the same point, there is a moment where all of them are far enough from the
origin. We study the correlation among the time that runners spend close to the
origin. By means of these correlations, we improve a result of Chen on the gap
of loneliness and we extend an invisible runner result of Czerwinski and
Grytczuk. In the last part, we introduce dynamic interval graphs to deal with a
weak version of the conjecture thus providing some new results.
