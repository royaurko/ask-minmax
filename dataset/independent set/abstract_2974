The objective of the paper is to recognize handwritten samples of Roman
numerals using Tesseract open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
engine. Tesseract is trained with data samples of different persons to generate
one user-independent language model, representing the handwritten Roman
digit-set. The system is trained with 1226 digit samples collected form the
different users. The performance is tested on two different datasets, one
consisting of samples collected from the known users (those who prepared the
training data samples) and the other consisting of handwritten data samples of
unknown users. The overall recognition accuracy is obtained as 92.1% and 86.59%
on these test datasets respectively.
