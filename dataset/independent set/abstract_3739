The level surfaces of solutions to the eikonal equation define null or
characteristic surfaces. In this note we study, in Minkowski space, properties
of these surfaces. In particular we are interested both in the singularities of
these ``surfaces'' (which can in general self-intersect and be only piece-wise
smooth) and in the decomposition of the null surfaces into a one parameter
family of two-dimensional wavefronts which can also have self-intersections and
singularities.
  We first review a beautiful method for constructing the general solution to
the flat-space eikonal equation; it allows for solutions either from arbitrary
Cauchy data or for time independent (stationary) solutions of the form
S=t-S_{0}(x,y,z). We then apply this method to obtain global, asymptotically
spherical, null surfaces that are associated with shearing ("bad")
two-dimensional cuts of null infinity; the surfaces are defined from the normal
rays to the cut. This is followed by a study of the caustics and singularities
of these surfaces and those of their associated wavefronts. We then treat the
same set of issues from an alternative point of view, namely from Arnold's
theory of generating families. This treatment allows one to deal
(parametrically) with the regions of self-intersection and non-smoothness of
the null surfaces, regions which are difficult to treat otherwise.
  Finally we generalize the analysis of the singularities to families of
solutions of the eikonal equation.
