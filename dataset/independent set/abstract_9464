We demonstrate that in the back-to-back kinematics the production of four
jets in the collision of two partons is suppressed in the leading log
approximation of pQCD, compared to the hard processes involving the collision
of four partons. We derive the basic equation for four-jet production in QCD in
terms of the convolution of generalized two-parton distributions of colliding
hadrons in the momentum space representation. Our derivation leads to
geometrical approach in the impact parameter space close to that suggested
within the parton model and used before to describe the four-jet production. We
develop the independent parton approximation to the light-cone wave function of
the proton. Comparison with the CDF and D0 data shows that the independent
parton approximation to the light-cone wave function of the proton is
insufficient to explain the data. We argue that the data indicate the presence
of significant multiparton correlations in the light-cone wave functions of
colliding protons.
