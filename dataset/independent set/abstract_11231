Boban Velickovic asked the following question: Is there a nontrivial forcing
notion with the Sacks property which is also ccc? A ``definable'' variant of
this question has been answered in [Sh:480] (math.LO/9303208): Every nontrivial
Souslin forcing notion which has the Sacks property has an uncountable
antichain. Here we show that it is consistent that every nontrivial forcing
notion which has the Sacks property has an uncountable antichain.
Independently, Velickovic has also proved the consistency of this statement.
