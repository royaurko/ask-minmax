This paper concerns the probabilistic evaluation of the effects of actions in
the presence of unmeasured variables. We show that the identification of causal
effect between a singleton variable X and a set of variables Y can be
accomplished systematically, in time polynomial in the number of variables in
the graph. When the causal effect is identifiable, a closed-form expression can
be obtained for the probability that the action will achieve a specified goal,
or a set of goals.
