The decoherence of a qubit due to a classical non-Gaussian noise with
correlation time longer than the decoherence time is discussed for arbitrary
working points of the qubit. A method is developed that allows an exact formula
for the phase memory functional in the presence of independent random telegraph
noise sources to be derived.
