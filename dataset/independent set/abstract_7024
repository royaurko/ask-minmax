In my former paper "A pre-order principle and set-valued Ekeland variational
principle" (see: arXiv: 1311.4951[math.FA]), we established a general pre-order
principle. From the pre-order principle, we deduced most of the known
set-valued Ekeland variational principles (denoted by EVPs) and their
improvements. But the pre-order principle could not imply Khanh and Quy's EVP
in [On generalized Ekeland's variational principle and equivalent formulations
for set-valued mappings, J. Glob. Optim., 49 (2011), 381-396], where the
perturbation contains a weak $\tau$-function. In this paper, we give a revised
version of the pre-order principle. This revised version not only implies the
original pre-order principle, but also can be applied to obtain the above Khanh
and Quy's EVP. Thus, the revised pre-order principle implies all the known
set-valued EVPs in set containing forms (to my knowledge).
