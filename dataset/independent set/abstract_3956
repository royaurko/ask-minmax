Markovian evolving graphs are dynamic-graph models where the links among a
fixed set of nodes change during time according to an arbitrary Markovian rule.
They are extremely general and they can well describe important dynamic-network
scenarios.
  We study the speed of information spreading in the "stationary phase" by
analyzing the completion time of the "flooding mechanism". We prove a general
theorem that establishes an upper bound on flooding time in any stationary
Markovian evolving graph in terms of its node-expansion properties.
  We apply our theorem in two natural and relevant cases of such dynamic
graphs. "Geometric Markovian evolving graphs" where the Markovian behaviour is
yielded by "n" mobile radio stations, with fixed transmission radius, that
perform independent random walks over a square region of the plane.
"Edge-Markovian evolving graphs" where the probability of existence of any edge
at time "t" depends on the existence (or not) of the same edge at time "t-1".
  In both cases, the obtained upper bounds hold "with high probability" and
they are nearly tight. In fact, they turn out to be tight for a large range of
the values of the input parameters. As for geometric Markovian evolving graphs,
our result represents the first analytical upper bound for flooding time on a
class of concrete mobile networks.
