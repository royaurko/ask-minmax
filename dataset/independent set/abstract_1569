A simplicial complex K is called d-representable if it is the nerve of a
collection of convex sets in R^d; K is d-collapsible if it can be reduced to an
empty complex by repeatedly removing a face of dimension at most d-1 that is
contained in a unique maximal face; and K is d-Leray if every induced
subcomplex of K has vanishing homology of dimension d and larger.
  It is known that d-representable implies d-collapsible implies d-Leray, and
no two of these notions coincide for d greater or equal to 2. The famous Helly
theorem and other important results in discrete geometry can be regarded as
results about d-representable complexes, and in many of these results
"d-representable" in the assumption can be replaced by "d-collapsible" or even
"d-Leray".
  We investigate "dimension gaps" among these notions, and we construct, for
all positive integers d, a 2d-Leray complex that is not (3d-1)-collapsible and
a d-collapsible complex that is not (2d-2)-representable. In the proofs we
obtain two results of independent interest: (i) The nerve of every finite
family of sets, each of size at most d, is d-collapsible. (ii) If the nerve of
a simplicial complex K is d-representable, then K embeds in R^d.
