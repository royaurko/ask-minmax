Hereditarily finite (HF) set theory provides a standard universe of sets, but
with no infinite sets. Its utility is demonstrated through a formalisation of
the theory of regular languages and finite automata, including the
Myhill-Nerode theorem and Brzozowski's minimisation algorithm. The states of an
automaton are HF sets, possibly constructed by product, sum, powerset and
similar operations.
