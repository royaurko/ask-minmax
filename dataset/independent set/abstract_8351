We establish a result concerning the so-called Lagrangian controllability of
the Euler equation for incompressible perfect fluids in dimension 3. More
precisely we consider a connected bounded domain of R^3 and two smooth
contractible sets of fluid particles, surrounding the same volume. We prove
that given any initial velocity field, one can find a boundary control and a
time interval such that the corresponding solution of the Euler equation makes
the first of the two sets approximately reach the second one.
