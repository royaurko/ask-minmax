Using the de Sitter/CFT correspondence we describe a scenario of holographic
inflation which is driven by a three dimensional boundary field theory. We find
that inflationary constraints severely restrict the $\beta$--function, the
anomalous dimensions and the value of the $C$--function of the boundary theory.
The scenario has model independent predictions such as $\epsilon<< \eta$,
$n_T<0.04$, $P_{tensor}/P_{scalar}<0.08$ and $H<10^{14} GeV$. We consider some
simple boundary theories and find that they do not lead to inflation. Thus,
building an acceptable holographic inflation model remains a challenge. We also
describe holographic quintessence and find that it closely resembles a
cosmological constant.
