We present results of the multicolour UBVR photometry of the high-amplitude
EC14026-type star, Balloon 090100001. The data span over a month and consist of
more than a hundred hours of observations. Fourier analysis of these data led
us to the detection of at least 30 modes of pulsation of which 22 are
independent. The frequencies of 13 detected modes group in three narrow ranges,
around 2.8, 3.8 and 4.7 mHz, where the radial fundamental mode, the first and
second overtones are likely to occur. Surprisingly, we also detect 9
independent modes in the low-frequency domain, between 0.15 and 0.4 mHz. These
modes are typical for pulsations found in PG1716+426-type stars, discovered
recently among cool B-type subdwarfs. The modes found in these stars are
attributed to the high-order g modes. As both kinds of pulsations are observed
in Balloon 090100001, it represents a link between the two classes of pulsating
hot subdwarfs. At present, it is probably the most suitable target for testing
evolutionary scenarios and internal constitution models of these stars by means
of asteroseismology.
  Three of the modes we discovered form an equidistant frequency triplet which
can be explained by invoking rotational splitting of an $\ell$ = 1 mode. The
splitting amounts to about 1.58 $\mu$Hz, leading to a rotation period of 7.1
$\pm$ 0.1 days.
