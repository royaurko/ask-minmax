The pion-mass dependence of the nucleon mass within the covariant SU(2)
baryon chiral perturbation theory both without and with explicit Delta(1232)
degrees of freedom up to order p^4 is investigated. By fitting to lattice QCD
data in 2 and 2+1 flavors from several collaborations, for pion masses M_pi <
420 MeV, we obtain low energy constants of natural size and compatible with
pion nucleon scattering data. Our results are consistent with the rather linear
pion-mass dependence showed by lattice QCD. In the 2 flavor case we have also
performed simultaneous fits to the nucleon mass and pion-nucleon sigma-term
data. As a result of our analysis, which encompasses the study of finite volume
corrections and discretization effects, we report a value for the pion-nucleon
sigma-term of 41(5)(4) MeV in the 2 flavor case and 52(3)(8) MeV for 2+1
flavors, where the inclusion of the Delta(1232) resonance changes the results
by around 9 MeV. In the 2 flavor case we are able to set independently the
scale for lQCD data, given by a Sommer scale of r_0=0.493(23) fm.
