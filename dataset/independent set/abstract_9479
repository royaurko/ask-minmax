We calculate the model-independent radiative corrections to the Dalitz plot
of K_{l3}^\pm decays to order (\alpha/\pi)(q/M_1), where q is the momentum
transfer and M_1 is the mass of the kaon. The final results are presented,
first, with the triple integration over the variables of the bremsstrahlung
photon ready to be performed numerically and, second, in an analytical form.
These two forms are useful to crosscheck on one another and with other
calculations. This paper is organized to make it accessible and reliable in the
analysis of the Dalitz plot of precision experiments and is not compromised to
fixing the form factors at predetermined values. It is assumed that the real
photons are kinematically discriminated. Otherwise, our results have a general
model-independent applicability.
