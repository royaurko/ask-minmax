Using quadratic spinor techniques we demonstrate that the Immirzi parameter
can be expressed as ratio between scalar and pseudo-scalar contributions in the
theory and can be interpreted as a measure of how Einstein gravity differs from
a generally constructed covariant theory for gravity. This interpretation is
independent of how gravity is quantized. One of the important advantage of
deriving the Immirzi parameter using the quadratic spinor techniques is to
allow the introduction of renormalization scale associated with the Immirzi
parameter through the expectation value of the spinor field upon quantization.
