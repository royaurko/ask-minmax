We test against two different sets of data an apparently new approach to the
analysis of the variance of a numerical variable which depends on qualitative
characters. We suggest that this approach be used to complement other existing
techniques to study the interdependence of the variables involved. According to
our method the variance is expressed as a sum of orthogonal components,
obtained as differences of conditional means, with respect to the qualitative
characters. The resulting expression for the variance depends on the ordering
in which the characters are considered. We suggest an algorithm which leads to
an ordering which is deemed natural. The first set of data concerns the score
achieved by a population of students, on an entrance examination, based on a
multiple choice test with 30 questions. In this case the qualitative characters
are dyadic and correspond to correct or incorrect answer to each question. The
second set of data concerns the delay in obtaining the degree for a population
of graduates of Italian universities. The variance in this case is analyzed
with respect to a set of seven specific qualitative characters of the
population studied (gender, previous education, working condition, parent's
educational level, field of study, etc.)
