We study admissibility of inference rules and unification with parameters in
transitive modal logics (extensions of K4), in particular we generalize various
results on parameter-free admissibility and unification to the setting with
parameters.
  Specifically, we give a characterization of projective formulas generalizing
Ghilardi's characterization in the parameter-free case, leading to new proofs
of Rybakov's results that admissibility with parameters is decidable and
unification is finitary for logics satisfying suitable frame extension
properties (called cluster-extensible logics in this paper). We construct
explicit bases of admissible rules with parameters for cluster-extensible
logics, and give their semantic description. We show that in the case of
finitely many parameters, these logics have independent bases of admissible
rules, and determine which logics have finite bases.
  As a sideline, we show that cluster-extensible logics have various nice
properties: in particular, they are finitely axiomatizable, and have an
exponential-size model property. We also give a rather general characterization
of logics with directed (filtering) unification.
  In the sequel, we will use the same machinery to investigate the
computational complexity of admissibility and unification with parameters in
cluster-extensible logics, and we will adapt the results to logics with unique
top cluster (e.g., S4.2) and superintuitionistic logics.
