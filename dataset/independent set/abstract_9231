We present the first measurements of the \vec{e}p->epg cross section in the
deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) regime and the valence quark region.
The Q^2 dependence (from 1.5 to 2.3 GeV^2) of the helicity-dependent cross
section indicates the twist-2 dominance of DVCS, proving that generalized
parton distributions (GPDs) are accessible to experiment at moderate Q^2. The
helicity-independent cross section is also measured at Q^2=2.3 GeV^2. We
present the first model-independent measurement of linear combinations of GPDs
and GPD integrals up to the twist-3 approximation.
