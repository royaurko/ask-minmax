Process migration refers to the act of transferring a process in the middle
of its execution from one machine to another in a network. In this paper, we
proposed a process migration framework for Linux OS. It is a multilayer
architecture to confine every functionality independent section of the system
in separate layer. This architecture is capable of supporting diverse
applications due to generic user space interface and dynamic structure that can
be modified according to demands.
