We show how two frequency combs $\mathcal{E}_1$, $\mathcal{E}_2$ can be used
to measure single-photon, two-photon absorption (TPA), and Raman resonances in
a molecule with three electronic bands, by detecting the radio frequency
modulation of the nonlinear transmission signal. Some peaks are independent of
the carrier frequency of the comb and others shift with that frequency and have
a width close to the comb width. TPA and Raman resonances independent of the
carrier frequency are selected by measuring the transmission signal
$\sim\mathcal{E}_1^2 \mathcal{E}_2^2$ and the single-photon resonances are
selected by measuring the transmission signal
$\sim\mathcal{E}_1^3\mathcal{E}_2$. Sinusoidal spectral phase shaping strongly
affects the TPA, but not the Raman resonances.
