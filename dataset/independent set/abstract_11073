Spin-dependent and spin-independent quark light-cone momentum distributions
and structure functions are calculated for the nucleon. We utilize a modified
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in which confinement is simulated by eliminating
unphysical thresholds for nucleon decay into quarks. The nucleon bound state is
obtained by solving the Faddeev equation in the quark-diquark approximation,
where both scalar and axial-vector diquark channels are included. We find
excellent agreement between our model results and empirical data.
