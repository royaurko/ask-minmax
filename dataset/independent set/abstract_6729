We study the family of renormalization transformations of the generalized
$d$--dimensional diamond hierarchical Potts model in statistical mechanic and
prove that their Julia sets and non-escaping loci are always connected, where
$d\geq 2$. In particular, we prove that their Julia sets can never be a
Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet if the parameter is real. We show that the Julia set is a
quasicircle if and only if the parameter lies in the unbounded capture domain
of these models. Moreover, the asymptotic formula of the Hausdorff dimension of
the Julia set is calculated as the parameter tends to infinity.
