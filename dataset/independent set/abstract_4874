In this paper, firstly we propose two new concepts concerning the notion of
key escrow encryption schemes: provable partiality and independency. Roughly
speaking we say that a scheme has provable partiality if existing polynomial
time algorithm for recovering the secret knowing escrowed information implies a
polynomial time algorithm that can solve a well-known intractable problem. In
addition, we say that a scheme is independent if the secret key and the
escrowed information are independent. Finally, we propose a new verifiable
partial key escrow, which has both of above criteria. The new scheme use
McCurley encryption scheme as underlying scheme.
