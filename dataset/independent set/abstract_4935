How low can be the joint entropy of $n$ locally-independent (i.e., $d$-wise
independent for $d\ge2$) Bernoulli variables? This question has been posed and
partially answered in a recent work of Babai. In this paper we improve some of
his bounds, prove new bounds in a wider range of parameters and show matching
upper bounds in some special cases. In particular, we prove tight lower bounds
for the min-entropy for pair-wise and three-wise balanced Bernoulli trials for
infinitely many values of $n$.
