We determine the complete set of independent gauge and gauge-Higgs CP-odd
effective operators for the generic case of a dynamical Higgs, up to four
derivatives in the chiral expansion. The relation with the linear basis of
dimension six CP-odd operators is clarified. Phenomenological applications
include bounds inferred from electric dipole moment limits, and from present
and future collider data on triple gauge coupling measurements and Higgs
signals.
