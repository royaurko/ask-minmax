We explore the capability of the IceCube/Deepcore array to discover signal
neutrinos resulting from the annihilations of Supersymmetric WIMPS that may be
captured in the solar core. In this analysis, we use a previously generated set
of /sim 70k model points in the 19-dimensional parameter space of the pMSSM
which satisfy existing experimental and theoretical constraints. Our
calculations employ a realistic estimate of the IceCube/DeepCore effective area
that has been modeled by the IceCube collaboration. We find that a large
fraction of the pMSSM models are shown to have significant signal rates in the
anticipated IceCube/DeepCore 1825 day dataset, including some prospects for an
early discovery. Many models where the LSP only constitutes a small fraction of
the total dark matter relic density are found to have observable rates. We
investigate in detail the dependence of the signal neutrino fluxes on the LSP
mass, weak eigenstate composition, annihilation products and thermal relic
density, as well as on the spin-independent and spin-dependent scattering cross
sections. Lastly, We compare the model coverage of IceCube/DeepCore to that
obtainable in near-future direct detection experiments and to pMSSM searches at
the 7 TeV LHC.
