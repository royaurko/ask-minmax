We study a class of conditional independence models for discrete data with
the property that one or more log-linear interactions are defined within two
different marginal distributions and then constrained to 0; all the conditional
independence models which are known to be non smooth belong to this class. We
introduce a new marginal log-linear parameterization and show that smoothness
may be restored by restricting one or more independence statements to hold
conditionally to a restricted subset of the configurations of the conditioning
variables. Our results are based on a specific reconstruction algorithm from
log-linear parameters to probabilities and fixed point theory. Several examples
are examined and a general rule for determining the implied conditional
independence restrictions is outlined.
