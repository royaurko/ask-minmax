In this article we study Cantor sets defined by monotone sequences, in the
sense of Besicovitch and Taylor. We classify these Cantor sets in terms of
their h-Hausdorff and h-Packing measures, for the family of dimension functions
h, and characterize this classification in terms of the underlying sequences.
