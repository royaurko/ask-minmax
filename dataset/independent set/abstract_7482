We analyze the phase stability and the response of a mixture of bosons and
spin-polarized fermions in one dimension (1D). Unlike in 3D, phase separation
happens for low fermion densities. The dynamics of the mixture at low energy is
independent of the spin-statistics of the components, and zero-sound-like modes
exist that are essentially undamped.
