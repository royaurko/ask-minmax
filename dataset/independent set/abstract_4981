We work with two general factorization schemes in order to explore the
consequences of imposing scheme independence on $g_1^p (x, Q^2)$. We see that
although the light quark sector is indifferent to the choice of a particular
scheme, the extension of the calculations to the heavy quark sector indicates
that a scheme like the $\bar{MS}$ is preferable.
