An $\infty$-step nilsystem is an inverse limit of minimal nilsystems. In this
article is shown that a minimal distal system is an $\infty$-step nilsystem if
and only if it has no nontrivial pairs with arbitrarily long finite
IP-independence sets. Moreover, it is proved that any minimal system without
nontrivial pairs with arbitrarily long finite IP-independence sets is an almost
one to one extension of its maximal $\infty$-step nilfactor, and each invariant
ergodic measure is isomorphic (in the measurable sense) to the Haar measure on
some $\infty$-step nilsystem. The question if such a system is uniquely ergodic
remains open. In addition, the topological complexity of an $\infty$-step
nilsystem is computed, showing that it is polynomial for each nontrivial open
cover.
