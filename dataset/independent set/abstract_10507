We present a general molecular-dynamics simulation scheme, based on the Nose'
thermostat, for sampling according to arbitrary phase space distributions. We
formulate numerical methods based on both Nose'-Hoover and Nose'-Poincare'
thermostats for two specific classes of distributions; namely, those that are
functions of the system Hamiltonian and those for which position and momentum
are statistically independent. As an example, we propose a generalized variable
temperature distribution that designed to accelerate sampling in molecular
systems.
