The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) has already measured over 200,000
redshifts of nearby (median redshift z~0.1) galaxies. This is the single
largest set of galaxy spectra ever collected. It allows us to subdivide the
survey into subsets according to the galaxy intrinsic properties. We outline
here a method (based on Principal Component Analysis) for spectrally
classifying these galaxies in a robust and independent manner. In so doing we
develop a continuous measure of spectral type, eta, which reflects the actual
distribution of spectra in the observed galaxy population. We demonstrate the
usefulness of this classification by estimating luminosity functions and
clustering per spectral type.
