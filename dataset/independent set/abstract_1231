Myers-Perry-AdS-dS black hole exhibits SO(2,1)xU(n) symmetry in the near
horizon limit in the special case that all rotation parameters are equal. We
consider a massive relativistic particle propagating on such a background and
reduce it to superintegrable spherical mechanics with U(n) symmetry. A complete
set of functionally independent u(n) generators realized in the model is given.
