I present a definition of the cross section for the production of an isolated
photon plus $n$ jets which only depends upon direct photon production, and it
is independent of the parton-to-photon fragmentation contribution. This
prescription, based on a modified cone approach which implements the isolation
condition in a smooth way, treats in the same way quarks and gluons and can be
directly applied to experimental data in hadron-hadron, photon-hadron and
$\epem$ collisions. The case of several, isolated photons in the final state
can also be dealt with in the very same way.
