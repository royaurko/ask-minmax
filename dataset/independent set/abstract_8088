The asymptotic normalisation coefficients (ANC) for the vertex $^{10}$B $\to$
$^9$Be + p is deduced from a set of different proton transfer reactions at
different energies. This set should ensure the peripheral character of the
reaction and availability of data for the elastic channels. The problems
associated with the characteristics of the data and the analysis are discussed.
For a subgroup of the set of available data, the uniqueness property of the
extracted ANC is fulfilled. However, more measurements are needed before a
definite conclusion can be drawn.
