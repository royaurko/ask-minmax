The intermediate and late-time behaviour of a massive Dirac field in the
background of static spherically symmetric black hole solutions is
investigated. The intermediate asymptotic behaviour of a massive Dirac field
depends on the mass parameter as well as the wave number of the mode, while the
late time behaviour has a power law decay rate independent of both.
