We show that the operations addition and multiplication on the set
$C(\Omega)$ of all real continuous functions on $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$
can be extended to the set $\mathbb{H}(\Omega)$ of all Hausdorff continuous
interval functions on $\Omega$ in such a way that the algebraic structure of
$C(\Omega)$ is preserved, namely, $\mathbb{H}(\Omega)$ is a commutative ring
with identity. The operations on $\mathbb{H}(\Omega)$ are defined in three
different but equivalent ways. This allow us to look at these operations from
different points of view as well as to show that they are naturally associated
with the Hausdorff continuous functions.
