Multiparticle production of charged particles at high energies exhibit the
phenomenon of Limiting Fragmentation. Furthermore, the region in rapidity over
which the production of particles appears to be independent of energy,
increases with energy. It is argued that this phenomenon, known as Extended
Longitudinal Scaling, is a direct manifestation of some kind of saturation,
akin to that in the Color Glass Condensate picture of particle production.
