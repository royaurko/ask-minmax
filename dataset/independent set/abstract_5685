A microscopic theory for equilibrium and non equilibrium relaxations in
structural glasses is formulated. For all temperatures below the glass
transition the dynamics can be asymptotically separated in a $\beta $ -
relaxation regime, which connects a quasi equilibrium with the aging regime and
the aging regime. In the $\beta$ - relaxation regime dynamic correlation are
independent from spatial correlations. This is due to a self organized critical
bifurcation scenario, which gives rise to one dynamic power law and a
logarithmic law. It is shown that the fluctuation dissipation ratio in the
aging regime is a universal property of the system independent from spatial
scales.
