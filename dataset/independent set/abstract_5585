Motivated by the problem of dealing with incomplete or imprecise acquisition
of data in computer vision and computer graphics, we extend results concerning
the stability of persistent homology with respect to function perturbations to
results concerning the stability with respect to domain perturbations. Domain
perturbations can be measured in a number of different ways. An important
method to compare domains is the Hausdorff distance. We show that by encoding
sets using the distance function, the multidimensional matching distance
between rank invariants of persistent homology groups is always upperly bounded
by the Hausdorff distance between sets. Moreover we prove that our construction
maintains information about the original set. Other well known methods to
compare sets are considered, such as the symmetric difference distance between
classical sets and the sup-distance between fuzzy sets. Also in these cases we
present results stating that the multidimensional matching distance between
rank invariants of persistent homology groups is upperly bounded by these
distances. An experiment showing the potential of our approach concludes the
paper.
