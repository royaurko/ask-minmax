Recent discoveries of the Xi_b, Sigma_b and Sigma_b^* baryons at the Tevatron
are in good agreement with model-independent mass predictions made a decade ago
based on a combined expansion in 1/N_c, 1/m_Q and SU(3) flavor symmetry
breaking. Using the new experimental data as input, mass predictions for the
undiscovered bottom baryons Xi_b^\prime, Xi_b^*, Omega_b and Omega_b^* and for
many unmeasured bottom baryon mass splittings are updated. The observed ground
state charm baryons exhibit the mass hierarchy previously predicted by the
1/N_c, 1/m_Q and SU(3) flavor breaking expansion.
