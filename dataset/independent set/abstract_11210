We consider solutions of six dimensional Einstein equations with two compact
dimensions. It is shown that one can introduce 3-branes in this background in
such a way that the effective four dimensional cosmological constant is
completely independent of the brane tensions. These tensions are completely
arbitrary, without requiring any fine tuning. We must, however, fine tune bulk
parameters in order to obtain a sufficiently small value for the observable
cosmological constant. We comment in the effective four dimensional description
of this effect at energies below the compactification scale.
