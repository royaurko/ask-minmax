We present a fully perturbative mechanism that naturally generates mass
hierarchies for the Standard Model (SM) fermions in a flavor-blind sector. The
dynamics generating the mass hierarchies can therefore be independent from the
source of flavor violation, and may operate at a much lower scale. This
mechanism operates by dynamically enforcing simultaneous diagonalization -
alignment - among a set of flavor-breaking spurions, as well as generating
highly singular spectra for them. It also has general applications in model
building beyond the SM, wherever alignment between exotic and SM sources of
flavor violation is desired.
