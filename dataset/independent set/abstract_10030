Assuming a random uniform distribution of n sensor nodes over a virtual grid,
this paper addresses the problem of finding the maximum number of connected set
covers each ensuring 100% coverage of the query region. The connected sets
remain active one after another in a round robin fashion such that if there are
P such set covers, it can enhance the network lifetime P-fold. From
graph-theoretic point of view, a centralized O(n3) heuristic is proposed here
to maximize P. Next, for large self-organized sensor networks, a distributed
algorithm is developed. The proposed algorithm is to be executed just once,
during the initialization of the network. In case of failure, a distributed
recovery algorithm is executed to rearrange the partitions. Simulation studies
show that the performance of the proposed distributed algorithm is comparable
with that of the centralized algorithm in terms of number of partitions. Also,
comparison with earlier works shows significant improvement in terms of number
of partitions, message complexity and network lifetime.
