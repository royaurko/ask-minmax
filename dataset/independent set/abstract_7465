In the pressure range 5-12 GPa the fractional valence of cerium is
independent of pressure because of the coexistence of two or more structural
phases. The observation of a single crystallographic structure in this pressure
range arises from a non-equilibrium situation induced by the initial conditions
of the high pressure experiment.
