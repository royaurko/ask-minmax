Getoor's conjecture that essentially all Levy processes satisfy (H) is a
long-standing open problem in potential theory. In the beginning of the paper,
we summarize the main results obtained so far for the problem. Then, we present
two new necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of (H).
Furthermore, we give applications of these new criteria. First, we give
explicit constructions of Levy processes satisfying (H) in a context where
previously known results could not be applied. Second, we show that a large
class of pure jump subordinators can be decomposed into the summation of two
independent subordinators such that both of them satisfy (H).
