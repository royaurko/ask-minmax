We consider the self-normalized sums
$T_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}Y_{i}/\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}$, where ${Y_{i} : i\geq 1}$
are non-negative i.i.d. random variables, and ${X_{i} : i\geq 1} $ are i.i.d.
random variables, independent of ${Y_{i} : i \geq 1}$. The main result of the
paper is that each subsequential limit law of T_n$ is continuous for any
non-degenerate $X_1$ with finite expectation, if and only if $Y_1$ is in the
centered Feller class.
