We study the behaviour of the spectrum of a family of one-dimensional
operators with periodic high-contrast coefficients as the period goes to zero,
which may represent e.g. the elastic or electromagnetic response of a
two-component composite medium. Compared to the standard operators with
moderate contrast, they exhibit a number of new effects due to the underlying
non-uniform ellipticity of the family. The effective behaviour of such media in
the vanishing period limit also differs notably from that of multi-dimensional
models investigated thus far by other contributors, due to the fact that neither
component of the composite forms a connected set. We then discuss a modified
problem, where the equation coefficient is set to a positive constant on an
interval that is independent of the period. Formal asymptotic analysis and
numerical tests with finite elements suggest the existence of localised
eigenfunctions ("defect modes"), whose eigenvalues situated in the gaps of the
limit spectrum for the unperturbed problem.
