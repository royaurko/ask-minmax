We construct an iterated stochastic integral with fractional Brownian motion
with H > 1/2. The first integrand is a deterministic function, and each
successive integral is with respect to an independent fBm. We show that this
symmetric stochastic integral is equal to the Malliavin divergence integral. By
a version of the Fourth Moment theorem of Nualart and Peccati, we show that a
family of such integrals converges in distribution to a scaled Brownian motion.
An application is an approximation to the windings for a planar fBm, previously
studied by Baudoin and Nualart.
