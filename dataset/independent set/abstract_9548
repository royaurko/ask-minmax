We prove the removal singularity results for maps with bounded energy from
the unit disk $B$ of $R^2$ centered at the origin to a closed Riemannian
manifold whose tension field is unbounded in $L^2(B)$ but satisfies the
following condition: {eqnarray*}
  (\int_{B_t\setminus B_{\frac{t}{2}}}|\tau(u)|^2)^1/2\leq C_1(\frac{1}{t})^a,
{eqnarray*} for some $0<a<1$ and for any $0<t<1$, where $C_1$ is a constant
independent of $t$.
  We will also prove that if a sequence $\{u_n\}$ has uniformly bounded energy
and satisfies {eqnarray*}
  (\int_{B_t\setminus B_{\frac{t}{2}}}|\tau(u_n)|^2)^1/2\leq
C_2(\frac{1}{t})^a,
  {eqnarray*} for some $0<a<1$ and for any $0<t<1$, where $C_2$ is a constant
independent of $n$ and $t$, then the energy identity holds for this sequence
and there will be no neck formation during the blow up process.
