All possible linearly independent local conservation laws for $n$-dimensional
diffusion--convection equations $u_t=(A(u))_{ii}+(B^i(u))_i$ were constructed
using the direct method and the composite variational principle. Application of
the method of classification of conservation laws with respect to the group of
point transformations [R.O. Popovych, N.M. Ivanova, J. Math. Phys., 2005, V.46,
043502 (math-ph/0407008)] allows us to formulate the result in explicit closed
form. Action of the symmetry groups on the conservation laws of diffusion
equations is investigated and generating sets of conservation laws are
constructed.
