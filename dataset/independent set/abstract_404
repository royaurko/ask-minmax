Our main result is that, given a collection $\mathcal{R}$ of meager relations
on a Polish space $X$ such that $|\mathcal{R}|\leq\omega$, there exists a dense
Baire subspace $F$ of $X$ (equivalently, a nowhere meager subset of $X$) such
that $F$ is $R$-free for every $R\in\mathcal{R}$. This generalizes a recent
result of Banakh and Zdomskyy. Furthermore, assuming Martin's Axiom for
countable posets, our result can be strengthened by substituting
"$|\mathcal{R}|\leq\omega$" with "$|\mathcal{R}|<\mathfrak{c}$" and "Baire"
with "completely Baire". As an application, we show that there exists a
non-meager independent family on $\omega$, and define the corresponding
cardinal invariant.
