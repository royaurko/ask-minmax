The present work considers the phase transition between the confinement and
"Coulomb" phases in U(1), SU(2) and SU(3)-sectors of Anti-grand unified theory
described by regularized Wilson loop action. It was shown the independence of
the critical coupling constants of the regularization method ("universality").
