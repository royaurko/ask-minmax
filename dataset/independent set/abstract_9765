In this note we present some results concerning the concentration of
sequences of first eigenfunctions on the limit sets of a Morse-Smale dynamical
system on a compact Riemanniann manifold. More precisely a renormalized
sequence of eigenfunctions converges to a measure $\mu$ concentrated on the
hyperbolic sets of the field. The set of all possible measure turns out to be a
sum of a finite Dirac distributions localized at the critical point of the
field and absolutely continuous measure with respect to the Lebesgue measure on
each limit cycles : the coefficients which appear in the limit measure can be
characterized using the concentration theory. In the second part, certain
aspects of some first order PDE on manifolds are studied. We study the limit of
a sequence solutions of a second order PDE, when a parameter of viscosity tends
to zero. Under some explicit assumptions on some vector fields, bounded and
differentiable solutions are obtained. We exibit the role played by the limit
sets of the dynamical systems and provide in some cases an explicit
representation formula.
