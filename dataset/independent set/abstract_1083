We provide a new, independent, and analytic estimate of the lowest glueball
mass, and we found it at 1661 MeV within a relativistic quantum-field model
based on analytic confinement. The conventional mesons and the weak decay
constants are described to extend the consideration. For the spectra of
two-gluon and two-quark bound states we solve the ladder Bethe-Salpeter
equation. By using a minimal set of model parameters (the quark masses, the
coupling constant, and the confinement scale) we obtain numerical results which
are in reasonable agreement with experimental evidence in the wide range of
energy scale. The model serves a reasonable framework to describe
simultaneously different sectors in low-energy particle physics.
