We investigate soft gluon radiation off a quark-antiquark antenna in both
color singlet and octet configurations traversing a dense medium. We
demonstrate that, in both cases, multiple scatterings lead to a gradual
decoherence of the antenna radiation as a function of the medium density. In
particular, in the limit of an completely opaque medium, total decoherence is
obtained, i.e., the quark and the antiquark radiate as independent emitters in
vacuum, thus losing memory of their origin. We comment on possible implications
on intrajet observables in heavy-ion collisions.
