Recently, it has shown that an explicit local realistic model for the values
of a correlation function, given in a two-setting Bell experiment (two-setting
model), works only for the specific set of settings in the given experiment,
but cannot construct a local realistic model for the values of a correlation
function, given in a {\it continuous-infinite} settings Bell experiment
(infinite-setting model), even though there exist two-setting models for all
directions in space. Hence, two-setting model does not have the property which
infinite-setting model has. Here, we show that an explicit two-setting model
cannot construct a local realistic model for the values of a correlation
function, given in a {\it only discrete-three} settings Bell experiment
(three-setting model), even though there exist two-setting models for the three
measurement directions chosen in the given three-setting experiment. Hence,
two-setting model does not have the property which three-setting model has.
