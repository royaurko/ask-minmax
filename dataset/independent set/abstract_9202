We further develop an algorithmic and diagrammatic computational framework
for very general exact renormalization groups, where the embedded
regularisation scheme, parametrised by a general cutoff function and infinitely
many higher point vertices, is left unspecified. Calculations proceed
iteratively,by integrating by parts with respect to the effective cutoff, thus
introducing effective propagators, and differentials of vertices that can be
expanded using the flow equations; many cancellations occur on using the fact
that the effective propagator is the inverse of the classical Wilsonian
two-point vertex. We demonstrate the power of these methods by computing the
beta function up to two loops in massless four dimensional scalar field theory,
obtaining the expected universal coefficients, independent of the details of
the regularisation scheme.
