In this paper we introduce a new kind of Lax-Oleinik type operator with
parameters associated with positive definite Lagrangian systems for both the
time-periodic case and the time-independent case. On one hand, the new family
of Lax-Oleinik type operators with an arbitrary $u\in C(M,\mathbb{R}^1)$ as
initial condition converges to a backward weak KAM solution in the
time-periodic case, while it was shown by Fathi and Mather that there is no
such convergence of the Lax-Oleinik semigroup. On the other hand, the new
family of Lax-Oleinik type operators with an arbitrary $u\in C(M,\mathbb{R}^1)$
as initial condition converges to a backward weak KAM solution faster than the
Lax-Oleinik semigroup in the time-independent case.
