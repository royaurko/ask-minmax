Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is a key concept in evolutionary game
theory. ESS provides an evolutionary stability criterion for biological, social
and economic behaviors. In this paper, a method is developed to evaluate ESS in
symmetric two-person games with fuzzy payoffs. Every strategy is assigned a
membership that describes to what extent it is an ESS. The fuzzy set of ESS can
characterize the nature of ESS, and also gives a ranking of the stablest
strategies. This method uses the satisfaction function to compare fuzzy
payoffs, and adopts the fuzzy decision rule to obtain the membership function
of the fuzzy ESS set. The relation between fuzzy ESS and fuzzy Nash equilibrium
is also explored. In a symmetric two-person game, the fuzzy ESS set is a subset
of the fuzzy symmetric Nash equilibrium set. The numeric results are congruous
as expected, therefore this method to evaluate and compare ESSs is appropriate
for fuzzy payoff games.
