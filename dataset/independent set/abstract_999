We show that if $\phi$ is a continuous, minimally supported prescale
function, then its translates are linearly independent on any set of positive
measure in the unit interval. This generalizes results of Y. Meyer and P. G.
Lemarie.
  This result implies that a stability condition, introduced by Gundy and
Kazarian for the study of local convergence of spline wavelet expansions, is
satisfied for all expansions arizing from multiresolution analyses generated by
such prescale functions $\phi$.
