We investigate the universality of singular value and eigenvalue
distributions of matrix valued functions of independent random matrices and
apply these general results in several examples. In particular we determine the
limit distribution and prove universality under general conditions for singular
value and eigenvalue distributions of products of independent matrices from
spherical ensembles.
