For any irrational cut-and-project setup, we demonstrate a natural infinite
family of windows which gives rise to separated nets that are each bounded
distance to a lattice. Our proof provides a new construction, using a
sufficient condition of Rauzy, of an infinite family of non-trivial bounded
remainder sets for any totally irrational toral rotation in any dimension.
