Given a cardinal $\kappa$ and a sequence $\left(\alpha_i\right)_{i\in\kappa}$
of ordinals, we determine the least ordinal $\beta$ (when one exists) such that
the topological partition relation
\[\beta\rightarrow\left(top\,\alpha_i\right)^1_{i\in\kappa}\] holds, including
an independence result for one class of cases. Here the prefix "$top$" means
that the homogeneous set must be of the correct homeomorphism class rather than
the correct order type. The answer is linked to the non-topological pigeonhole
principle of Milner and Rado.
