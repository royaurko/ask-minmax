We present a search for Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles predicted by models with
universal extra dimensions (UED) using a data set corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 7.3 fb$^{-1}$, collected by the D0 detector at a
$p\bar p$ center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The decay chain of KK particles
can lead to a final state with two muons of the same charge. This signature is
used to set a lower limit on the compactification scale of $R^{-1}>260$ GeV in
a minimal UED model.
