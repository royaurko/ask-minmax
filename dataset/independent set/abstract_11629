The invariance of the phase of plane waves among inertial frames is
investigated in some details. The reason that eventually led the contributor of a
recent EPL letter [EPL \textbf{79}, 1006 (2007)] to a spurious conclusion of
the non-invariance of the phase of waves has been identified -- it is the
ignorance of the effect of relativistically-induced optical anisotropy in the
analysis of the problem. It is argued that the Lorentz-invariant expression for
the phase of waves should be taken in the form $\Phi=\mathbf{k\cdot
r}-\mathbf{k\cdot u}/c$, instead of the widely-used expression
$\Phi=\mathbf{k\cdot r}-\omega t$ which has a limited validity.
