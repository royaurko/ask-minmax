Using a class of permutation polynomials of $F_{3^{2h+1}}$ obtained from the
Ree-Tits symplectic spreads in $PG(3,3^{2h+1})$, we construct a family of skew
Hadamard difference sets in the additive group of $F_{3^{2h+1}}$. With the help
of a computer, we show that these skew Hadamard difference sets are new when
$h=2$ and $h=3$. We conjecture that they are always new when $h>3$.
Furthermore, we present a variation of the classical construction of the twin
prime power difference sets, and show that inequivalent skew Hadamard
difference sets lead to inequivalent difference sets with twin prime power
parameters.
