We show that the resistive anisotropy of an anisotropic medium is determined
by the ratio of the phase coherence lengths. In layered crystals in which the
interlayer transport is incoherent, the out-of-plane phase coherence length is
fixed and temperature independent. This leads to a temperature dependent
resistive anisotropy and to the coexistence of metallic in-plane and
non-metallic out-of-plane conductivities. Our approach provides a description
of the c-axis conductivity in the highly nonclassical regime, characteristic of
layered cuprates.
