We study the Restricted Isometry Property of a random matrix $\Gamma$ with
independent isotropic log-concave rows. To this end, we introduce a parameter
$\Gamma_{k,m}$ that controls uniformly the operator norm of sub-matrices with
$k$ rows and $m$ columns. This parameter is estimated by means of new tail
estimates of order statistics and deviation inequalities for norms of
projections of an isotropic log-concave vector.
