We study the nodal sets of non-degenerate eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on
fibre bundles $\pi{:}\, M\to B$ in the adiabatic limit. This limit consists in
considering a family $G_\varepsilon$ of Riemannian metrics, that are close to
Riemannian submersions, for which the ratio of the diameter of the fibres to
that of the base is given by $\varepsilon \ll 1$.
  We assume $M$ to be compact and allow for fibres $F$ with boundary, under the
condition that the ground state eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Laplacian on $F_x$
is independent of the base point. We prove for $\mathrm{dim} B \leq 3$ that the
nodal set of the Dirichlet-eigenfunction $\varphi$ converges to the pre-image
under $\pi$ of the nodal set of a function $\psi$ on $B$ that is determined as
the solution to an effective equation. In particular this implies that the
nodal set meets the boundary for $\varepsilon$ small enough and shows that many
known results on this question, obtained for some types of domains, also hold
on a large class of manifolds with boundary. For the special case of a closed
manifold $M$ fibred over the circle $B=S^1$ we obtain finer estimates and prove
that every connected component of the nodal set of $\varphi$ is smoothly
isotopic to the typical fibre of $\pi{:}\, M\to S^1$.
