When a linear model is adjusted to control for additional explanatory
variables the sign of a fitted coefficient may reverse. Here these reversals
are studied using coefficients of determination. The resulting theory can be
used to determine directions of unique effects in the presence of substantial
model uncertainty. This process is called model-independent estimation when the
estimates are invariant across changes to the model structure. When a single
covariate is added, the reversal region can be understood geometrically as an
elliptical cone of two nappes with an axis of symmetry relating to a
best-possible condition for a reversal using a single coefficient of
determination. When a set of covariates are added to a model with a single
explanatory variable, model-independent estimation can be implemented using
subject matter knowledge. More general theory with partial coefficients is
applicable to analysis of large data sets. Applications are demonstrated with
dietary health data from the United Nations. Necessary conditions for Simpson's
paradox are derived.
