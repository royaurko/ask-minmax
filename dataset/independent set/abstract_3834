A solution generating technique is developed for D=5 minimal supergravity
with two commuting Killing vectors based on the $G_2$ U-duality arising in the
reduction of the theory to three dimensions. The target space of the
corresponding 3-dimensional sigma-model is the coset $G_{2(2)}/(SL(2,R)\times
SL(2,R))$. Its isometries constitute the set of solution generating symmetries.
These include two electric and two magnetic Harrison transformations with the
corresponding two pairs of gauge transformations, three $SL(2,R) S$-duality
transformations, and the three gravitational scale, gauge and Ehlers
transformations (altogether 14). We construct a representation of the coset in
terms of $7\times 7$ matrices realizing the automorphisms of split octonions.
Generating a new solution amounts to transforming the coset matrices by
one-parametric subgroups of $G_{2(2)}$ and subsequently solving the dualization
equations. Using this formalism we derive a new charged black ring solution
with two independent parameters of rotation.
