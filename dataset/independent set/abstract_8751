We consider indecomposable representations of the Klein four group over a
field of characteristic $2$ and of a cyclic group of order $pm$ with $p,m$
coprime over a field of characteristic $p$. For each representation we
explicitly describe a separating set in the corresponding ring of invariants.
Our construction is recursive and the separating sets we obtain consist of
almost entirely orbit sums and products.
