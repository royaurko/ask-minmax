A compensator (null-corrector) for testing aspheric optical surfaces is
proposed, which enables i) independent verification of optical elements and
assembling of the compensator itself, and ii) ascertaining the compensator
position in a control layout for a specified aspheric surface. The compensator
consists of three spherical lenses made of the same glass. In this paper, the
scope of the compensator expanded to a surface speed ~f/2.3; a conceptual
example for a nominal primary of Hubble Space Telescope is given. The
autocollimating design allows significant reducing difficulties associated with
practical use of lens compensators.
