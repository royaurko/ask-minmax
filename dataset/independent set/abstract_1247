We describe how graphical Markov models started to emerge in the last 40
years, based on three essential concepts that had been developed independently
more than a century ago. Sequences of joint or single regressions and their
regression graphs are singled out as being best suited for analyzing
longitudinal data and for tracing developmental pathways. Interpretations are
illustrated using two sets of data and some of the more recent, important
results for sequences of regressions are summarized.
