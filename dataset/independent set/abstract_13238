An approach to deep inelastic scattering is described in which the matrix
elements arising from the operator product expansion are factorised into
composite operator propagators and proper vertex functions. In the case of
polarised $\m p$ scattering, the composite operator propagator is identified
with the square root of the QCD topological susceptibility
$\sqrt{\chi^{\prime}(0)}$, while the corresponding proper vertex is a
renormalisation group invariant. We estimate $\chi^{\prime}(0)$ using QCD
spectral sum rules and find that it is significantly suppressed relative to the
OZI expectation. Assuming OZI is a good approximation for the proper vertex,
our predictions, $\int_{0}^{1}dx g_1^p (x;Q^2=10\GV^2)= 0.143 \pm 0.005$ and
$G^{(0)}_A \equiv \Delta \Sigma = 0.353 \pm 0.052$, are in excellent agreement
with the new SMC data. This result, together with one confirming the validity
of the OZI rule in the $\hp$ radiative decay, supports our earlier conjecture
that the suppression in the flavour singlet component of the first moment of
$g_1^p$ observed by the EMC-SMC collaboration is a target-independent feature
of QCD related to the $U(1)$ anomaly and is not a property of the proton
structure. As a corollary, we extract the magnitude of higher twist effects
from the neutron and Bjorken sum rules.
