We present a differential algebra of generalized functions over a field of
generalized scalars by means of several axioms in terms of general algebra and
topology. Our differential algebra is of Colombeau type in the sense that it
contains a copy of the space of Schwartz distributions, and the set of regular
distributions with $\mathcal C^\infty$-kernels forms a differential subalgebra.
We discuss the uniqueness of the field of scalars as well as the consistency
and independence of our axioms. This article is written mostly to satisfy the
interest of mathematicians and scientists who do not necessarily belong to the
\emph{Colombeau community}; that is to say, those who do not necessarily work
in the \emph{non-linear theory of generalized functions}.
