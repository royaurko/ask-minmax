A unital in PG(2,q^2) is a set U of q^3+1 points such that each line meets U
in 1 or q+1 points. The well known example is the classical unital consisting
of all absolute points of a non-degenerate unitary polarity of PG(2,q^2).
Unitals other than the classical one also exist in PG(2,q^2) for every q>2.
Actually, all known unitals are of Buekenhout-Metz type and they can be
obtained by a construction due to Buekenhout. The unitals constructed by
Baker-Ebert, and independently by Hirschfeld-Szonyi, are the union of q conics.
Our Theorem 1.1 shows that this geometric property characterizes the
Baker-Ebert-Hirschfeld-Szonyi unitals.
