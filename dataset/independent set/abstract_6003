We take another look at the general problem of selecting a preferred
probability measure among those that comply with some given constraints. The
dominant role that entropy maximization has obtained in this context is
questioned by arguing that the minimum information principle on which it is
based could be supplanted by an at least as plausible "likelihood of evidence"
principle. We then review a method for turning given selection functions into
representation independent variants, and discuss the tradeoffs involved in this
transformation.
