A framework is presented to analyze the asymptotic behavior of two timescale
stochastic approximation algorithms that include situations where the mean
fields are set-valued. The framework is a natural generalization of the one
developed by Borkar. Perkins and Leslie have developed a framework for
asynchronous coupled stochastic approximation algorithms with set-valued mean
fields. Our framework is however more general as compared to the synchronous
version of the Perkins and Leslie framework.
