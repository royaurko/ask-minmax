We study the $CP$-violating, $|\Delta S| =1$ parameter $\varepsilon
'/\varepsilon$ by computing the hadronic matrix elements in the chiral quark
model. We estimate the coefficients of the next-to-leading order terms in the
chiral expansion that correspond to the operators $Q_6$ and $Q_{11}$. We
consider the impact of these corrections on the value of $\varepsilon
'/\varepsilon$. We also investigate the possibility that the chiral quark model
might drastically reduce the dimensional regularization $\gamma_5$-scheme
dependence of current evaluations of $\varepsilon '/\varepsilon$.
