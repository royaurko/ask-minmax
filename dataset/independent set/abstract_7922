The radii of convexity of some Lommel and Struve functions of the first kind
are determined. For both of Lommel and Struve functions three different
normalizations are applied in such a way that the resulting functions are
analytic in the unit disk of the complex plane. Some results on the zeros of
the derivatives of some Lommel and Struve functions of the first kind are also
deduced, which may be of independent interest.
