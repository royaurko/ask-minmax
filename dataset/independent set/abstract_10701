First-order hyperbolic systems are promising as a basis for numerical
integration of Einstein's equations. In previous work, the lapse and shift have
typically not been considered part of the hyperbolic system and have been
prescribed independently. This can be expensive computationally, especially if
the prescription involves solving elliptic equations. Therefore, including the
lapse and shift in the hyperbolic system could be advantageous for numerical
work. In this paper, two first-order symmetrizable hyperbolic systems are
presented that include the lapse and shift as dynamical fields and have only
physical characteristic speeds.
