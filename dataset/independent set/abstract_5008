The extended Dirac's principle describes the interference between different
particles as an effect of the multiparticle system with itself. In this paper
we present a novel example, based on the detection of particles emitted in
multimode states by independent sources, which illustrates in a simple way the
necessity of extending the original Dirac's criterion.
