Jet production in charged and neutral current events in the kinematic range
of Q^2 from 640 to 35000 GeV^2 is studied in deep-inelastic positron-proton
scattering at HERA. The measured rate of multi-jet events and distributions of
jet polar angle, transverse energy, dijet mass, and other dijet variables are
presented. Using parton densities derived from inclusive DIS cross sections,
perturbative QCD calculations in NLO are found to give a consistent description
of both the neutral and charged current dijet production. A direct, model
independent comparison of the jet distributions in charged and neutral current
events confirms that the QCD dynamics of the hadronic final state is
independent of the underlying electroweak scattering process.
