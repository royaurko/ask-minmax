Let $\mathbf D$ be the set of isomorphism types of finite double partially
ordered sets, that is sets endowed with two partial orders. On $\BZ\mathbf D$
we define a product and a coproduct, together with an internal product, that
is, degree-preserving. With these operations $\BZ\mathbf D$ is a Hopf algebra,
self-dual with respect to a scalar product which counts the number of pictures
(in the sense of Zelevinsky) between two double posets. The product and
coproduct correspond respectively to disjoint union of posets and to a natural
decomposition of a poset into order ideals. Restricting to special double
posets (meaning that the second order is total), we obtain a notion equivalent
to Stanley's labelled posets, and obtain a sub-Hopf-algebra already considered
by Blessenohl and Schocker. The mapping which maps each double poset onto the
sum of the linear extensions of its first order, identified via its second
(total) order with permutations, is a Hopf algebra homomorphism, which is
isometric and preserves the internal product, onto the Hopf algebra of
permutations, previously considered by the two contributors. Finally, the scalar
product between any special double poset and double posets naturally associated
to integer partitions is described by an extension of the Littlewood-Richardson
rule.
