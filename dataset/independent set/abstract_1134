A permutation sigma in Sn is a k-derangement if for any subset X = {a1, . .
., ak} \subseteq [n], {sigma(a1), . . ., sigma(ak)} is not equal to X. One can
form the k-derangement graph on the set of permutations of Sn by connecting two
permutations sigma and tau if sigma(tau)^-1 is a k-derangement. We characterize
when such a graph is connected or Eulerian. For n an odd prime power, we
determine the independence, clique and chromatic number of the 2-derangement
graph.
