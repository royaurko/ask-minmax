We apply the holonomic gradient method to compute the distribution function
of a weighted sum of independent noncentral chi-square random variables. It is
the distribution function of the squared length of a multivariate normal random
vector. We treat this distribution as an integral of the normalizing constant
of the Fisher-Bingham distribution on the unit sphere and make use of the
partial differential equations for the Fisher-Bingham distribution.
