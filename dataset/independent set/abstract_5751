We show that the correction to the Paschos-Wolfenstein relation associated
with charge symmetry violation in the valence quark distributions is
essentially model independent. It is proportional to a ratio of quark momenta
that is independent of Q^2. This result provides a natural explanation of the
surprisingly good agreement found between our earlier estimates within several
different models. When applied to the recent NuTeV measurement, this effect
significantly reduces the discrepancy with other determinations of the Weinberg
angle.
