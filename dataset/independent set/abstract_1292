There are currently two philosophies for building grammars and parsers --
Statistically induced grammars and Wide-coverage grammars. One way to combine
the strengths of both approaches is to have a wide-coverage grammar with a
heuristic component which is domain independent but whose contribution is tuned
to particular domains. In this paper, we discuss a three-stage approach to
disambiguation in the context of a lexicalized grammar, using a variety of
domain independent heuristic techniques. We present a training algorithm which
uses hand-bracketed treebank parses to set the weights of these heuristics. We
compare the performance of our grammar against the performance of the IBM
statistical grammar, using both untrained and trained weights for the
heuristics.
