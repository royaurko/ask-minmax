Reactive answer set programming has paved the way for incorporating online
information into operative solving processes. Although this technology was
originally devised for dealing with data streams in dynamic environments, like
assisted living and cognitive robotics, it can likewise be used to incorporate
facts, rules, or queries provided by a user. As a result, we present the design
and implementation of a system for interactive query answering with reactive
answer set programming. Our system quontroller is based on the reactive solver
oclingo and implemented as a dedicated front-end. We describe its functionality
and implementation, and we illustrate its features by some selected use cases.
