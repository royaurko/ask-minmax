Let f_1,f_2,..., be functions chosen independently and uniformly from the set
of all functions from a set of cardinality n into itself. Let g_t be the
composition of the first t functions, and let T be the smallest t for which g_t
is constant. We find the limiting distribution of T/n, as n --> infinity.
