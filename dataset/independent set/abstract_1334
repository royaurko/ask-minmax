We observe strong violation of Bell's inequality in an Einstein, Podolsky and
Rosen type experiment with independent observers. Our experiment definitely
implements the ideas behind the well known work by Aspect et al. We for the
first time fully enforce the condition of locality, a central assumption in the
derivation of Bell's theorem. The necessary space-like separation of the
observations is achieved by sufficient physical distance between the
measurement stations, by ultra-fast and random setting of the analyzers, and by
completely independent data registration.
