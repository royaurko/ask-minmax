We consider muon neutrino to tau neutrino oscillations in the context of the
Mass Varying Neutrino (MaVaN) model, where the neutrino mass can vary depending
on the electron density along the flight path of the neutrino. Our analysis
assumes a mechanism with dependence only upon the electron density, hence
ordinary matter density, of the medium through which the neutrino travels.
Fully-contained, partially-contained and upward-going muon atmospheric neutrino
data from the Super--Kamiokande detector, taken from the entire SK--I period of
1489 live days, are compared to MaVaN model predictions. We find that, for the
case of 2-flavor oscillations, and for the specific models tested, oscillation
independent of electron density is favored over density dependence. Assuming
maximal mixing, the best-fit case and the density-independent case do not
differ significantly.
