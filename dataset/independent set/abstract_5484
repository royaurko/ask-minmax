Given a discret subgroup $\Gamma\subset PSL(3,\C)$, we determine the number
of complex lines and complex lines in general position lying in the complement
of: maximal regions on which $\Gamma$ acts properly discontinuously, the
Kularni's limit set of $\Gamma$ and the equicontinuity set of $\Gamma$. We also
provide sufficient conditions to ensure that the equicontinuity region agrees
with the Kulkarni's discontinuity region and is the largest set where the group
acts properly discontinuously and we provide a description of he respective
limit set in terms of the elements of the group.
