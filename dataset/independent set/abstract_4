We consider numbers and sizes of independent sets in graphs with minimum
degree at least $d$, when the number $n$ of vertices is large. In particular we
investigate which of these graphs yield the maximum numbers of independent sets
of different sizes, and which yield the largest random independent sets. We
establish a strengthened form of a conjecture of Galvin concerning the first of
these topics.
