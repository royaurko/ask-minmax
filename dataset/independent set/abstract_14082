In the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_d$ of degree $d$ rational maps, the
bifurcation locus is the support of a closed $(1,1)$ positive current $T_\bif$
which is called the bifurcation current. This current gives rise to a measure
$\mu_\bif:=(T_\bif)^{2d-2}$ whose support is the seat of strong bifurcations.
Our main result says that $\supp(\mu_\bif)$ has maximal Hausdorff dimension
$2(2d-2)$. As a consequence, the set of degree $d$ rational maps having $2d-2$
distinct neutral cycles is dense in a set of full Hausdorff dimension.
