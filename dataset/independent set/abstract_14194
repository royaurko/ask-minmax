The domination polynomial D(G,x) of a graph G is the generating function of
its dominating sets. We prove that D(G,x) satisfies a wide range of reduction
formulas. We show linear recurrence relations for D(G,x) for arbitrary graphs
and for various special cases. We give splitting formulas for D(G,x) based on
articulation vertices, and more generally, on splitting sets of vertices.
