We present the results of a search for dark matter production in the monojet
signature. We analyze a sample of Tevatron pp-bar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96
TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.7/fb recorded by the CDF II
detector. In events with large missing transverse energy and one energetic jet,
we find good agreement between the standard model prediction and the observed
data. We set 90% confidence level upper limits on the dark matter production
rate. The limits are translated into bounds on nucleon-dark matter scattering
rates which are competitive with current direct detection bounds on
spin-independent interaction below a dark matter candidate mass of 5 GeV/c^2,
and on spin-dependent interactions up to masses of 200 GeV/c^2.
