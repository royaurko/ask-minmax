A large set of numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence
induced by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is presented. Revisiting the
previous survey conducted by Sano et al. (2004), we investigate the gas
pressure dependence of the saturation level. In ideal MHD simulations, the gas
pressure dependence is found to be very sensitive to the choice of a numerical
scheme. This is because the numerical magnetic Prandtl number varies according
to the scheme as well as the pressure, which considerably affects the results.
The saturation level is more sensitive to the numerical magnetic Prandtl number
than the pressure. In MHD simulations with explicit viscosity and resistivity,
the saturation level increases with the physical magnetic Prandtl number, and
it is almost independent of the gas pressure when the magnetic Prandtl number
is constant. This is indicative of the incompressible turbulence saturated by
the secondary tearing instability.
