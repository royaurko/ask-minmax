We explore the nature of the classical propagation of light through media
with strong frequency-dependent dispersion in the presence of a gravitational
field. In the weak field limit, gravity causes a redshift of the optical
frequency, which the slow-light medium converts into a spatially-varying index
of refraction. This results in the bending of a light ray in the medium. We
further propose experimental techniques to amplify and detect the phenomenon
using weak value measurements. Independent heuristic and rigorous derivations
of this effect are given.
