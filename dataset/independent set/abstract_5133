We address a linear control system under geometric constraints on control and
study its reachable sets starting at zero time from the origin. The main result
is the existence of a limit shape of the reachable sets as the terminal time
tends to zero. Here, a shape of a set stands for the set regarded up to an
invertible linear transformation. Both autonomous and non-autonomous cases are
considered.
