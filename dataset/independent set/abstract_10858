Light-Front quark model spin wave functions are employed to calculate the
three independent couplings g_{\Sigma_c \Lambda_c \pi}, f_{\Lambda_{c1}
\Sigma_c \pi} and f_{\Lambda^{*}_{c1} \Sigma_c \pi} of S-wave to S-wave and
P-wave to S-wave one-pion transitions. It is found that g_{\Sigma_c \Lambda_c
\pi}=6.81 MeV^{-1}, f_{\Lambda_{c1} \Sigma_c \pi}=1.16 and f_{\Lambda^{*}_{c1}
\Sigma_c \pi}=0.96 . 10^{-4} MeV^{-2}. We also predict decay rates for specific
strong transitions of charmed baryons.
