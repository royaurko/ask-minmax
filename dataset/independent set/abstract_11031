We write the probabilities for neutrino oscillations in uniform-density
matter exactly in terms of convention-independent vacuum neutrino oscillation
parameters and the matter density. This extends earlier results formulating
neutrino oscillations in terms of matter-, phase-, and trace-invariant
quantities.
