We consider Teichm\"uller geodesics in strata of translation surfaces. We
prove a Jarn\'ik-type inequality for geodesics bounded in some compact part of
the stratum and we establish generalized logarithmic laws for geodesics
admitting excursions to infinity at a given prescribed rate. Our main tool are
planar resonant sets arising from a given translation surface, that is the
countable sets of directions of its saddle connections or of its closed
geodesics, filtered according to length. We study approximations of a general
direction by the elements of a resonant set. In an abstract setting, and
assuming specific metric properties for resonant sets, we prove a dichotomy for
the Hausdorff measure of well approximable directions and an estimate on the
dimension of badly approximable directions. Then we prove that resonant sets
arising from a translation surface satisfies the required metric properties.
Our techniques also give estimates on the Hausdorff dimension of the set of
directions in a rational billiard having fast recurrence.
