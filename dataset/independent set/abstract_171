We discuss electron-electron contact-interaction searches in the process
e^+e^- -->e^+e^- at a future e^+e^- Linear Collider with c.m. energy
\sqrt{s}=0.5 TeV and with both beams longitudinally polarized. Our analysis is
based on the measurement of the polarized differential cross sections, and
allows to simultaneously take into account the general set of contact
interaction couplings as independent, non-zero, parameters thus avoiding
simplifying, model-dependent, assumptions. We evaluate the corresponding
model-independent constraints on the coupling constants, emphasizing the role
of beam polarization, and make a comparison with the case of e^+e^-
-->\mu^+\mu^-.
