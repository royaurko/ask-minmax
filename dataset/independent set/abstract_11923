Let $Q_n(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} A_{i}x^{i}$ be a random polynomial where the
coefficients
  $A_0,A_1,... $ form a sequence of centered Gaussian random variables.
Moreover, assume that the increments $\Delta_j=A_j-A_{j-1}$, $j=0,1,2,...$ are
independent, assuming $A_{-1}=0$. The coefficients can be considered as $n$
consecutive observations of a Brownian motion. We study the number of times
that such a random polynomial crosses a line which is not necessarily parallel
to the x-axis. More precisely we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the expected
number of real roots of the equation $Q_n(x)=Kx$, for the cases that $K$ is any
non-zero real constant $K=o(n^{1/4})$, and $K=o(n^{1/2})$ separately.
