With quadrotor use seeing extensive growth in recent years, the autonomous
control of these Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is an increasing relevant and
intersting field. In this paper a linear state-space approach at designing a
stable hover controller in the presence of disturbances is presented along with
simulation of control system performance. Additionally the design of a tracking
system, for linear inertial position and yaw, is presented with simulation
results. The gain matrix developed for this control system is independent of
the specific quadrotor parameters, meaning that this same gain matrix can be
used on a wide variety of quadrotors without modification. The hover and
tracking controllers designed in this paper proved to perform well in
simulation under perturbation disturbances and normally distributed
disturbances on the UAVs linear speeds and angular speeds.
