The recent analysis of the cosmic microwave background data carried out by
the WMAP team seems to show that the sum of the neutrino masses is <0.7 eV.
However, this result is not model-independent, depending on precise assumptions
on the cosmological model. We study how this result is modified when the
assumption of perfect lepton symmetry is dropped out.
