The electric conductivity which reveals the zero gap semiconducting (ZGS)
state has been investigated as the function of temperature $T$ and life time
$\tau$ in order to understand the ZGS state in quarter-filled
$\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ salt with four sites in the unit cell. By treating
$\tau$ as a parameter and making use of the one-loop approximation, it is found
that the conductivity is proportional to $T$ and $\tau$ for $k_B\gg\hbar/\tau$
and independent of $T$ and $\tau$ for $k_B T\ll\hbar/\tau$. Further the
conductivity being independent of $T$ in the ZGS state is examined in terms of
Born approximation for the impurity cattering.
