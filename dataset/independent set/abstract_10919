We present a closed form expression for |V_{ub}|^2/ |V_{tb} V_{ts}^*|^2 in
terms of the endpoint photon and lepton spectra from the inclusive decays B ->
X_s\gamma and B -> X_u\ell\nu, respectively, which includes the resummation of
the endpoint logs at next to leading order and is completely independent of the
B meson structure function. The use of this expression for extracting V_{ub}
would eliminate the large systematic errors usually incurred due to the
modeling of the heavy quarks' Fermi motion.
