The distributions of the single decay b-quarks and leptons from e^+e^- \to
t\bar t assuming CP violation are reviewed. Different asymmetries, sensitive
independently to CP violation in the production and in the decay, and sensitive
to the real and imaginary parts of d^\gamma and d^Z are defined. The analytic
expressions are general and independent on the model of CP violation. In most
of them all phase space integrations are fulfilled analytically. Numerical
results in the MSSM with complex couplings are presented.
