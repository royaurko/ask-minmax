I note that the explanation of a recently posted paper by Lambiase et al.
[arXiv:0811.2302] for the oscillations in the electron capture decay rate,
reported by Litvinov et al.[arXiv:0801.2079], requires the cancellation of a
difference by eleven orders of magnitude for the two independent measurements.
Such a cancellation is (impossible)^2.
