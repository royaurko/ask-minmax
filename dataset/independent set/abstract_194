Let $i_t(G)$ be the number of independent sets of size $t$ in a graph $G$.
Engbers and Galvin asked how large $i_t(G)$ could be in graphs with minimum
degree at least $\delta$. They further conjectured that when $n\geq 2\delta$
and $t\geq 3$, $i_t(G)$ is maximized by the complete bipartite graph
$K_{\delta, n-\delta}$. This conjecture has drawn the attention of many
researchers recently. In this short note, we prove this conjecture.
