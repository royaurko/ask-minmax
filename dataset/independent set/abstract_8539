The method of constrained randomisation is applied to three-dimensional
simulated galaxy distributions. With this technique we generate for a given
data set surrogate data sets which have the same linear properties as the
original data whereas higher order or nonlinear correlations are not preserved.
The analysis of the original and surrogate data sets with measures, which are
sensitive to nonlinearities, yields information about the existence of
nonlinear correlations in the data. We demonstrate how to generate surrogate
data sets from a given point distribution, which have the same linear
properties (power spectrum) as well as the same density amplitude distribution.
We propose weighted scaling indices as a nonlinear statistical measure to
quantify local morphological elements in large scale structure. Using
surrogates is is shown that the data sets with the same 2-point correlation
functions have slightly different void probability functions and especially a
different set of weighted scaling indices. Thus a refined analysis of the large
scale structure becomes possible by calculating local scaling properties
whereby the method of constrained randomisation yields a vital tool for testing
the performance of statistical measures in terms of sensitivity to different
topological features and discriminative power.
