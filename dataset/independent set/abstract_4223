In wide double white dwarf (DWD) binaries, in which the co-eval WDs evolve
independently, the more massive, faster-evolving WD can be used to obtain a
main-sequence lifetime for the less-massive WD. By converting this lifetime
into an initial mass for the less-massive WD, and combining it with the
spectroscopically derived mass for this WD, one can constrain the initial-final
mass relation (IFMR). However, the number of known and well-characterized DWDs
is small, severely limiting their usefulness for this analysis. To obtain new
constraints on the IFMR, we search for wide DWDs in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) Data Release 9. We find 65 new candidate systems, thereby raising
the number of known wide DWDs to 142. We then engage in a spectroscopic
campaign to characterize these pairs, identifying 32 DA/DA pairs, two DA/DB
pairs, four DA/DAH candidate pairs, a previously unidentified candidate triple
WD system, and five DA/DC WDs. We present a reanalysis of the constraint on the
IFMR placed by Finley & Koester (1997) using the DWD PG 0922+162, and finish by
discussing how it could be expanded to a generic set of wide DWDs.
