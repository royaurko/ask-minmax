Let T be a random field invariant under the action of a compact group G We
give conditions ensuring that independence of the random Fourier coefficients
is equivalent to Gaussianity. As a consequence, in general it is not possible
to simulate a non-Gaussian invariant random field through its Fourier expansion
using independent coefficients.
