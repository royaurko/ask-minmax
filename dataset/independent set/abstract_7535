Strong-flavor and parity a priori mixing in hadrons are shown to describe
well the experimental evidence on weak radiative decays of hyperons. An
independent determination of the a priori mixing angles is performed. The
values obtained for them are seen to have a universality-like property, when
compared to their values in non-leptonic decays of hyperons.
