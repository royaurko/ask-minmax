The HST/NICMOS transmission spectrum measurements of HD 189733b that suggest
the detection of methane (CH$_{4}$) in an exoplanet atmosphere have been a
source of significant controversy. With what is probably the best analyzed
exoplanet spectroscopy data set to date, different teams, using different
methods, have claimed evidence both contradicting and supporting the original
findings. Here, we report results from a uniform spectral retrieval analysis of
the three, independent, published spectra together with null hypothesis
testing. Based on Bayesian model comparison, we find that two of the three
spectra show strong evidence ($\geq$ 3.6$\sigma$) for the detection of
molecular features mainly due to water and methane while the third is
consistent with a weak molecular detection at the 2.2$\sigma$ level. We
interpret the agreement in the spectral modulation established by previous
contributors and the atmospheric retrieval results presented here, as a confirmation
of the original detection of molecular absorbers in the atmosphere of HD
189733b.
