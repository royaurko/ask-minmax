Suggested holographic duals of QCD, based on AdS/CFT duality, predict that
one should be able to vary the scales of colour confinement and chiral-symmetry
breaking independently. Furthermore they suggest that such independent
variation of scales can be achieved by the inclusion of extra 4-fermion
interactions in QCD. We simulate lattice QCD with such extra 4-fermion terms at
finite temperatures and show that for strong enough 4-fermion couplings the
deconfinement transition occurs at a lower temperature than the chiral-symmetry
restoration transition. Moreover the separation of these transitions depends on
the size of the 4-fermion coupling, confirming the predictions from the
proposed holographic dual of QCD.
