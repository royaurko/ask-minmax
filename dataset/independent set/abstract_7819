We consider exact sequences and lower central series of surface braid groups
and we explain how they can prove to be useful for obtaining representations
for surface braid groups. In particular, using a completely algebraic
framework, we describe the notion of extension of a representation introduced
and studied recently by An and Ko and independently by Blanchet.
