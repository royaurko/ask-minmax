Recent studies on control of aggregate power of an ensemble of
thermostatically-controlled-loads (TCLs) have been concentrated on shifting the
temperature set points of each TCL in the population. A sudden shift in the set
point, however, is known to be associated with undesirable power oscillations
which require closed-loop control strategies to regulate the aggregate power
consumption of the population. In this article, we propose a new approach which
we term as a "safe protocol" to implement the shift in temperature set point.
It is shown analytically and verified numerically that by shifting the set
point "safely" the aggregate power consumption can be changed to a different
value within a time frame of the order of a TCL's cycle duration and avoid the
undesired oscillations seen otherwise in a "sudden" shift. We discuss how the
excess aggregate energy transferred under a safe shift in the set point could
potentially mitigate the burden due to abnormal energy generation within a
short time span.
