During the year 2000, LEP has been operated at centre-of-mass energies up to
sqrt(s) = 209 GeV. New particle searches have been performed using these data
samples. Model independent limits on the production cross-sections and mass
limits in the context of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)
assuming R-parity violation and in the context of gauge-mediated supersymmetry
breaking theories (GMSB) are presented. Searches for technicolor, excited
leptons and leptoquarks are also reviewed.
