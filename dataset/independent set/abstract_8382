For a group G we consider the set of natural numbers n for which the nth
cohomology functor of G commutes with filtered colimit systems of coefficient
modules. We find that for the large class of hierarchically decomposable groups
there is a dichotomy: this set of natural numbers is either finite or cofinite.
Moreover any finite or cofinite set is shown to arise in suitable examples. A
survey of recent literature on this topic, especially the work of Martin
Hamilton, is included.
