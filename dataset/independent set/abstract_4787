A More Sums Than Differences (MSTD) set is a set $A$ for which $|A+A|>|A-A|$.
Martin and O'Bryant proved that the proportion of MSTD sets in
$\{0,1,\dots,n\}$ is bounded below by a positive number as $n$ goes to
infinity. Iyer, Lazarev, Miller and Zhang introduced the notion of a
generalized MSTD set, a set $A$ for which $|sA-dA|>|\sigma A-\delta A|$ for a
prescribed $s+d=\sigma+\delta$. We offer efficient constructions of
$k$-generational MSTD sets, sets $A$ where $A, A+A, \dots, kA$ are all MSTD. We
also offer an alternative proof that the proportion of sets $A$ for which
$|sA-dA|-|\sigma A-\delta A|=x$ is positive, for any $x \in \mathbb{Z}$. We
prove that for any $\epsilon>0$, $\Pr(1-\epsilon<\log |sA-dA|/\log|\sigma
A-\delta A|<1+\epsilon)$ goes to $1$ as the size of $A$ goes to infinity and we
give a set $A$ which has the current highest value of $\log |A+A|/\log |A-A|$.
We also study decompositions of intervals $\{0,1,\dots,n\}$ into MSTD sets and
prove that a positive proportion of decompositions into two sets have the
property that both sets are MSTD.
