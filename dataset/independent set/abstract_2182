The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamical behavior of the sequence
$(x_n)$ produced by the forward-backward algorithm $y_{n+1} \in B(u_{n+1},
x_n)$, $x_{n+1} = ( I + \gamma_{n+1} A(u_{n+1}, \cdot))^{-1}( x_n -
\gamma_{n+1} y_{n+1} )$ where $A(\xi) = A(\xi, \cdot)$ and $B(\xi) = B(\xi,
\cdot)$ are two functions valued in the set of maximal monotone operators on
$\mathbb{R}^N$, $(u_n)$ is a sequence of independent and identically
distributed random variables, and $(\gamma_n)$ is a sequence of vanishing step
sizes. Following the approach of the recent paper~\cite{bia-(arxiv)15}, we
define the operators ${\mathcal A}(x) = {\mathbb E}[ A(u_1, x) ]$ and
${\mathcal B}(x) = {\mathbb E} [ B(u_1, x)]$, where the expectations are the
set-valued Aumann integrals with respect to the law of $u_1$, and assume that
the monotone operator ${\mathcal A} + {\mathcal B}$ is maximal (sufficient
conditions for maximality are provided). It is shown that with probability one,
the interpolated process obtained from the iterates $x_n$ is an asymptotic
pseudo trajectory in the sense of Bena\"{\i}m and Hirsch of the differential
inclusion $\dot z(t) \in - ({\mathcal A} + {\mathcal B})(z(t))$. The
convergence of the empirical means of the $x_n$'s towards a zero of ${\mathcal
A} + {\mathcal B}$ follows, as well as the convergence of the sequence $(x_n)$
itself to such a zero under a demipositivity assumption. These results find
applications in a wide range of optimization or variational inequality problems
in random environments.
