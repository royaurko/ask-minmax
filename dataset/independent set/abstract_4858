In a set equipped with a binary operation, (S,*), a subset U is defined to be
avoidable if there exists a partition {A,B} of S such that no element of U is
the product of two distinct elements of A or of two distinct elements of B. For
more than two decades, avoidable sets in the natural numbers (under addition)
have been studied by renowned mathematicians such as Erdos, and a few families
of sets have been shown to be avoidable in that setting. In this paper we
investigate the generalized notion of an avoidable set and determine the
avoidable sets in several families of groups; previous work in this field
considered only the case (S, *) = (N, +).
