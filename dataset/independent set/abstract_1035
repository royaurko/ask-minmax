Using a three-baryon $\Lambda NN$ potential having a spin-independent
dispersive and a two-pion exchange components, realistic variational Monte
Carlo calculations have been performed for the $\Lambda$-seperation energy for
$^{5}_{\Lambda}$He. A relationship between strengths associated with both
pieces of $\Lambda NN$ force giving exact experimental $\Lambda$-seperation
energy has been obtained which then combined with our previous study on
$^{17}_{\,\,\Lambda}$O hypernucleus determines a unique and acceptable set of
strength parameters for $\Lambda NN$ potential. The $\Lambda NN$ force is found
important for the core polarization.
