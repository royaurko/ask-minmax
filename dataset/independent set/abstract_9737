We prove anti-concentration results for polynomials of independent random
variables with arbitrary degree. Our results extend the classical
Littlewood-Offord result for linear polynomials, and improve several earlier
estimates.
  We discuss applications in two different areas. In complexity theory, we
prove near optimal lower bounds for computing the Parity, addressing a
challenge in complexity theory posed by Razborov and Viola, and also address a
problem concerning OR functions. In random graph theory, we derive a general
anti-concentration result on the number of copies of a fixed graph in a random
graph.
