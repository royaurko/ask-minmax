In this paper we prove some lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of sets
of Furstenberg type. Moreover, we extend these results to sets of generalized
Furstenberg type, associated to doubling dimension functions. With some
additional growth conditions on the dimension function, we obtain a lower bound
on the dimension of "zero dimensional" Furstenberg sets.
