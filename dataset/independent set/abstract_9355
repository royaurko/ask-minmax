In this paper we study the problem of testing the null hypothesis that errors
from k independent parametrically specified generalized autoregressive
conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models have the same distribution versus
a general alternative. First we establish the asymptotic validity of a class of
linear test statistics derived from the k residual-based empirical distribution
functions. A distinctive feature is that the asymptotic distribution of the
test statistics involves terms depending on the distributions of errors and the
parameters of the models, and weight functions providing the flexibility to
choose scores for investigating power performance. A Monte Carlo study assesses
the asymptotic performance in terms of empirical size and power of the
three-sample test based on the Wilcoxon and Van der Waerden score generating
functions in finite samples. The results demonstrate that the two proposed
tests have overall reasonable size and their power is particularly high when
the assumption of Gaussian errors is violated. As an illustrative example, the
tests are applied to daily individual stock returns of the New York Stock
Exchange data.
