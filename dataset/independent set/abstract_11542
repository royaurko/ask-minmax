We show that continuous dynamical decoupling can protect a two-qubit
entangled state from sudden death at finite temperature due to uncorrelated
dephasing, bit flipping, and dissipation. We consider a situation where an
entangled state shared between two non-interacting qubits is initially prepared
and left evolve under the environmental perturbations and the protection of
external fields. To illustrate the protection of the entanglement, we solve
numerically a master equation in the Born approximation, considering
independent boson fields at the same temperature coupled to the different error
agents of each qubit.
