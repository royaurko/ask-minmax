All Control Systems that grow to any size have a variety of data that are
stored in different formats on different nodes in the network. Examples include
sensor value and status, archived sensor data, device oriented support data and
relationships, message logs, application and machine configurations etc. Each
type of data typically has a different programming interface. Higher-level
applications need to access a logically related set of data that is in
different data stores and may require different processing. AIDA is envisioned
to be a distributed service that allows applications access to this wide
variety of Control System data in a consistent way that is language and machine
independent. It has the additional goal of providing an object-oriented layer
for constructing applications on top of multiple existing conventional systems
like EPICS or the SLC Control System. Motivation, design overview and current
status will be presented.
