Locally isotropic pseudo-Riemannian manifolds are known to be locally
symmetric; this result is due to Wolf. In the Riemannian setting one proof, due
to Szab\'o, uses spectral properties of the so-called Szab\'o operator. In this
paper we extend Szab\'o's method to the pseudo-Riemannian setting, obtaining
results comparable to those of Wolf. Most results concerning the Szab\'o
operator in the pseudo-Riemannian setting are presented using methods of
algebraic topology. This paper exploits the polynomial nature of the Szab\'o
operator along with its behavior over the nullcone, both of which have received
little attention this far.
