In this paper we study the distribution of the scaled largest eigenvalue of
complexWishart matrices, which has diverse applications both in statistics and
wireless communications. Exact expressions, valid for any matrix dimensions,
have been derived for the probability density function and the cumulative
distribution function. The derived results involve only finite sums of
polynomials. These results are obtained by taking advantage of properties of
the Mellin transform for products of independent random variables.
