It is well known that an intersecting family of subsets of an n-element set
can contain at most 2^(n-1) sets. It is natural to wonder how `close' to
intersecting a family of size greater than 2^(n-1) can be. Katona, Katona and
Katona introduced the idea of a `most probably intersecting family.' Suppose
that X is a family and that 0<p<1. Let X(p) be the (random) family formed by
selecting each set in X independently with probability p. A family X is `most
probably intersecting' if it maximises the probability that X(p) is
intersecting over all families of size |X|.
  Katona, Katona and Katona conjectured that there is a nested sequence
consisting of most probably intersecting families of every possible size. We
show that this conjecture is false for every value of p provided that n is
sufficiently large.
