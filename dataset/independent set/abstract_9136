We present results of an investigation to study CP violation in the Higgs
sector in $t\bar t$ production at a $\gamma\gamma$-collider. This is done in a
model independent way in terms of six form-factors $\{\Re(S_{\gamma}),
\Im(S_{\gamma}), \Re(P_{\gamma}), \Im(P_{\gamma}), S_t, P_t\}$ which
parameterize the CP mixing in Higgs sector. The angular distribution of the
decay lepton from $t/\bar t$ is shown to be independent of any CP violation in
the $tbW$ vertex. Hence it can be used as a diagnostic of the CP mixing. We
study how well one can probe different combinations of the form factors by
measurements of the combined asymmetries that we construct, in the initial
state lepton (photon) polarization and the final state lepton charge, using
only circularly polarized photons. We show that the method can be sensitive to
loop-induced CP violation in the Higgs sector in the MSSM.
