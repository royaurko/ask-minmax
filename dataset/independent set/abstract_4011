Results are reported from a search for non-standard-model Higgs boson decays
to pairs of new light bosons, each of which decays into the oppositely charged
dimuon final state. The new bosons may be produced either promptly or via a
decay chain. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.3
inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV, recorded by
the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011. Such Higgs boson decays are predicted in
several scenarios of new physics, including supersymmetric models with extended
Higgs sectors or hidden valleys. Thus, the results of the search are relevant
for establishing whether the new particle observed in Higgs boson searches at
the LHC has the properties expected for a standard model Higgs boson. No excess
of events is observed with respect to the yields expected from standard model
processes. A model-independent upper limit of 0.86 +/- 0.06 fb on the product
of the cross section times branching fraction times acceptance is obtained. The
results, which are applicable to a broad spectrum of models, are compared with
the predictions of two benchmark scenarios as functions of a Higgs boson mass
larger than 86 GeV and of a new light boson mass within the range 0.25-3.55
GeV.
