A portion of 20 minutes of the GPS signals collected during the Bridge 2
experimental campaign, performed by ESA, have been processed. An innovative
algorithm called Parfait, developed by Starlab and implemented within Starlab's
GNSS-R Software package STARLIGHT (STARLab Interferometric Gnss Toolkit), has
been successfully used with this set of data. A comparison with tide values
independently collected and with differential GPS processed data has been
performed. We report a successful PARIS phase altimetric measure of the Zeeland
Brug over the sea surface with a rapidly changing tide, with a precision better
than 2 cm.
