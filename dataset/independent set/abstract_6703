Wavelet sets that are finite unions of convex sets are constructed in
$\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq 2$, for dilation by any expansive matrix that has a power
equal to a scalar times the identity and also has all singular values greater
than $\sqrt n$. In particular, we produce simple wavelet sets in any dimension
for dilation by any real scalar greater than 1.
