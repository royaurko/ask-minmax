The greybody factor and the Hawking temperature for a class of asymptotically
flat charged dilatonic black holes are computed by using the low-energy
dynamics of scalar fields in the black hole background. In the semi-classical
approximation, the Hawking temperature has a good agreement with the one
computed from the surface gravity, which is independent of the magnetic (or
electric) charges of dilatonic black holes.
