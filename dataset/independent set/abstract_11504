The propagator of three-dimensional Aharonov-Bohm-Coulomb system is
calculated by following the Duru-Kleinert method. It is shown that the system
is reduced to two independent two dimensional Aharonov-Bohm plus harmonic
oscillator systems through dimensional extension and Kustaanheimo-Stiefel
transformation. The energy spectrum is deduced.
