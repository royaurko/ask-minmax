We study the VC-dimension of the set system on the vertex set of some graph
which is induced by the family of its k-connected subgraphs. In particular, we
give upper and lower bounds for the VC-dimension. Moreover, we show that
computing the VC-dimension is NP-complete and that it remains NP-complete for
planar graphs in the case k = 2. This is done by a reduction from a variant of
Planar 1-In-3-Sat which we prove to be NP-complete.
