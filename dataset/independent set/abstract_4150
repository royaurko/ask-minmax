The rigorous study of spectral stability of strong detonations was begun by
Erpenbeck in the 1960s. Working with the Zeldovitch-von Neumann-D\"oring (ZND)
model, he identified two fundamental classes of detonation profiles, referred
to as those of decreasing (D) and increasing (I) type, which appeared to
exhibit very different behavior with respect to high-frequency perturbations.
Using a combination of rigorous and non-rigorous arguments, Erpenbeck concluded
that type I detonations were unstable to some oscillatory perturbations for
which the (vector) frequency was of arbitrarily large magnitude, while type D
detonations were stable provided the frequency magnitude was sufficiently high.
For type D detonations Erpenbeck's methods did not allow him to obtain a cutoff
magnitude for stability that was \emph{uniform} with respect to frequency
direction. Thus, he left open the question whether the cutoff magnitude for
stability might approach $+\infty$ as certain frequency directions were
approached. In this paper we show by quite different methods that for type D
detonations there exists a uniform cutoff magnitude for stability independent
of frequency direction. By reducing the search for unstable frequencies to a
bounded frequency set, the uniform cutoff obtained here is a key step toward
the rigorous validation of a number of results in the computational detonation
literature. The main difficulty in the analysis is to treat "turning points at
infinity".
