Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies is increasingly popular and
many meta-analytic methods have been recently proposed. A majority of
meta-analytic methods combine information from multiple studies by assuming
that studies are independent since individuals collected in one study are
unlikely to be collected again by another study. However, it has become
increasingly common to utilize the same control individuals among multiple
studies to reduce genotyping or sequencing cost. This causes those studies that
share the same individuals to be dependent, and spurious associations may arise
if overlapping subjects are not taken into account in a meta-analysis. In this
paper, we propose a general framework for meta-analyzing dependent studies with
overlapping subjects. Given dependent studies, our approach "decouples" the
studies into independent studies such that meta-analysis methods assuming
independent studies can be applied. This enables many meta-analysis methods,
such as the random effects model, to account for overlapping subjects. Another
advantage is that one can continue to use preferred software in the analysis
pipeline which may not support overlapping subjects. Using simulations and the
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data, we show that our decoupling
approach allows both the fixed and the random effects models to account for
overlapping subjects while retaining desirable false positive rate and power.
