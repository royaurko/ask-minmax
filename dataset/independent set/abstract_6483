I lay out the problem of time facets as arising piecemeal from a number of
aspects of background independence. Almost all of these already have simpler
classical counterparts. This approach can be viewed as a facet by facet
completion of the observation that Barbour-type relationalism is a background
independent precursor to 2 of the 9 facets. That completion proceeds in an
order dictated by the additional layers of mathematical structure required to
support each. Moreover, the `nonlinear nature' of the interactions between the
Problem of Time facets renders a joint study of them mandatory. The current
article is none the less a useful prequel via gaining a conceptual
understanding of each facet, prior to embarking on rendering some combinations
of facets consistent and what further obstructions arise in attempting such
joint considerations. See [20, 21, 26] for up to date studies of this more
complicated joint version. I also identify new facets (threading based),
subfacets (of observables and of reconstructions) and further source of variety
from how far down the levels of mathematical structure these facets extend.
