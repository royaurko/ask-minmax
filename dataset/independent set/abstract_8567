In a "tipping" model, each node in a social network, representing an
individual, adopts a property or behavior if a certain number of his incoming
neighbors currently exhibit the same. In viral marketing, a key problem is to
select an initial "seed" set from the network such that the entire network
adopts any behavior given to the seed. Here we introduce a method for quickly
finding seed sets that scales to very large networks. Our approach finds a set
of nodes that guarantees spreading to the entire network under the tipping
model. After experimentally evaluating 31 real-world networks, we found that
our approach often finds seed sets that are several orders of magnitude smaller
than the population size and outperform nodal centrality measures in most
cases. In addition, our approach scales well - on a Friendster social network
consisting of 5.6 million nodes and 28 million edges we found a seed set in
under 3.6 hours. Our experiments also indicate that our algorithm provides
small seed sets even if high-degree nodes are removed. Lastly, we find that
highly clustered local neighborhoods, together with dense network-wide
community structures, suppress a trend's ability to spread under the tipping
model.
