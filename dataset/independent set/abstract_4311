With the rapid development of digital imaging and communication technologies,
image set based face recognition (ISFR) is becoming increasingly important. One
key issue of ISFR is how to effectively and efficiently represent the query
face image set by using the gallery face image sets. The set-to-set distance
based methods ignore the relationship between gallery sets, while representing
the query set images individually over the gallery sets ignores the correlation
between query set images. In this paper, we propose a novel image set based
collaborative representation and classification method for ISFR. By modeling
the query set as a convex or regularized hull, we represent this hull
collaboratively over all the gallery sets. With the resolved representation
coefficients, the distance between the query set and each gallery set can then
be calculated for classification. The proposed model naturally and effectively
extends the image based collaborative representation to an image set based one,
and our extensive experiments on benchmark ISFR databases show the superiority
of the proposed method to state-of-the-art ISFR methods under different set
sizes in terms of both recognition rate and efficiency.
