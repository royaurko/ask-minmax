Several recent observations using standard rulers and standard candles now
suggest, either individually or in combination, that the Universe is close to
flat, i.e. that the curvature radius is about as large as the horizon radius
(\sim 10h^{-1}Gpc) or larger. Here, a method of distinguishing an almost flat
universe from a precisely flat universe using a single observational data set,
without using any microwave background information, is presented. The method
(i) assumes that a standard ruler should have no preferred orientation (radial
versus tangential) to the observer, and (ii) requires that the (comoving)
length of the standard ruler be known independently (e.g. from low redshift
estimates). The claimed feature at fixed {\em comoving} length in the power
spectrum of density perturbations, detected among quasars, Lyman break galaxies
or other high redshift objects, would provide an adequate standard candle to
prove that the Universe is curved, if indeed it is curved. For example, a
combined intrinsic and measurement uncertainty of 1% in the length of the
standard ruler $\llss$ applied at a redshift of $z=3$ would distinguish an
hyperbolic $(\Omega_m=0.2,\Omega_\Lambda=0.7)$ or a spherical
$(\Omega_m=0.4,\Omega_\Lambda=0.7)$ universe from a flat one to 1-P > 95%
confidence.
