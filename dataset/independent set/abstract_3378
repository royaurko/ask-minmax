We will show that the sequence appearing in the double recurrence theorem is
a good universal weight for the Furstenberg averages. That is, given a system
$(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu, T)$ and bounded functions $f_1, f_2 \in L^\infty(\mu)$,
there exists a set of full-measure $X_{f_1, f_2}$ in $X$ that is independent of
integers $a$ and $b$ and a positive integer $k$ such that for all $x \in
X_{f_1, f_2}$ and for every other measure-preserving system $(Y, \mathcal{G},
\nu, S)$, and each bounded and measurable function $g_1, \ldots, g_k \in
L^\infty(\nu)$, the averages \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N
f_1(T^{an}x)f_2(T^{bn}x)g_1 \circ S^n g_2 \circ S^{2n} \cdots g_k \circ S^{kn}
\] converge in $L^2(\nu)$.
