The superradiance phenomena of massive bosons and fermions in the Kerr
spacetime are studied in the Bargmann-Wigner formulation. In case of bi-spinor,
the four independent components spinors correspond to the four bosonic freedom:
one scalar and three vectors uniquely. The consistent description of the
Bargmann-Wigner equations between fermions and bosons shows that the
superradiance of the type with positive energy $(0<\omega)$ and negative
momentum near horizon $(p_{\rm H}<0)$ is shown not to occur. On the other hand,
the superradiance of the type with negative energy $(\omega<0)$ and positive
momentum near horizon $(0<p_{\rm H})$ is still possible for both scalar bosons
and spinor fermions.
