We have developed a parameter-independent method to detect local maxima of
the two-point correlation function. By applying it to two samples of rich Abell
clusters of galaxies with redshift limits z<0.08 and z<0.12 we detect three
maxima centered at 150 Mpc, 300 Mpc and 430 Mpc with confidence levels 80% and
higher. This sequence of fluctuations has an average interval of 140 Mpc, that
can be explained by a power spectrum with a distinct peak at
k=0.048+-0.005/Mpc.
