Discrete moments of the Riemann zeta function were studied by Gonek and
Hejhal in the 1980's. They independently formulated a conjecture concerning the
size of these moments. In 1999, Hughes, Keating, and O'Connell, by employing a
random matrix model, made this conjecture more precise. Subject to the Riemann
hypothesis, we establish upper and lower bounds of the correct order of
magnitude in the case of the fourth moment.
