We construct basis-independent expressions that measure the magnitude of
$R$-parity breaking due to possible superpotential terms in the Minimal
Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, in the absence of soft
supersymmetry-breaking terms and spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking. We also
discuss briefly their application to a consistent treatment of cosmological
constraints on $R$-parity violation.
