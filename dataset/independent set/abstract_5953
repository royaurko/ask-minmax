We construct families of smooth, proper, algebraic curves in characteristic
0, of arbitrary genus g, together with g elements in the kernel of the tame
symbol. We show that those elements are in general independent by a limit
calculation of the regulator. Working over a number field, we show that in some
of those families the elements are integral. We determine when those curves are
hyperelliptic, finding, in particular, that over any number field we have
non-hyperelliptic curves of all composite genera g with g independent integral
elements in the kernel of the tame symbol.
