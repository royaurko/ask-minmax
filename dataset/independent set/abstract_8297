Given a bounded $C^1$ domain $\Omega\subset\R^n$ and a nonempty subset $E$ of
its boundary (set of tomography), we consider broken rays which start and end
at points of $E$. We ask: If the integrals of a function over all such broken
rays are known, can the function be reconstructed? We give positive answers
when $\Omega$ is a ball and the unknown function is required to be uniformly
quasianalytic in the angular variable and the set of tomography is open. We
also analyze the situation when the set of tomography is a singleton.
