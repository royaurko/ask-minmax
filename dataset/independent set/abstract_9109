Vector Meson Dominance ideas together with a Finite Energy QCD sum rule
allows for the determination of the $q^{2}$- and the $T$- dependence of the
effective hadronic coupling constant $g_{\rho \pi \pi}$ in the space-like
region. It turns out that $g_{\rho \pi \pi}(q^{2},T)$ vanishes at the critical
temperature $T_{c}$, independently of $q^{2}$. A comparison with a previous
independent QCD determination of the electromagnetic pion form factor at finite
temperature supports the validity of Vector Meson Dominance at finite
temperature. We find also thet the pion radius increases with $T$, having a
divergent behavior at $T_{c}$.
