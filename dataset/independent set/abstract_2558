A spherical optical model potential (OMP) containing a dispersive term is
used to fit the available experimental database of angular distribution and
total cross section data for n + Al27 covering the energy range 0.1- 250 MeV
using relativistic kinematics and a relativistic extension of the Schroedinger
equation. A dispersive OMP with parameters that show a smooth energy dependence
and energy independent geometry are determined from fits to the entire data
set. A very good overall agreement between experimental data and predictions is
achieved up to 150 MeV. Inclusion of nonlocality effects in the absorptive
volume potential allows to achieve an excellent agreement up to 250 MeV.
