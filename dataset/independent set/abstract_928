Metal-insulator transition in anisotropic disordered Anderson model with both
topological and diagonal disorder is investigated numerically. For four sets of
the model parameters we found the critical disorder and the critical exponent
and prove that they do not depend on the transport direction. The system size
independent critical conductance distribution P_c(g) is found for each critical
point. The form of P_c(g) depends on the model parameters and on the direction
of the treansport. Arguments in favor of the one-parameter scaling are
presented.
