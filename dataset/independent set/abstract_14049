Computational analyses of, e.g., genomic, proteomic, or metabolomic data,
commonly result in one or more sets of candidate genes, proteins, or enzymes.
These sets are often the outcome of clustering algorithms. Subsequently, it has
to be tested if, e.g., the candidate gene-products are members of known
metabolic processes. With OrfMapper we provide a powerful but easy-to-use,
web-based database application, that supports such analyses. All services
