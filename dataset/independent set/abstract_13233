This paper describes topological searches for neutral scalar bosons S0
produced in association with a Z0 boson via the Bjorken process e+e- -> S0Z0 at
centre-of-mass energies of 91 GeV and 183-209 GeV. These searches are based on
studies of the recoil mass spectrum of Z0 -> e+e- and mu+mu- events on a search
for S0Z0 with Z0 -> nunu bar and S0 -> e+e- or photons. They cover the decays
of the S0 into an arbitrary combination of hadrons, leptons, photons and
invisible particles as well as the possibility that it might be stable. No
indication for a signal is found in the data and upper limits on the cross
section of the Bjorken process are calculated. Cross-section limits are given
in terms of a scale factor k with respect to the Standrad Model cross section
for the Higgs-strahlung process e+e- -> H0smZ0. These results can be
interpreted in general scenarios independently of the decay modes of the S0.
The examples considered here are the production of a single new scalar particle
with a decay width smaller than the detector mass resolution, and for the first
time, two scenarios with continuous mass distributions, due to a single very
broad state or several states close in mass.
