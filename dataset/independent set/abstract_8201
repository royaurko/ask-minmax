The $C^1$-structurally stable diffeomorphims of a compact manifold are those
that satisfy Axiom A and the strong transversality condition (AS). We
generalize the concept of AS from diffeomorphisms to invariant compact subsets.
Among other properties, we show the structural stability of the AS invariant
compact sets $K$ of surface diffeomorphisms $f$. Moreover if $\hat f$ is the
dynamics of a compact manifold, which fibers over $f$ and such that the bundle
is normally hyperbolic over the non-wandering set of $f_{|K}$, then the bundle
over $K$ is persistent. This provides non trivial examples of persistent
laminations that are not normally hyperbolic.
