We study rational surfaces having an even set of disjoint $(-4)$-curves. The
properties of the surface $S$ obtained by considering the double cover branched
on the even set are studied. It is shown, that contrarily to what happens for
even sets of $(-2)$-curves, the number of curves in an even set of
$(-4)$-curves is bounded (less or equal to 12). The surface $S$ has always
Kodaira dimension bigger or equal to zero and the cases of Kodaira dimension
zero and one are completely characterized. Several examples of this situation
are given.
