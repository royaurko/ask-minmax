Exact time-dependent solutions of nonrelativistic noncommutative Chern -
Simons gauge theory are presented in closed analytic form. They are different
from (indeed orthogonal to) those discussed recently by Hadasz, Lindstrom,
Rocek and von Unge. Unlike theirs, our solutions can move with an arbitrary
constant velocity, and can be obtained from the previously known static
solutions by the recently found ``exotic'' boost symmetry.
