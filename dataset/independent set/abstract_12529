We study the effect of parton angular momentum on the twist-four correction
to the left-right asymmetry in the electron-deuteron parity-violating deep
inelastic scattering (PVDIS). We show that this higher-twist correction is
transparent to the dynamics of parton angular momentum needed to account for
the Sivers and Boer-Mulders functions and spin-independent parton distribution
functions. A sufficiently precise measurement of the PVDIS asymmetry may, thus,
provide additional information about the parton dynamics responsible for
nucleon spin.
