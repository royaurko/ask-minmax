The independence of the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift on particle velocity is one
of its defining properties. The classical counterpart to this dispersionless
behavior is the absence of forces along the direction of motion of the
particle. A reevaluation of the experimental demonstration that forces are
absent in the AB physical system is given, including previously unpublished
data. It is shown that the debate on the presence or absence of forces is not
settled, and an experiment searching for dispersionless forces is proposed.
