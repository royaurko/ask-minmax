This paper presents some general formulas for random partitions of a finite
set derived by Kingman's model of random sampling from an interval partition
generated by subintervals whose lengths are the points of a Poisson point
process. These lengths can be also interpreted as the jumps of a subordinator,
that is an increasing process with stationary independent increments. Examples
include the two-parameter family of Poisson-Dirichlet models derived from the
Poisson process of jumps of a stable subordinator. Applications are made to the
random partition generated by the lengths of excursions of a Brownian motion or
Brownian bridge conditioned on its local time at zero.
