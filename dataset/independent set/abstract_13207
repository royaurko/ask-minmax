We study zero-temperature, stochastic Ising models sigma(t) on a
d-dimensional cubic lattice with (disordered) nearest-neighbor couplings
independently chosen from a distribution mu on R and an initial spin
configuration chosen uniformly at random. Given d, call mu type I (resp., type
F) if, for every x in the lattice, sigma(x,t) flips infinitely (resp., only
finitely) many times as t goes to infinity (with probability one) --- or else
mixed type M. Models of type I and M exhibit a zero-temperature version of
``local non-equilibration''. For d=1, all types occur and the type of any mu is
easy to determine. The main result of this paper is a proof that for d=2,
plus/minus J models (where each coupling is independently chosen to be +J with
probability alpha and -J with probability 1-alpha) are type M, unlike
homogeneous models (type I) or continuous (finite mean) mu's (type F). We also
prove that all other noncontinuous disordered systems are type M for any d
greater than or equal to 2. The plus/minus J proof is noteworthy in that it is
much less ``local'' than the other (simpler) proof. Homogeneous and plus/minus
J models for d greater than or equal to 3 remain an open problem.
