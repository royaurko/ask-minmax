We characterize the statistical and geometrical properties of the
cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry in a statistically-steady forced rotating
turbulence experiment. Turbulence is generated by a set of vertical flaps which
continuously inject velocity fluctuations towards the center of a tank mounted
on a rotating platform. We first characterize the cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry
from conventional single-point vorticity statistics. We propose a
phenomenological model to explain the emergence of the asymmetry in the
experiment, from which we predict scaling laws for the root-mean-square
velocity in good agreement with the experimental data. We further quantify the
cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry using a set of third-order two-point velocity
correlations. We focus on the correlations which are nonzero only if the
cyclone-anticyclone symmetry is broken. They offer two advantages over
single-point vorticity statistics: first, they are defined from velocity
measurements only, so an accurate resolution of the Kolmogorov scale is not
required; second, they provide information on the scale-dependence of the
cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry. We compute these correlation functions
analytically for a random distribution of independent identical vortices. These
model correlations describe well the experimental ones, indicating that the
cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry is dominated by the large-scale long-lived
cyclones.
