We consider the problem of the determination of the isotropy classes of the
orbit spaces of all the real linear groups, with three independent basic
invariants satisfying only one independent relation. The results are obtained
in the $\hat P$-matrix approach solving a universal differential equation ({\em
master equation}) which involves as free parameters only the degrees $d_a$ of
the invariants. We begin with some remarks which show how the $\hat{P}$-matrix
approach may be relevant in physical contexts where the study of invariant
functions is important, like in the analysis of phase spaces and structural
phase transitions (Landau's theory).
