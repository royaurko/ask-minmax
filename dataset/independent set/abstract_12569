We study the mean number of encounters up to time t, E_N(t), taking place in
a subspace with dimension d* of a d-dimensional lattice, for N independent
random walkers starting simultaneously from the same origin. E_N is first
evaluated analytically in a continuum approximation and numerically through
Monte Carlo simulations in one and two dimensions. Then we introduce the notion
of the intersection of strongly anisotropic fractals and use it to calculate
the long-time behaviour of E_N.
