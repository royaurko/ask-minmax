A measurement of the W boson mass using 4.3 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity
collected with the D0 detector during Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron collider
is presented. Based on a sample of 1.68 * 10^6 W->enu candidate events, the W
boson mass is measured to be M_W = 80.367 +/- 0.026 GeV. Combining this result
with an earlier D0 result determined using an independent Run II data sample of
1 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity, yields M_W = 80.375 +/- 0.023 GeV.
