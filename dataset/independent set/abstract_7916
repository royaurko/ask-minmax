We study the symmetry breaking phenomenon for an elliptic equation involving
the fractional Laplacian in a large ball. Our main tool is an extension of the
Strauss radial lemma involving the fractional Laplacian, which might be of
independent interest; and from which we derive compact embedding theorems for a
Sobolev-type space of radial functions with power weights.
