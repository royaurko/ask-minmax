We present here an elementary construction of an aperiodic tile set. Although
there already exist dozens of examples of aperiodic tile sets we believe this
construction introduces an approach that is different enough to be interesting
and that the whole construction and the proof of aperiodicity are hopefully
simpler than most existing techniques.
