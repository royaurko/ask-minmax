Most research related to unithood were conducted as part of a larger effort
for the determination of termhood. Consequently, novelties are rare in this
small sub-field of term extraction. In addition, existing work were mostly
empirically motivated and derived. We propose a new probabilistically-derived
measure, independent of any influences of termhood, that provides dedicated
measures to gather linguistic evidence from parsed text and statistical
evidence from Google search engine for the measurement of unithood. Our
comparative study using 1,825 test cases against an existing
empirically-derived function revealed an improvement in terms of precision,
recall and accuracy.
