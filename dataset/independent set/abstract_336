This article introduces a multi-object filter for the resolution of joint
detection/tracking problems involving multiple targets, derived from the novel
Bayesian estimation framework for stochastic populations. Fully probabilistic
in nature, the filter for Distinguishable and Independent Stochastic
Populations (DISP) exploits two exclusive probabilistic representations for the
potential targets. The distinguishable targets are those for which individual
information is available through past detections; they are represented by
individual tracks. The indistinguishable targets are those for which no
individual information is available yet; they are represented collectively by a
single stochastic population. Assuming that targets are independent, and
adopting the "at most one measurement per scan per target" rule, the DISP
filter propagates the set of all possible tracks, with associated credibility,
based on the sequence of measurement sets collected by the sensor so far. A few
filtering approximations, aiming at curtailing the computational cost of a
practical implementation, are also discussed.
