We study the expressive power of fragments of inclusion and independence
logic defined either by restricting the number of universal quantifiers or the
arity of inclusion and independence atoms in formulas. Assuming the so-called
lax semantics for these logics, we relate these fragments of inclusion and
independence logic to familiar sublogics of existential second-order logic. We
also show that, with respect to the stronger strict semantics, inclusion logic
is equivalent to existential second-order logic.
