This talk summarizes a method for analyzing the properties of any new scalar
particle, which is systematic in the sense that it minimizes apriori
theoretical assumptions about the properties of the scalar particle, leading to
very model-independent results. This kind of analysis lends itself to
systematic survey through the terrain of candidate theories, which we find has
vast unpopulated areas. It is also useful for quantifying the comparison of the
goodness of fit of competing descriptions of data, should a new scalar be
found.
