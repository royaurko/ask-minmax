A method is described for dealing with effective theories of hadron
scattering. It allows one to reduce the number of independent renormalization
prescriptions in those theories and gives a possibility to make numerical
predictions. As an illustration, we show the results of comparison with the
known data on $\pi\pi$, $\pi K$ and $\pi N$ elastic scattering. This work
presents a generalization and the further development of our results first
discussed at the MENU'99 Symposium
