While the asymptotic stability of positive linear systems in the presence of
bounded time delays has been thoroughly investigated, the theory for nonlinear
positive systems is considerably less well-developed. This paper presents a set
of conditions for establishing delay-independent stability and bounding the
decay rate of a significant class of nonlinear positive systems which includes
positive linear systems as a special case. Specifically, when the time delays
have a known upper bound, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for
exponential stability of (a) continuous-time positive systems whose vector
fields are homogeneous and cooperative, and (b) discrete-time positive systems
whose vector fields are homogeneous and order preserving. We then present
explicit expressions that allow us to quantify the impact of delays on the
decay rate and show that the best decay rate of positive linear systems that
our bounds provide can be found via convex optimization. Finally, we extend the
results to general linear systems with time-varying delays.
