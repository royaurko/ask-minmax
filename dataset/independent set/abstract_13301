Models of coevolution have recently been studied, in which a species is
defined by a genome in the form of a bitstring, and the interactions between
species i and j are given by a fixed matrix with independent, randomly
distributed elements M_{ij}. A consequence of the stochastic independence is
that species whose genotypes differ even by a single bit may have completely
different phenotypes. This is clearly unrealistic, as closely related species
should be similar in their interactions with the rest of the ecosystem. Here we
therefore study a model, in which the M_{ij} are correlated to a controllable
degree. We calculate, both analytically and numerically, the correlation
function for matrix elements M_{ij} and M_{kl} versus the Hamming distance
between the bitstrings representing the species. We compare Monte Carlo
simulations of coevolution models with uncorrelated and correlated
interactions. In particular, we consider the lifetimes of individual species.
The species-lifetime distribution is close to a power law with an exponent near
-2 in both uncorrelated and correlated cases. The durations of quasi-steady
states and power spectral densities for the diversity indices display
noticeable differences. However, some qualitative features, like 1/f behaviour
in power spectral densities for the diversity indices, are not affected by the
correlations in the interaction matrix.
