This paper deals with the dimension reduction for high-dimensional time
series based on common factors. In particular we allow the dimension of time
series $p$ to be as large as, or even larger than, the sample size $n$. The
estimation for the factor loading matrix and the factor process itself is
carried out via an eigenanalysis for a $p\times p$ non-negative definite
matrix. We show that when all the factors are strong in the sense that the norm
of each column in the factor loading matrix is of the order $p^{1/2}$, the
estimator for the factor loading matrix, as well as the resulting estimator for
the precision matrix of the original $p$-variant time series, are weakly
consistent in $L_2$-norm with the convergence rates independent of $p$. This
result exhibits clearly that the `curse' is canceled out by the `blessings' in
dimensionality. We also establish the asymptotic properties of the estimation
when not all factors are strong. For the latter case, a two-step estimation
procedure is preferred accordingly to the asymptotic theory. The proposed
methods together with their asymptotic properties are further illustrated in a
simulation study. An application to a real data set is also reported.
