One of the persistent complications in searches for transiting exoplanets is
the low percentage of the detected candidates that ultimately prove to be
planets, which significantly increases the load on the telescopes used for the
follow-up observations to confirm or reject candidates. Several attempts have
been made at creating techniques that can pare down candidate lists without the
need of additional observations. Some of these techniques involve a detailed
analysis of light curve characteristics; others estimate the stellar density or
some proxy thereof. In this paper, we extend upon this second approach,
exploring the use of independently-calculated stellar densities to identify the
most promising transiting exoplanet candidates. We use a set of CoRoT
candidates and the set of known transiting exoplanets to examine the potential
of this approach. In particular, we note the possibilities inherent in the
high-precision photometry from space missions, which can detect stellar
asteroseismic pulsations from which accurate stellar densities can be extracted
without additional observations.
