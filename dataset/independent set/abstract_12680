We study the modes of evolution of massless scalar fields in the
asymptotically AdS spacetime surrounding maximally symmetric black holes of
large and intermediate size in the Lovelock model. It is observed that all
modes are purely damped at higher orders. Also, the rate of damping is seen to
be independent of order at higher dimensions. The asymptotic form of these
frequencies for the case of large black holes is found analytically. Finally,
the area spectrum for such black holes is found from these asymptotic modes.
