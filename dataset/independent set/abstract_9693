It is shown that the decomposition theorems for symmetric spatial second-rank
tensors, such as the perturbed metric and perturbed Ricci tensor, and the
spatial fluid velocity vector imply that, for open, flat or closed
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universes, there are exactly two, unique,
independent gauge-invariant quantities which describe the perturbations to the
energy density and particle number density.
  Using these two new quantities, evolution equations for cosmological density
perturbations, adapted to non-barotropic equations of state for the pressure,
are derived. The new definitions for the perturbations to the energy density
and particle number density allow for an exact non-relativistic limit with a
time-independent Newtonian potential. It is shown that density perturbations
evolve adiabatically if and only if the particle number density does not
contribute to the pressure.
