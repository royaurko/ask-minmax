A maximum stable set in a graph G is a stable set of maximum cardinality. S
is a local maximum stable set if it is a maximum stable set of the subgraph of
G spanned by the union of S and N(S), where N(S) is the neighborhood of S. One
theorem of Nemhauser and Trotter Jr., working as a useful sufficient local
optimality condition for the weighted maximum stable set problem, ensures that
any local maximum stable set of G can be enlarged to a maximum stable set of G.
In this paper we demonstrate that an inverse assertion is true for forests.
Namely, we show that for any non-empty local maximum stable set S of a forest T
there exists a local maximum stable set S1 of T, such that S1 is included in S
and |S1| = |S| - 1. Moreover, as a further strengthening of both the theorem of
Nemhauser and Trotter Jr. and its inverse, we prove that the family of all
local maximum stable sets of a forest forms a greedoid on its vertex set.
