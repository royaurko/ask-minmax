In this paper a new mining algorithm is defined based on frequent item set.
Apriori Algorithm scans the database every time when it finds the frequent item
set so it is very time consuming and at each step it generates candidate item
set. So for large databases it takes lots of space to store candidate item set
.In undirected item set graph, it is improvement on apriori but it takes time
and space for tree generation. The defined algorithm scans the database at the
start only once and then from that scanned data base it generates the Trade
List. It contains the information of whole database. By considering minimum
support it finds the frequent item set and by considering the minimum
confidence it generates the association rule. If database and minimum support
is changed, the new algorithm finds the new frequent items by scanning Trade
List. That is why it's executing efficiency is improved distinctly compared to
traditional algorithm.
