The near-threshold expansion of the $\pi \pi$ amplitude is developed using
the crossing-covariant independent variables. The independent threshold
parameters entering the real part of the amplitude in an explicitly
Lorentz-invariant way are free from restrictions of isotopic and crossing
symmetries. Parameters of the expansion of the imaginary part are recovered by
the perturbative unitarity relations.
