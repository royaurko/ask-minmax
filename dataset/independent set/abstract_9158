To avoid misleading discrepancies between results of different dark matter
search experiments as well as between the data and SUSY calculations it is in
general preferable to use a mixed spin-scalar coupling approach in which
spin-independent and spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon couplings are both non-zero.
On the other hand one may, however, to safely neglect the subdominant spin
WIMP-nucleon contribution in comparison with the spin-independent one in
analysis of data from experiments with heavy enough non-zero-spin target
nuclei. The mixed coupling approach is applied to estimate future prospects of
experiments with the odd-neutron high-spin isotope Ge-73.
