We study the existence of traveling wave solutions for a diffusive
predator-prey system. The system considered in this paper is governed by a
Sigmoidal response function which is more general than those studied
previously. Our method is an improvement to the original method introduced in
the work of Dunbar \cite{Dunbar1,Dunbar2}. A bounded Wazewski set is used in
this work while unbounded Wazewski sets were used in \cite{Dunbar1,Dunbar2}.
The existence of traveling wave solutions connecting two equilibria is
established by using the original Wazewski's theorem which is much simpler than
the extended version in Dunbar's work.
