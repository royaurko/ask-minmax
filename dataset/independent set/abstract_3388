Mobile apps can access a wide variety of secure information, such as contacts
and location. However, current mobile platforms include only coarse access
control mechanisms to protect such data. In this paper, we introduce
interaction-based declassification policies, in which the user's interactions
with the app constrain the release of sensitive information. Our policies are
defined extensionally, so as to be independent of the app's implementation,
based on sequences of security-relevant events that occur in app runs. Policies
use LTL formulae to precisely specify which secret inputs, read at which times,
may be released. We formalize a semantic security condition, interaction-based
noninterference, to define our policies precisely. Finally, we describe a
prototype tool that uses symbolic execution to check interaction-based
declassification policies for Android, and we show that it enforces policies
correctly on a set of apps.
