A finite set X in a metric space M is called an s-distance set if the set of
distances between any two distinct points of X has size s. The main problem for
s-distance sets is to determine the maximum cardinality of s-distance sets for
fixed s and M. In this paper, we improve the known upper bound for s-distance
sets in n-sphere for s=3,4. In particular, we determine the maximum
cardinalities of three-distance sets for n=7 and 21. We also give the maximum
cardinalities of s-distance sets in the Hamming space and the Johnson space for
several s and dimensions.
