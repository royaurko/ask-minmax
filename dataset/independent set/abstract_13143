We investigate the consistency of visual morphological classifications of
galaxies by comparing classifications for 831 galaxies from six independent
observers. The galaxies were classified on laser print copy images or on
computer screen produced from scans with the Automated Plate Measuring (APM)
machine. Classifications are compared using the Revised Hubble numerical type
index T. We find that individual observers agree with one another with rms
combined dispersions of between 1.3 and 2.3 type units, typically about 1.8
units. The dispersions tend to decrease slightly with increasing angular
diameter and, in some cases, with increasing axial ratio $(b/a)$. The agreement
between independent observers is reasonably good but the scatter is
non-negligible. In spite of the scatter the Revised Hubble T system can be used
to train an automated galaxy classifier, e.g. an Artificial Neural Network, to
handle the large number of galaxy images that are being compiled in the APM and
other surveys.
