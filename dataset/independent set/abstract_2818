Associated to a simple undirected graph G is a simplicial complex whose faces
correspond to the independent sets of G. We call a graph G shellable if this
simplicial complex is a shellable simplicial complex in the non-pure sense of
Bjorner-Wachs. We are then interested in determining what families of graphs
have the property that G is shellable. We show that all chordal graphs are
shellable. Furthermore, we classify all the shellable bipartite graphs; they
are precisely the sequentially Cohen-Macaulay bipartite graphs. We also give an
recursive procedure to verify if a bipartite graph is shellable. Because
shellable implies that the associated Stanley-Reisner ring is sequentially
Cohen-Macaulay, our results complement and extend recent work on the problem of
determining when the edge ideal of a graph is (sequentially) Cohen-Macaulay. We
also give a new proof for a result of Faridi on the sequentially
Cohen-Macaulayness of simplicial forests.
