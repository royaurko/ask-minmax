The 2 cm VLBA Survey observed since 1994 a set of ~170 Quasars, BL Lac
objects, and radio galaxies, selected to be representative of the compact AGN
radio population. This effort was continued as the MOJAVE project, where a
statistically complete set of radio sources being monitored was defined. A
comparison of the gamma-detection rates between the members of both samples
shows that the MOJAVE-I sources, hosting generally faster jets, have a much
higher detection rate than the sources not belonging to this sample. BL Lac
objects are more favourably detected than QSOs in gamma-rays, in the same rate
for both samples.
