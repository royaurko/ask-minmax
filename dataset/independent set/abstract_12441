We have synthesized and characterized laser-deposited film samples of
perovskite BaCrO_{3}, a missing member of the perovskite-chromate family. The
BaCrO_{3} films have a substantially larger lattice constant than other
chromates, are insulating, and exhibit weak ferromagnetism likely associated
with canted antiferromagnetism. Comparison with the other sister compounds
CaCrO_{3} and SrCrO_{3} suggest an anomalous Mott transition where magnetism is
independent of whether the compound is metallic or insulating
