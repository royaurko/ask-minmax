The coincidence problem of late cosmic acceleration is a serious riddle in
connection with our understanding of the evolution of the Universe. In this
paper we show that an interaction between the dark energy component (either
phantom or quintessence) and dark matter can alleviate it. In this scenario the
baryon component is independently conserved. This generalizes a previous study
[S. del Campo, R. Herrera, and D. Pavon, Phys. Rev. D 71, 123529 (2005)] in
which neither baryons nor phantom energy were considered.
