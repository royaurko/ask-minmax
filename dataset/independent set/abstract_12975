We report a hybrid mesophase consisting of magnetic nanorods confined between
the non-ionic surfactant bilayers of a lamellar phase. The magnetic
field-induced ordering of the nanorods was measured experimentally and modeled
by a two-dimensional Onsager theory including the third virial coefficient. The
nanorods are strongly confined in layers, with no orientational coupling from
one layer to the next. At high volume concentration they exhibit spontaneous
in-plane orientational ordering and form a stack of independent two-dimensional
nematic systems. This isotropic-nematic transition is first-order.
