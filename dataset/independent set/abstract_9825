Algebraic-geometric codes can be constructed by evaluating a certain set of
functions on a set of distinct rational points of an algebraic curve. The set
of functions that are evaluated is the linear space of a given divisor or,
equivalently, the set of section of a given line bundle. Using arbitrary rank
vector bundles on algebraic curves, we propose a natural generalization of the
above construction. Our codes can also be seen as interleaved versions of
classical algebraic-geometric codes. We show that the algorithm of Brown,
Minder and Shokrollahi can be extended to this new class of codes and it
corrects any number of errors up to $t^{*} - g/2$, where $t^{*}$ is the
designed correction capacity of the code and $g$ is the curve genus.
