Bell's inequality is investigated for the three qubit GHZ state in
relativistic regime. Two different relativistic spin operator are considered.
One of them is defined by Lee, and the other is the Pauli-Lubanski pseudovector
used by Kim \textit{et al}. It is shown that for both spin operator Bell's
inequality is still maximally violated in a Lorentz-boosted frame.
