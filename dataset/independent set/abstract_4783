The abstract boundary uses sets of curves with the bounded parameter property
(b.p.p.) to classify the elements of the abstract boundary into regular points,
singular points, points at infinity and so on. To study how the classification
changes as this set of curves is changed it is necessary to describe the
relationships between these sets of curves in a way that reflects the effect of
the curves on the classification. The usual algebra of sets fails to do this.
We remedy this situation by generalising inclusion, intersection, and union:
producing an algebra of sets on the set of all b.p.p. satisfying sets of curves
that does appropriately describe the relative effects on the classification. In
Part II we use this algebra of sets to show how the classification changes as
the set of b.p.p. satisfying set of curves is changed with respect to this
generalization.
