We propose a new model-independent method, to determine the ratio
$|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$, which is theoretically described by the phase space factor
and the well-known perturbative QCD correction only. We explore the possible
experimental options: the measurement of inclusive hadronic invariant mass
distributions. We also discuss the relevant experimental backgrounds.
