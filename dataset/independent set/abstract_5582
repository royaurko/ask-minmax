A set S of vertices of a connected graph G is convex, if for any pair of
vertices u; v 2 S, every shortest path joining u and v is contained in S . The
convex hull CH(S) of a set of vertices S is defined as the smallest convex set
in G containing S. The set S is geodetic, if every vertex of G lies on some
shortest path joining two vertices in S, and it is said to be a hull set if its
convex hull is V(G). The geodetic and the hull numbers of G are the cardinality
of a minimum geodetic and a minimum hull set, respectively. In this work, we
investigate the behavior of both geodetic and hull sets with respect to the
strong product operation for graphs. We also stablish some bounds for the
geodetic number and the hull number and obtain the exact value of these
parameters for a number of strong product graphs.
