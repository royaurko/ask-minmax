The problem of joint source-channel coding in transmitting independent
sources over interference channels with correlated receiver side information is
studied. When each receiver has side information correlated with its own
desired source, it is shown that source-channel code separation is optimal.
When each receiver has side information correlated with the interfering source,
sufficient conditions for reliable transmission are provided based on a joint
source-channel coding scheme using the superposition encoding and partial
decoding idea of Han and Kobayashi. When the receiver side information is a
deterministic function of the interfering source, source-channel code
separation is again shown to be optimal. As a special case, for a class of
Z-interference channels, when the side information of the receiver facing
interference is a deterministic function of the interfering source, necessary
and sufficient conditions for reliable transmission are provided in the form of
single letter expressions. As a byproduct of these joint source-channel coding
results, the capacity region of a class of Z-channels with degraded message
sets is also provided.
