We prove that complex Bernoulli convolutions are absolutely continuous in the
supercritical parameter region, outside of an exceptional set of parameters of
zero Hausdorff dimension. Similar results are also obtained in the biased case,
and for other parametrized families of self-similar sets and measures in the
complex plane, extending earlier results.
