This paper describes a natural framework for rules, based on belief
functions, which includes a repre- sentation of numerical rules, default rules
and rules allowing and rules not allowing contraposition. In particular it
justifies the use of the Dempster-Shafer Theory for representing a particular
class of rules, Belief calculated being a lower probability given certain
independence assumptions on an underlying space. It shows how a belief function
framework can be generalised to other logics, including a general Monte-Carlo
algorithm for calculating belief, and how a version of Reiter's Default Logic
can be seen as a limiting case of a belief function formalism.
