For finite sets of integers $A_1, A_2 ... A_n$ we study the cardinality of
the $n$-fold sumset $A_1+...
  +A_n$ compared to those of $n-1$-fold sumsets $A_1+...
  +A_{i-1}+A_{i+1}+... A_n$. We prove a superadditivity and a
submultiplicativity property for these quantities. We also examine the case
when the addition of elements is restricted to an addition graph between the
sets.
