By modifying the method of Bruss and Peres, we construct two new families of
entangled two qutrit states. For all density matrices in these families the
(i,j)th entry is 0 for i+j odd. The first family depends on 27 independent real
parameters and includes both PPT and NPT states. The second family consists of
PPT entangled states. The number of independent real parameters of this family
is at least 11.
