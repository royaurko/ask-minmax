We propose a scheme to generate GHZ state of nitrogen-vacancy centers coupled
to a whispering-gallery mode cavity. The implemented evolution is independent
on the cavity field state with the assistant of a strong classical field, and
thus not sensitive to the thermal state of the cavity. Meanwhile, it is fast
compare to the convectional dispersive interaction induced operation in a
cavity-assisted system. The scheme is readily scalable to multiqubit scenario.
