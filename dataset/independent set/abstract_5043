We prove a multiple recurrence result for arbitrary measure-preserving
transformations along polynomials in two variables of the form m+p_i(n), with
rationally independent p_i's with zero constant term. This is in contrast to
the single variable case, in which even double recurrence fails unless the
transformations generate a virtually nilpotent group. The proof involves
reduction to nilfactors and an equidistribution result on nilmanifolds.
