The Social Web is a set of social relations that link people through World
Wide Web. This Social Web encompasses how the websites and software are
designed and developed to support social relations. The new paradigms, tools
and web services introduced by Social Web are widely accepted by internet
users. The main drawbacks of these tools are it acts as independent data silos;
hence interoperability among applications is a complex issue. This paper
