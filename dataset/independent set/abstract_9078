We calculate the proton's magnetic moment $\mu_p$ and its axial-vector
coupling $g_A$ as a function of its Dirac radius $R_1$ using a relativisitic
three-quark model formulated on the light-cone. The relationship between
$\mu_p$ and $g_A$ is found to be independent of the assumed form of the
light-cone wavefunction. At the physical radius $R_1=0.76$ fm, one obtains the
experimental values for both $\mu_p$ and $g_A$, and the helicity carried by the
valence $u$ and $d$ quarks are each reduced by a factor $\simeq 0.75$ relative
to their non-relativistic values. At large proton radius, $\mu_p$ and $g_A$ are
given by the usual non-relativistic formulae. At small radius, $\mu_p$ becomes
equal to the Dirac moment, as demanded by the Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov sum rule.
In addition, as $R_1 \to 0,$ the constituent quark helicities become completely
disoriented and $g_A \to 0$.
