A Bayesian analysis is carried out to identify the consistent regions of the
mSUGRA parameter space, where the newly-discovered Higgs boson's mass is used
as a constraint, along with other experimental constraints. It is found that
$m_{1/2}$ can lie in the sub-TeV region, $A_0/m_0$ is mostly confined to a
narrow strip with $|A_0/m_0| \leq 1$, while $m_0$ is typically a TeV or larger.
Further, the Bayesian analysis is used to set 95% CL lower bounds on sparticle
masses. Additionally, it is shown that the spin independent neutralino-proton
cross section lies just beyond the reach of the current sensitivity but within
the projected sensitivity of the SuperCDMS-1T and XENON-1T experiments, which
explains why dark matter has thus far not been detected. The light sparticle
spectrum relevant for the discovery of supersymmetry at the LHC are seen to be
the gluino, the chargino and the stop with the gluino and the chargino as the
most likely candidates.
