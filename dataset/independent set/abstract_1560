For finite dimensional Hamiltonian systems derived from 1+1 dimensional
integrable systems, if they have Lax representations, then the Lax operator
creates a set of conserved integrals. When these conserved integrals are in
involution, it is believed quite popularly that there will be enough
functionally independent ones among them to guarantee the Liouville
integrability of the Hamiltonian systems, at least for those derived from
physical problems. In this paper, we give a counterexample based on the U(2)
principal chiral field. It is proved that the finite dimensional Hamiltonian
systems derived from the U(2) principal chiral field are Liouville integrable.
Moreover, their Lax operator gives a set of involutive conserved integrals, but
they are not enough to guarantee the integrability of the Hamiltonian systems.
