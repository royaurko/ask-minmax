We report extensive calculations of the decay properties of fine-structure
K-vacancy levels in Fe X-Fe XVII. A large set of level energies, wavelengths,
radiative and Auger rates, and fluorescence yields has been computed using
three different standard atomic codes, namely Cowan's HFR, AUTOSTRUCTURE and
the Breit-Pauli R-matrix package. This multi-code approach is used to the study
the effects of core relaxation, configuration interaction and the Breit
interaction, and enables the estimate of statistical accuracy ratings. The
K-alpha and KLL Auger widths have been found to be nearly independent of both
the outer-electron configuration and electron occupancy keeping a constant
ratio of 1.53+/-0.06. By comparing with previous theoretical and measured
wavelengths, the accuracy of the present set is determined to be within 2 mA.
Also, the good agreement found between the different radiative and Auger data
sets that have been computed allow us to propose with confidence an accuracy
rating of 20% for the line fluorescence yields greater than 0.01. Emission and
absorption spectral features are predicted finding good correlation with
measurements in both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.
