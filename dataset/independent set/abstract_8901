We introduce two kinds of generalized $s$-convex functions on real linear
fractal sets $\mathbb{R}^{\alpha}(0<\alpha<1)$. And similar to the class
situation, we also study the properties of these two kinds of generalized
$s$-convex functions and discuss the relationship between them. Furthermore,
some applications are given.
