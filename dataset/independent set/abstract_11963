Given a finite subset S in F_p^d, let a(S) be the number of distinct r-tuples
(x_1,...,x_r) in S such that x_1+...+x_r = 0. We consider the "moments" F(m,n)
= sum_|S|=n a(S)^m. Specifically, we present an explicit formula for F(m,n) as
a product of two matrices, ultimately yielding a polynomial in q=p^d. The first
matrix is independent of n while the second makes no mention of finite fields.
However, the complexity of calculating each grows with m. The main tools here
are the Schur-Weyl duality theorem, and some elementary properties of symmetric
functions. This problem is closely to the study of maximal caps.
