In his papers [2], [3] Brin introduced the higher dimensional Thompson groups
nV which are generalizations to the Thompson's group V of self-homeomorphisms
of the Cantor set and found a finite set of generators and relations in the
case n = 2. We show how to generalize his construction to obtain a finite
presentation for every positive integer n. As a corollary, we obtain another
proof that the groups nV are simple (first proved by Brin in [4]).
