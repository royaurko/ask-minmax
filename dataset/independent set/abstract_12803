We study the scattering of matter-waves from interacting bosons in a
one-dimensional optical lattice, described by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We
derive analytically a formula for the inelastic cross section as a function of
the atomic interaction in the lattice, employing Bogoliubov's formalism for
small condensate depletion. A linear decay of the inelastic cross section for
weak interaction, independent of number of particles, condensate depletion and
system size, is found.
