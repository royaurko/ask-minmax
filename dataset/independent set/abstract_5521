We study properties of particular non-redundant sets of if-then rules
describing dependencies between graded attributes. We introduce notions of
saturation and witnessed non-redundancy of sets of graded attribute
implications are show that bases of graded attribute implications given by
systems of pseudo-intents correspond to non-redundant sets of graded attribute
implications with saturated consequents where the non-redundancy is witnessed
by antecedents of the contained graded attribute implications. We introduce an
algorithm which transforms any complete set of graded attribute implications
parameterized by globalization into a base given by pseudo-intents.
Experimental evaluation is provided to compare the method of obtaining bases
for general parameterizations by hedges with earlier graph-based approaches.
