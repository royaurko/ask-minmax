This is an introductory paper about our recent merge of a noncommutative de
Finetti type result with representations of the infinite braid and symmetric
group which allows to derive factorization properties from symmetries. We
explain some of the main ideas of this approach and work out a constructive
procedure to use in applications. Finally we illustrate the method by applying
it to the theory of group characters.
