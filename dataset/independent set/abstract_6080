In 1943, Littlewood and Offord proved the first anti-concentration result for
sums of independent random variables. Their result has since then been
strengthened and generalized by generations of researchers, with applications
in several areas of mathematics.
  In this paper, we present the first non-abelian analogue of Littlewood-Offord
result, a sharp anti-concentration inequality for products of independent
random variables.
