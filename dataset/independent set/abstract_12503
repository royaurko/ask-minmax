A new universal coding/decoding scheme for random access with collision
detection is given in the case of two senders. The result is used to give an
achievable joint source-channel coding error exponent for multiple access
channels in the case of independent sources. This exponent is improved in a
modified model that admits error free 0 rate communication between the senders.
