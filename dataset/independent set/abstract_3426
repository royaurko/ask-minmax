Statistical node clustering in discrete time dynamic networks is an emerging
field that raises many challenges. Here, we explore statistical properties and
deterministic inference in a model that combines a stochastic block model (SBM)
for its static part with independent Markov chains for the evolution of the
nodes groups through time. We model binary data as well as weighted dynamic
random graphs (with discrete or continuous edges values). Our approach
particularly focuses on the control for label switching issues across the
different time steps. We study identifiability of the model parameters, propose
an inference procedure based on a variational expectation maximization
algorithm as well as a model selection criterion to select for the number of
groups. We carefully discuss our initialization strategy which plays an
important role in the method and compare our procedure with existing ones on
synthetic datasets. We also illustrate our approach on a real data set of
encounters among high school students and provide an implementation of the
method into a R package called dynsbm.
