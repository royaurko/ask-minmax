We apply a recently developed numerical renormalization group, the
corner-transfer-matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), to 2D classical lattice
models at their critical temperatures. It is shown that the combination of
CTMRG and the finite-size scaling analysis gives two independent critical
exponents.
