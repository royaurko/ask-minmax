The new type of "bumping" of the Muckenhoupt $A_2$ condition on weights is
introduced. It is based on bumping the entropy integral of the weights. In
particular, one gets (assuming mild regularity conditions on the corresponding
Young functions) the bump conjecture, proved earlier by A. Lerner and
independently by Nazarov--Reznikov--Treil--Volberg, as a corollary of entropy
bumping. But our entropy bumps cannot be reduced to the bumping with Orlicz
norms in the solution of bump conjecture, they are effectively smaller.
Henceforth we get somewhat stronger result than the one that solves the bump
conjecture. New results concerning one sided bumping conjecture are obtained.
All the results hold in the general non-homogeneous situation.
