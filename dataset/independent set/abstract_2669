We show that we are able to extract the pion electromagnetic form factor by
using the recent charged pion electroproduction data from JLab and a simple
t-channel diagram. For this purpose we have performed the Q2-independent and
dependent analyses. The result of the first analysis is in good agreement with
those of previous works and fit the Maris and Tandy model as well as the
monopole parameterization which describes a pion radius of 0.672 fm. The result
of the second analysis corroborates the findings in the first analysis. Our
findings therefore provide a direct proof that at the given kinematics the
t-channel diagram really dominates the process. This could also set a new
constraint to the phenomenological models that try to describe the process.
