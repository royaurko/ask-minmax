In this paper we study the motion of a charged particle on a Riemannian
surface under the influence of a positive magnetic field B. Using Moser's Twist
Theorem and ideas from classical pertubation theory we find sufficient
conditions to perpetually trap the motion of a particle with a sufficiently
large charge in a neighborhood of a level set of the magnetic field. The
conditions on the level set of the magnetic field that guarantee the trapping
are local and hold near all non-degenerate critical local minima or maxima of
B. Using symplectic reduction we apply the results of our work to certain S^1 -
invariant magnetic fields on R^3.
