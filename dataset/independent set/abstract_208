For a cardinal mu we give a sufficient condition (*)_mu (involving ranks
measuring existence of independent sets) for:
  [(**)_mu] if a Borel set B subseteq R x R contains a mu-square (i.e. a set
of the form A x A, |A|= mu) then it contains a 2^{aleph_0}-square and even a
perfect square,
  and also for
  [(***)_mu] if psi in L_{omega_1, omega} has a model of cardinality mu then
it has a model of cardinality continuum generated in a nice, absolute way.
  Assuming MA + 2^{aleph_0}> mu for transparency, those three conditions
((*)_mu, (**)_mu and (***)_mu) are equivalent, and by this we get e.g.: for
all alpha<omega_1: 2^{aleph_0} >= aleph_alpha => not (**)_{aleph_alpha}, and
also min {mu :(*)_mu}, if <2^{aleph_0}, has cofinality aleph_1.
  We deal also with Borel rectangles and related model theoretic problems.
