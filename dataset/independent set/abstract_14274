We show that repelling periodic points are landing points of periodic rays
for exponential maps whose singular value has bounded orbit. For polynomials
with connected Julia sets, this is a celebrated theorem by Douady, for which we
present a new proof. In both cases we also show that points in hyperbolic sets
are accessible by at least one and at most finitely many rays. For exponentials
this allows us to conclude that the singular value itself is accessible.
