We study the joint convergence of independent copies of several patterned
matrices in the noncommutative probability setup. In particular, joint
convergence holds for the well known Wigner, Toeplitz, Hankel, reverse
circulant and symmetric circulant matrices. We also study some properties of
the limits. In particular, we show that copies of Wigner becomes asymptotically
free with copies of any of the above other matrices.
