Colloidal glasses, bird feathers, and beetle scales can all show structural
colors arising from short-ranged spatial correlations between scattering
centers. Unlike the structural colors arising from Bragg diffraction in ordered
materials like opals, the colors of these photonic glasses are independent of
orientation, owing to their disordered, isotropic microstructures. However,
there are few examples of photonic glasses with angle-independent red colors in
nature, and colloidal glasses with particle sizes chosen to yield structural
colors in the red show weak color saturation. Using scattering theory, we show
that the absence of angle-independent red color can be explained by the
tendency of individual particles to backscatter light more strongly in the
blue. We discuss how the backscattering resonances of individual particles
arise from cavity-like modes, and how they interact with the structural
resonances to prevent red. Finally, we use the model to develop design rules
for colloidal glasses with red, angle-independent structural colors.
