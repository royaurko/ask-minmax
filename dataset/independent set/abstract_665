Dirty paper coding (DPC) allows a transmitter to send information to a
receiver in the presence of interference that is known (non-causally) to the
transmitter. The original version of DPC was derived for the case where the
noise and the interference are statistically independent Gaussian random
sequences. More recent works extended this approach to the case where the noise
and the interference are mutually independent and at least one of them is
Gaussian. In this letter we further extend the DPC scheme by relaxing the
Gaussian and statistical independence assumptions. We provide lower bounds on
the achievable data rates in a DPC setting for the case of possibly dependent
noise, interference and input signals. Also, the interference and noise terms
are allowed to have arbitrary probability distributions. The bounds are
relatively simple, are phrased in terms of second-order statistics, and are
tight when the actual noise distribution is close to Gaussian.
