We present new solutions of the string cosmological effective action in the
presence of a homogeneous Maxwell field with pure magnetic component. Exact
solutions are derived in the case of space-independent dilaton and vanishing
torsion background. In our examples the four dimensional metric is either of
Bianchi-type III and VI$_{-1}$ or Kantowski-Sachs.
