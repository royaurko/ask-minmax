In the context of flux compactifications, metastable vacua with a small
positive cosmological constant are obtained by combining a sector where
supersymmetry is broken dynamically with the sector responsible for moduli
stabilization, which is known as the F-uplifting. We analyze this procedure in
a model-independent way and study phenomenological properties of the resulting
vacua.
