We consider decays of the lowest-lying radially excited baryons. Assuming a
single-quark decay approximation, and negligible configuration mixing, we make
model-independent predictions for the partial decay widths to final states with
a single meson. Masses of unobserved states are predicted using an old mass
formula rederived using large-$N_c$ QCD. The momentum dependence of the
one-body decay amplitude is determined phenomenologically by fitting to
observed decays. Comparison of these predictions to experiment may shed light
on whether the Roper resonance can be interpreted as a three-quark state.
