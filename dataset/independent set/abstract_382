A record is an entry in a time series that is larger or smaller than all
previous entries. If the time series consists of independent, identically
distributed random variables with a superimposed linear trend, record events
are positively (negatively) correlated when the tail of the distribution is
heavier (lighter) than exponential. Here we use these correlations to detect
heavy-tailed behavior in small sets of independent random variables. The method
consists of converting random subsets of the data into time series with a
tunable linear drift and computing the resulting record correlations.
