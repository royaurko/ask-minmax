We study a geometric bootstrap percolation model, line percolation, on the
d-dimensional grid [n]^d. In line percolation with infection parameter r,
infection spreads from a subset A of initially infected lattice points as
follows: if there is an axis parallel line L with r or more infected lattice
points on it, then every lattice point of [n]^d on L gets infected and we
repeat this until the infection can no longer spread. The elements of the set A
are usually chosen independently, with some density p, and the main question is
to determine p_c(n,r,d), the critical density at which percolation (infection
of the entire grid) becomes likely. In this paper, we determine p_c(n,r,2) up
to a factor of 1+o(1) and p_c(n,r,3) up to multiplicative constants as n tends
to infinity for every fixed natural number r. We also determine the size of the
minimal percolating sets in all dimensions and for all values of the infection
parameter.
