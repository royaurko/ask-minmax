We study the amoebae (in S. Favorov's sense) of finite systems of exponential
sums with real spectra. For generic systems of this type, we give a more
effective representation of the amoeba and we prove that the complementary set
to the amoeba of a system with r exponential sums is a (r-1)-convexe set.
