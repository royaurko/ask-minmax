This paper addresses the linear independence of T-splines in three space
dimensions. We give an abstract definition of analysis-suitability, and prove
that it is sufficient for linear independence of the T-spline blending
functions. In addition, we present a local refinement algorithm that generates
analysis-suitable meshes and has linear computational complexity in terms of
the number of marked and generated mesh elements.
