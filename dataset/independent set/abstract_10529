The distributions of the reflection coefficients $P(R)$ for chaotic microwave
cavities with time-reversal symmetry are investigated in different absorption
and antenna coupling regimes. In all investigated regimes the agreement between
the experimental distributions and random matrix result is very good, provided
both the antenna coupling $T_a$ and wall absorption strength $T_w$ are properly
accounted for. Those parameters are determined by independent experimental
quantities.
