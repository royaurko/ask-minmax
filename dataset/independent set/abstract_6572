A pattern class is a set of permutations closed under the formation of
subpermutations. Such classes can be characterised as those permutations not
involving a particular set of forbidden permutations. A simple collection of
necessary and sufficient conditions on sets of forbidden permutations which
ensure that the associated pattern class is of polynomial growth is determined.
A catalogue of all such sets of forbidden permutations having three or fewer
elements is provided together with bounds on the degrees of the associated
enumerating polynomials.
