In this paper we provide an up-to-date survey on the study of Lipschitz
equivalence of self-similar sets. Lipschitz equivalence is an important
property in fractal geometry because it preserves many key properties of
fractal sets. A fundamental result by Falconer and Marsh [On the Lipschitz
equivalence of Cantor sets, \textit{Mathematika}, \textbf{39} (1992), 223--233]
establishes conditions for Lipschitz equivalence based on the algebraic
properties of the contraction ratios of the self-similar sets. Recently there
has been other substantial progress in the field. This paper is a comprehensive
survey of the field. It provides a summary of the important and interesting
results in the field. In addition we provide detailed discussions on several
important techniques that have been used to prove some of the key results. It
is our hope that the paper will provide a good overview of major results and
techniques, and a friendly entry point for anyone who is interested in studying
problems in this field.
