We define the splash of a subgeometry on a projective line, extending the
definition of \cite{BaJa13} to general dimension and prove that a splash is
always a linear set. We also prove the converse: each linear set on a
projective line is the splash of some subgeometry. Therefore an alternative
description of linear sets on a projective line is obtained. We introduce the
notion of a club of rank $r$, generalizing the definition from \cite{FaSz2006},
and show that clubs correspond to tangent splashes. We determine the condition
for a splash to be a scattered linear set and give a characterization of clubs,
or equivalently of tangent splashes. We also investigate the equivalence
problem for tangent splashes and determine a necessary and sufficient condition
for two tangent splashes to be (projectively) equivalent.
