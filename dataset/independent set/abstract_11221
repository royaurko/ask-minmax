This is the second part of a two part paper. In this part, we evaluate the
previously unevaluated local densities at dyadic places which appear in the
density theorem stated in the first part. For this part, we introduce an
invariant, the level, attaced to a pair of ramified quadratic extensions of a
dyadic local field. This invariant measures how close two fields are in their
arithmetic properties and may be of interest independent of its application
here.
