The paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of (non-normalized) traces of
certain classes of matrices with non-commutative random variables as entries.
We show that, unlike in the commutative framework, the asymptotic behavior of
matrices with free circular, respectively with Bernoulli distributed Boolean
independent entries is described in terms of free, respectively Boolean
cumulants. We also present an exemple of relation of monotone independence
arising from the study of Boolean independence.
