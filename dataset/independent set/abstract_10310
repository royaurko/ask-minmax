The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect is studied in non-standard cosmologies. By
considering flat universes with a non-fluctuating dark energy component, it is
shown how the quadrupole power can be suppressed by atypical evolution of the
scale factor. For example, a brief period of non-standard evolution at a high
redshift can suppress the quadrupole significantly. The effect on the overall
normalization of the CMB power spectrum is also discussed. Non-standard
cosmologies can affect the overall normalization significantly and enhance the
primordial fluctuations. The possibility of constraining such non-standard
models with CMB and independent measures of $\sigma_8$, is considered.
