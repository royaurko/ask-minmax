We study the phase structure of a 4-fermi model with three bare coupling
constants, which potentially has three types of bound states. This model is a
generalization of the model discussed previously by A. Chodos et al. [Phys.
Rev. D 61, 045011 (2000)], which contained both chiral condensates and Cooper
pairs. For this generalization we find that there are two independent
renormalized coupling constants which determine the phase structure at finite
density and temperature. We find that the vacuum can be in one of three
distinct phases depending on the value of these two renormalized coupling
constants.
