In this paper, given a split extension of an arbitrary Coxeter group by
automorphisms of the Coxeter graph, we determine the involutions in that
extension whose centralizer has finite index. Our result has applications to
many problems such as the isomorphism problem of general Coxeter groups. In the
argument, some properties of certain special elements and of the fixed-point
subgroups by graph automorphisms in Coxeter groups, which are of independent
interest, are also given.
