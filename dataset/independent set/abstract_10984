Results are reviewed, which provide relations between the response (and
eventual instability) of the chiral QCD vacuum to an increase of the number of
massless quarks in the theory and the observed violations of the large $N_c$
expansion in the scalar meson sector, by combining chiral perturbation theory
expansions in $m_s$ with sum rule methods. An approach based on the
construction of scalar form-factors was recently confirmed by an independent
approach which uses the $\pi K$ scattering amplitudes.
