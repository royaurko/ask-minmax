We have studied the magnetotransport properties in the normal state for a
series of La1.85Sr0.15Cu(1-y)Zn(y)O4 films with values of y, between 0 and
0.12. A variable degree of compressive or tensile strain results from the
lattice mismatch between the substrate and the film, and affects the transport
properties differently from the influence of the zinc impurities. In
particular, the orbital magnetoresistance (OMR) varies with y but is
strain-independent. The relations for the resistivity and the Hall angle and
the proportionality between the OMR and tan^2 theta are followed about 70 K. We
have been able to separate the strain and impurity effects by rewriting the
above relations, where each term is strain-independent and depends on y only.
We also find that changes in the lattice constants give rise to closely the
same fractional changes in other terms of the equation.The OMR is more strongly
supressed by the addition of impurities than tan^2 theta. We conclude that the
relaxation ratethat governs Hall effect is not the same as for the
magnetoresistance. We also suggest a correspondence between the transport
properties and the opening of the pseudogap at a temperature which changes when
the La-sr ratio changes, but does not change with the addition of the zinc
impurities.
