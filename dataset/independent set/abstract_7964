The warping matrix has been defined for knot projections and knot diagrams by
using warping degrees. In particular, the warping matrix of a knot diagram
represents the knot diagram uniquely. In this paper we show that the rank of
the warping matrix is one greater than the crossing number. We also discuss the
linearly independence of knot diagrams by considering the warping incidence
matrix.
