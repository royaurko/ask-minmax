The values for the gravitational energy-momentum density, given by the famous
classical pseudotensors: Einstein, Papapetrou, Landau-Lifshitz,
Bergmann-Thompson, Goldberg, M{\o}ller, and Weinberg, in the small region limit
are found to lowest non-vanishing order in normal coordinates. All except
M{\o}ller's have the zeroth order material limit required by the equivalence
principle. However for small vacuum regions we find that {\it none} of these
classical holonomic pseudotensors satisfies the criterion of being proportional
to the Bel-Robinson tensor. Generalizing an earlier work which had identified
one case, we found another independent linear combination satisfying this
requirement--and hence a one parameter set of linear combinations of the
classical pseudotensors with this desirable property.
