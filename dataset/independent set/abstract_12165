The autonomous control system of PoGOLite is presented. PoGOLite is a balloon
borne X-ray polarimeter designed to observe point sources. To obtain scientific
data with optimal efficiency, independent of the ground connection, the payload
control system has been made autonomous in most functions. The overall system
architecture and the interconnections between components, as well as the
automation philosophy and software, are described. Results of performance tests
are given.
