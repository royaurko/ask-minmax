Properties of the set $T_s$ of "particularly non-normal numbers" of the unit
interval are studied in details ($T_s$ consists of real numbers $x$, some of
whose s-adic digits have the asymptotic frequencies in the nonterminating $s-$
adic expansion of $x$, and some do not). It is proven that the set $T_s$ is
residual in the topological sense (i.e., it is of the first Baire category) and
it is generic in the sense of fractal geometry ($T_s$ is a superfractal set,
i.e., its Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension is equal to~1). A topological and
fractal classification of sets of real numbers via analysis of asymptotic
frequencies of digits in their s-adic expansions is presented.
