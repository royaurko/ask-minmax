The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is now widely used in
many fields, and its convergence was proved when two blocks of variables are
alternately updated. It is computationally beneficial to extend the ADMM
directly to the case of a multi-block convex minimization problem.
Unfortunately, such an extension fails to converge when solving a simple square
system of linear equations. In this paper, however, we prove that, if in each
step one randomly and independently permutes the updating order of any given
number of blocks followed by the regular multiplier update, the method will
converge in expectation for solving the square system of linear equations.
