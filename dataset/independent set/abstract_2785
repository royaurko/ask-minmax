Schr\"odinger's cat appears to have been harassed in a chamber during the
past eighty years or so by interpreting the role of the observer as a person,
who sets an experiment and then observes results, may be after some time. The
realist position tells us that the physical processes would take place
independent of the observer with well defined properties, whereas the
positivist position wants us to believe that nothing can be said of a system
when it is not being observed. In this paper we question both these positions
and also the assumption that the atom and the cat are entangled and further
whether the atom could be considered to be in a state of decay and not decay.
We let the cat either out of the bag (chamber) or rest in peace with or without
the atom or the observer.
