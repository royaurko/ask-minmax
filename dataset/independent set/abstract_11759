We prove the almost sure invariance principle for stationary R^d--valued
processes (with dimension-independent very precise error terms), solely under a
strong assumption on the characteristic functions of these processes. This
assumption is easy to check for large classes of dynamical systems or Markov
chains, using strong or weak spectral perturbation arguments.
