We formally study iterated block ciphers that alternate between two sequences
of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) rounds. It is demonstrated
that, in some cases the effect of alternating increases security, while in
other cases the effect may strictly decrease security relative to the
corresponding product of one of its component sequences. As this would appear
to contradict conventional wisdom based on the ideal cipher approximation, we
introduce new machinery for provable security comparisons. The comparisons made
here simultaneously establish a coherent ordering of security metrics ranging
from key-recovery cost to computational indistinguishability.
