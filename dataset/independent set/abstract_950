We show that by combining the static heavy quark action with the Neuberger
action for the light quark, the renormalisation of the heavy-light bilinear and
four-quark operators, computed on the lattice, becomes highly simplified: all
the heavy-light bilinears get renormalised by a single multiplicative constant,
whereas the renormalisation of the complete set of parity even dB=2 four-quark
operators involves only four independent constants. The relevant (matching)
constants are computed at NLO in perturbation theory and are presented here.
