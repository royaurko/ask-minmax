The latest results from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) unequivocally confirm the existence of a resonance, $X$,
with mass near 125 GeV which could be the Higgs boson of the Standard Model.
Measuring the properties (quantum numbers and couplings) of this resonance is
of paramount importance. Initial analyses by the LHC collaborations disfavor
specific alternative benchmark hypotheses, e.g. pure pseudoscalars or
gravitons. However, this is just the first step in a long-term program of
detailed measurements. We consider the most general set of operators in the
decay channels $X \to ZZ$, $WW$, $Z\gamma$, $\gamma\gamma$ and derive the
constraint implied by the measured rate. This allows us to provide a useful
parametrization of the orthogonal independent Higgs coupling degrees of freedom
as coordinates on a suitably defined sphere.
