We describe a method that provides a model independent measurement of the Bs
fraction in Y(5S) resonance decays, fs, using the relative rates of like-sign
versus opposite sign dileptons; the like-sign leptons result from B^0 and Bs
mixing. In addition, we show that determining the rates of single, double and
triple Ds mesons provides an alternative way of finding fs.
