This paper addresses the classical problem of determining the sets of
possible states of a linear discrete-time system subject to bounded
disturbances from measurements corrupted by bounded noise. These so-called
uncertainty sets evolve with time as new measurements become available. We
present an exact, computationally simple procedure that propagates a point on
the boundary of the uncertainty set at some time instant to a set of points on
the boundary of the uncertainty set at the next time instant.
