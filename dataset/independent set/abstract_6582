In standard bootstrap percolation, a subset A of the n x n grid is initially
infected. A new site is then infected if at least two of its neighbours are
infected, and an infected site stays infected forever. The set A is said to
percolate if eventually the entire grid is infected. A percolating set is said
to be minimal if none of its subsets percolate. Answering a question of
Bollobas, we show that there exists a minimal percolating set of size 4n^2/33 +
o(n^2), but there does not exist one larger than (n + 2)^2/6.
