Observations of variability can provide valuable information about the
processes of cloud formation and dissipation in brown dwarf atmospheres. Here
we report the results of an independent analysis of archival data from the
Brown dwarf Atmosphere Monitoring (BAM) program. Time series data for 14 L and
T dwarfs reported to be significantly variable over timescales of hours were
analyzed. We confirm large-amplitude variability (amplitudes $>$2\%) for 4/13
targets and place upper limits of 0.7\%-1.6\% on variability in the remaining
sample. For two targets we find evidence of weak variability at amplitudes of
1.3\% and 1.6\%. Based on our revised classification of variable objects in the
BAM study, we find strong variability outside the L/T transition to be rare at
near infrared wavelengths. From a combined sample of 81 L0-T9 dwarfs from the
revised BAM sample and the variability survey of Radigan et al. we infer an
overall observed frequency for large-amplitude variability outside the L/T
transition of 3.2$_{-1.8}^{+2.8}$\%, in contrast to 24$^{+11}_{-9}$\% for
L9-T3.5 spectral types. We conclude that while strong variability is not
limited to the L/T transition, it occurs more frequently in this spectral type
range, indicative of larger or more highly contrasting cloud features at these
spectral types.
