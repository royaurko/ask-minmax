We analyze the role of shake-off and of the final state interactions in
inelastic processes in the fullerene shell which follow ionization of the caged
atom. We demonstrate that in the broad interval of the photon energies the
process is dominated by the final state interactions. Its contribution is
calculated in a model-independent way. In the large energy intervals the cross
section of the process is close to that of photoionization of isolated atom.
