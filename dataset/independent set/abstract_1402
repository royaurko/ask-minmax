Searches for new fermionic states heavier than the top quark are being
pursued by the CMS & ATLAS collaborations, pushing the mass bounds towards the
TeV scale. Although a chiral fourth generation of quarks is now excluded by the
LHC results, models going beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of
heavy vector-like top partners as potential smoking gun signatures. Relying on
a model-independent parametrisation, we present the first results of a
dedicated software called XQCAT (eXtra Quark Combined Analysis Tool), which
recasts publicly available experimental data from direct and Supersymmetry
inspired searches and computes the exclusion confidence level for New Physics
scenarios with one or multiple top partners. The mass limits set on a T singlet
scenario with general coupling assumptions are briefly discussed in this
framework.
