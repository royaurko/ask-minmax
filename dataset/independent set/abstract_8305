In this paper, we explore the radial projection method for locally finite
point sets and provide numerical examples for different types of order. The
main question is whether the method is suitable to analyse order in a
quantitive way. Our findings indicate that the answer is affermative. In this
context, we also study local visibility conditions for certain types of
aperiodic point sets.
