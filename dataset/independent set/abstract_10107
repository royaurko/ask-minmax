Let $D$ be the open unit disc in the complex plane. We denote by $\mathbb{C}$
the set of complex numbers and consider any compact set $K$ which is disjoint
from $D$ and which also has connected complement. Let $A(K)$ denote all the
functions $f:K\to \mathbb{C} $ such that $f$ is continuous on $K$ and
holomorphic in $K^o$. It is well known that there exist holomorphic functions
$f$ on $D$ for which the partial sums $S_n(f)$, n=1,2,... of the Taylor series
with center $0$ are dense in $A(K)$ for every $K$ satisfying the properties
above. It is also known that the above result fails if we consider the weighted
polynomials $2^nS_n(f)$, n=1,2,... instead of $S_n(f)$, n=1,2,.... In the
opposite direction, the main result of this work shows that there exist
holomorphic functions $f$ on $D$ for which the sequence $2^nS_n(f)$,
$n=1,2,...$ is dense in $A(K)$ for specific compact sets $K$. In this case the
geometry of $K$ plays a crucial role. We also generalize these results on
arbitrary simply connected domains.
