The P300 speller is being considered as an independent brain-computer
interface. That means it measures the user's intent, and does not require the
user to move any muscles. In particular it should not require eye fixation of
the desired character. However, it has been shown that posterior electrodes
provide significant discriminative information, which is likely related to
visual processing. These findings imply the need for studies controlling the
effect of eye movements. In experiments with a 3x3 character matrix, attention
and eye fixation was directed to different characters. In the event-related
potentials, a P300 occurred for the attended character, and N200 was seen for
the trials showing the focussed character. It occurred at posterior sites,
reaching its peak at 200ms after stimulus onset. The results suggest that gaze
direction plays an important role in P300 speller paradigm. By controlling gaze
direction it is possible to separate voluntary and involuntary EEG responses to
the highlighting of characters.
