The concept of majority domination in graphs has been defined in at least two
different ways: As a function and as a set. In this work we extend the latter
concept to digraphs, while the former was extended in another paper. Given a
digraph $D=(V,A),$ a set $S\subseteq V$ is a \textit{majority out-dominating
set} (MODS) of $D$ if $|N^+[S]|\geq \frac {n}{2}.$ The minimum cardinality of a
MODS in $D$ is the {\it set majority out-domination number} $\gamma^+_{m}(D)$
of $D.$ In this work we introduce these concepts and prove some results about
them, among which the characterization of minimal MODSs.
