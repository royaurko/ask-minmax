We propose a semiparametric independent-component model for the intensity
functions of a point process. When independent replications of the process are
available, we show that the estimators are consistent and asymptotically
normal. We study the finite-sample behavior of the estimators by simulation,
and as an example of application we analyze the spatial distribution of street
robberies in the city of Chicago.
