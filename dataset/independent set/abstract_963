It is shown that the probe-independent charge radius of the neutrino is a
physical observable; as such, it may be extracted from experiment, at least in
principle. This is accomplished by expressing a set of experimental
neutrino-electron cross-sections in terms of the finite charge radius and two
additional gauge- and renormalization-group-invariant quantities, corresponding
to the electroweak effective charge and mixing angle.
