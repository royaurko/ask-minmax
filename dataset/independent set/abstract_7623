For a complex projective manifold Gromov-Witten invariants can be constructed
either algebraically or symplectically. Using the versions of Gromov-Witten
theory by Behrend and Fantechi on the algebraic side and by the contributor on the
symplectic side, we prove that both points of view give the same results. A
similar statement has been obtained independently by Li and Tian using their
definitions of algebraic and symplectic Gromov-Witten invariants
(alg-geom/9712035).
