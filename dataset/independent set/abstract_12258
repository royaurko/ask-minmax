Given a chain complex with the only modi?cation that each cell of the complex
has a probability distribution assigned. We will call this complex - a random
complex and what should be understood in practice, is that we have a classical
chain complex whose cells appear and disappear according to some probability
distributions. In this paper, we will try to fi?nd the stochastic homology of
random complex, whose simplices have independent discrete distributions.
