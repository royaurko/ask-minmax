We show that if the maximum modulus of a quasiregular mapping f grows
sufficiently rapidly then there exists a non-empty escaping set I(f) consisting
of points whose forward orbits under iteration tend to infinity. This set I(f)
has an unbounded component but, in contrast to the case of entire functions on
the complex plane, the closure of I(f) may have a bounded component.
