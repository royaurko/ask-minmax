We study a new supersymmetric mechanism for lepton flavor violation in a
minimal extension of the MSSM with low-mass heavy singlet neutrinos, which is
fully independent of the flavor structure of the soft SUSY breaking sector. We
find that l -> l' gamma processes are forbidden in the SUSY limit, whilst the
processes l -> l'l1 l2 and mu -> e conversion in nuclei can be enhanced well
above the observable level, via large neutrino Yukawa-coupling effects.
