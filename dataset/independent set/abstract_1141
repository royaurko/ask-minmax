Given a finite point set $X$ in the plane, the degree of a pair $\{x,y\}
\subset X$ is the number of empty triangles $t=conv\{x,y,z\}$, where empty
means $t\cap X=\{x,y,z\}$. Define $deg X$ as the maximal degree of a pair in
$X$. Our main result is that if $X$ is a random sample of $n$ independent and
uniform points from a fixed convex body, then $deg X \ge cn/\ln n$ in
expectation.
