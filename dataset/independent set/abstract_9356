Fendley, Schoutens and van Eerten [Fendley et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 38
(2005), pp. 315-322] studied the hard square model at negative activity. They
found analytical and numerical evidence that the eigenvalues of the transfer
matrix with periodic boundary were all roots of unity. They also conjectured
that for an m times n square grid, with doubly periodic boundary, the partition
function is equal to 1 when m and n are relatively prime. These conjectures
were later proven by Jonsson [Jonsson, Electronic J. Combin., 13(1) (2006),
R67]. There, it was also noted that the cylindrical case seemed to have
interesting properties when the circumference of the cylinder is odd. In
particular, when 3 is a divisor of both the circumference and the width of the
cylinder minus 1, the partition function is -2. Otherwise, it is equal to 1. In
this paper, we investigate the hard square and hard hexagon models at activity
-1, with single periodic boundary, i.e, cylindrical identifications, using both
topological and combinatorial techniques. We compute the homology groups of the
associated independence complex for small sizes and suggest a matching which,
we believe, with further analysis could help solve the conjecture.
