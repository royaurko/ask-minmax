Within the area of computational models of argumentation, the
instantiation-based approach is gaining more and more attention, not at least
because meaningful input for Dung's abstract frameworks is provided in that
way. In a nutshell, the aim of instantiation-based argumentation is to form,
from a given knowledge base, a set of arguments and to identify the conflicts
between them. The resulting network is then evaluated by means of
extension-based semantics on an abstract level, i.e. on the resulting graph.
While several systems are nowadays available for the latter step, the
automation of the instantiation process itself has received less attention. In
this work, we provide a novel approach to construct and visualize an
argumentation framework from a given knowledge base. The system we propose
relies on Answer-Set Programming and follows a two-step approach. A first
program yields the logic-based arguments as its answer-sets; a second program
is then used to specify the relations between arguments based on the
answer-sets of the first program. As it turns out, this approach not only
allows for a flexible and extensible tool for instantiation-based
argumentation, but also provides a new method for answer-set visualization in
general.
