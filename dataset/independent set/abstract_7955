We give an asymptotic formula for the $2k$th moment of a sum of
multiplicative Steinhaus variables. This was recently computed independently by
Harper, Nikeghbali and Radziwi\l\l. We also compute the $2k$th moment of a
truncated characteristic polynomial of a unitary matrix. This provides an
asymptotic equivalence with the moments of Steinhaus variables. Similar results
for multiplicative Rademacher variables are given.
