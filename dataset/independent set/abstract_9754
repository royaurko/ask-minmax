A numerical program is presented which facilitates the computation of the
full set of one-gluon loop diagrams (including ghost loop contributions), with
M attached external gluon lines in all possible ways. The feasibility of such a
task rests on a suitably defined master formula, which is expressed in terms of
a set of Grassmann and a set of Feynman parameters, the number of which
increases with M. An important component of the numerical program is an
algorithm for computing multi-Grassmann variable integrals. The cases M=2, 3,
4, which are the only ones having divergent terms, are fully worked out. A
complete agreement with known, analytic results pertaining to the divergent
terms is attained.
