We consider single particle Schrodinger operators with a gap in the energy
spectrum. We construct a countable set of exponentially decaying functions,
which form a complete, orthonormal basis set for the states below the spectral
gap. Each such function is localized near a closed surface. Estimates on the
exponential decay rate and a discussion of the geometry of these surfaces is
included.
