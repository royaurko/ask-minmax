Limits on the cross-section times branching fraction for neutral Higgs
bosons, produced in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, and decaying to two
tau leptons with pseudorapidities between 2.0 and 4.5, are presented. The
result is based on a dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0
$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, collected with the LHCb detector. Candidates are identified
by reconstructing final states with two muons, a muon and an electron, a muon
and a hadron, or an electron and a hadron. A model independent upper limit at
the 95% confidence level is set on a neutral Higgs boson cross-section times
branching fraction. It varies from 8.6 pb for a Higgs boson mass of 90 GeV to
0.7 pb for a Higgs boson mass of 250 GeV, and is compared to the Standard Model
expectation. An upper limit on $\tan\beta$ in the Minimal Supersymmetric Model
is set in the $m_{h^0}^\mathrm{max}$ scenario. It ranges from 34 for a CP-odd
Higgs boson mass of 90 GeV to 70 for a pseudo-scalar Higgs boson mass of 140
GeV.
