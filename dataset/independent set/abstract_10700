The first-order general relativistic theory of a generic dissipative
(heat-conducting, viscous, particle-creating) fluid is rediscussed from a
unified covariant frame-independent point of view. By generalizing some
previous works in the literature, we derive a formula for the temperature
variation rate, which is valid both in Eckart's (particle) and in the
Landau-Lifshitz (energy) frames. Particular attention is paid to the case of
gravitational particle creation and its possible cross-effect with the bulk
viscosity mechanism.
