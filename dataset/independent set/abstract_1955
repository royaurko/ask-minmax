Monte Carlo (MC) methods are widely used in statistics, signal processing and
machine learning. A well-known class of MC methods are Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithms. In order to foster better exploration of the state space,
specially in high-dimensional applications, several schemes employing multiple
parallel MCMC chains have been recently introduced. In this work, we describe a
novel parallel interacting MCMC scheme, called orthogonal MCMC (O-MCMC), where
a set of vertical parallel MCMC chains share information using some horizontal
MCMC techniques working on the entire population of current states. More
specifically, the vertical chains are led by random-walk proposals, whereas the
horizontal MCMC techniques employ independent proposals, thus allowing an
efficient combination of global exploration and local approximation. The
interaction is contained in these horizontal iterations. Within the analysis of
different implementations of O-MCMC, novel schemes for reducing the overall
computational cost of parallel multiple try Metropolis (MTM) chains are also
presented. Furthermore, a modified version of O-MCMC for optimization is
provided by considering parallel simulated annealing (SA) algorithms. Finally,
we also discuss the application of O-MCMC in a big bata framework. Numerical
results show the advantages of the proposed sampling scheme in terms of
efficiency in the estimation, as well as robustness in terms of independence
with respect to initial values and the choice of the parameters.
