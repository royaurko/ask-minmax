We consider critical branching Brownian motion with absorption, in which
there is initially a single particle at $x > 0$, particles move according to
independent one-dimensional Brownian motions with the critical drift of
$-\sqrt{2}$, and particles are absorbed when they reach zero. Here we obtain
asymptotic results concerning the behavior of the process before the extinction
time, as the position $x$ of the initial particle tends to infinity. We
estimate the number of particles in the system at a given time and the position
of the right-most particle. We also obtain asymptotic results for the
configuration of particles at a typical time.
