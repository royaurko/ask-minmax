In this note, we show that any distributive lattice is isomorphic to the set
of reachable configurations of an Edge Firing Game. Together with the result of
James Propp, saying that the set of reachable configurations of any Edge Firing
Game is always a distributive lattice, this shows that the two concepts are
equivalent.
