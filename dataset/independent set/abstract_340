Recent research shows that deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used to extract
deep speaker vectors (d-vectors) that preserve speaker characteristics and can
be used in speaker verification. This new method has been tested on
text-dependent speaker verification tasks, and improvement was reported when
combined with the conventional i-vector method.
  This paper extends the d-vector approach to semi text-independent speaker
verification tasks, i.e., the text of the speech is in a limited set of short
phrases. We explore various settings of the DNN structure used for d-vector
extraction, and present a phone-dependent training which employs the posterior
features obtained from an ASR system. The experimental results show that it is
possible to apply d-vectors on semi text-independent speaker recognition, and
the phone-dependent training improves system performance.
