In this article is given an axiomatic definition of sets with individuals and
a strictly predicative definition of the natural numbers. As close as possible
are followed the axioms of `standard set theory' ZF. But there are individuals.
Individuals are found in `physical reality' therefore the logical equality can
not be used. Equality has to be defined in set theory. The set theory used is
as simple as possible. There is no `axiom of infinity', no `power set' axiom,
and with individuals there is no `empty set'. The `union of all natural
numbers' is postulated.
