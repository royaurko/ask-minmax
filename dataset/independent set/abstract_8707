We determine the optimal achievable rate at which entanglement can be
reliably transmitted when the memoryless channel used during transmission is
unknown both to sender and receiver. To be more precise, we assume that both of
them only know that the channel belongs to a given set of channels. Thus, they
have to use encoding and decoding schemes that work well for the whole set.
