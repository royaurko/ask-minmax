A novel recovery of some important documents related to the Fermi course on
neutron physics, held at Los Alamos in 1945, is announced. Its relevance for
the effective launch of a British nuclear programme in the early postwar
period, independently of the U.S. technical cooperation (precluded by the
American contributorities) and warmly supported by Chadwick, is discussed.
