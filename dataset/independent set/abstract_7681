The arbitrary functions principle says that the fractional part of $nX$
converges stably to an independent random variable uniformly distributed on the
unit interval, as soon as the random variable $X$ possesses a density or a
characteristic function vanishing at infinity. We prove a similar property for
random variables defined on the Wiener space when the stochastic measure
$dB\_s$ is crumpled on itself.
