There is an infinite subset of a Martin-L\"of random set of integers that
does not compute any Martin-L\"of random set of integers. To prove this, we
show that each real of positive effective Hausdorff dimension computes an
infinite subset of a Martin-L\"of random set of integers, and apply a result of
Miller.
