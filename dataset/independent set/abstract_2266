A particularly simple model belonging to a wide class of coupled maps which
obey a local conservation law is studied. The phase structure of the system and
the types of the phase transitions are determined. It is argued that the
structure of the phase diagram is robust with respect to mild violations of the
conservation law. Critical exponents possibly determining a new universality
class are calculated for a set of independent order parameters. Numerical
evidence is produced suggesting that the singularity in the density of Lyapunov
exponents at $\lambda=0$ is a reflection of the singularity in the density of
Fourier modes (a ``Van Hove'' singularity) and disappears if the conservation
law is broken. Applicability of the Lyapunov dimension to the description of
spatiotemporal chaos in a system with a conservation law is discussed.
