We show that positive measure domination implies uniform almost everywhere
domination and that this proof translates into a proof in the subsystem
WWKL$_0$ (but not in RCA$_0$) of the equivalence of various Lebesgue measure
regularity statements introduced by Dobrinen and Simpson. This work also allows
us to prove that low for weak $2$-randomness is the same as low for
Martin-L\"of randomness (a result independently obtained by Nies). Using the
same technique, we show that $\leq_{LR}$ implies $\leq_{LK}$, generalizing the
fact that low for Martin-L\"of randomness implies low for $K$.
