By modeling a dielectric medium with two independent reservoirs, i.e.,
electric and magnetic reservoirs, the electromagnetic field is quantized in a
linear dielectric medium consistently. A Hamiltonian is proposed from which
using the Heisenberg equations, not only the Maxwell equations but also the
structural equations can be obtained. Using the Laplace transformation, the
wave equation for the electromagnetic vector potential is solved in the case of
a homogeneous dielectric medium. Some examples are considered showing the
applicability of the model to both absorptive and nonabsorptive dielectrics.
