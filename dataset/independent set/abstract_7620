We introduce a canonical outer vector field on a Poisson manifold, also due
independently to A. Weinstein. We view it as a global section of the sheaf of
Poisson vector fields modulo the subsheaf of hamiltonian vector fields. We
study this outer derivation mostly in the case of holomorphic Poisson
manifolds.
