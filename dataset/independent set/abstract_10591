We consider the propagation of a dark soliton in a quasi 1D Bose-Einstein
condensate in presence of a random potential. This configuration involves
nonlinear effects and disorder, and we argue that, contrarily to the study of
stationary transmission coefficients through a nonlinear disordered slab, it is
a well defined problem. It is found that a dark soliton decays algebraically,
over a characteristic length which is independent of its initial velocity, and
much larger than both the healing length and the 1D scattering length of the
system. We also determine the characteristic decay time.
