We study free scalar field theory on flat spacetime using a background
independent (polymer) quantization procedure. Specifically we compute the
propagator using a method that takes the energy spectrum and position matrix
elements of the harmonic oscillator as inputs. We obtain closed form results in
the infrared and ultraviolet regimes that give Lorentz invariance violating
dispersion relations, and show suppression of propagation at sufficiently high
energy.
