A code over a finite alphabet is called locally recoverable (LRC) if every
symbol in the encoding is a function of a small number (at most $r$) other
symbols. We present a family of LRC codes that attain the maximum possible
value of the distance for a given locality parameter and code cardinality. The
codewords are obtained as evaluations of specially constructed polynomials over
a finite field, and reduce to a Reed-Solomon code if the locality parameter $r$
is set to be equal to the code dimension. The size of the code alphabet for
most parameters is only slightly greater than the code length. The recovery
procedure is performed by polynomial interpolation over $r$ points. We also
construct codes with several disjoint recovering sets for every symbol. This
construction enables the system to conduct several independent and simultaneous
recovery processes of a specific symbol by accessing different parts of the
codeword. This property enables high availability of frequently accessed data
("hot data").
