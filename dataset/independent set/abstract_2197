A new set of accurately measured frequencies of solar oscillations are used
to infer the rotation rate inside the Sun, as a function of radial distance as
well as latitude. We have adopted a regularized least squares technique with
iterative refinement for both 1.5D inversion using the splitting coefficients
and 2D inversion using individual m splittings. The inferred rotation rate
agrees well with earlier estimates showing a shear layer just below the surface
and another one around the base of the convection zone. The tachocline or the
transition layer where the rotation rate changes from differential rotation in
the convection zone to almost latitudinally independent rotation rate in the
radiative interior is studied in detail. No compelling evidence for any
latitudinal variation in position and width of tachocline is found though it
appears that the tachocline probably shifts to slightly larger radial distance
at higher latitudes and possibly becomes thicker also. However, these
variations are within the estimated errors and more accurate data would be
needed to make a definitive statement about latitudinal variations.
