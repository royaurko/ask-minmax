We develop a new thermodynamic approach to stochastic graph-rewriting. The
ingredients are a finite set of reversible graph-rewriting rules called
generating rules, a finite set of connected graphs P called energy patterns and
an energy cost function. The idea is that the generators define the qualitative
dynamics, by showing which transformations are possible, while the energy
patterns and cost function specify the long-term probability $\pi$ of any
reachable graph. Given the generators and energy patterns, we construct a
finite set of rules which (i) has the same qualitative transition system as the
generators; and (ii) when equipped with suitable rates, defines a
continuous-time Markov chain of which $\pi$ is the unique fixed point. The
construction relies on the use of site graphs and a technique of `growth
policy' for quantitative rule refinement which is of independent interest. This
division of labour between the qualitative and long-term quantitative aspects
of the dynamics leads to intuitive and concise descriptions for realistic
models (see the examples in S4 and S5). It also guarantees thermodynamical
consistency (AKA detailed balance), otherwise known to be undecidable, which is
important for some applications. Finally, it leads to parsimonious
parameterizations of models, again an important point in some applications.
