Signatures of the cluster spin glass have been found in a variety of
experiments, with an effective onset temperature $T_{on}$ that is frequency
dependent. We reanalyze the experimental results and find that they are
characterized by a distribution of activation energies, with a nonzero glass
transition temperature $T_g(x)<T_{on}$. While the distribution of activation
energies is the same, the distribution of weights depends on the process.
Remarkably, the weights are essentially doping independent.
