In this paper I will define a Lagrangian for scalar and gauge fields on
causal sets, based on the selection of an Alexandrov set in which the variation
of appropriate expressions in terms of either scalar field or the gauge field
holonomies around suitable loops take on the least value. For these fields, I
will find that the values of the variations of these expressions define
Lagrangian in the covariant form.
