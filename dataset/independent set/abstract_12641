We study asymptotic clustering of zeros of random polynomials, and show that
the expected discrepancy of roots of a polynomial of degree $n$, with not
necessarily independent coefficients, decays like $\sqrt{\log n/n}$. Our proofs
rely on discrepancy results for deterministic polynomials, and order statistics
of a random variable. We also consider the expected number of zeros lying in
certain subsets of the plane, such as circles centered on the unit
circumference, and polygons inscribed in the unit circumference.
