We analyze the latest published solar neutrino data assuming an arbitrary
neutrino oscillation/conversion mechanism suppresses the electron neutrino flux
from the Sun independent of energy. For oscillations/transitions into active
(sterile) neutrinos such mechanisms are ruled out at 99.96 (99.9997) % C.L.
assuming the standard solar model by Bahcall and Pinnsoneault '95 correctly
predicts all solar neutrino fluxes within their estimated uncertainties. Even
if one allows for $^8{\rm B}$ and $^7{\rm Be}$ solar neutrino fluxes that are
vastly different from the ones in contemporary standard solar models these
mechanisms are strongly disfavored by the data.
