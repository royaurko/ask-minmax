Let T be Takagi's continuous but nowhere-differentiable function. It is known
that almost all level sets (with respect to Lebesgue measure on the range of T)
are finite. We show that the most common cardinality of the level sets of T is
two, and investigate in detail the set of ordinates y such that the level set
at level y has precisely two elements. As a by-product, we obtain a simple
iterative procedure for solving the equation T(x)=y. We show further that any
positive even integer occurs as the cardinality of some level set, and
investigate which cardinalities occur with positive probability if an ordinate
y is chosen at random from the range of T. The key to the results is a system
of set equations for the level sets, which are derived from the partial
self-similarity of T. These set equations yield a system of linear
relationships between the cardinalities of level sets at various levels, from
which all the results of this paper flow.
