We study the large-time behavior of (weak) solutions to a two-scale
reaction-diffusion system coupled with a nonlinear ordinary differential
equations modeling the partly dissipative corrosion of concrete (/cement)-based
materials with sulfates. We prove that as $t\to\infty$ the solution to the
original two-scale system converges to the corresponding two-scale stationary
system. To obtain the main result we make use essentially of the theory of
evolution equations governed by subdifferential operators of time-dependent
convex functions developed combined with a series of two-scale energy-like
time-independent estimates.
