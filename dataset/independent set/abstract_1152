By applying results obtained from the new versions of the classical Levy,
Ottaviani, and Hoffmann-Jorgensen (1974) inequalities proved by Li and
Rosalsky(2013) and by using techniques developed by Hechner and Heinkel (2010),
we provide a characterization of a new type of strong law of large numbers for
independent and identically distributed real-valued random variables. Versions
of this strong law of large numbers are also presented in a Banach space
setting.
