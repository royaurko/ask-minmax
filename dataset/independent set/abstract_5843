We solve the problem of equivariant mirror symmetry for O(-3)->P^2 for the
(three) cases of one independent equivariant parameter. This gives a
decomposition of mirror symmetry for local P^2 into that of three subspaces,
each of which may be considered independently. Finally, we give a new
interpretation of mirror symmetry for O(k)+O(-2-k)->P^1.
