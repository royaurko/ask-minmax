This paper examines the completion of an w-ordered sequence of recursive
definitions which on the one hand defines an increasing sequence of nested set
and on the other redefines successively a numeric variable as the cardinal of
the successively defined nested sets. The consequence is a contradiction
involving the consistency of w-order and then that of the Axiom of Infinity.
