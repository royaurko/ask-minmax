Given two conjugate mapping classes f and g, we produce a conjugating element
w such that |w| < K(|f|+|g|), where |.| denotes the word metric with respect to
a fixed generating set, and K is a constant depending only on the generating
set. As a consequence, the conjugacy problem for mapping class groups is
exponentially bounded.
