In this note we introduce and prove local and potential independent
transportation, Log-Sobolev and HWI inequalities in one dimensional free
probability on compact intervals which are sharp. We recover using this
approach a free transportation inequality on the whole real line which was put
forward recently by M. Maida and E. Maurel-Segala.
