We report on a consistent, microscopic calculation of the bound and
scattering states in the 4He system employing modern realistic two-nucleon and
three-nucleon potentials in the framework of the resonating group model (RGM).
We present for comparison with these microscopic RGM calculations the results
from a charge-independent, Coulomb-corrected R-matrix analysis of all types of
data for reactions in the A=4 system. Comparisons are made for selected
examples of phase shifts and measurements from reactions sensitive to
three-nucleon force effects.
