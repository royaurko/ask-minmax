Kuratowski's 14-set theorem says that in a topological space, 14 is the
maximum possible number of distinct sets which can be generated from a fixed
set by taking closures and complements. In this article we consider the
analogous questions for any possible subcollection of the operations {closure,
complement, interior, intersection, union}, and any number of initially given
sets. We use the algebraic "topological calculus" to full advantage.
