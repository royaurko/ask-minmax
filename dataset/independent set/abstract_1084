In unipolar resistance switching of NiO capacitors, Joule heating in the
conducting channels should cause a strong nonlinearity in the low resistance
state current-voltage (I-V) curves. Due to the percolating nature of the
conducting channels, the reset current IR, can be scaled to the nonlinear
coefficient Bo of the I-V curves. This scaling relationship can be used to
predict reset voltages, independent of NiO capacitor size; it can also be
applied to TiO2 and FeOy capacitors. Using this relation, we developed an error
correction scheme to provide a clear window for separating reset and set
voltages in memory operations.
