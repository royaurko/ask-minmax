Approximately 438 pb-1 of e+e- data from the OPAL detector, taken with the
LEP collider running at centre-of-mass energies of 192-209 Gev, are analyzed to
search for evidence of chargino pair production, e+e- -> tilde chi^+_1 tilde
chi^-_1, or neutralino associated production, e+e- -> tilde chi^0_2 tilde
chi^0_1. Limits are set at the 95% confidence level on the product of the
cross-section for the process e+e- -> tilde chi^+_1 tilde chi^-_1 and its
branching ratios to topologies containing jets and missing energy, of jest with
a lepton and missing energy, and on the product of the cross-section for e+e-
-> tilde chi^0_2 tilde chi^0_1 and its branching ratio to jets. R-parity
conservation is assumed throughout this paper. When these results are
interpreted in the context of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model, limits are also set on the masses of the tilde chi^+-_1, tilde chi^0_1
and tilde chi^0_2, and regions of the parameter space of the model are ruled
out. Nearly model-independent limits are also set at the 95% confidence level
on sigma(e+e- -> tilde chi^+_1 tilde chi^-_1) with the assumption that each
chargino decays via a W boson, and on sigma(e+e- -> tilde chi^0_2 tilde
chi^0_1) with the tilde chi^0_2 assumed to decay via a Z^0.
