The notion of overlap algebra introduced by G. Sambin provides a constructive
version of complete Boolean algebra. Here we first show some properties
concerning overlap algebras: we prove that the notion of overlap morphism
corresponds classically to that of map preserving arbitrary joins; we provide a
description of atomic set-based overlap algebras in the language of formal
topology, thus giving a predicative characterization of discrete locales; we
show that the power-collection of a set is the free overlap algebra
join-generated from the set. Then, we generalize the concept of overlap algebra
and overlap morphism in various ways to provide constructive versions of the
category of Boolean algebras with maps preserving arbitrary existing joins.
