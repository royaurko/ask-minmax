We report a particle source imaging analysis based on two-pion correlations
in high multiplicity Au + Au collisions at beam energies between 2 and 8A GeV.
We apply the imaging technique introduced by Brown and Danielewicz, which
allows a model-independent extraction of source functions with useful accuracy
out to relative pion separations of about 20 fm. The extracted source functions
have Gaussian shapes. Values of source functions at zero separation are almost
constant across the energy range under study. Imaging results are found to be
consistent with conventional source parameters obtained from a multidimensional
HBT analysis.
