The POOL data storage mechanism is intended to satisfy the needs of the LHC
experiments to store and analyze the data from the detector response of
particle collisions at the LHC proton-proton collider. Both the data rate and
the data volumes will largely differ from the past experience. The POOL data
storage mechanism is intended to be able to cope with the experiment's
requirements applying a flexible multi technology data persistency mechanism.
The developed technology independent approach is flexible enough to adopt new
technologies, take advantage of existing schema evolution mechanisms and allows
users to access data in a technology independent way. The framework consists of
several components, which can be individually adopted and integrated into
existing experiment frameworks.
