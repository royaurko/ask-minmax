Taubes has recently defined Gromov invariants for symplectic four-manifolds
and related them to the Seiberg-Witten invariants. Independently, Ruan and Tian
defined symplectic invariants based on ideas of Witten. In this note, we show
that Taubes' Gromov invariants are equal to certain combinations of Ruan-Tian
invariants. This link allows us to generalize Taubes' invariants. For each
closed symplectic four-manifold, we define a sequence of symplectic invariants
$Gr_{\delta}$, $\delta=0,1,2,...$. The first of these, $Gr_0$, generates
Taubes' invariants, which count embedded J-holomorphic curves. The new
invariants $Gr_{\delta}$ count immersed curves with $\delta$ double points. In
particular, these results give an independent proof that Taubes' invariants are
well-defined. They also show that some of the Ruan-Tian symplectic invariants
agree with the Seiberg-Witten invariants.
