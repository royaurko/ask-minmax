I review the status of global fits to the CKM matrix within the framework of
the Standard Model and also allowing for New Physics contributions in B-Bbar
mixing. The driving force is coming from the large data sets collected by the
B-factory experiments BABAR and Belle. Additional important inputs to the B_s
sector are provided by the Tevatron experiments CDF and D0. In particular, when
constraining New Physics in B-Bbar mixing in a model-independent analysis a
nice interplay between the B-factories and the Tevatron experiments is
observed.
