We study prismatics sets analogously to simplical sets except that
realization involves prisms, i.e., products of simplices rather than just
simplices. Particular examples are the prismatic subdivision of a simplicial
set S and the prismatic star of S. Both have the same homotopy type as S and in
particular the latter we use to study lattice gauge theory in the sense of
Phillips and Stone. Thus for a Lie group G and a set of parallel transport
functions defining the transition over faces of the simplices, we define a
classifying map from the prismatic star to a prismatic version of the
classifying space of G. In turn this defines a G-bundle over the prismatic
star.
