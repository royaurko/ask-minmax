Motivation: Illumina Sequencing data can provide high coverage of a genome by
relatively short (100 bp150 bp) reads at a low cost. Our goal is to produce
trimmed and error-corrected reads to improve genome assemblies. Our error
correction procedure aims at producing a set of error-corrected reads (1)
minimizing the number of distinct false k-mers, i.e. that are not present in
the genome, in the set of reads and (2) maximizing the number that are true,
i.e. that are present in the genome. Because coverage of a genome by Illumina
reads varies greatly from point to point, we cannot simply eliminate k-mers
that occur rarely.
  Results: Our software, called QuorUM, provides reasonably accurate correction
and is suitable for large data sets (1 billion bases checked and corrected per
day per core).
  Availability: QuorUM is distributed as an independent software package and as
a module of the MaSuRCA assembly software. Both are available under the GPL
open source license at http://www.genome.umd.edu.
