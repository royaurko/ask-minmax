We provide an intrinsic classification of the large and small orbits for N=2,
4D extremal black holes on symmetric spaces which does not depend on the
duality frame used for the charges or on the special coordinates. A coordinate
independent formula for the fake superpotential W, which (at infinity)
represents the black hole ADM mass, is given explicitly in terms of invariants
of the N=2 special geometry.
