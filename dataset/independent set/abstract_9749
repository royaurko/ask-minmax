We compare the results of constructing binary black hole initial data with
three different decompositions of the constraint equations of general
relativity. For each decomposition we compute the initial data using a
superposition of two Kerr-Schild black holes to fix the freely specifiable
data. We find that these initial-data sets differ significantly, with the ADM
energy varying by as much as 5% of the total mass. We find that all
initial-data sets currently used for evolutions might contain unphysical
gravitational radiation of the order of several percent of the total mass. This
is comparable to the amount of gravitational-wave energy observed during the
evolved collision. More astrophysically realistic initial data will require
more careful choices of the freely specifiable data and boundary conditions for
both the metric and extrinsic curvature. However, we find that the choice of
extrinsic curvature affects the resulting data sets more strongly than the
choice of conformal metric.
