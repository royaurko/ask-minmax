We obtain relations between partial-wave amplitudes for pi-N-->pi-N and
pi-N-->pi-Delta directly from large N_c QCD. While linear relations among
certain amplitudes holding at leading order (LO) in 1/N_c were derived in the
context of chiral soliton models two decades ago, the present work employs a
fully model-independent framework based on consistency with the large N_c
expansion. At LO we reproduce the soliton model results; however, this method
allows for systematic corrections. At next-to-leading order (NLO), most
relations require additional unknown functions beyond those appearing at
leading order (LO) and thus have little additional predictive power. However,
three NLO relations for the pi-N-->pi-Delta reaction are independent of unknown
functions and make predictions accurate at this order. The amplitudes relevant
to two of these relations were previously extracted from experiment. These
relations describe experiment dramatically better than their LO counterparts.
