Properties of systems with majority voting rules have been exhaustingly
studied. In this work we focus on the randomized case - where the system is
initialized by randomized initial set of seeds. Our main aim is to give an
asymptotic estimate for sampling probability, such that the initial set of
seeds is (is not) a dynamic monopoly almost surely. After presenting some
trivial examples, we present exhaustive results for toroidal mesh and random
4-regular graph under simple majority scenario.
