Let r, s >= 2 be integers. Suppose that the number of blue r-cliques in a
red/blue coloring of the edges of the complete graph K_n is known and fixed.
What is the largest possible number of red s-cliques under this assumption? The
well known Kruskal-Katona theorem answers this question for r=2 or s=2. Using
the shifting technique from extremal set theory together with some analytical
arguments, we resolve this problem in general and prove that in the extremal
coloring either the blue edges or the red edges form a clique.
