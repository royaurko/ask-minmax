We study stable conditional measures for a certain equilibrium measure for
hyperbolic endomorphisms, on basic sets with overlaps; we show that these
conditional measures are geometric probabilities and measures of maximal stable
dimension. They are also proved to be absolutely continuous if and only if the
respective basic set is a folded repellor. Examples of such non-reversible
systems and their associated measures are given too.
