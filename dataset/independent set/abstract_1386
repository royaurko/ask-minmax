We perform a model independent reconstruction of the cosmic expansion rate
based on type Ia supernova data. Using the Union 2.1 data set, we show that the
Hubble parameter behaviour allowed by the data without making any hypothesis
about cosmological model or underlying gravity theory is consistent with a flat
LCDM universe having H_0 = 70.43 +- 0.33 and Omega_m=0.297 +- 0.020, weakly
dependent on the choice of initial scatter matrix. This is in closer agreement
with the recently released Planck results (H_0 = 67.3 +- 1.2, Omega_m = 0.314
+- 0.020) than other standard analyses based on type Ia supernova data. We
argue this might be an indication that, in order to tackle subtle deviations
from the standard cosmological model present in type Ia supernova data, it is
mandatory to go beyond parametrized approaches.
