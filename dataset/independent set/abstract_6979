We consider tropical hemispaces, defined as tropically convex sets whose
complements are also tropically convex, and tropical semispaces, defined as
maximal tropically convex sets not containing a given point. We introduce the
concept of $(P,R)$-decomposition. This yields (to our knowledge) a new kind of
representation of tropically convex sets extending the classical idea of
representing convex sets by means of extreme points and rays. We characterize
tropical hemispaces as tropically convex sets that admit a (P,R)-decomposition
of certain kind. In this characterization, with each tropical hemispace we
associate a matrix with coefficients in the completed tropical semifield,
satisfying an extended rank-one condition. Our proof techniques are based on
homogenization (lifting a convex set to a cone), and the relation between
tropical hemispaces and semispaces.
