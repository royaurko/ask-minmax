Let M be the set of mixed states and S the set of separable states of the
two-qubit system, and G = SU(2) x SU(2) the group of local unitary
transformations (ignoring the overall phase factor). We compute the multigraded
Poincare series for the algebra of G-invariant polynomial functions on the
affine space of all Hermitian operators of trace 1. We check that this series
is consistent with the list of invariants computed by Makhlin. By using the
recent result of Augusiak et al., we show that the boundary of S decomposes
naturally into two pieces. We prove that the part of this boundary which is
contained in the relative interior of M is a smooth manifold.
