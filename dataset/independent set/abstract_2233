We use recent measurements of the dimensionless coordinate distances from
Fanaroff-Riley Type IIb radio galaxies and the X-ray gas mass fractions in
clusters to constrain the parameters of a non-standard cosmological model. This
work complements our recent analysis of the SN Ia data within a non-Riemannian
cosmological model. We use two independent data sets to constrain the new
density parameter $\Omega_\psi$, which is related to the non-Riemannian
structure of the underlying spacetime and supplements the field equations that
are very similar to the usual Friedmann equations of general relativity.
Thereby we place an upper limit on the presence of non-Riemannian quantities in
the late stages of the universe. The numerical results of this work also apply
to several anisotropic cosmological models which, on the level of the field
equations, exhibit a similar scaling behavior of the density parameters like
our non-Riemannian model.
