Given a finite $n$-element set $X$, a family of subsets ${\mathcal F}\subset
2^X$ is said to separate $X$ if any two elements of $X$ are separated by at
least one member of $\mathcal F$. It is shown that if $|\mathcal F|>2^{n-1}$,
then one can select $\lceil\log n\rceil+1$ members of $\mathcal F$ that
separate $X$. If $|\mathcal F|\ge \alpha 2^n$ for some $0<\alpha<1/2$, then
$\log n+O(\log\frac1{\alpha}\log\log\frac1{\alpha})$ members of $\mathcal F$
are always sufficient to separate all pairs of elements of $X$ that are
separated by some member of $\mathcal F$. This result is generalized to
simultaneous separation in several sets. Analogous questions on separation by
families of bounded Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and separation of point sets
in ${\mathbb{R}}^d$ by convex sets are also considered.
