In this paper, we combine classical techniques of model theory of p-adic
subanalytic sets with results of tropical analytic geometry to obtain a result
of effective model-completeness. We consider languages L_F=( +,.,0,1, P_n, f;
for all n natural number and f in F) where F is a family of restricted analytic
functions. Definable sets in this language are a collection of p-adic
subanalytic sets. The main result of the paper gives conditions on F so that
the structure with underlying set Zp (the ring of p-adic integers) in this
language is effectively model-complete. An interesting example of language
satisfying our hypotheses is the case where F={exp(px)}. This example gives a
structure of exponential ring to Zp which is a natural $p$-adic equivalent to
the (restricted) real exponential field.
