We prove a local Nullstellensatz with parameter for a continuous family of
c-holomorphic functions with an effective exponent independent of the
parameter: the local degree of the cycle of zeroes of the central section
section. We assume that this central section defines a proper intersection and
we show that we can omit this assumption in case of isolated zeroes.
