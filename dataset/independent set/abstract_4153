Poles of partial wave scattering matrices have also in hadron spectroscopy
recently been established as a sole link between experiment and QCD theories
and models [1-4]. We have, however, noticed the fact that Karlsruhe-Helsinki
(KH) partial wave analyses, one of the two partial wave analyses which have
been "above the line" in PDG [1] for over three decades, does calculate and PDG
compiles the abundance of Breit-Wigner (BW) parameters obtained by local BW
fit, but has produced only a limited number of pole information obtained by
using speed plot (SP) method [5]. We stress the fact that in KH method only
Mandelstam analyticity is used as a theoretical constraint, so KH partial wave
solutions are as model independent as possible. Therefore, they represent a
very confident and valuable input, so it is of extreme importance to extract as
many resonance pole parameters from them as possible. In addition, the
troubling fact is that BW parameters given in PDG have been obtained from KH80
solution, while pole parameters have been obtained from KA84 version of KH
solution. To remedy this, we have used newly developed Laurent+Pietarinen
expansion method [6,7] for obtaining pole positions for all partial waves for
KH80 and KA84 solutions, compared them, and shown that the differences in pole
parameters are, with very few discussed exceptions, negligible for all partial
waves. We finally give a full set of pole parameters for both solutions for all
partial waves; results which are until now unpublished.
