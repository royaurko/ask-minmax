The article considers a prototype module with sensitive dimensions of 2 x 0.5
m2 based on 2 m long straw tubes which preserves its geometrical dimensions up
to the pressure of 4 bar independently of the ambient temperature and humidity.
The suggested technique provides a possibility of constructing relatively
low-cost planar modules by using straw tubes as long as needed for constructing
large area detectors at colliders or other field experiments by assembling them
in a common coordinate detector with a user-specified acceptance. The
distinguishing feature of a detector is its good radiation hardness, low
radiation thickness and a possibility of optimizing the detector operation mode
in a large range of gas pressure.
