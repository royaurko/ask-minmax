Superluminal neutrinos are expected to lose energy due to bremstrauhlung. It
is dominated by e+e--pair production if kinematically allowed. The same
signature was used in searches for 3-body decays of hypothetical heavy sterile
neutrinos. From the absence of these processes in CERN PS191 and CHARM
experiments we set upper limits on the neutrino velocity in the energy range
from 0.2 GeV to 280 GeV. Our limits are well below the neutrino velocity
favored by the recent OPERA results. For energy-independent neutrino velocity
the limits obtained in this paper are stronger than those coming from ICARUS
experiment and observations of Supernova SN1987a.
