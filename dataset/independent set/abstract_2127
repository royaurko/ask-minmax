This paper introduces a novel methodology that combines the multi-resolution
feature of the Gabor wavelet transformation (GWT) with the local interactions
of the facial structures expressed through the Pseudo Hidden Markov model
(PHMM). Unlike the traditional zigzag scanning method for feature extraction a
continuous scanning method from top-left corner to right then top-down and
right to left and so on until right-bottom of the image i.e. a spiral scanning
technique has been proposed for better feature selection. Unlike traditional
HMMs, the proposed PHMM does not perform the state conditional independence of
the visible observation sequence assumption. This is achieved via the concept
of local structures introduced by the PHMM used to extract facial bands and
automatically select the most informative features of a face image. Thus, the
long-range dependency problem inherent to traditional HMMs has been drastically
reduced. Again with the use of most informative pixels rather than the whole
image makes the proposed method reasonably faster for face recognition. This
method has been successfully tested on frontal face images from the ORL, FRAV2D
and FERET face databases where the images vary in pose, illumination,
expression, and scale. The FERET data set contains 2200 frontal face images of
200 subjects, while the FRAV2D data set consists of 1100 images of 100 subjects
and the full ORL database is considered. The results reported in this
application are far better than the recent and most referred systems.
