I present new comparisons of AGN optical, UV, and X-ray variations. These
reveal complex relationships between the different passbands that can change
with time in a given object. While there is evidence from several objects that
X-ray and optical activity levels are correlated on long timescales, variations
on shorter timescales can occur independently. It is proposed that the
combination of correlated and uncorrelated short-timescale variability is a
consequence of anisotropic high-energy emission. It is also argued that the
correlation between X-ray and optical variability on long timescales must be
due to a common underlying factor and not to reprocessing of X-ray radiation.
