We show propagation of local equilibrium for the symmetric inclusion process
(SIP) after diffusive rescaling of space and time, as well as the local
equilibrium property of the non-equilibrium steady state in the boundary driven
SIP. The main tool is self-duality and a coupling between $n$ SIP particles and
$n$ independent random walkers.
