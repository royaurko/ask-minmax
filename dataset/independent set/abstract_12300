It is shown for a class of random, time-independent, square-integrable,
three-dimensional magnetic fields that the one-loop effective fermion action of
four-dimensional QED increases faster than a quadratic in B in the strong
coupling limit. The limit is universal. The result relies on the paramagnetism
of charged spin - 1/2 fermions and the diamagnetism of charged scalar bosons.
