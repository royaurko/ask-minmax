We show that Vopenka's Principle and Vopenka cardinals are indestructible
under reverse Easton forcing iterations of increasingly directed-closed partial
orders, without the need for any preparatory forcing. As a consequence, we are
able to prove the relative consistency of these large cardinal axioms with a
variety of statements known to be independent of ZFC, such as the generalised
continuum hypothesis, the existence of a definable well-order of the universe,
and the existence of morasses at many cardinals.
