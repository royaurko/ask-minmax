It is shown uniquely that quantized spaces are realised on four-dimensional
compact manifolds. In the case of O(1,5) quantized space this are four
independent parameters of O(5) unit vector; in the case of O(2,4) these are
parameters of one two-dimensional unit vector (1 parameter) and components of
unit four-dimensional vector (3- parameters) and at last in the case O(3,3)
these are parameters of 2 independent 3-dimensional unit vectors (each have 2
parameters). This result follows directly only from the condition to have a
correct limit to usual theory (correspondence principle).
