We discuss the structure of the non-perturbative fermion-boson vertex in
quenched QED. We show that it is possible to construct a vertex which not only
ensures that the fermion propagator is multiplicatively renormalizable, obeys
the appropriate Ward-Takahashi identity, reproduces perturbation theory for
weak couplings and guarantees that the critical coupling at which the mass is
dynamically generated is gauge independent but also makes sure that the value
for the anomalous dimension for the mass function is strictly 1, as Holdom and
Mahanta have proposed.
