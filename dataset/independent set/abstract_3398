This paper proposes an efficient parameterization of the Room Transfer
Function (RTF). Typically, the RTF rapidly varies with varying source and
receiver positions, hence requires an impractical number of point to point
measurements to characterize a given room. Therefore, we derive a novel RTF
parameterization that is robust to both receiver and source variations with the
following salient features: (i) The parameterization is given in terms of a
modal expansion of 3D basis functions. (ii) The aforementioned modal expansion
can be truncated at a finite number of modes given that the source and receiver
locations are from two sizeable spatial regions, which are arbitrarily
distributed. (iii) The parameter weights/coefficients are independent of the
source/receiver positions. Therefore, a finite set of coefficients is shown to
be capable of accurately calculating the RTF between any two arbitrary points
from a predefined spatial region where the source(s) lie and a pre-defined
spatial region where the receiver(s) lie. A practical method to measure the RTF
coefficients is also provided, which only requires a single microphone unit and
a single loudspeaker unit, given that the room characteristics remain
stationary over time. The accuracy of the above parameterization is verified
using appropriate simulation examples.
