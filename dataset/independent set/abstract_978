A complete set of supertraces on the algebras of observables of the rational
Calogero models with harmonic interaction based on the classical root systems
of B_N, C_N and D_N types is found. These results extend the results known for
the case A_N. It is shown that there exist Q independent supertraces where
Q(B_N)=Q(C_N) is a number of partitions of N into a sum of positive integers
and Q(D_N) is a number of partitions of N into a sum of positive integers with
even number of even integers.
