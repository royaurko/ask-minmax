We use the method of the tensor product graph to construct rational (Yangian
invariant) solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in fundamental representations
of $c_n$ and thence the full set of $c_n$-invariant factorized $S$-matrices.
Brief comments are made on their bootstrap structure and on Belavin's scalar
Yangian conserved charges.
