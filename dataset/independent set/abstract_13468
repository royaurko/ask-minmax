We have calculated the properties of nuclear matter in a self-consistent
manner with quark-meson coupling mechanism incorporating structure of nucleons
in vacuum through a relativistic potential model; where the dominant confining
interaction for the free independent quarks inside a nucleon, is represented by
a phenomenologically average potential in equally mixed scalar-vector harmonic
form. Corrections due to spurious centre of mass motion as well as those due to
other residual interactions such as the one gluon exchange at short distances
and quark-pion coupling arising out of chiral symmetry restoration; have been
considered in a perturbation manner to obtain the nucleon mass in vacuum. The
nucleon-nucleon interaction in nuclear matter is then realized by introducing
additional quark couplings to sigma and omega mesons through mean field
approximations. The relevant parameters of the interaction are obtained self
consistently while realizing the saturation properties such as the binding
energy, pressure and compressibility of the nuclear matter. We also discuss
some implications of chiral symmetry in nuclear matter along with the nucleon
and nuclear sigma term and the sensitivity of nuclear matter binding energy
with variations in the light quark mass.
