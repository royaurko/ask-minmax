Azimuthal two particle correlations at intermediate $p_{T}$ with one of the
particles identified have been measured at PHENIX. Trigger ($2.5 < p_{T} < 4.0
GeV/c$) baryons and mesons show little significant difference in the number of
associated particles ($1.7 < p_{T} < 2.5 GeV/c$) independent of centrality. For
inclusive hadron triggers with $2.5 < p_{T} < 4.0 GeV/c$, associated
fragmentation particles with $1.0 < p_{T} < 2.5 GeV/c$ show a higher baryon to
meson ratio on the away side.
