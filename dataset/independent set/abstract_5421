The H1 and ZEUS published PDF analyses are compared, including a discussion
of the different treatments of correlated systematic uncertainties. Differences
in the data sets and the analyses are investigated by putting the H1 data set
through both PDF analyses and by putting the ZEUS and H1 data sets through the
same (ZEUS) analysis, separately. Finally the HERA averaged data set is put
through the ZEUS PDF analysis and the result is compared to that obtained when
putting the ZEUS and H1 data sets through this analysis together, using both
the
 Offset and the Hessian methods of treating correlated systematic
uncertainties.
