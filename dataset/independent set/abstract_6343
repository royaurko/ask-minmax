The coupled system of renormalized Dyson-Schwinger equations for the electron
self-energy and the photon propagator are supplied with the tree level vertex
as Ansatz for the renormalized three point function. The system is investigated
numerically. In the case of a massive electron, the theory is ``weakly
renormalizable'', i.e.\ cutoff independent for values of the cutoff below an
upper limit. In this regime of cutoff independence, the quenched approximation
yields good results for the electron self-energy. In the chiral limit, a
logarithmic cutoff dependence of the electron self-energy is found. The
question, whether a regime of cutoff independence with a spontaneously broken
chiral symmetry exists in strongly coupled QED, remains open.
