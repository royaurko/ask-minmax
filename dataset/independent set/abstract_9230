PHENIX has extended the measurement of the pi0, eta, identified and inclusive
charged hadron up to 20 GeV/c, and extended the measurement to the Cu+Cu
collision system. A strong suppression is observed for both pi0 and charged
hadron yields in central Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions. Comparing Au+Au and Cu+Cu
systems, RAA becomes independent of pT above 5 GeV/c. Its centrality dependence
is compared with two models in order to test for universal Npart scaling that
is independent of system; results are inconclusive. The results are compatible
with energy loss predictions. In addition, the ratio of eta to pi0 approaches,
within uncertainties, a constant value of 0.4-0.5 at high pT in p+p, d+Au, and
Au+Au, while the ratio of Ks to pi0 is also consistent with a constant value at
high pT in d+Au and p+p. These results are compatible with normal jet
fragmentation.
