The feasibility of using antihydrogen for igniting inertial confinement
fusion pellets or triggering large scale thermonuclear explosions is
investigated. The number of antiproton annihilations required to start a
thermonuclear burn wave in either DT or Li_2DT is found to be about
10^{21}/k^2, where k is the compression factor of the fuel to be ignited. In
the second part, the technologies for producing antiprotons with high energy
accelerator systems and the means for manipulating and storing microgram
amounts of antihydrogen are examined. While there seems to be no theoretical
obstacles to the production of 10^{18} antiprotons per day (the amount required
for triggering one thermonuclear bomb), the construction of such a plant
involves several techniques which are between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude away
from present day technology.
