Let $X=\{X_{t},t\in R_{+}\}$ be a symmetric L\'evy process with local time
$\{L^{x}_{t} ; (x,t)\in R^{1}\times R^{1}_{+}\}$. When the L\'evy exponent
$\psi(\la)$ is regularly varying at infinity with index $1<\beta\leq 2$ and
satisfies some additional regularity conditions && \sqrt{h\psi^{2}(1/h)} \lc
\int (L^{x+h}_{1}- L^{x}_{1})^{2} dx- E(\int (L^{x+h}_{1}- L^{x}_{1})^{2}
dx)\rc\nn && {1 in} \stackrel{\mathcal{L}}{\Longrightarrow}
(8c_{\beta,1})^{1/2} \eta (\int (L_{1}^{x})^{2} dx)^{1/2} \nn, as $h\rar 0$,
where $\eta$ is a normal random variable with mean zero and variance one that
is independent of $L^{x}_{t}$, and $c_{\beta,1}$ is a known constant.
