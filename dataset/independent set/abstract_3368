An observation of a cumulative distribution function $F$ with finite variance
is said to be contaminated according to the inflated variance model if it has a
large probability of coming from the original target distribution $F$, but a
small probability of coming from a contaminating distribution that has the same
mean and shape as $F$, though a larger variance. In this paper we investigate
under which conditions the sample mean, based on a finite number of independent
observations of $F$ which are contaminated according to the inflated variance
model, is a valid estimator for the mean of $F$. In particular, we examine up
to what extent this estimator is weakly consistent for the mean of $F$ and
asymptotically normal. As the classical central limit theory will in many
situations turn out to be inaccurate to cope with the asymptotic normality in
this setting, we will fall back on the more general quantitative central limit
theory as developed by Berckmoes, Lowen and Van Casteren. Our theoretical
results are illustrated by a specific example and a simulation study.
