We define sets of orthogonal polynomials satisfying the additional constraint
of a vanishing average. These are of interest, for example, for the study of
the Hohenberg-Kohn functional for electronic or nucleonic densities and for the
study of density fluctuations in centrifuges. We give explicit properties of
such polynomial sets, generalizing Laguerre and Legendre polynomials. The
nature of the dimension 1 subspace completing such sets is described. A
numerical example illustrates the use of such polynomials.
