This work reports on the thermal stability of two amorphous CoFeB layers
coupled antiferromagnetically via a thin Ru interlayer. The saturation field of
the artificial ferrimagnet which is determined by the coupling, J, is almost
independent on the annealing temperature up to more than 300 degree C. An
annealing at more than 325 degree C significantly increases the coercivity, Hc,
indicating the onset of crystallization.
