In an abelian group G, a more sums than differences (MSTD) set is a subset A
of G such that |A+A|>|A-A|. We provide asymptotics for the number of MSTD sets
in finite abelian groups, extending previous results of Nathanson. The proof
contains an application of a recently resolved conjecture of Alon and Kahn on
the number of independent sets in a regular graph.
