In a suitably chosen back-to-back kinematics, four-jet production in hadronic
collisions is known to be dominated by contributions from two independent
partonic scattering processes, thus giving experimental access to the structure
of generalized two-parton distributions 2GPDs. Here, we show that a combined
measurement of the double hard four-jet cross section in proton-proton and
proton-nucleus collisions will allow one to disentangle different sources of
two-parton correlations in the proton, that cannot be disentangled with 4-jet
measurements in proton-proton collisions alone. To this end, we analyze in
detail the structure of 2GPDs in the nucleus (A), we calculate in the
independent nucleon approximation all contributions to the double hard four-jet
cross section in pA, and we determine corrections arising from the nuclear
dependence of single parton distribution functions. We then outline an
experimental strategy for determining the longitudinal two-parton correlations
in the proton.
