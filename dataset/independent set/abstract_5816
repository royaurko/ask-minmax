Relativistic and non-relativistic modern nucleon-nucleon potentials are
mapped on a relativistic operator basis using projection techniques. This
allows to compare the various potentials at the level of covariant amplitudes
were a remarkable agreement is found. In nuclear matter large scalar and vector
mean fields of several hundred MeV magnitude are generated at tree level. This
is found to be a model independent feature of the nucleon-nucleon interaction.
