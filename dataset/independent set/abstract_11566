In the first part I briefly survey recent issues in constituent quark models
raised by the observation of unusual hadronic states. In particular I discuss
the role of higher Fock components in the wave function of baryons and the
possible interpretation of open charm and of new charmonium-type resonances as
tetraquarks. In the second part I show support for the quark model dynamics
obtained in a model independent way from the $1/N_c$ expansion approach of QCD
which proved to be successful in describing baryon properties.
