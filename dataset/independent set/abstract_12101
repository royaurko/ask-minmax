Extending a recent result by Frank and Lieb, we show an entropic uncertainty
principle for mixed states in a Hilbert space relatively to pairs of positive
operator valued measures that are independent in some sense. This yields
spatial-spectral uncertainty principles and log-Sobolev inequalities for
invariant operators on homogeneous spaces, which are sharp in the compact case.
