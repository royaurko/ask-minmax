We construct the full p6 order chiral Lagrangians for the unitary group and
special unitary groups, including nf-, three- and two-flavor cases, all
bilinear currents (scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector and tensor
currents) and theta parameter. The number of independent operators are 1391,
1326 and 969 for each of the flavor unitary groups. From these results, we find
one extra linear relation among the traditional p4 order low-energy constants
under the U(3) group, and some more linear relations with tensor sources for
the p6 order low-energy constants in the special unitary groups. We develop a
scheme to obtain the relations for the dependent operators in terms of
independent operators.
