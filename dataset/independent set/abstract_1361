The evaluation of produced items at the time of delivery is, in practice,
usually amended by at least one inspection at later time points. We extend the
methodology of acceptance sampling for variables for arbitrary unknown
distributions when additional sampling infor- mation is available to such
settings. Based on appropriate approximations of the operating characteristic,
we derive new acceptance sampling plans that control the overall operating
characteristic. The results cover the case of independent sampling as well as
the case of dependent sampling. In particular, we study a modified panel
sampling design and the case of spatial batch sampling. The latter is advisable
in photovoltaic field monitoring studies, since it allows to detect and analyze
local clusters of degraded or damaged modules. Some finite sample properties
are examined by a simulation study, focusing on the accuracy of estimation.
