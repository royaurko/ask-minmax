We present a deterministic algorithm for computing all irreducible factors of
degree $\le d$ of a given bivariate polynomial $f\in K[x,y]$ over an algebraic
number field $K$ and their multiplicities, whose running time is polynomial in
the bit length of the sparse encoding of the input and in $d$. Moreover, we
show that the factors over $\Qbarra$ of degree $\le d$ which are not binomials
can also be computed in time polynomial in the sparse length of the input and
in $d$.
