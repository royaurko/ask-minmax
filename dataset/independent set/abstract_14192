Let $G$ be a compact connected Lie group acting on a stable complex manifold
$M$ with equivariant vector bundle $E$. Besides, suppose $\phi$ is an
equivariant map from $M$ to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We can define some
equivalence relation on the triples $(M, E, \phi)$ such that the set of
equivalence classes form an abelian group. In this paper, we will show that
this group is isomorphic to a completion of character ring $R(G)$. In this
framework, we provide a geometric proof to the "Quantization Commutes with
Reduction" conjecture in the non-compact setting.
