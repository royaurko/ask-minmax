We consider correspondences on smooth quasiprojective varieties $U$. An
algebraic cycle inducing the K\"unneth projector onto $H^1(U)$ is constructed.
Assuming normal crossings at infinity, the existence of relative motivic
cohomology is shown to imply the independence of $\ell$ for traces of open
correspondences.
