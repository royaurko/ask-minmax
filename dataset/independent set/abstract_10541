Effective field theories exploit a separation of scales in physical systems
in order to perform systematically improvable, model-independent calculations.
They are ideally suited to describe universal aspects of a wide range of
physical systems. I will discuss recent applications of effective field theory
to cold atomic and molecular few-body systems with large scattering length.
