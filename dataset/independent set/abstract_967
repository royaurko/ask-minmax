We derive a new set of sum rules between the neutrino mass and mixing
parameters in vacuum and their effective counterparts in matter. The moduli of
nine genuine lepton mixing matrix elements can then be calculated in terms of
the matter-corrected ones, and the latter can directly be determined from a
variety of long-baseline neutrino oscillations. We show that it is possible to
reconstruct the leptonic unitarity triangles and CP violation in a similar
parametrization-independent way.
