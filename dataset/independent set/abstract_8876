We study a family of transcendental entire functions of genus zero, for which
all of the zeros lie within a closed sector strictly smaller than a half-plane.
In general these functions lie outside the Eremenko-Lyubich class. We show that
for functions in this family the fast escaping set has Hausdorff dimension
equal to two.
