One of the challenging problems in the multidatabase systems is to find the
most viable solution to the problem of interoperability of distributed
heterogeneous autonomous local component databases. This has resulted in the
creation of a global schema over set of these local component database schemas
to provide a uniform representation of local schemas. The aim of this paper is
to use object oriented approach to integrate schemas of distributed
heterogeneous autonomous local component database schemas into a global schema.
The resulting global schema provides a uniform interface and high level of
location transparency for retrieval of data from the local component databases.
A set of integration operators are defined to integrate local schemas based on
the semantic relevance of their classes and to provide a model independent
representation of virtual classes of the global schema. The schematic
representation and heterogeneity is also taken into account in the integration
process. Justifications about Object Oriented Modal are also discussed. Bottom
up local schema modifications propagation in Global schema is also considered
to maintain Global schema as local schemas are autonomous and evolve over time.
An example illustrates the applicability of the integration operator defined.
