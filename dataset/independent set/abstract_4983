Leptonic decay widths and leptonic decay constants of light vector mesons and
weak leptonic decay widths and weak decay constants of light and heavy
pseudoscalar mesons have been studied in a field- theoretic framework based on
the independent quark model with a scalar- vector power-law potential. The
results are in very good agreement with the experimental data.
