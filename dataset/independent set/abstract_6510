We evaluate the forward Compton scattering off the proton, based on
Kramers-Kronig kind of relations which express the Compton amplitudes in terms
of integrals of total photoabsorption cross sections. We obtain two distinct
fits to the world data on the unpolarized total photoabsorption cross section,
and evaluate the various spin-independent sum rules using these fits. For the
sum of proton electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities, governed by the
Baldin sum rule, we obtain the following average (between the two fits):
$\alpha_{E1}+\beta_{M1}=14.0(2)\times 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{fm}^3$. An analogous sum
rule involving the quadrupole polarizabilities of the proton is evaluated too.
The spin-independent forward amplitude of proton Compton scattering is
evaluated in a broad energy range. The results are compared with previous
evaluations and the only experimental data point for this amplitude (at 2.2
GeV). We remark on sum rules for the elastic component of polarizabilities.
