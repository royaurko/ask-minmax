Numerical modeling of shock breakout in compact presupernovae of type Ib/c is
done by two independent methods. Peak color temperatures reach 4 to 8 million K
for explosion energies 1 to 9 foe with a typical local time-scale of 0.03
seconds. In the obverver's frame the burst is smeared over few seconds due to
light travel time correction R/c.
