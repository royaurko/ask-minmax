The WITCH experiment aims to study a possible admixture of a scalar or tensor
type interaction in beta decay by determining the beta-neutrino angular
correlation from the shape of the recoil energy spectrum. The installation
period was completed and intensive commissioning of the set-up was performed
already. The lay-out of the WITCH set-up and results of commissioning tests
performed until now are described here, showing that the full set-up up to the
spectrometer is now operational, although several efficiencies are still to be
improved. Due to its feature of being able to measure the energy spectrum for
recoil ions, the WITCH experiment also opens possibilities for other
observables.
