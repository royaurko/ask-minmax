It is shown that if every projective set of reals is Lebesgue measurable and
has the property of Baire, if every projective set in the plane has a
projective uniformization, and if Steel's K exists, then J^K_{\omega_1} \models
"there are infinitely many strong cardinals." This is best possible, by a
recent result of Steel.
