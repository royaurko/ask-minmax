In this paper, we introduce a family of second-order sigma delta quantization
schemes for analog-to-digital conversion which are `quiet' : quantization
output is guaranteed to fall to zero at the onset of vanishing input. In the
process, we prove that the origin is a globally attractive fixed point for the
related family of asymmetrically-damped piecewise affine maps. Our proof of
convergence is twofold: first, we construct a trapping set using a
Lyapunov-type argument; we then take advantage of the asymmetric structure of
the maps under consideration to prove convergence to the origin from within
this trapping set.
