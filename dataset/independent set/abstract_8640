We present a class of homogeneous ideals which are generated by monomials and
binomials of degree two and are set-theoretic complete intersections. This
class includes certain reducible varieties of minimal degree and, in
particular, the presentation ideals of the fiber cone algebras of monomial
varieties of codimension two.
