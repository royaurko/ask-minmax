As in the cases of freeness and monotonic independence, the notion of
conditional freeness is meaningful when complex-valued states are replaced by
positive conditional expectations. In this framework, the paper presents
several positivity results, a version of the central limit theorem and an
analogue of the conditionally free R-transform constructed by means of
multilinear function series.
