We studied the mutual information between a stimulus and a large system
consisting of stochastic, statistically independent elements that respond to a
stimulus. The Mutual Information (MI) of the system saturates exponentially
with system size. A theory of the rate of saturation of the MI is developed. We
show that this rate is controlled by a distance function between the response
probabilities induced by different stimuli. This function, which we term the
{\it Confusion Distance} between two probabilities, is related to the Renyi
$\alpha$-Information.
