Let G be a graph. The independence-domination number is the maximum over all
independent sets I in G of the minimal number of vertices needed to dominate I.
In this paper we investigate the computational complexity of independence
domination for graphs in several graph classes related to cographs. We present
an exact exponential algorithm. We also present a PTAS for planar graphs.
