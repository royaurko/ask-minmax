We study a QCD sum rule analysis for an exotic tetraquark ud bar[s] bar[s] of
J^P=0^+ and I = 1. We construct q q bar[q] bar[q] currents in a local product
form and find that there are five independent currents for this channel. Due to
high dimensional nature of the current, it is not easy to form a good sum rule
when using a single current. This means that we do not find any sum rule window
to extract reliable results, due to the insufficient convergence of the OPE and
to the exceptional important role of QCD continuum. Then we examine sum rules
by using currents of linear combinations of two currents among the independent
ones. We find two reasonable cases that predict a mass of the tetraquark around
1.5 GeV.
