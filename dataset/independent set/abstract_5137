The notion of Haar null set was introduced by J. P. R. Christensen in 1973
and reintroduced in 1992 in the context of dynamical systems by Hunt, Sauer and
Yorke. During the last twenty years this notion has been useful in studying
exceptional sets in diverse areas. These include analysis, dynamical systems,
group theory, and descriptive set theory. Inspired by these various results, we
introduce the topological analogue of the notion of Haar null set. We call it
Haar meager set. We prove some basic properties of this notion, state some open
problems and suggest a possible line of investigation which may lead to the
unification of these two notions in certain context.
