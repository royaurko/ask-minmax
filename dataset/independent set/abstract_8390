The d-measurement set of a graph is its set of possible squared edge lengths
over all d-dimensional embeddings. In this note, we define a new notion of
graph isomorphism called d-measurement isomorphism. Two graphs are
d-measurement isomorphic if there is agreement in their d-measurement sets. A
natural question to ask is "what can be said about two graphs that are
d-measurement isomorphic?" In this note, we show that this property coincides
with the 2-isomorphism property studied by Whitney.
