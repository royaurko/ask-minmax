We employ the charge neutrality condition in the form of zero vorticity for a
Josephson junction lattice in calculating its ground state. We consider a
Fibonacci ladder and the Penrose lattice to test our method. We also compare
the results with those of the model that treats the plaquettes independently.
We show that the zero vorticity condition improves on the results of the
independent plaquette model.
