A new mechanism of supersymmetry breaking involving a dynamical parameter is
introduced. It is independent of particle phenomenology and gauge groups. An
explicit realization of this mechanism takes place in Type II superstring
compactifications which admit eight supercharges (also known as generalized
SU(3) structures). The resulting Kahler potentials are expressed in terms of
Hitchin functionals.
