This paper provides a new model to compute the fractal dimension of a subset
on a generalized-fractal space. Recall that fractal structures are a perfect
place where a new definition of fractal dimension can be given, so we perform a
suitable discretization of the Hausdorff theory of fractal dimension. We also
find some connections between our definition and the classical ones and also
with fractal dimensions I & II (see http://arxiv.org/submit/0080421/pdf).
Therefore, we generalize them and obtain an easy method in order to calculate
the fractal dimension of strict self-similar sets which are not required to
verify the open set condition.
