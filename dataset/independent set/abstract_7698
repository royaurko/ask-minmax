Ratios of integrated particle yields provide the best method for determining
the temperature and the chemical potential. The chemical freeze-out parameters
obtained at CERN/SPS, BNL/AGS and GSI/SIS energies all correspond to a unique
value of 1 GeV per hadron in the local rest frame of the system, independent of
the beam energy and of the target and beam particles.
