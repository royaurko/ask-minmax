This is the first of a series of three papers devoted to the calibration of a
few parameters of crucial importance in the modeling of the evolution of
intermediate-mass stars, with special attention to the amount of convective
core overshoot. To this end we acquired deep V and R photometry for three
globular clusters of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), namely NGC 2173, SL 556
and NGC 2155, in the age interval 1-3 Gyr. In this first paper, we describe the
aim of the project, the VLT observations and data reduction, and we make
preliminary comparisons of the color-magnitude diagrams with both Padova and
Yonsei-Yale isochrones. Two following papers in this series present the results
of a detailed analysis of these data, independently carried out by members of
the Yale and Padova stellar evolution groups. This allows us to compare both
sets of models and discuss their main differences, as well as the systematic
effects that they would have to the determination of the ages and metallicities
of intermediate-age single stellar populations.
