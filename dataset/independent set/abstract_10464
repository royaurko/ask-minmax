We analyze the effect of the simultaneous presence of correlated additive and
multiplicative noises on the stochastic resonance response of a modulated
bistable system. We find that when the correlation parameter is also modulated,
the system's response, measured through the output signal-to-noise ratio,
becomes largely independent of the additive noise intensity.
