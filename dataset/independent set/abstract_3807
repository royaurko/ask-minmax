We study the existence and stability of phaselocked patterns and amplitude
death states in a closed chain of delay coupled identical limit cycle
oscillators that are near a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The coupling is
limited to nearest neighbors and is linear. We analyze a model set of discrete
dynamical equations using the method of plane waves. The resultant dispersion
relation, which is valid for any arbitrary number of oscillators, displays
important differences from similar relations obtained from continuum models. We
discuss the general characteristics of the equilibrium states including their
dependencies on various system parameters. We next carry out a detailed linear
stability investigation of these states in order to delineate their actual
existence regions and to determine their parametric dependence on time delay.
Time delay is found to expand the range of possible phaselocked patterns and to
contribute favorably toward their stability. The amplitude death state is
studied in the parameter space of time delay and coupling strength. It is shown
that death island regions can exist for any number of oscillators N in the
presence of finite time delay. A particularly interesting result is that the
size of an island is independent of N when N is even but is a decreasing
function of N when N is odd.
