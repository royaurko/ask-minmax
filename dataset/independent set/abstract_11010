Scattering at transplanckian energies offers model independent tests of TeV
scale gravity. Black-hole production is one spectacular signal, though a full
calculation of the cross section is not yet available. Another signal is given
by gravitational elastic scattering, which is maybe less spectacular but which
can be nicely computed in the forward region using the eikonal approximation.
In this talk I discuss the distinctive signatures of eikonalized scattering at
future accelerators.
