We consider real and complex Clifford algebras of arbitrary even and odd
dimensions and prove generalizations of Pauli's theorem for two sets of
Clifford algebra elements that satisfy the main anticommutative conditions. We
use generalized contractions (averaging) to do it. These theorems give us an
algorithm for computing elements that connect two different sets of Clifford
algebra elements.
