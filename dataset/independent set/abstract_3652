The EDELWEISS collaboration has performed a direct search for WIMP dark
matter using a 320 g heat-and-ionization cryogenic Ge detector operated in a
low-background environment in the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane. No nuclear
recoils are observed in the fiducial volume in the 30-200 keV energy range
during an effective exposure of 4.53 kg.days. Limits for the cross-section for
the spin-independent interaction of WIMPs and nucleons are set in the framework
of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The central value of the
signal reported by the experiment DAMA is excluded at 90% CL.
