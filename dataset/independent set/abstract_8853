In the present paper, We introduce a pair of middle Cantor sets namely
$(C_\alpha, C_\beta)$ having stable intersection, while the product of their
thickness is smaller than one. Furthermore, the arithmetic difference
$C_\alpha- \lambda C_\beta$ contains at least one interval for each nonzero
number $\lambda$.
