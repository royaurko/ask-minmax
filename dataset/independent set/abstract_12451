We derive exact relations among the polarized gluon and three-gluon
distributions in the transversely polarized nucleon which are relevant to
single and double spin asymmetries in various hard processes. We also discuss
the partonic decomposition of the transverse nucleon spin and point out a
potential problem with frame-independence.
