We report on early stages of submonolayer Ag island coarsening on Ag(111)
surface at room temperature ($300$ K) carried out using realistic kinetic Monte
Carlo (KMC) simulations. We find that during early stages, coarsening proceeds
as a sequence of selected island sizes creating peaks and valleys in the island
size distribution. We find that island-size selectivity is due to formation of
kinetically stable islands for certain sizes because of adatom
detachment/attachment processes and large activation barrier for kink
detachment.
  In addition, we find that the ratio of number of adatom attachment to
detachment processes to be independent of parameters of initial configuration
and also on the initial shapes of the islands confirming that island-size
selectivity is independent of initial conditions.These simulations were carried
out using a very large database of processes identified by their local
environment and whose activation barriers were calculated using the
embedded-atom method.
