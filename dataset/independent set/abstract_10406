We investigate the behavior of weak ferromagnetic metals close to the
ferromagnetic critical point. We show that in the limit of small magnetic
moment the low temperature metallic phase is rigorously described by a local
ferromagnetic Fermi liquid that has a momentum-independent self-energy.
Whereas, non-Fermi liquid features develop at higher temperatures. Furthermore,
we find that an instability towards s-wave superconductivity is possible when
the exchange splitting is comparable to the superconducting gap.
