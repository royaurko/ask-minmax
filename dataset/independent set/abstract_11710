We construct a four dimensional Yang-Mills theory with ${\cal N}=4$ twisted
supersymmetry whose classical vacua correspond to four dimensional anti-de
Sitter space. The theory utilizes a complex gauge field whose real part is a
spin connection which is used to enforce local Lorentz invariance. The
imaginary part of the connection can then be interpreted as a vierbein. The
topological construction ensures that the partition function and classical
vacua are independent of the background geometry. Additionally a supersymmetric
and gauge invariant lattice construction is possible yielding a
non-perturbative definition of the theory.
