Geometrical objects with integral side lengths have fascinated mathematicians
through the ages. We call a set $P=\{p_1,...,p_n\}\subset\mathbb{Z}^2$ a
maximal integral point set over $\mathbb{Z}^2$ if all pairwise distances are
integral and every additional point $p_{n+1}$ destroys this property. Here we
consider such sets for a given cardinality and with minimum possible diameter.
We determine some exact values via exhaustive search and give several
constructions for arbitrary cardinalities. Since we cannot guarantee the
maximality in these cases we describe an algorithm to prove or disprove the
maximality of a given integral point set. We additionally consider restrictions
as no three points on a line and no four points on a circle.
