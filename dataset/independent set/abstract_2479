We revisit the reduction of type II supergravity on SU(3) structure
manifolds, conjectured to lead to gauged N=2 supergravity in 4 dimensions. The
reduction proceeds by expanding the invariant 2- and 3-forms of the SU(3)
structure as well as the gauge potentials of the type II theory in the same set
of forms, the analogues of harmonic forms in the case of Calabi-Yau reductions.
By focussing on the metric sector, we arrive at a list of constraints these
expansion forms should satisfy to yield a base point independent reduction.
Identifying these constraints is a first step towards a first-principles
reduction of type II on SU(3) structure manifolds.
