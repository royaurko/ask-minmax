Inclusive studies of nuclear photoabsorption have provided clear evidence of
medium modifications in the properties of hadrons. However, the results have
not been explained in a model independent way. A deeper understanding of the
situation is expected from a detailed comparison of meson photoproduction from
nucleons and from nuclei in exclusive reactions. Recent experimental results
are presented.
