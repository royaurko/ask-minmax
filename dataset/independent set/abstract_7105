Dynamical quasiparticle properties are determined from lattice
  QCD along the line of the Peshier model for the running strong coupling
constant in case of three light flavors. By separating time-like and space-like
quantities in the number density and energy density the effective degrees of
freedom in the gluon and quark sector may be specified from the time-like
densities. The space-like parts of the energy densities are identified with
interaction energy (or potential energy) densities. By using the time-like
parton densities (or scalar densities) as independent degrees of freedom
variations of the potential energy densities with respect to the time-like
gluon and/or fermion densities lead to effective mean-fields for time-like
gluons and quarks as well as to effective gluon-gluon, quark-gluon and
quark-quark (quark-antiquark) interactions. The latter dynamical quantities are
found to be approximately independent on the quark chemical potential and thus
well suited for an inplementation in off-shell parton transport approaches.
Results from the dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) in case of two dynamical
light quark flavors are compared to lattice QCD calculations for the net quark
density as well as for the 'back-to-back' differential dilepton production rate
by $q-{\bar q}$ annihilation. The DQPM is found to pass the independent tests.
