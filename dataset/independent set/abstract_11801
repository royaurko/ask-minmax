First-principles calculations were performed to investigate electronic and
elastic properties of the newly discovered 7.5K superconductor: layered Nb2InC.
As a result, electronic bands, total and site-projected l- decomposed DOS at
the Fermi level, shape of the Fermi surface for Nb2InC were obtained for the
first time. Besides, independent elastic constants, bulk modulus,
compressibility, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio together with
the elastic anisotropy parameters and indicator of brittle/ductile behavior of
Nb2InC were evaluated and analyzed in comparison with the available data.
