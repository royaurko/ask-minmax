We show that, for $pn \to \infty$, the largest set in a $p$-random subset of
the power set of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ containing no $k$-chain has size $( k - 1 +
o(1) ) p \binom{n}{n/2}$ with high probability.
  In the case $k = 2$, this confirms a conjecture of Osthus, and has been
proved independently by Balogh, Mycroft and Treglown.
