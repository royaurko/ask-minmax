The method for determination of the Supernovae (SNe) explosions frequency
distribution function based on the assumption of explosions independence are
offered. The method is based on assumption that the sequence of SNe explosions
in an individual galaxy is a Poisson sequence. The essence of the method is in
the determination of statistical moments of the frequency of the SNe explosions
and subsequent determination of distribution function . The program of
numerical simulation has been developed for testing the efficiency of the
method. Numerical simulations show that even for a small mean number of
registered SNe explosions, method allows restoring initial distribution
function. The results of numerical simulations are given.
