We consider a mixture consisting of two species of spherical nanoparticles
dispersed in a liquid medium. We show that with an appropriate choice of
refractive indices and particle diameters, it is possible to observe the
phenomenon of optical soliton bistability in two spatial dimensions in a broad
beam power range. Previously, this possibility was ruled out in the case of a
single-species colloid. As a particular example, we consider the system of
hydrophilic silica particles and gas bubbles generated in the process of
electrolysis in water. The interaction of two soliton beams can lead to
switching of the lower branch solitons to the upper branch, and the interaction
of solitons from different branches is phase independent and always repulsive.
