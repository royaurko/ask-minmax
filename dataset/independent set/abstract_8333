The Lempert function for a set of poles in a domain of $\mathbb C^n$ at a
point $z$ is obtained by taking a certain infimum over all analytic disks going
through the poles and the point $z$, and majorizes the corresponding multi-pole
pluricomplex Green function. Coman proved that both coincide in the case of
sets of two poles in the unit ball. We give an example of a set of three poles
in the unit ball where this equality fails.
