We present and investigate a general model for inhomogeneous random digraphs
with labeled vertices, where the arcs are generated independently, and the
probability of inserting an arc depends on the labels of its endpoints and its
orientation. For this model the critical point for the emergence of a giant
component is determined via a branching process approach.
