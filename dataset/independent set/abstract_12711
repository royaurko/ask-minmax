We have succeeded in fully describing dynamic properties of spin current
including the different spin absorption mechanism for longitudinal and
transverse spins in lateral spin valves, which enables to elucidate intrinsic
spin transport and relaxation mechanism in the nonmagnet. The deduced spin
lifetimes are found independent of the contact type. From the transit-time
distribution of spin current extracted from the Fourier transform in Hanle
measurement data, the velocity of the spin current in Ag with Py/Ag Ohmic
contact turns out much faster than that expected from the widely used model.
