The efficiency of different mass formulas derived from the liquid drop model
including or not the curvature energy, the Wigner term and different powers of
the relative neutron excess $I$ has been determined by a least square fitting
procedure to the experimental atomic masses assuming a constant
R$_{0,charge}$/A$^{1/3}$ ratio. The Wigner term and the curvature energy can be
used independently to improve the accuracy of the mass formula. The different
fits lead to a surface energy coefficient of around 17-18 MeV, a relative sharp
charge radius r$_0$ of 1.22-1.23 fm and a proton form-factor correction to the
Coulomb energy of around 0.9 MeV.
