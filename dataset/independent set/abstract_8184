We obtain gravity duals to supersymmetric gauge theories in two and three
spacetime dimensions with unquenched flavor. The supergravity solutions are
generated by a set of color branes wrapping a compact cycle in a Calabi-Yau
threefold, together with another set of flavor branes extended along the
directions orthogonal to the cycle wrapped by the color branes. We construct
supergravity backgrounds which include the backreaction induced by a smeared
set of flavor branes, which act as delocalized dynamical sources of the
different supergravity fields.
