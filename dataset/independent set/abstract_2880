We formulate target space duality symmetry of NSR superstring from the
perspectives of worldsheet. The worldsheet action is presented in the
superspace formalism in the presence of massless backgrounds. We start from a
${\hat D}$-dimensional target space worldsheet action and compactify the theory
on a d-dimensional torus, $T^d$. It is assumed that the backgrounds are
independent of compact (super)coordinates. We adopt the formalism of our
earlier work to introduce dual supercoordinates along compact directions and
introduce the corresponding dual backgrounds. It is demonstrated that combined
equations of motion of the two sets of coordinates can be expressed in a
manifestly $O(d,d)$ covariant form analogous to the equations of motions for
closed bosonic string derived by us. Furthermore, we show that the vertex
operators associated with excited massive levels of NSR string can be expressed
in an $O(d,d)$ invariant form generalizing earlier result for closed bosonic
string.
