We study the maximal abelian ad-nilpotent (mad) subalgebras of the domains D
Morita equivalent to the first Weyl algebra. We give a complete description
both of the individual mad subalgebras and of the space of all such. A
surprising consequence is that this last space is independent of D. Our results
generalize some classic theorems of Dixmier about the Weyl algebra.
