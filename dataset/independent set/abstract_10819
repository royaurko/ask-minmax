The structure of the renormalization group equations for the low energy
effective theory of gravity coupled to a scalar field is presented. An
approximate solution to these equations with a finite number of independent
renormalized parameters can be found when the mass scale characteristic of the
fluctuations in the geometry is much smaller than the Planck mass. The
cosmological constant problem is reformulated in this context and some
conditions on the matter field content and interactions required in order to
have a sufficiently small cosmological constant are identified.
