We study solutions for the Hodge laplace equation $\Delta u=\omega$ on p
forms with L r estimates for r \textgreater{} 1. Our main hypothesis is that
$\Delta$ has a spectral gap in L 2. We use this to get L r Hodge decomposition
theorems. An interesting feature is that our decompositions are completely
independent of the boundedness of the Riesz transforms in L s. These results
are based on a generalisation of the Raising Steps Method to complete non
compact riemannian manifolds.
