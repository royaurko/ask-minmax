Gene-gene interactions have long been recognized to be fundamentally
important to understand genetic causes of complex disease traits. At present,
identifying gene-gene interactions from genome-wide case-control studies is
computationally and methodologically challenging. In this paper, we introduce a
simple but powerful method, named `BOolean Operation based Screening and
Testing'(BOOST). To discover unknown gene-gene interactions that underlie
complex diseases, BOOST allows examining all pairwise interactions in
genome-wide case-control studies in a remarkably fast manner. We have carried
out interaction analyses on seven data sets from the Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium (WTCCC). Each analysis took less than 60 hours on a standard
3.0 GHz desktop with 4G memory running Windows XP system. The interaction
patterns identified from the type 1 diabetes data set display significant
difference from those identified from the rheumatoid arthritis data set, while
both data sets share a very similar hit region in the WTCCC report. BOOST has
also identified many undiscovered interactions between genes in the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) region in the type 1 diabetes data set. In the
coming era of large-scale interaction mapping in genome-wide case-control
studies, our method can serve as a computationally and statistically useful
tool.
