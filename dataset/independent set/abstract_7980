We have fabricated and characterized a new type of electrometer that couples
two parallel single-electron transistors (SETs) to a radio-frequency tank
circuit for use as a differential RF-SET. We demonstrate operation of this
device in summing, differential, and single-SET operation modes, and use it to
measure a Coulomb staircase from a differential single Cooper-pair box. In
differential mode, the device is sensitive to uncorrelated input signals while
screening out correlated ones.
