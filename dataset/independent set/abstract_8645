We introduce non-abelian cohomology sets of Hopf algebras with coefficients
in Hopf modules. We prove that these sets generalize Serre's non-abelian group
cohomology theory. Using descent techniques, we establish that our construction
enables to classify as well twisted forms for modules over Hopf-Galois
extensions as torsors over Hopf-modules.
