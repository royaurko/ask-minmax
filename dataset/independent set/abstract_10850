We compare two most relevant loop induced muon number violating processes,
\mu --> e \gamma and \mu-e conversion in nuclei, in constraining new physics.
Because of much richer structure of the latter process it may be enhanced with
respect to \mu --> e \gamma by a large $\ln(m^2_\mu/\Lambda^2),$ where
$\Lambda$ is the scale of the new physics. After model-independent
considerations we present two examples constraining the R-parity violating
couplings of MSSM and the off-diagonal couplings of the doubly charged Higgs
bosons from the non-observation of \mu-e conversion.
