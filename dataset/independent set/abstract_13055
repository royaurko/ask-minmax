We report the spin-pump-induced spin-transport property of a
thermally-evaporated pentacene film at room temperature. In a
palladium(Pd)/pentacene/Ni80Fe20 tri-layer sample, pure spin-current induced
with the spin-pump of the Ni80Fe20 is generated in the pentacene, and the
generated spin current is absorbed into the Pd layer. The absorbed spin current
is converted to a charge current with the inverse spin-Hall effect in the Pd,
and is detected as electromotive forces. This is the first observation of the
pure spin current in evaporated pentacene at room temperature, independent of
the conductance mismatch problem in spin injection.
