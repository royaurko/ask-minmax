We study the geometric structure of compact convex sets in 2-dimensional
asymmetric normed lattices. We prove that every q-compact convex set is
strongly q-compact and we give a complete geometric description of the compact
convex sets with non empty interior in (R^2, q), where q is an asymmetric
lattice norm.
