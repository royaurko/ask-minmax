A variation of Rosenstock's trapping model in which $N$ independent random
walkers are all initially placed upon a site of a one-dimensional lattice in
the presence of a {\em one-sided} random distribution (with probability $c$) of
absorbing traps is investigated. The probability (survival probability)
$\Phi_N(t)$ that no random walker is trapped by time $t$ for $N \gg 1$ is
calculated by using the extended Rosenstock approximation. This requires the
evaluation of the moments of the number $S_N(t)$ of distinct sites visited in a
{\em given} direction up to time $t$ by $N$ independent random walkers. The
Rosenstock approximation improves when $N$ increases, working well in the range
$Dt\ln^2(1-c) \ll \ln N$, $D$ being the diffusion constant. The moments of the
time (lifetime) before any trapping event occurs are calculated asymptotically,
too. The agreement with numerical results is excellent.
