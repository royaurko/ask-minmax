A model-independent determination of the CKM matrix element V_{us} from five
measured strangeness-changing hyperon semileptonic decays is performed. Flavor
SU(3) symmetry breaking effects in the leading vector and axial-vector form
factors are analyzed in the framework of the 1/N_c expansion of QCD. A fit to
experimental data allows one to extract the value V_{us}=0.2199\pm 0.0026,
which is comparable to the one from K_{e3} decays. This reconciliation is
achieved through second-order symmetry breaking effects of a few percent in the
form factors f_1, which increase their magnitudes over their SU(3) predictions.
