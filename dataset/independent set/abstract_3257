A mixture model of Gaussian copulas is presented to cluster mixed data
(different kinds of variables simultaneously) where any kinds of variables are
allowed if they admit a cumulative distribution function. This approach allows
to straightforwardly define simple multivariate intra-class dependency models
while preserving any one-dimensional margin distributions of each component of
interest for the statistician. Typically in this work, the margin distributions
of each component are classical parametric ones in order to facilitate the
model interpretation. In addition, the intra-class dependencies are taken into
account by the Gaussian copulas which provide one correlation coefficient,
having robustness properties, per couple of variables and per class. This model
generalizes different existing models defined for homogeneous and mixed
variables. The inference is performed via a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler in
a Bayesian framework. Numerical experiments illustrate the model flexibility
even if the data are simulated according to another model. Finally, three
applications on real data sets strengthen the idea that the proposed model is
of interest, since it reduces the biases of the locally independent model and
since it provides a meaningful summary of the data.
