We study, globaly in time, the velocity distribution $f(v,t)$ of a spatially
homogeneous system that models a system of electrons in a weakly ionized
plasma, subjected to a constant external electric field $E$. The density $f$
satisfies a Boltzmann type kinetic equation containing a full nonlinear
electron-electron collision term as well as linear terms representing
collisions with reservoir particles having a specified Maxwellian distribution.
We show that when the constant in front of the nonlinear collision kernel,
thought of as a scaling parameter, is sufficiently strong, then the $L^1$
distance between $f$ and a certain time dependent Maxwellian stays small
uniformly in $t$. Moreover, the mean and variance of this time dependent
Maxwellian satisfy a coupled set of nonlinear ODE's that constitute the
``hydrodynamical'' equations for this kinetic system. This remain true even
when these ODE's have non-unique equilibria, thus proving the existence of
multiple stabe stationary solutions for the full kinetic model. Our approach
relies on scale independent estimates for the kinetic equation, and entropy
production estimates. The novel aspects of this approach may be useful in other
problems concerning the relation between the kinetic and hydrodynamic scales
globably in time.
