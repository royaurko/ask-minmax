The time independent Schoedinger equation for two electrons confined in a
parabolic external potential is solved. Developing this solution in terms of a
dimensionless variable it is demonstrated that parameterization of the strength
of the confining potential separate from the effective mass assumption greatly
clarifies the functional dependence of the system energy on the system
parameters. The determination of the strength of the external confinement and
validation of the effective mass assumption in real devices is greatly improved
by characterizing the strength of the confining potential separate from the
effective mass.
