We use the $\Delta_{\chi^2}$ statistic introduced in \cite{gup08,gup10} to
study directional dependence, in the high-z supernovae data. This dependence
could arise due to departures from the cosmological principle or from direction
dependent statistical systematics in the data. We apply our statistic to the
gold data set from \cite{rie04} and \cite{rie07}, and Union2 catalogue from
\cite{aman10}. Our results show that all the three data sets show a weak but
consistent direction dependence. In 2007 data errors are Gaussian, however
other two data sets show non-Gaussian features.
