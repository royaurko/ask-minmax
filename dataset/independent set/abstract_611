We discuss four-fermion contact-interaction searches in the processes
e^+e^-\to\mu^+\mu^-, c{\bar c} and b{\bar b} at a future e^+e^- Linear Collider
with c.m. energy \sqrt{s}=0.5 TeV and with both beams longitudinally polarized.
Our analysis is based on the measurements of familiar polarized observables
such as the total cross section and the forward-backward/left-right
asymmetries, and accounts for the general set of contact interaction couplings
as independent, non-zero, parameters thus avoiding simplifying,
model-dependent, assumptions. We derive the corresponding model-independent
constraints on the above-mentioned coupling constants, and evaluate the
corresponding reach at the Linear Collider, emphasizing the role of beam
polarization. We compare the results with a model-dependent procedure where
only one coupling is varied at a time.
