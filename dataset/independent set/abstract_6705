Let $\mathbf{P}$ denote the set of prime numbers and, for an appropriate
function $h$, define a set $\mathbf{P}_{h}=\{p\in\mathbf{P}:
\exists_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\ p=\lfloor h(n)\rfloor\}$. The aim of this paper is to
show that every subset of $\mathbf{P}_{h}$ having positive relative upper
density contains a nontrivial three-term arithmetic progression. In particular
the set of Piatetski--Shapiro primes of fixed type $71/72<\gamma<1$, i.e.
$\{p\in\mathbf{P}: \exists_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\ p=\lfloor n^{1/\gamma}\rfloor\}$
has this feature. We show this by proving the counterpart of Bourgain--Green's
restriction theorem for the set $\mathbf{P}_{h}$.
