In recent years answer set programming has been extended to deal with
multi-valued predicates. The resulting formalisms allows for the modeling of
continuous problems as elegantly as ASP allows for the modeling of discrete
problems, by combining the stable model semantics underlying ASP with fuzzy
logics. However, contrary to the case of classical ASP where many efficient
solvers have been constructed, to date there is no efficient fuzzy answer set
programming solver. A well-known technique for classical ASP consists of
translating an ASP program $P$ to a propositional theory whose models exactly
correspond to the answer sets of $P$. In this paper, we show how this idea can
be extended to fuzzy ASP, paving the way to implement efficient fuzzy ASP
solvers that can take advantage of existing fuzzy logic reasoners. To appear in
