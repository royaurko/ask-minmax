We construct quasi-isometric embeddings from right-angled Artin groups into
the outer automorphism group of a free group. These homomorphisms are in
analogy with those constructed in \cite{CLM}, where the target group is the
mapping class group of a surface. Toward this goal, we develop tools in the
free group setting that mirror those for surface groups as well as discuss
various analogs of subsurface projection; these may be of independent interest.
