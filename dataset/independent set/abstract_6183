We present a simple new proof for the stochastic homogenization of
quasiconvex (level-set convex) Hamilton-Jacobi equations set in stationary
ergodic environments. Our approach, which is new even in the convex case,
yields more information about the qualitative behavior of the effective
nonlinearity.
