The four LEP experiments, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have searched for Higgs
bosons predicted by a large number of extensions of the Standard Model. Flavor
independent searches are presented for the h$^{0}$Z$^{0}$ process in which the
h$^{0}$ decays hadronically. Search results are also presented for fermiophobic
Higgs bosons, invisibly decaying Higgs bosons, charged Higgs bosons and the
neutral Higgs bosons in the MSSM.
