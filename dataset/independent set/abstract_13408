LISA is the upcoming space-based Gravitational Wave telescope. LISA
Pathfinder, to be launched in the coming years, will prove and verify the
detection principle of the fundamental Doppler link of LISA on a flight
hardware identical in design to that of LISA. LISA Pathfinder will collect a
picture of all noise disturbances possibly affecting LISA, achieving the
unprecedented pureness of geodesic motion necessary for the detection of
gravitational waves. The first steps of both missions will crucially depend on
a very precise calibration of the key system parameters. Moreover, robust
parameters estimation is of fundamental importance in the correct assessment of
the residual force noise, an essential part of the data processing for LISA. In
this paper we present a maximum likelihood parameter estimation technique in
time domain being devised for this calibration and show its proficiency on
simulated data and validation through Monte Carlo realizations of independent
noise runs. We discuss its robustness to non-standard scenarios possibly
arising during the real-life mission, as well as its independence to the
initial guess and non-gaussianities. Furthermore, we apply the same technique
to data produced in mission-like fashion during operational exercises with a
realistic simulator provided by ESA.
