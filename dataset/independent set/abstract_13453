In the past, clues on the potential radiogenic activity of the lunar interior
have been obtained from the isotopic composition of noble gases like Argon.
Excess Argon (40) relative to Argon (36), as compared to the solar wind
composition, is generally ascribed to the radiogenic activity of the lunar
interior. Almost all the previous estimates were based on, 'on-the-spot'
measurements from the landing sites. Relative concentration of the isotopes of
40Ar and 36Ar along a meridian by the Chandra's Altitudinal Composition
Explorer (CHACE) experiment, on the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) of India's first
mission to Moon, has independently yielded clues on the possible spatial
heterogeneity in the radiogenic activity of the lunar interior in addition to
providing indicative 'antiquity' of the lunar surface along the ground track
over the near side of the moon. These results are shown to broadly corroborate
the independent topography measurements by the Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument
(LLRI) in the main orbiter Chandrayaan-1. The unique combination of these
experiments provided high spatial resolution data while indicating the possible
close linkages between the lunar interior and the lunar ambience.
