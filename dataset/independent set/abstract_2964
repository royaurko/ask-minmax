A central limit theorem for the integrated squared error of the
directional-linear kernel density estimator is established. The result enables
the construction and analysis of two testing procedures based on squared loss:
a nonparametric independence test for directional and linear random variables
and a goodness-of-fit test for parametric families of directional-linear
densities. Limit distributions for both test statistics, and a consistent
bootstrap strategy for the goodness-of-fit test, are developed for the
directional-linear case and adapted to the directional-directional setting.
Finite sample performance for the goodness-of-fit test is illustrated in a
simulation study. This test is also applied to datasets from biology and
environmental sciences.
