The density of states of Yang-Mills integrals in the supersymmetric case is
characterized by power-law tails whose decay is independent of N, the rank of
the gauge group. It is believed that this has no counterpart in matrix models,
but we construct a matrix model that exactly exhibits this property. In
addition, we show that the eigenfunctions employed to construct the matrix
model are invariant under the collinear subgroup of conformal transformations,
SL(2,R). We also show that the matrix model itself is invariant under a
fractional linear transformation. The wave functions of the model appear in the
trigonometric Rosen-Morse potential and in free relativistic motion on AdS
space.
