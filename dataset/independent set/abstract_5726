Using two specific models and a model independent formalism, we show that an
``out-longitudinal'' cross term should be included in any gaussian fits to
correlation data. In addition, we show that correlation radii (including the
cross term) measure lengths of homogeneity within the source, not necessarily
geometric sizes.
