We study the parametrizations of simple modules provided by the theory of
basic sets for all finite Weyl groups. In the case of type B, we show the
existence of basic sets for the matrices of constructible representations. Then
we study bijections between the various basic sets and show that they are
controlled by the matrices of the constructible representations.
