Building on previous work of Tait, Koellner, and myself exploring the
question of which reflection principles are intrinsically justified on the
basis of the iterative conception of set, we formulate a new reflection
principle, which subsumes all previously known reflection principles which have
been proposed as intrinsically justified and are also known to be consistent,
and which is itself consistent relative to an $\omega$-Erd\"os cardinal. An
open-ended family of strengthenings of this principle is tentatively proposed
as exhausting everything that can be justified on the basis of the iterative
conception of set.
