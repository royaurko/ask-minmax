Assuming repeated independent sampling from a Bernoulli distribution with two
possible outcomes S and F, there are formulas for computing the probability of
one specific pattern of consecutive outcomes (such as SSFFSS) winning (i.e.
being generated first) over another such pattern (e.g. SFSSFS). In this article
we will extend the theory to three competing patterns.
