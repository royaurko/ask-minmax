Using methods from ergodic theory along with properties of the Furstenberg
measure we obtain conditions under which certain classes of plane self-affine
sets have Hausdorff or box-counting dimensions equal to their affinity
dimension. We exhibit some new specific classes of self-affine sets for which
these dimensions are equal.
