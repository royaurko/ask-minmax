The joint statistics of partial sums of ordered random variables (RVs) are
often needed for the accurate performance characterization of a wide variety of
wireless communication systems. A unified analytical framework to determine the
joint statistics of partial sums of ordered independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) random variables was recently presented. However, the
identical distribution assumption may not be valid in several real-world
applications. With this motivation in mind, we consider in this paper the more
general case in which the random variables are independent but not necessarily
identically distributed (i.n.d.). More specifically, we extend the previous
analysis and introduce a new more general unified analytical framework to
determine the joint statistics of partial sums of ordered i.n.d. RVs. Our
mathematical formalism is illustrated with an application on the exact
performance analysis of the capture probability of generalized selection
combining (GSC)-based RAKE receivers operating over frequency-selective fading
channels with a non-uniform power delay profile. We also discussed a couple of
other sample applications of the generic results presented in this work.
