We prove that a `small' extension of a minimal AF equivalence relation on a
Cantor set is orbit equivalent to the AF relation. By a `small' extension we
mean an equivalence relation generated by the minimal AF equivalence relation
and another AF equivalence relation which is defined on a closed thin subset.
The result we obtain is a generalization of the main theorem in [GMPS2].
