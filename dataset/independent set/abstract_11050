We present an independent calculation of ${\cal{O}}(\alpha_s)$ matrix
elements of the QCD penguin operators for the decays $\bar{B}\to
X_{s(d)}\gamma$. The Mellin-Barnes representation technique is applied for the
systematic numerical evaluation of involved two-loop diagrams. The numerical
effect of the calculated contributions is confirmed to be of order of 1%. We
also present an updated numerical analysis for $\bar{B}\to X_{s(d)}\gamma$
decay rates.
