We analyze the effects of a tree level flavor changing $tcZ$ vertex induced
by a mixing with new isosinglet $Q=2/3$ quarks, on the effective $bsZ$ vertex.
We compute the contributions arising from the new electroweak penguin diagrams
involving one insertion of the $tcZ$ vertex. We show that a generalized GIM
mechanism ensures the cancellation of the mass independent terms as well as of
the new divergences. Unexpectedly, the presence of a $tcZ$ coupling cannot
enhance the rates for the $Z$ mediated flavor changing decays \bsll\ and \bsnn,
implying that these processes cannot be used to set limits on the $tcZ$
coupling. The additional effects of the heavy isosinglets are compared with the
well studied effects of new isodoublets appearing in multi-generational models.
