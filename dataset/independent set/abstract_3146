Consider any supercritical Galton-Watson process which may become extinct
with positive probability. It is a well-understood and intuitively obvious
phenomenon that, on the survival set, the process may be pathwise decomposed
into a stochastically `thinner' Galton-Watson process, which almost surely
survives and which is decorated with immigrants, at every time step, initiating
independent copies of the original Galton-Watson process conditioned to become
extinct. The thinner process is known as the backbone and characterizes the
genealogical lines of descent of prolific individuals in the original process.
Here, prolific means individuals who have at least one descendant in every
subsequent generation to their own.
  Starting with Evans and O'Connell, there exists a cluster of literature
describing the analogue of this decomposition (the so-called backbone
decomposition) for a variety of different classes of superprocesses and
continuous-state branching processes. Note that the latter family of stochastic
processes may be seen as the total mass process of superprocesses with
non-spatially dependent branching mechanism.
  In this article we consolidate the aforementioned collection of results
concerning backbone decompositions and describe a result for a general class of
supercritical superprocesses with spatially dependent branching mechanisms. Our
approach exposes the commonality and robustness of many of the existing
arguments in the literature.
