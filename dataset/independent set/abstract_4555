We analyze the 2D correlation function of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS sample of massive galaxies of the ninth data
release to measure cosmic expansion H and the angular diameter distance D_A at
a mean redshift of <z> = 0.57. We apply, for the first time, a new correlation
function technique called clustering wedges. Using a physically motivated
model, the anisotropic baryonic acoustic feature in the galaxy sample is
detected at a significance level of 4.7 sigma compared to a featureless model.
The baryonic acoustic feature is used to obtain model independent constraints
cz/H/r_s = 12.28 +- 0.82 (6.7 per-cent accuracy) and D_A/r_s = 9.05 +- 0.27
(3.0 per-cent) with a correlation coefficient of -0.5, where r_s is the sound
horizon scale at the end of the baryonic drag era. We conduct thorough tests on
the data and 600 simulated realizations, finding robustness of the results
regardless of the details of the analysis method. Combining with r_s
constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background we obtain H(0.57) = 90.8 +-
6.2 kms-1Mpc-1 and D_A(0.57) = 1386 +- 45 Mpc. We use simulations to forecast
results of the final BOSS CMASS data set. We apply the reconstruction technique
on the simulations demonstrating that the sharpening of the anisotropic
baryonic acoustic feature should improve the detection as well as tighten
constraints of H and D_A by 30 per-cent on average.
