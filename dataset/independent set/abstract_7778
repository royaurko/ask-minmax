A model-independent method of studying the forward-backward correlations in
symmetric high energy processes is developed. The method allows a systematic
study of properties of various particle sources and to uncover asymmetric
structures hidden in symmetric hadron-hadron and nucleus-nucleus inelastic
reactions.
