We investigate the matrix-model origin of the spherical sector of the
rational Calogero model and its constants of motion. We develop a diagrammatic
technique which allows us to find explicit expressions of the constants of
motion and calculate their Poisson brackets. In this way we obtain all
functionally independent constants of motion to any given order in the momenta.
Our technique is related to the valence-bond basis for singlet states.
