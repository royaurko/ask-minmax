The path integral formulation of Quantum Field Theory implies an infinite set
of local, Schwinger-Dyson-like relations. Exact renormalization group equations
can be cast as a particular instance of these relations. Furthermore, exact
scheme independence is turned into a vector field transformation of the kernel
of the exact renormalization group equation under field redefinitions.
