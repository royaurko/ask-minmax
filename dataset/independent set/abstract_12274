Motivated by Yang-Mills theory in 4n dimensions, and generalizing the notion
due to Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin and Manin for n=1, Okonek, Spindler and
Trautmann introduced instanton bundles and special instanton bundles as certain
algebraic vector bundles of rank 2n on the complex projective space P^{2n+1}.
The moduli space of special instanton bundles is shown to be rational.
