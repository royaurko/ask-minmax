An extensive experimental study of indentation and crack arrest statistics is
presented for four different brittle materials (alumina, silicon carbide,
silicon nitride, glass). Evidence is given that the crack length statistics can
be described by a universal (i.e. material independent) distribution. The
latter directly derives from results obtained when modeling crack propagation
as a depinning phenomenon. Crack arrest (or effective toughness) statistics
appears to be fully characterized by two parameters, namely, an asymptotic
crack length (or macroscopic toughness) value and a power law size dependent
width. The experimental knowledge of the crack arrest statistics at one given
scale thus gives access to its knowledge at all scales.
