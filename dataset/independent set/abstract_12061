Proton structure effects in hydrogenic bound states are analyzed using
nonrelativistic QED effective field theory. Implications for the Lamb shift in
muonic hydrogen are discussed. Model-dependent assumptions in previous analyses
are isolated, and sensitivity to poorly constrained hadronic structure in the
two-photon exchange contribution is identified.
