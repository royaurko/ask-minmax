In the present paper we review recent experimental results from the BaBar
experiment concerning the measurement of the CKM angles. A particular highlight
is given to the novel independent determination of the angle alpha from B0 ->
a_1(1260)+/- pi -/+ and to the recent full-luminosity updates of several angle
gamma measurements.
