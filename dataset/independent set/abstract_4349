We give an overview of some developments in dependence and independence
logic. This is a tiny selection, intended for a newcomer, from a rapidly
growing literature on the topic. Furthermore, we discuss conditional
independence atoms and we prove that conditional and non-conditional
independence logic are equivalent. Finally, we briefly discuss an application
of our logics to belief representation.
