Poisson statistics predicts that the shot noise in a tunnel junction has a
temperature independent third cumulant e^2\I, determined solely by the mean
current I. Experimental data, however, show a puzzling temperature dependence.
We demonstrate theoretically that the third cumulant becomes strongly
temperature dependent and may even change sign as a result of feedback from the
electromagnetic environment. In the limit of a noninvasive (zero-impedance)
measurement circuit in thermal equilibrium with the junction, we find that the
third cumulant crosses over from e^2/I at low temperatures to -e^2/I at high
temperatures.
