The tree level semileptonic $\Lambda_{b}\to pl\nu$ and $\Lambda_{c}\to nl\nu$
transitions are investigated using the light cone QCD sum rules approach in
full theory. The spin--1/2, $\Lambda_{Q}$ baryon with $Q=b$ or $c$, is
considered by the most general form of its interpolating current. The time
ordering product of the initial and transition currents is expanded in terms of
the nucleon distribution amplitudes with different twists. Considering two sets
of independent input parameters entering to the nucleon wave functions, namely,
QCD sum rules and Lattice QCD parameters, the related form factors and their
heavy quark effective theory limits are calculated and compared with the
existing predictions of other approaches. It is shown that our results satisfy
the heavy quark symmetry relations for lattice input parameters and b case
exactly and the maximum violation is for charm case and QCD sum rules input
parameters. The obtained form factors are used to compute the transition rates
both in full theory and heavy quark effective theory. A comparison of the
results on decay rate of $\Lambda_{b}\to pl\nu$ with those predicted by other
phenomenological methods or the same method in heavy quark effective theory
with different interpolating current and distribution amplitudes of the
$\Lambda_{b}$ is also presented.
