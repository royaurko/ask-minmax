The model combined with unitarity and impact parameter picture provides
simple mechanism for generation of hyperon polarization in collision of
unpolarized hadrons. We concentrate on a particular problem of
$\Lambda$-hyperon polarization and derive its linear $x_F$-dependence as well
as its energy and transverse momentum independence at large $p_\perp$ values.
Mechanism responsible for the single--spin asymmetries in pion production is
also discussed.
