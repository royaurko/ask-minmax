We study partitions of the symmetric group which have desirable geometric
properties. The statistical tests defined by such partitions involve counting
all permutations in the equivalence classes. These permutations are the linear
extensions of partially ordered sets specified by the data. Our methods refine
rank tests of non-parametric statistics, such as the sign test and the runs
test, and are useful for the exploratory analysis of ordinal data. Convex rank
tests correspond to probabilistic conditional independence structures known as
semi-graphoids. Submodular rank tests are classified by the faces of the cone
of submodular functions, or by Minkowski summands of the permutohedron. We
enumerate all small instances of such rank tests. Graphical tests correspond to
both graphical models and to graph associahedra, and they have excellent
statistical and algorithmic properties.
