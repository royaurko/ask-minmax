Self-assembly is a fundamental process by which supramolecular species form
spontaneously from their components. This process is ubiquitous throughout the
life chemistry and is central to biological information processing. Algorithms
for solving many mathematical and computational problems via tile self assembly
have been proposed by many researchers in the last decade. In particular tile
set for doing basic arithmetic of two inputs have been given. In this work we
give tile set for doing basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction,
multiplication) of n inputs and subsequently computing its modulo. We also
present a tile set for primality testing. Finally we present a software
'xtilemod' for doing modular arithmetic. This simplifies the task of creating
the input files to xgrow simulator for doing basic (addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division) as well as modular arithmetic of n inputs. Similar
software for creating tile set for primality testing is also given.
