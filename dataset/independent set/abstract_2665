Supersymmetrization of a nonlinear evolution equation in which the bosonic
equation is independent of the fermionic variable and the system is linear in
fermionic field goes by the name B-supersymmetrization. This special type of
supersymmetrization plays a role in superstring theory. We provide
B-supersymmetric extension of a number of quasilinear and fully nonlinear
evolution equations and find that the supersymmetric system follows from the
usual action principle while the bosonic and fermionic equations are
individually non Lagrangian in the field variable. We point out that
B-supersymmetrization can also be realized using a generalized Noetherian
symmetry such that the resulting set of Lagrangian symmetries coincides with
symmetries of the bosonic field equations. This observation provides a basis to
associate the bosonic and fermionic fields with the terms of bright and dark
solitons. The interpretation sought by us has its origin in the classic work of
Bateman who introduced a reverse-time system with negative friction to bring
the linear dissipative systems within the framework of variational principle.
