We consider a diffeomorphism f of a compact manifold M which is Almost Axiom
A, i.e. f is hyperbolic in a neighborhood of some compact f-invariant set,
except in some singular set of neutral points. We prove that if there exists
some f-invariant set of hyperbolic points with positive unstable-Lebesgue
measure such that for every point in this set the stable and unstable leaves
are "long enough", then f admits a probability SRB measure.
