Using 4 flavors of staggered fermions at infinite gauge coupling, we compare
various analytic results for the hadron spectrum with exact Monte Carlo
simulations. Agreement with Ref. \cite{Martin_etal} is very good, at the level
of a few percent.
  Our results give credence to a discrepancy between the baryon mass and the
critical chemical potential, for which baryons fill the lattice at zero
temperature and infinite gauge coupling. Independent determinations of the
latter set it at about 30% less than the baryon mass. One possible explanation
is that the nuclear attraction becomes strong at infinite gauge coupling.
