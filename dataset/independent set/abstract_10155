Let $\Omega=\{1,2,...,n\}$ where $n \ge 2$. The {\em shape} of an ordered set
partition $P=(P_1,..., P_k)$ of $\Omega$ is the integer partition
$\lambda=(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_k)$ defined by $\lambda_i = |P_i|$. Let G be a
group of permutations acting on $\Omega$. For a fixed partition $\lambda$ of n,
we say that G is {\em $\lambda$-transitive} if G has only one orbit when acting
on partitions P of shape $\la$. A corresponding definition can also be given
when G is just a set. For example, if $\lambda=(n-t,1,...,1)$, then a
$\lambda$-transitive group is the same as a t-transitive permutation group and
if $\lambda=(n-t,t)$, then we recover the t-homogeneous permutation groups.
  In this paper, we use the character theory of the symmetric group $S_n$ to
establish some structural results regarding $\lambda$-transitive groups and
sets. In particular, we are able to generalize a theorem of Livingstone and
Wagner about t-homogeneous groups. We survey the relevant examples coming from
groups. While it is known that a finite group of permutations can be at most
5-transitive unless it contains the alternating group, we show that it is
possible to construct a non-trivial t-transitive set of permutations for each
positive integer t. We also show how these ideas lead to a split basis for the
association scheme of the symmetric group.
