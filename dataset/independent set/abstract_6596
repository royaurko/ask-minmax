Let {X_n} be a sequence of analytic sets converging to some analytic set X in
the sense of holomorphic chains. We introduce a condition which implies that
every irreducible component of X is the limit of a sequence of irreducible
components of the sets from {X_n}. Next we apply the condition to approximate a
holomorphic solution y=f(x) of a system Q(x,y)=0 of Nash equations by Nash
solutions. Presented methods allow to construct an algorithm of approximation
of the holomorphic solutions.
