If two G-manifolds are G-cobordant then characteristic numbers corresponding
to the fixed point sets (submanifolds) of subgroups of G and to normal bundles
to these sets coincide. We construct two analogues of these characteristic
numbers for singular complex G-varieties where G is a finite group. They are
defined as sums of certain indices of collections of 1-forms (with values in
the spaces of the irreducible representations of subgroups). These indices are
generalizations of the GSV-index (for isolated complete intersection
singularities) and the Euler obstruction respectively.
