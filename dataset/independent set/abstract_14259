The set of non-commutative probability distributions with mean one can be
endowed with the structure of a unital ring, which is isomorphic to the
Grothendieck $\lambda$-ring. Voiculescu's multiplicative and additive free
convolution, $\boxtimes$ and $\boxplus$, are related to each other as the
logarithm is to the exponential. We show the connection of the $R$- and
$S$-transform with Witt vectors, formal group laws and Faber polynomials.
Finally we give a representation of the set of all complex-valued
multiplicative genera in complex cobordism as elements in a non-commutative
probability space.
