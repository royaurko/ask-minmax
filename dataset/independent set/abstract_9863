We extend the classical LR characterization of chirotopes of finite planar
families of points to chirotopes of finite planar families of pairwise disjoint
convex bodies: a map \c{hi} on the set of 3-subsets of a finite set I is a
chirotope of finite planar families of pairwise disjoint convex bodies if and
only if for every 3-, 4-, and 5-subset J of I the restriction of \c{hi} to the
set of 3-subsets of J is a chirotope of finite planar families of pairwise
disjoint convex bodies. Our main tool is the polarity map, i.e., the map that
assigns to a convex body the set of lines missing its interior, from which we
derive the key notion of arrangements of double pseudolines, introduced for the
first time in this paper.
