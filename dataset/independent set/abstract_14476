The Adaptive Multilevel Splitting algorithm is a very powerful and versatile
iterative method to estimate the probability of rare events, based on an
interacting particle systems. In an other article, in a so-called idealized
setting, the contributors prove that some associated estimators are unbiased, for
each value of the size n of the systems of replicas and of resampling number k.
Here we go beyond and prove these estimator's asymptotic normality when h goes
to infinity, for any fixed value of k. The main ingredient is the asymptotic
analysis of a functional equation on an appropriate characteristic function.
Some numerical simulations illustrate the convergence to rely on Gaussian
confidence intervals.
