Ultrahigh-dimensional variable selection plays an increasingly important role
in contemporary scientific discoveries and statistical research. Among others,
Fan and Lv [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 70 (2008) 849-911] propose
an independent screening framework by ranking the marginal correlations. They
showed that the correlation ranking procedure possesses a sure independence
screening property within the context of the linear model with Gaussian
covariates and responses. In this paper, we propose a more general version of
the independent learning with ranking the maximum marginal likelihood estimates
or the maximum marginal likelihood itself in generalized linear models. We show
that the proposed methods, with Fan and Lv [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat.
Methodol. 70 (2008) 849-911] as a very special case, also possess the sure
screening property with vanishing false selection rate. The conditions under
which the independence learning possesses a sure screening is surprisingly
simple. This justifies the applicability of such a simple method in a wide
spectrum. We quantify explicitly the extent to which the dimensionality can be
reduced by independence screening, which depends on the interactions of the
covariance matrix of covariates and true parameters. Simulation studies are
used to illustrate the utility of the proposed approaches. In addition, we
establish an exponential inequality for the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator
which is useful for high-dimensional statistical learning.
