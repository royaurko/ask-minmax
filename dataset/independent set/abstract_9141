In the two correlated $B$ meson decay experiment we propose to measure
intensities relating CP eigenstate ($J/\psi K_{S,L}$) decays on $both$ sides,
which will be measurable in future upgrades of KEK and PEP. As a CP-forbidden
transition, we obtain $I(J/\psi K_S, J/\psi K_S, \Delta t) \sim \sin ^2
(2\beta)$. We calculate in a model independent way all the possible intensities
relating final CP and flavour eigenstate decays. Under CPT-invariance, the
asymmetries for processes related by CP$\Delta t$ vanish for $\Delta \Gamma =0$
and measure $\Delta \Gamma$ linearly. We notice the impossibility to isolate
the sign of $\cos (2\bet a)$ without an independent knowledge of the sign of
$\Delta \Gamma$. This exhaustion of the possible Golden Plate and flavour
decays provides new observables which may throw light in our present
understanding of CKM physics.
