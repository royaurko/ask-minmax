A recent paper [DDL] claims that the increase of the proton electric charge e
leads to a (forbidden) decrease of black hole entropy, therefore, possible
evidence for variation of $\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$ [alpha] must be interpreted as a
decrease of the speed of light. We argue that purely theoretical consideration
of black holes possibly cannot give any model-independent limitations on
variation of fundamental constants.
