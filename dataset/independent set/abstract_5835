Given samples (x_1,...,x_m) and (z_1,...,z_n) which we believe are
independent realizations of random variables X and Z respectively, where we
further believe that Z=X+Y with Y independent of X, the problem is to estimate
the distribution of Y. We present a new method for doing this, involving
simulation. Experiments suggest that the method provides useful estimates.
