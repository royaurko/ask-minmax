We announce and outline a proof of the existence of a homoclinic orbit of
the Lorenz equations. In addition, we develop a shooting technique and two key
conditions, which lead to the existence of a one-to-one correspondence between
a set of solutions and the set of all infinite sequences of 1's and 3's.
