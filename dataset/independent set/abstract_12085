Our starting point is a lemma due to Varopoulos. We give a different proof of
a generalized form this lemma, that yields an equivalent description of the
$K$-functional for the interpolation couple $(X_0,X_1)$ where
$X_0=L_{p_0,\infty}(\mu_1; L_q(\mu_2))$ and $X_1=L_{p_1,\infty}(\mu_2;
L_q(\mu_1))$ where $0<q<p_0,p_1\le \infty$ and $(\Omega_1,\mu_1),
(\Omega_2,\mu_2)$ are arbitrary measure spaces. When $q=1$, this implies that
the space $(X_0,X_1)_{\theta,\infty}$ ($0<\theta<1$) can be identified with a
certain space of operators. We also give an extension of the Varopoulos Lemma
to pairs (or finite families) of conditional expectations that seems of
independent interest. The present paper is motivated by non-commutative
applications that we choose to publish separately.
