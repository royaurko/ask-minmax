We consider statistically independent non-identical subsystems with different
entropic indices q1 and q2. A relation between q1, q2 and q' (for the entire
system) extends a power law for entropic index as a function of distance r. A
few examples illustrate a role of the proposed constraint q' < min(q1, q2) for
the Beck's concept of quasi-additivity.
