The effect of non-standard neutrino interactions with matter at long baseline
neutrino experiments is examined in a model independent way, taking into
account the constraints from all the experiments. It is found that such a
non-standard interaction can enhance the flavor transition probability so
significantly that the ongoing experiment MINOS may see the signal of
$\nu_\mu\to\nu_e$ which is much more than the prediction by the standard
scenario. It is also found that the silver channel $\nu_e\to\nu_\tau$ at a
neutrino factory could have a huge enhancement.
