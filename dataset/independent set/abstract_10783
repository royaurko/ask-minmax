A general model-independent discussion of mesonic correlation functions is
given. We derive new inequalities, including one stronger than Weingarten's
inequality. Mesonic correlation functions are calculated in the random
instanton vacuum and are compared with phenomenological expectations and
lattice results. Both diagonal and non-diagonal correlators of all strange and
light flavored currents, as well as the most important unflavored ones are
considered. Our results are used to extract the masses and the coupling
constants of the corresponding mesons. Not only the qualitative behaviour is
reproduced in all channels, but in several channels the model works with
amazing accuracy
