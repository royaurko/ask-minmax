Sampling from the lattice Gaussian distribution is emerging as an important
problem in coding and cryptography. In this paper, a Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithm referred to as the independent Metropolis-Hastings-Klein (MHK)
algorithm is proposed for lattice Gaussian sampling, which overcomes the
restriction on the standard deviation confronted by the Klein algorithm. It is
proven that the Markov chain arising from the proposed MHK algorithm is
uniformly ergodic, namely, it converges to the stationary distribution
exponentially fast. Moreover, the rate of convergence is explicitly calculated
in terms of the theta series, making it possible to predict the mixing time of
the underlying Markov chain.
