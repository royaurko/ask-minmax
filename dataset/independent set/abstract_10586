It is found that the finite-energy spectral properties of the one-dimensional
Hubbard model are controlled by the scattering of charged $\eta$-spin-zero
$2\nu$-holon composite objects, spin-zero $2\nu$-spinon composite objects, and
charged $\eta$-spin-less and spin-less objects, rather than by the scattering
of independent $\eta$-spin 1/2 holons and spin 1/2 spinons. Here $\nu
=1,2,...$. The corresponding $S$ matrix is calculated and its relation to the
spectral properties is clarified.
