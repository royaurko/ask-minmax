Real algebraic geometry is the study of semi-algebraic sets, subsets of
$\R^k$ defined by Boolean combinations of polynomial equalities and
inequalities. The focus of this thesis is to study quantitative results in real
algebraic geometry, primarily upper bounds on the topological complexity of
semi-algebraic sets as measured, for example, by their Betti numbers. Another
quantitative measure of topological complexity which we study is the number of
homotopy types of semi-algebraic sets of bounded description complexity. The
description complexity of a semi-algebraic set depends on the context, but it
is simply some measure of the complexity of the polynomials in the formula
defining the semi-algebraic set (e.g., the degree and number of variables of a
polynomial, the so called dense format). We also provide a description of the
Hausdorff limit of a one-parameter family of semi-algebraic sets, up to
homotopy type which the contributor hopes will find further use in the future.
Finally, in the last chapter of this thesis, we prove a decomposition theorem
similar to the well-known cylindrical decomposition for semi-algebraic sets but
which has the advantage of requiring significantly less cells in the
decomposition. The setting of this last result is not in semi-algebraic
geometry, but in the more general setting of o-minimal structures.
