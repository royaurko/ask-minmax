In this paper, we use Conley index theory to examine the Poincare index of an
isolated invariant set. We obtain some limiting conditions on a critical point
of a planar vector field to be an isolated invariant set. As a result we show
the existence of infinitely many homoclinic orbits for a critical point with
the Poincare index greater than one.
