I discuss the results of a recent quenched lattice calculation of the two
independent form factors parametrizing the semileptonic decays between
heavy-light pseudoscalar mesons. The differential decay rate of the process B
--> D l nu has been calculated at non vanishing momentum transfer both in the
case of the light leptons, l=e,mu, and in the case of a non vanishing lepton
mass, l=tau.
