We propose an integral form of Atiah-Patodi-Singer spectral boundary
conditions (SBC) and find explicitly the integral projector onto SBC for the
3-dimensional spherical cavity. After discussion of a simple example we argue
that the relation between the projector and fermion propagator is universal and
stays valid independently of the bag form and space dimension.
