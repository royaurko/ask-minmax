Electroweak one-loop radiative corrections to the process e^+ e^- -> t tbar
are revisited. Two groups from Karlsruhe and Bielefeld/Zeuthen performed
independent calculations of both (virtual and soft) QED contributions and weak
virtual corrections. For the angular distribution an agreement of at least
eight digits for the weak corrections and of at least seven digits for
additional photonic corrections is established.
