We introduce a new concept for stimulated-Brillouin-scattering-based slow
light in optical fibers that is applicable for broadly-tunable frequency-swept
sources. It allows slow light to be achieved, in principle, over the entire
transparency window of the optical fiber. We demonstrate a slow light delay of
10 ns at 1550 nm using a 10-m-long photonic crystal fiber with a source sweep
rate of 0.4 MHz/ns and a pump power of 200 mW. We also show that there exists a
maximal delay obtainable by this method, which is set by the SBS threshold,
independent of sweep rate. For our fiber with optimum length, this maximum
delay is ~38 ns, obtained for a pump power of 760 mW.
