A geometric progression of length $k$ and integer ratio is a set of numbers
of the form $\{a,ar,\dots,ar^{k-1}\}$ for some positive real number $a$ and
integer $r\geq 2$. For each integer $k \geq 3$, a greedy algorithm is used to
construct a strictly decreasing sequence $(a_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}$ of positive
real numbers with $a_1 = 1$ such that the set \[ G^{(k)} =
\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} \left(a_{2i} , a_{2i-1} \right] \] contains no geometric
progression of length $k$ and integer ratio. Moreover, $G^{(k)}$ is a maximal
subset of $(0,1]$ that contains no geometric progression of length $k$ and
integer ratio. It is also proved that there is a strictly increasing sequence
$(A_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}$ of positive integers with $A_1 = 1$ such that $a_i =
1/A_i$ for all $i = 1,2,3,\ldots$.
  The set $G^{(k)}$ gives a new lower bound for the maximum cardinality of a
subset of the set of integers $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ that contains no geometric
progression of length $k$ and integer ratio.
