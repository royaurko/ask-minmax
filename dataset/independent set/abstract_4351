In this paper, we show an approximation in law of the complex Brownian motion
by processes constructed from a stochastic process with independent increments.
We give sufficient conditions for the characteristic function of the process
with independent increments that ensure the existence of the approximation. We
apply these results to L\'evy processes. Finally we extend this results to the
$m$-dimensional complex Brownian motion.
