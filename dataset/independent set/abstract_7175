We describe a set up for measurements of low frequency (1 mHz < f < 20 Hz)
conductance fluctuations in a solid conductor. The set-up uses a five probe
a.c. measurement technique and extensive digital signal processing to reach a
noise floor down to $S_{v}(f) \leq 10^{-20}$ V$^{2}$Hz$^{-1}$. The set up also
allows measurement of noise using an a.c. in presence of a superimposed direct
current. This feature is desirable in studies of electromigration damage or in
systems that show non-linear conductivity. In addition, we describe a scheme
which allows us to obtain the probability density function of the conductance
fluctuation after subtracting the extraneous noise contributions (background)
from the observed noise. The set-up has been used for conductance fluctuation
measurement in the temperature range 1.5 K < T < 500 K in the presence of
magnetic fields. We present some representative data obtained by this system.
