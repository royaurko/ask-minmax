Since the pioneering experiment, E89-009 studying hypernuclear spectroscopy
using the $(e,e^{\prime}K^+)$ reaction was completed, two additional
experiments, E01-011 and E05-115, were performed at Jefferson Lab. These later
experiments used a modified experimental design, the "tilt method", to
dramatically suppress the large electromagnetic background, and allowed for a
substantial increase in luminosity. Additionally, a new kaon spectrometer, HKS
(E01-011), a new electron spectrometer, HES, and a new splitting magnet were
added to produce precision, high-resolution hypernuclear spectroscopy. These
two experiments, E01-011 and E05-115, resulted in two new data sets, producing
sub-MeV energy resolution in the spectra of ${}^{7}_{\Lambda}\text{He}$,
${}^{12}_{\Lambda}\text{B}$ and ${}^{28}_{\Lambda}\text{Al}$ and
${}^{7}_{\Lambda}\text{He}$, ${}^{10}_{\Lambda}\text{Be}$,
${}^{12}_{\Lambda}\text{B}$ and ${}^{52}_{\Lambda}\text{V}$. All three
experiments obtained a ${}^{12}_{\Lambda}\text{B}$, spectrum, which is the most
characteristic $p$-shell hypernucleus and is commonly used for calibration.
Independent analyses of these different experiments demonstrate excellent
consistency and provide the clearest level structure to date of this
hypernucleus as produced by the $(e,e^{\prime}K^+)$ reaction. This paper
presents details of these experiments, and the extraction and analysis of the
observed ${}^{12}_{\Lambda}\text{B}$ spectrum.
