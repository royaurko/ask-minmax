We present a systematic study of the B meson light-cone distribution
amplitudes which are relevant for the QCD factorization approach for the
exclusive B meson decays. We construct representations for the quark-antiquark
distribution amplitudes in terms of independent dynamical degrees of freedom,
which exactly satisfy the QCD equations of motion and constraints from
heavy-quark symmetry.
