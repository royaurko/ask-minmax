We report the independent discovery of a new extrasolar transiting planet
around OGLE-TR-113, a candidate star from the Optical Gravitational Lensing
Experiment. Small radial-velocity variations have been detected based on
observations conducted with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan I (Baade)
telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory (Chile) during 2003. We have also
carried out a light-curve analysis incorporating new photometry and realistic
physical parameters for the star. OGLE-TR-113b has an orbital period of only
1.43 days, a mass of 1.08 +/- 0.28 M_Jup, and a radius of 1.09 +/- 0.10 R_Jup.
Similar parameters have been obtained very recently in an independent study by
Bouchy et al., from observations taken a year later. The orbital period of
OGLE-TR-113b, and also that of the previously announced planet OGLE-TR-56b
(P_orb = 1.21 days) -- the first two found photometrically -- are much shorter
than the apparent cutoff of close-in giant planets at 3-4-day periods found
from high-precision radial velocities surveys. Along with a third case reported
by Bouchy et al. (OGLE-TR-132b, P_orb = 1.69 days), these objects appear to
form a new class of ``very hot Jupiters'' that pose very interesting questions
for theoretical study.
