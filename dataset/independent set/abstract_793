The use of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological standard candles is
fundamental in modern observational cosmology. In this letter, we derive a
simple empirical photometric redshift estimator for SNe Ia using a training set
of SNe Ia with multiband ($griz$) light-curves and spectroscopic redshifts
obtained by the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). This estimator is analytical
and model-independent; it does not use spectral templates. We use all the
available SNe Ia from SNLS with near maximum photometry in $griz$ (a total of
40 SNe Ia) to train and test our photometric redshift estimator. The difference
between the estimated redshifts $z_{phot}$ and the spectroscopic redshifts
$z_{spec}$, $(z_{phot}-z_{spec})/(1+z_{spec})$, has rms dispersions of 0.031
for 20 SNe Ia used in the training set, and 0.050 for 20 SNe Ia not used in the
training set. The dispersion is of the same order of magnitude as the flux
uncertainties at peak brightness for the SNe Ia. There are no outlyers.
  This photometric redshift estimator should significantly enhance the ability
of observers to accurately target high redshift SNe Ia for spectroscopy in
ongoing surveys. It will also dramatically boost the cosmological impact of
very large future supernova surveys, such as those planned for Advanced
Liquid-mirror Probe for Astrophysics, Cosmology and Asteroids (ALPACA), and the
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).
