We establish a mixed norm estimate for the Radon transform in the plane when
the set of directions has fractional dimension. This estimate is used to prove
a result about an exceptional set of directions connected with projections of
planar sets. That leads to a conjecture analogous to a well-known conjecture of
Furstenberg.
