In this paper, we introduce a family of observables for the dimer model on a
bi-periodic bipartite planar graph, called pattern density fields. We study the
scaling limit of these objects for liquid and gaseous Gibbs measures of the
dimer model, and prove that they converge to a linear combination of a
derivative of the Gaussian massless free field and an independent white noise.
