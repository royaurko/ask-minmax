We present new examples of open sets of diffeomorphisms such that a generic
diffeomorphisms in those sets have no dynamically indecomposable attractors in
the topological sense and have infinitely many chain-recurrence classes. We
show that except from one particular class, the other classes are contained in
periodic surfaces. This study allows us to obtain existence of Milnor
attractors as well as studying ergodic properties of the diffeomorphisms in
those open sets by using the ideas and results from [BV] and [BF].
