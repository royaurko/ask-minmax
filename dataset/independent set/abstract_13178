We report the results of a cosmic shear survey using the 4.2m William
Herschel Telescope on La Palma, to a depth of R=25.8 (z~0.8), over 4 square
degrees. The shear correlation functions are measured on scales from 1' to 15',
and are used to constrain cosmological parameters. We ensure that our
measurements are free from instrumental systematics by performing a series of
tests, including a decomposition of the signal into E- and B-modes. We also
reanalyse the data independently, using the shear measurement pipeline
developed for the COMBO-17 survey. This confirms our results and also
highlights various effects introduced by different implementations of the basic
"KSB" shear measurement method. We find that the normalisation of the matter
power spectrum on 8 h^{-1}Mpc scales is
sigma_8=(1.02+/-0.15)(0.3/Omega_m)^{0.5}, where the 68%CL error includes noise,
sample variance, covariance between angular scales, systematic effects,
redshift uncertainty and marginalisation over other parameters. We compare
these results with other cosmic shear surveys and with recent constraints from
the WMAP experiment.
