We construct uncountably many simply connected open 3-manifolds with genus
one ends homeomorphic to the Cantor set. Each constructed manifold has the
property that any self homeomorphism of the manifold (which necessarily extends
to a homeomorphism of the ends) fixes the ends pointwise. These manifolds are
complements of rigid generalized Bing-Whitehead (BW) Cantor sets. Previous
examples of rigid Cantor sets with simply connected complement in $R^{3}$ had
infinite genus and it was an open question as to whether finite genus examples
existed. The examples here exhibit the minimum possible genus, genus one. These
rigid generalized BW Cantor sets are constructed using variable numbers of Bing
and Whitehead links. Our previous result with \v{Z}eljko determining when BW
Cantor sets are equivalently embedded in $R^{3}$ extends to the generalized
construction. This characterization is used to prove rigidity and to
distinguish the uncountably many examples.
