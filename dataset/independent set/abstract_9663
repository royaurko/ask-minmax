Recent studies show that the microbial communities inhabiting the human
intestine can have profound impact on our well-being and health. However, we
have limited understanding of the mechanisms that control this complex
ecosystem. Based on a deep phylogenetic analysis of the intestinal microbiota
in a thousand western adults we identified groups of bacteria that tend to be
either nearly absent, or abundant in most individuals. The abundances of these
bimodally distributed bacteria vary independently, and their contrasting
alternative states are associated with host factors such as ageing and
overweight. We propose that such bimodal groups represent independent tipping
elements of the intestinal microbiota. These reflect the overall state of the
intestinal ecosystem whose critical transitions can have profound health
implications and diagnostic potential.
