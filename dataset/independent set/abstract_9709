In this article, we propose a new method for the fundamental task of testing
for dependence between two groups of variables. The response densities under
the null hypothesis of independence and the alternative hypothesis of
dependence are specified by nonparametric Bayesian models. Under the null
hypothesis, the joint distribution is modeled by the product of two independent
Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) priors; under the alternative, the full joint
density is modeled by a multivariate DPM prior. The test is then based on the
posterior probability of favoring the alternative hypothesis. The proposed test
not only has good performance for testing linear dependence among other popular
nonparametric tests, but is also preferred to other methods in testing many of
the nonlinear dependencies we explored. In the analysis of gene expression
data, we compare different methods for testing pairwise dependence between
genes. The results show that the proposed test identifies some dependence
structures that are not detected by other tests.
