Levy flights, characterized by the microscopic step index f, are for f<2 (the
case of rare events) considered in short range and long range quenched random
force fields with arbitrary vector character to first loop order in an
expansion about the critical dimension 2f-2 in the short range case and the
critical fall-off exponent 2f-2 in the long range case. By means of a dynamic
renormalization group analysis based on the momentum shell integration method,
we determine flows, fixed point, and the associated scaling properties for the
probability distribution and the frequency and wave number dependent diffusion
coefficient. Unlike the case of ordinary Brownian motion in a quenched force
field characterized by a single critical dimension or fall-off exponent d=2,
two critical dimensions appear in the Levy case. A critical dimension (or
fall-off exponent) d=f below which the diffusion coefficient exhibits anomalous
scaling behavior, i.e, algebraic spatial behavior and long time tails, and a
critical dimension (or fall-off exponent) d=2f-2 below which the force
correlations characterized by a non trivial fixed point become relevant. As a
general result we find in all cases that the dynamic exponent z, characterizing
the mean square displacement, locks onto the Levy index f, independent of
dimension and independent of the presence of weak quenched disorder.
