ADF95 is a tool to automatically calculate numerical first derivatives for
any mathematical expression as a function of user defined independent
variables. Accuracy of derivatives is achieved within machine precision. ADF95
may be applied to any FORTRAN 77/90/95 conforming code and requires minimal
changes by the user. It provides a new derived data type that holds the value
and derivatives and applies forward differencing by overloading all FORTRAN
operators and intrinsic functions. An efficient indexing technique leads to a
reduced memory usage and a substantially increased performance gain over other
available tools with operator overloading. This gain is especially pronounced
for sparse systems with large number of independent variables. A wide class of
numerical simulations, e.g., those employing implicit solvers, can profit from
ADF95.
