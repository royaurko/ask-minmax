A long-standing conjecture of Farrell and Zdravkovska and independently
S.~T.~Yau states that every almost flat manifold is the boundary of a compact
manifold. This paper gives a simple proof of this conjecture when the holonomy
group is cyclic or quaternionic. The proof is based on the interaction between
flat bundles and involutions.
