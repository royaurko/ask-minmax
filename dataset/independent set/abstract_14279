A graph is $(c_1, c_2, ..., c_k)$-colorable if the vertex set can be
partitioned into $k$ sets $V_1,V_2, ..., V_k$, such that for every $i: 1\leq
i\leq k$ the subgraph $G[V_i]$ has maximum degree at most $c_i$. We show that
every planar graph without 4- and 5-cycles is $(1, 1, 0)$-colorable and
$(3,0,0)$-colorable. This is a relaxation of the Steinberg Conjecture that
every planar graph without 4- and 5-cycles are properly 3-colorable (i.e.,
$(0,0,0)$-colorable).
