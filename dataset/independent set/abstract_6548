A k-system of the graph G(P) of a simple polytope P is a set of induced
subgraphs of G(P) that shares certain properties with the set of subgraphs
induced by the k-faces of P.
  This new concept leads to polynomial-size certificates in terms of G(P) for
both the set of vertex sets of facets as well as for abstract objective
functions (AOF) in the sense of Kalai.
  Moreover, it is proved that an acyclic orientation yields an AOF if and only
if it induces a unique sink on every 2-face.
