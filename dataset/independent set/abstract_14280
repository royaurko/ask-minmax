We study weakly hyperbolic iterated function systems on compact spaces, as
defined by Edalat, but in the more general setting of a compact parameter
space. We prove the existence of attractors, both in the topological and
measure theoretical viewpoint, and prove that the measure theoretical attractor
is ergodic. We also define weakly hyperbolic iterated functions systems for
complete spaces and compact parameter space, and prove that this definition
extends the one given by Edalat. Furthermore, we study the question of
existence of the attractors in this setting. Finally, we prove a version of the
results of Barnsley and Vince about drawing the attractor (also called the
chaos game), for the case of compact parameter space.
