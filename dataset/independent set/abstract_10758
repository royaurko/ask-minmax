A largely model-independent measurement of the inclusive electron momentum
spectrum and branching fraction for semileptonic decays of B mesons is
presented based on data recorded at the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the BABAR
detector. Backgrounds from secondary charm decays are separated from prompt B
decays using charge and angular correlations between the electron from one B
meson and a high momentum electron tag from the second B meson. The resulting
branching fraction is BR(B -> X e nu) = (10.87 +-0.18(stat)+-0.30(syst))%.
Based on this measurement we determine the CKM matrix element |V_cb|.
