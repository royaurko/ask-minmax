It is shown that the topologies and nestings of the zero and nodal sets of
random (Gaussian) band limited functions have universal laws of distribution.
Qualitative features of the supports of these distributions are determined. In
particular the results apply to random monochromatic waves and to random real
algebraic hyper-surfaces in projective space.
