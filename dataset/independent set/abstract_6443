Jet momentum balance measurements, such as those recently performed by the
CMS collaboration, provide an opportunity to quantify the energy transferred
from a parton shower to the underlying medium in heavy-ion collisions.
Specifically, I argue that the Cooper-Frye freezeout distribution associated
with the energy and momentum deposited by the parton shower is controlled to a
significant extent by the distribution of the underlying bulk matter and
independent of the details of how deposited energy is redistributed in the
medium, which is largely determined by transport coefficients such as shear
viscosity. Thus by matching the distribution of momentum associated with the
secondary jet in such measurements to the thermal distribution of the
underlying medium, one can obtain a model independent estimate on the amount of
parton shower energy deposited.
