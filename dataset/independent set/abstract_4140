Many scientific and economic problems involve the analysis of
high-dimensional time series datasets. However, theoretical studies in
high-dimensional statistics to date rely primarily on the assumption of
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. In this work, we
focus on stable Gaussian processes and investigate the theoretical properties
of $\ell _1$-regularized estimates in two important statistical problems in the
context of high-dimensional time series: (a) stochastic regression with
serially correlated errors and (b) transition matrix estimation in vector
autoregressive (VAR) models. We derive nonasymptotic upper bounds on the
estimation errors of the regularized estimates and establish that consistent
estimation under high-dimensional scaling is possible via
$\ell_1$-regularization for a large class of stable processes under sparsity
constraints. A key technical contribution of the work is to introduce a measure
of stability for stationary processes using their spectral properties that
provides insight into the effect of dependence on the accuracy of the
regularized estimates. With this proposed stability measure, we establish some
useful deviation bounds for dependent data, which can be used to study several
important regularized estimates in a time series setting.
