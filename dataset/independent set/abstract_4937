This paper questions the generally accepted assumption that one can make a
random choice that is independent of the rest of the universe. We give a
general description of any setup that could be conceived to generate random
numbers. Based on the fact that the initial state of such setup together with
its environment cannot be known, we show that the independence of its generated
output cannot be guaranteed. Some consequences of this theoretical limitation
are discussed.
