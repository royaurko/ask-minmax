The GALAH survey targets one million stars in the southern hemisphere down to
a limiting magnitude of V = 14 at the Anglo- Australian Telescope. The project
aims to measure up to 30 elemental abundances and radial velocities (~1 km/s
accuracy) for each star at a resolution of R = 28000. These elements fall into
8 independent groups (e.g. alpha, Fe peak, r-process). For all stars, Gaia will
provide distances to 1% and transverse velocities to 1 km/s or better, giving
us a 14D set of parameters for each star, i.e. 6D phase space and 8D abundance
space. There are many scientic applications but here we focus on the prospect
of chemically tagging the thick disk and making a direct measurement of how
stellar migration evolves with cosmic time.
