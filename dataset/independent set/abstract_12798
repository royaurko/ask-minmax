Theoretical and experimental techniques employed in dedicated searches for
dark matter at hadron colliders are reviewed. Bounds from the 7 and 8 TeV
proton-proton collisions at the LHC on dark matter interactions have been
collected and the results interpreted. We review the current status of the
Effective Field Theory picture of dark matter interactions with the Standard
Model. Currently, LHC experiments have stronger bounds on operators leading to
spin-dependent scattering than direct detection experiments, while direct
detection probes are more constraining for spin-independent scattering for WIMP
masses above a few GeV.
