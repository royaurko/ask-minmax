Let $T$ be a first-order theory. A correspondence is established between
internal covers of models of $T$ and definable groupoids within $T$. We also
consider amalgamations of independent diagrams of algebraically closed
substructures, and find strong relation between: covers, uniqueness for
3-amalgamation, existence of 4-amalgamation, imaginaries of $T^\si$, and
definable groupoids. As a corollary, we describe the imaginary elements of
families of finite-dimensional vector spaces over pseudo-finite fields.
