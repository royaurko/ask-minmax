We prove that closed manifolds admitting a metric whose sectional curvature
is locally quasi-constant are graphs of space forms. In the more general
setting of QC space where sets of isotropic points are arbitrary, under
suitable positivity assumption and for torsion-free fundamental groups they are
still diffeomorphic to connected sums of spherical space forms and spherical
bundles over the circle.
