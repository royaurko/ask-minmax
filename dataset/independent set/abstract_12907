We study the electrical response of a wide class of strange metal phases
without quasiparticles at finite temperature and charge density, with
explicitly broken translational symmetry, using holography. The low frequency
electrical conductivity exhibits a Drude peak, so long as momentum relaxation
is slow. The relaxation time and the direct current conductivity are exactly
equal to what is computed, independently of holography, via the memory function
framework.
