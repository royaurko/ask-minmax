For an arbitrary left Artinian ring $R$, explicit descriptions are given of
all the left denominator sets $S$ of $R$ and left localizations $S^{-1}R$ of
$R$. It is proved that, up to $R$-isomorphism, there are only finitely many
left localizations and each of them is an idempotent localization, i.e.
$S^{-1}R\simeq S_e^{-1}R$ and ${\rm ass} (S) = {\rm ass} (S_e)$ where
$S_e=\{1,e\}$ is a left denominator set of $R$ and $e$ is an idempotent.
Moreover, the idempotent $e$ is unique up to a conjugation. It is proved that
the number of maximal left denominator sets of $R$ is finite and does not
exceed the number of isomorphism classes of simple left $R$-modules. The set of
maximal left denominator sets of $R$ and the left localization radical of $R$
are described.
