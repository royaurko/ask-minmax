We study the structure of the set of equilibrium payoffs in finite games,
both for Nash equilibrium and correlated equilibrium. A nonempty subset of R^2
is shown to be the set of Nash equilibrium payoffs of a bimatrix game if and
only if it is a finite union of rectangles. Furthermore, we show that for any
nonempty finite union of rectangles U and any polytope P in R^2 containing U,
there exists a bimatrix game with U as set of Nash equilibrium payoffs and P as
set of correlated equilibrium payoffs. The n-player case and the robustness of
this result to perturbation of the payoff matrices are also studied.
