This paper concerns $\mu$-limit sets of cellular automata: sets of
configurations made of words whose probability to appear does not vanish with
time, starting from an initial $\mu$-random configuration. More precisely, we
investigate the computational complexity of these sets and of related decision
problems. Main results: first, $\mu$-limit sets can have a $\Sigma\_3^0$-hard
language, second, they can contain only $\alpha$-complex configurations, third,
any non-trivial property concerning them is at least $\Pi\_3^0$-hard. We prove
complexity upper bounds, study restrictions of these questions to particular
classes of CA, and different types of (non-)convergence of the measure of a
word during the evolution.
