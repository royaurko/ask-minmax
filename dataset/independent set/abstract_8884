In this paper we investigate the level sets of extremal Sobolev functions for
subcritical exponents p. We conjecture that as p increases the corresponding
extremal functions become more peaked, which we can measure by comparing their
distribution functions. Then we provide compelling numerical evidence for our
conjecture.
