Data on the observation of neutron bursts in the process of high-voltage
discharge in the air at an average electric field strength ~ 1 MV/m and
discharge current ~ 10 kA are presented. Two independent methods (CR-39 track
detectors and plastic scintillation detectors) registered neutrons within the
range from thermal energies up to the energies above 10 MeV with the flux of >=
1E6 neutrons per shot into 4{\pi} solid angle.
