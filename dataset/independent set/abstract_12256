The Standard Model with massive fermions is formulated in the isotopic
Foldy-Wouthuysen representation. SU(2)xU(1) - invariance of the theory in this
representation is independent of whether fermions possess mass or not, and,
consequently, it is not necessary to introduce interactions between Higgs
bosons and fermions. The study discusses a possible relation between
spontaneous breaking of parity in the isotopic Foldy-Wouthuysen representation
and the composition of elementary particles of "dark matter".
