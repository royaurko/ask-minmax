We study the phase diagram of the site-diluted Ising model in a wide dilution
range, through Monte Carlo simulations and Finite-Size Scaling techniques. Our
results for the critical exponents and universal cumulants turn out to be
dilution-independent, but only after a proper infinite volume extrapolation,
taking into account the leading corrections-to-scaling terms.
