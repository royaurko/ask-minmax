By providing a variant of Weyl's inequality for general systems of forms we
establish the Hardy-Littlewood asymptotic formula for the density of integer
zeros of systems of quadratic or cubics forms under weaker rank conditions than
previously known. We also briefly discuss what happens for systems of higher
degree forms, and slightly relax the non-singularity condition in Birch's paper
on forms in many variables.
