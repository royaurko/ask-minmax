We show that the functional renormalization group is a numerically cheap
method to obtain the low-energy behavior of the Anderson impurity model
describing a localized interacting electron coupled to a bath of conduction
electrons. Our approach uses an external magnetic field as flow parameter,
partial bosonization of the transverse spin fluctuations, and
frequency-independent interaction vertices which are fixed by Ward identities.
We calculate the quasi-particle residue and the spin susceptibility in the
particle-hole symmetric case and obtain excellent agreement with the Bethe
ansatz results for arbitrary strengths of the interaction.
