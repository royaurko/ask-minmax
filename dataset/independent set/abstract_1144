The \emph{Filter Dichotomy} says that every uniform nonmeager filter on the
integers is mapped by a finite-to-one function to an ultrafilter. The
consistency of this principle was proved by Blass and Laflamme. A function
between topological spaces is \emph{universally measurable} if the preimage of
%every open subset of the codomain is measured by every Borel measure on the
domain. A \emph{medial limit} is a universally measurable function from
$\mathcal{P}(\omega)$ to the unit interval [0,1] which is finitely additive for
disjoint sets, and maps singletons to 0and $\omega$ to 1. Christensen and
Mokobodzki independently showed that the Continuum Hypothesis implies the
existence of medial limits. We show that the Filter Dichotomy implies that
there are no medial limits.
