We present reasons for developing a theory of forcing notions which satisfy
the properness demand for countable models which are not necessarily
elementary submodels of some (H(chi), in). This leads to forcing notions which
are ``reasonably'' definable. We present two specific properties materializing
this intuition: nep (non-elementary properness) and snep (Souslin
non-elementary properness). For this we consider candidates (countable models
to which the definition applies), and the older Souslin proper. A major theme
here is ``preservation by iteration'', but we also show a dichotomy: if such
forcing notions preserve the positiveness of the set of old reals for some
naturally define c.c.c. ideals, then they preserve the positiveness of any old
positive set. We also prove that (among such forcing notions) the only one
commuting with Cohen is Cohen itself.
