We consider tunnel microrefrigerators at low temperature. There is a number
of experimental studies performed on microrefrigeration in tunneling
superconductor--normal metal (SN) structures. Related to these experiments,
only the electron subsystem has been considered theoretically. Independently,
the phonon deficit effect has been studied a while ago in
superconductor-superconductor tunnel junctions. It can be regarded as a
possible prototype scheme for superconducting microrefrigerators. We try to
provide the missing link between experiments on the SN tunnel junction
refrigerators and the theory which includes microscopically phonons in
combination with the mechanism of the phonon deficit effect.
