The ZZ Ceti star GD 1212 was detected to have 19 independent modes from the
two-wheel-controlled Kepler Spacecraft in 2014. By asymptotic analysis, we
identify most of pulsation modes. We find out two set of complete triplets, and
four sets of doublet which are interpreted as rotation modes with $l=1$. For
the other five modes, the four modes $f_{13}$, $f_{15}$, $f_{16}$ and $f_{4}$
are identified as ones with $l=2$; and the mode $f_{7}$ is identified to be the
one with $l=1$. Meanwhile we derive a mean rotation period of $6.65\pm0.21$ h
for GD 1212 according to the rotation splitting. Using the method of matching
the observed periods to theoretical ones, we obtain the best-fitting model with
the four parameters as $M_{\rm{*}}/M_{\rm{\odot}} = 0.775$, $T_{\rm{eff}} =
11400$ K, $\log (M_{\rm{H}}/M_{\rm{*}}) = -5.0$, $\log
(M_{\rm{He}}/M_{\rm{*}})=-2.5$ for GD 1212. We find that due to the gradient of
C/O abundance in the interior of white dwarf, some modes can not propagate to
the stellar interior, which leads to the period spacing of the adjacent modes
to become large. This feature is just proven by the observational data from GD
1212. All of these imply that GD 1212 may be evolved from an intermediate mass
star.
