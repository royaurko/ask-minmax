In this article, we consider a sequence $(N_n)_{n \geq 1}$ of point
processes, whose points lie in a subset $E$ of $\bR \verb2\2 \{0\}$, and
satisfy an asymptotic independence condition. Our main result gives some
necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence in distribution of
$(N_n)_{n \geq 1}$ to an infinitely divisible point process $N$. As
applications, we discuss the exceedance processes and point processes based on
regularly varying sequences.
