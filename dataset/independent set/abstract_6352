Assuming high temperature and taking subleading temperature dependence into
account, gauge dependence of one-loop electron dispersion relation is
investigated in massless QED at zero chemical potential. The analysis is
carried out using a general linear covariant gauge. The equation governing the
gauge dependence of the dispersion relation is obtained and used to prove that
the dispersion relation is gauge independent in the limiting case of momenta
much larger than $eT$. It is also shown that the effective mass is not
influenced by the leading temperature dependence of the gauge dependent part of
the effective self-energy. As a result the effective mass, which is of order
$eT$, does not receive a correction of order $e^2T$ from one loop, independent
of the gauge parameter.
