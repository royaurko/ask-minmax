We generalise the definition of the characteristic of an integral triangle to
integral simplices and prove that each simplex in an integral point set has the
same characteristic. This theorem is used for an efficient construction
algorithm for integral point sets. Using this algorithm we are able to provide
new exact values for the minimum diameter of integral point sets.
