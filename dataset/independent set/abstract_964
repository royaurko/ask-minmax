We perform a detailed study of the consistency between different sets of
polarized deep inelastic scattering data and theory, from the standpoint of a
next to leading order QCD global analysis, and following the criteria proposed
by Collins and Pumplin. In face of recent suggestions that challenge the usual
assumption about parent parton spin independence of unpolarized fragmentation
functions, we specially focus on polarized semi-inclusive data.
