We measure the frequency dependence of the mechanical quality factor (Q) of
SiN membrane oscillators and observe a resonant variation of Q by more than two
orders of magnitude. The frequency of the fundamental mechanical mode is tuned
reversibly by up to 40% through local heating with a laser. Several distinct
resonances in Q are observed that can be explained by coupling to membrane
frame modes. Away from the resonances, the background Q is independent of
frequency and temperature in the measured range.
