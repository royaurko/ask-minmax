We examine the thermodynamic limit of fluids of hard core particles that are
polydisperse in size and shape. In addition, particles may interact
magnetically. Free energy of such systems is a random variable because it
depends on the choice of particles. We prove that the thermodynamic limit
exists with probability 1, and is independent of the choice of particles. Our
proof applies to polydisperse hard-sphere fluids, colloids and ferrofluids. The
existence of a thermodynamic limit implies system shape and size independence
of thermodynamic properties of a system.
