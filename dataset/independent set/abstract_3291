We present a systematic comparison between the recently measured cumulants of
the net-proton distributions by STAR for 0-5% central Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=7.7-200 GeV and two kinds of possible baseline measures, the
Poisson and Binomial baselines. These baseline measures are assuming that the
proton and anti-proton distributions independently follow Poisson statistics or
Binomial statistics. The higher order cumulant net-proton data are observed to
deviate from all the baseline measures studied at 19.6 and 27 GeV. We also
compare the net-proton with net-baryon fluctuations in UrQMD and AMPT model,
and convert the net-proton fluctuations to net-baryon fluctuations in AMPT
model by using a set of formula.
