I construct examples of dense Banach $\star$-subalgebras $A$ of the
commutative $C^{\star}$-algebra $c_0({\Bbb N})$ which are spectral invariant
and strongly spectral invariant, but do not satisfy the differential seminorm
condition $\|ab \|_A \leq K(\|a\|_{\infty} \|b\|_A + \|a \|_A \|b \|_{\infty})$
in $c_0({\Bbb N})$. The functions in $A$ vanish in a skewed manner with respect
to an unbounded scale $\sigma\colon {\Bbb N} \rightarrow [1, \infty)$.
  The notion of skew strong spectral invariance is introduced, and shown to be
independent from the differential seminorm condition.
