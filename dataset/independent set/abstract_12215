We present a formulation in a curved background of noncommutative mechanics,
where the object of noncommutativity $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ is considered as an
independent quantity having a canonical conjugate momentum. We introduced a
noncommutative first-order action in D=10 curved spacetime and the covariant
equations of motions were computed. This model, invariant under diffeomorphism,
generalizes recent relativistic results.
