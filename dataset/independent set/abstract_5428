The paper studies ways in which the sets of a partition of a lattice in
$\RR^n$ become regular model sets. The main theorem gives equivalent conditions
which assure that a matrix substitution system on a lattice in $\RR^n$ gives
rise to regular model sets (based on $p$-adic-like internal spaces), and hence
to pure point diffractive sets. The methods developed here are used to show
that the $n-$dimensional chair tiling and the sphinx tiling are pure point
diffractive.
