This paper introduces Jasper, a web programming framework which allows web
applications to be developed in an essentially platform indepedent manner and
which is also suited to a formal treatment. It outlines Jasper conceptually and
shows how Jasper is implemented on several commonplace platforms. It also
introduces the Jasper Music Store, a web application powered by Jasper and
implemented on each of these platforms. And it briefly describes a formal
treatment and outlines the tools and languages planned that will allow this
treatment to be automated.
