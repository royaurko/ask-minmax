We propose to undertake a model-independent analysis of the inclusive decay
rates and distributions in the processes \bgamaxs~ and \Bsell ~($B=B^\pm$ or
$B^0_d$). We show how measurements of the decay rates and distributions in
these processes would allow us to extract the magnitude and sign of the
dominant Wilson coefficients of the magnetic moment operator $\mb \bar{s}_L
\sigma_{\mu \nu} b_R F^{\mu \nu }$ and the four-fermion operators $(\bar{s}_L
\gamma_\mu b_L)(\bar{\ell} \gamma^{\mu} \ell)$ and $(\bar{s}_L \gamma_\mu
b_L)(\bar{\ell} \gamma^{\mu}\gamma^5 \ell)$.
