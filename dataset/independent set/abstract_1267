We introduce a basis of rational polynomial-like functions
$P_0,\ldots,P_{n-1}$ for the free module of functions $Z/nZ\to Z/mZ$. We then
characterize the subfamily of congruence preserving functions as the set of
linear combinations of the functions $lcm(k)\,P_k$ where $lcm(k)$ is the least
common multiple of $2,\ldots,k$ (viewed in $Z/mZ$). As a consequence, when
$n\geq m$, the number of such functions is independent of $n$.
