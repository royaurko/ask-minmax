We analyze the periodicity of optimal long products of matrices. A set of
matrices is said to have the finiteness property if the maximal rate of growth
of long products of matrices taken from the set can be obtained by a periodic
product. It was conjectured a decade ago that all finite sets of real matrices
have the finiteness property. This conjecture, known as the ``finiteness
conjecture", is now known to be false but no explicit counterexample to the
conjecture is available and in particular it is unclear if a counterexample is
possible whose matrices have rational or binary entries. In this paper, we
prove that finite sets of nonnegative rational matrices have the finiteness
property if and only if \emph{pairs} of \emph{binary} matrices do. We also show
that all {pairs} of $2 \times 2$ binary matrices have the finiteness property.
These results have direct implications for the stability problem for sets of
matrices. Stability is algorithmically decidable for sets of matrices that have
the finiteness property and so it follows from our results that if all pairs of
binary matrices have the finiteness property then stability is decidable for
sets of nonnegative rational matrices. This would be in sharp contrast with the
fact that the related problem of boundedness is known to be undecidable for
sets of nonnegative rational matrices.
