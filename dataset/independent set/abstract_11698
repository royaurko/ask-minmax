We study supersymmetric QED in AdS4 with massless matter. At 1-loop the
ultra-violet regulator of the theory generates a contribution to the gaugino
mass that is naively inconsistent with unbroken supersymmetry. We show that
this effect, known in flat space as anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking, is
required to cancel an infra-red contribution arising from the boundary
conditions in AdS space, which necessarily break chiral symmetry. We also
discuss an analogous UV/IR cancellation that is independent of supersymmetry.
