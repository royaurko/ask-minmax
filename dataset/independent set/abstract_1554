We generalize a theorem of Nymann that the density of points in Z^d that are
visible from the origin is 1/zeta(d), where zeta(a) is the Riemann zeta
function 1/1^a + 1/2^a + 1/3^a + ...
  A subset S of Z^d is called primitive if it is a Z-basis for the lattice
composed of the integer points in the R-span of S, or, equivalently, if S can
be completed to a Z-basis of Z^d. We prove that if m points in Z^d are chosen
uniformly and independently at random from a large box, then as the size of the
box goes to infinity, the probability that the points form a primitive set
approaches 1/[\zeta(d)\zeta(d-1)...zeta(d-m+1)].
