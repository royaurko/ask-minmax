Kolmogorov's exponential inequalities are basic tools for studying the strong
limit theorems such as the classical laws of the iterated logarithm for both
independent and dependent random variables. This paper establishes the
Kolmogorov type exponential inequalities of the partial sums of independent
random variables as well as negatively dependent random variables under the
sub-linear expectations. As applications of the exponential inequalities, the
laws of the iterated logarithm in the sense of non-additive capacities are
proved for independent or negatively dependent identically distributed random
variables with finite second order moments. For deriving a lower bound of an
exponential inequality, a central limit theorem is also proved under the
sub-linear expectation for random variables with only finite variances.
