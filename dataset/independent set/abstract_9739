The observational data on the the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave
background constraints the scalar spectral tilt $n_s$ and the tensor to scalar
ratio $r$ which depend on the first and second derivatives of the inflaton
potential. The information can be used to reconstruct the inflaton potential in
the polynomial form up to some orders. However, for some classes of potentials,
$n_s$ and $r$ behave as $n_s(N)$ and $r(N)$ universally. The universal behavior
of $n_s(N)$ can be used to reconstruct a class of the full inflaton potentials
in a model independent way. By parameterizing one of the parameters $n_s(N)$,
$\epsilon(N)$ and $\phi(N)$, and fitting the parameters in the models to the
observational data, we obtain the constraints on the parameters and reconstruct
the classes of the inflationary models which include the chaotic inflation,
T-model, hilltop inflation, s-dual inflation, natural inflation and $R^2$
inflation.
