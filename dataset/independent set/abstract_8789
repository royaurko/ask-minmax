Inclusion preserving maps from modules over an Artin algebra to complete
partially ordered sets are studied. This yields a filtration of the Ziegler
spectrum which is indexed by all Gabriel-Roiter measures. Another application
is a compactness result for the set of subcategories of finitely presented
modules that are closed under submodules.
