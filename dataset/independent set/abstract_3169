We present a first principles supercell methodology for the calculation of
exchange interactions of magnetic materials with arbitrary degrees of
structural and chemical disorder in their high temperature paramagnetic state.
It is based on a projection of the total magnetic energy of the system onto
local pair clusters, allowing the interactions to vary independently as a
response to their local environments. We demonstrate our method by deriving the
distance dependent exchange interactions in vibrating crystalline CrN, a
Ti$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$N solid solution as well as in amorphous CrN. Our method
reveals strong local environment effects in all three systems. In the amorphous
case we use the full set of exchange interactions in a search for the
non-collinear magnetic ground state.
