We propose a procedure to measure the Z$^{0}$ line shape and take full
advantage of the superb performance of the CERN $e^+e^-$ Collider LEP. A
precise determination of the total cross section at 5 energies is needed for a
model-independent analysis of the data and for a precision test of the QED
initial state radiation from the fully inclusive hadronic channel.
