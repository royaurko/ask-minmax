In this manuscript, we present conditions for delay-independent stability of
subhomogeneous cooperative time-delay systems. We consider the case where the
time-delay system has a unique equilibrium at the origin and the case where it
has a unique equilibrium in the interior of the positive orthant and prove
global delay-independent stability results in both cases.
