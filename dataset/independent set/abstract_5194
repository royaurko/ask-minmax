A set of reals A is called perfectly meager if A \cap P is meager in P, for
every perfect set P. Marczewski asked if the product of perfectly meager sets
is perfectly meager. In the paper it is shown that it is consistent that the
answer to this question is positive. (It is known that it is also consistent
that the answer is negative (Reclaw))
