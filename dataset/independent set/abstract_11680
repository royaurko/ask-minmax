We demonstrated for the first time the characterization of absolute frequency
stability of three reference cavities by cross beating three laser beams which
are independently locked to these reference cavities. This method shows the
individual feature of each reference cavity, while conventional beatnote
measurement between two cavities can only provide an upper bound. This method
allows for numerous applications such as optimizing the performance of the
reference cavity for optical clockwork.
