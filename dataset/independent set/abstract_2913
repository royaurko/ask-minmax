This paper introduces two new probabilistic graphical models for
reconstruction of genetic regulatory networks using DNA microarray data. One is
an Independence Graph (IG) model with either a forward or a backward search
algorithm and the other one is a Gaussian Network (GN) model with a novel
greedy search method. The performances of both models were evaluated on four
MAPK pathways in yeast and three simulated data sets. Generally, an IG model
provides a sparse graph but a GN model produces a dense graph where more
information about gene-gene interactions is preserved. Additionally, we found
two key limitations in the prediction of genetic regulatory networks using DNA
microarray data, the first is the sufficiency of sample size and the second is
the complexity of network structures may not be captured without additional
data at the protein level. Those limitations are present in all prediction
methods which used only DNA microarray data.
