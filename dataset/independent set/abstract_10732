We apply the puncture approach to conformal thin-sandwich black-hole initial
data. We solve numerically the conformal thin-sandwich puncture (CTSP)
equations for a single black hole with non-zero linear momentum. We show that
conformally flat solutions for a boosted black hole have the same maximum
gravitational radiation content as the corresponding Bowen-York solution in the
conformal transverse-traceless decomposition. We find that the physical
properties of these data are independent of the free slicing parameter.
