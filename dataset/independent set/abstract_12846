In this paper we study the tunneling using a background independent (polymer)
quantization scheme. We show that at low energies, for the tunneling through a
single potential barrier, the polymer transmission coefficient and the polymer
tunneling time converge to its quantum-mechanical counterparts in a clear
fashion. As the energy approaches the maximum these polymer quantities abruptly
decrease to zero. We use the transfer matrix method to study the tunneling
through a series of identical potential barriers. We obtain that the
transmission coefficients (polymer and quantum-mechanical) behave qualitatively
in a similar manner, as expected. Finally we show that the polymer tunneling
time exhibits anomalous peaks compared with the standard result. Numerical
results are also presented.
