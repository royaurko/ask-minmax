Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) of rutile Ti1-xCoxO2-d is systematically
examined with various x and d to reveal a phase diagram for the appearance of
ferromagnetism at higher carrier concentration and Co content. The phase
diagram exactly matches with that determined from anomalous Hall effect (AHE).
The magnetic field dependence of MCD also shows good coincidence with those of
the magnetization and AHE. The coincidence of these independent measurements
strongly suggests single and intrinsic ferromagnetic origin.
