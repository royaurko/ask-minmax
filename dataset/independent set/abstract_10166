Let $V$ be a finite set of divisorial valuations centered at a 2-dimensional
regular local ring $R$. In this paper we study its structure by means of the
semigroup of values, $S_V$, and the multi-index graded algebra defined by $V$,
$\gr_V R$. We prove that $S_V$ is finitely generated and we compute its minimal
set of generators following the study of reduced curve singularities. Moreover,
we prove a unique decomposition theorem for the elements of the semigroup.
  The comparison between valuations in $V$, the approximation of a reduced
plane curve singularity $C$ by families of sets $V^{(k)}$ of divisorial
valuations, and the relationship between the value semigroup of $C$ and the
semigroups of the sets $V^{(k)}$, allow us to obtain the (finite) minimal
generating sequences for $C$ as well as for $V$.
  We also analyze the structure of the homogeneous components of $\gr_V R$. The
study of their dimensions allows us to relate the Poincar\'e series for $V$ and
for a general curve $C$ of $V$. Since the last series coincides with the
Alexander polynomial of the singularity, we can deduce a formula of A'Campo
type for the Poincar\'e series of $V$. Moreover, the Poincar\'e series of $C$
could be seen as the limit of the series of $V^{(k)}$, $k\ge 0$.
