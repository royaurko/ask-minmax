With the market competition aggravating, it becomes necessary for market
players to adopt a business model which can adopt dynamic business changes. Any
enterprise has the possibility to win in the competition only when it forms the
strategic alliance with the upstream and downstream enterprise. This paper
articulates a way of using unified modelling language (UML) to develop business
value chain activities for any enterprise to develop dynamic, adhoc and agile
business model. The results show that the UML is useful in the development of
information systems and is independent of any programming language.
