For every integer $d\ge 1$, there is a unital closed subalgebra $A_d\subset
B(H)$ with similarity degree equal precisely to $d$, in the sense of our
previous paper. This means that for any unital homomorphism $u\colon A_d\to
B(H)$ we have $\|u\|_{cb} \le K\|u\|^d$ with $K>0$ independent of $u$, and the
exponent $d$ in this estimate cannot be improved. The proof that the degree is
larger than $d-1$ crucially uses an upper bound for the norms of certain
Gaussian random matrices due to Haagerup and Thorbj\o rnsen. We also include
several complements to our previous publications on the same subject.
