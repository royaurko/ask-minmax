Erd\H{o}s asked what is the maximum number $\alpha(n)$ such that every set of
$n$ points in the plane with no four on a line contains $\alpha(n)$ points in
general position. We consider variants of this question for $d$-dimensional
point sets and generalize previously known bounds. In particular, we prove the
following two results for fixed $d$:
  - Every set $H$ of $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ contains a subset
$S\subseteq H$ of size at least $c \left(n \log n\right)^{1/d}$, for some
constant $c=c(d)>0$, such that no cell of the arrangement of $H$ is bounded by
hyperplanes of $S$ only.
  - Every set of $cq^d\log q$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for some constant
$c=c(d)>0$, contains a subset of $q$ cohyperplanar points or $q$ points in
general position.
  Two-dimensional versions of the above results were respectively proved by
Ackerman et al. [Electronic J. Combinatorics, 2014] and by Payne and Wood [SIAM
J. Discrete Math., 2013].
