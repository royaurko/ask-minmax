High-resolution, numerical simulations of 17 cluster-sized dark-matter haloes
in eight different cosmologies with and without dynamical dark energy confirm
the picture that core halo densities are imprinted early during their formation
by the mean cosmological density. Quite independent of cosmology, halo
concentrations have a log-normal distribution with a scatter of ~0.2 about the
mean. We propose a simple scaling relation for halo concentrations in
dark-energy cosmologies.
