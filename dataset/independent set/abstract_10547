The iterated random walk is a random process in which a random walker moves
on a one-dimensional random walk which is itself taking place on a
one-dimensional random walk, and so on. This process is investigated in the
continuum limit using the method of moments. When the number of iterations goes
to infinity, a time-independent asymptotic density is obtained. It has a simple
symmetric exponential form which is stable against the modification of a finite
number of iterations. When n is large, the deviation from the stationary
density is exponentially small in n. The continuum results are compared to
Monte Carlo data for the discrete iterated random walk.
