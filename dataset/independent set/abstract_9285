We address the discrepancy between the Rosenbluth and polarization transfer
data for the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon. Assuming that the
effect of two-photon corrections on the polarization transfer data is
negligible, we obtain a model-independent estimate of the two-photon correction
Delta^(2\gamma). We analyze the polarization transfer data and the cross
section data separately using dispersion relations. A central value as well as
an error estimate for Delta^(2\gamma) is then obtained from a comparison of the
two analyses. The resulting values for Delta^(2\gamma) are in good agreement
with direct calculations available in the literature.
