It is shown that, for every integer n>2, there exists \delta_{n}>0 such that
the closure of the set of the real parts of the zeros of the nth partial sum of
the Riemann zeta function \zeta_{n} contains to the interval
[-\delta_{n},b^{n}]. b^{n} is the supremum of the real parts of the zeros of
\zeta_{n}. It is also demonstrated that b^{n} is positive for all n>2. It is
also shown that 0 is an accumulation point common to all the sets P_{\zeta_{n}}
wich are the sets of the real parts of the zeros of \zeta_{n}.
