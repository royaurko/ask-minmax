Maartens {\it et al.}\@ gave a covariant characterization, in a 1+3 formalism
based on a perfect fluid's velocity, of the parts of the first derivatives of
the curvature tensor in general relativity which are ``locally free'', i.e. not
pointwise determined by the fluid energy momentum and its derivative. The full
decomposition of independent curvature derivative components given in earlier
work on the spinor approach to the equivalence problem enables analogous
general results to be stated for any order: the independent matter terms can
also be characterized. Explicit relations between the two sets of results are
obtained. The 24 Maartens {\it et al.} locally free data are shown to
correspond to the $\nabla \Psi$ quantities in the spinor approach, and the
fluid terms are similarly related to the remaining 16 independent quantities in
the first derivatives of the curvature.
