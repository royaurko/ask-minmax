Exact consistent gravitational anomalies for chiral bosons in two dimensions
are treated both with the Schwinger-DeWitt regularization and independently
through a cohomological procedure. The diffeomorphism transformations are
described by a single ghost which allows to climb the cohomological chain in a
unique way.
