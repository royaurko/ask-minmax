Let $V$ denote a vector space over two-element field $\mathbb F_2$ with
finite positive dimension and endowed with a symplectic form $B.$ Let ${\rm
SL}(V)$ denote the special linear group of $V.$ Let $S$ denote a subset of $V.$
Define $Tv(S)$ as the subgroup of ${\rm SL}(V)$ generated by the transvections
with direction $\alpha$ for all $\alpha\in S.$ Define $G(S)$ as the graph whose
vertex set is $S$ and where $\alpha,\beta\in S$ are connected whenever
$B(\alpha,\beta)=1.$ A well-known theorem states that under the assumption that
$S$ spans $V,$ the following (i), (ii) are equivalent: (i) $Tv(S)$ is
isomorphic to a symmetric group. (ii) $G(S)$ is a claw-free block graph. We
give an example which shows that this theorem is not true. We give a
modification of this theorem as follows. Assume that $S$ is a linearly
independent set of $V$ and no element of $S$ is in the radical of $V.$ Then the
above (i), (ii) are equivalent.
