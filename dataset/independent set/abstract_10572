The beating pattern of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in 2D electron system
in the presence of a Rashba zero-field spin splitting is reproduced. It is
shown, taking into account the Zeeman splitting, that the explicit formulae for
the node position well describes the experimental data. The spin-orbit
interaction strength obtained is found to be magnetic field independent in an
agreement with the basic assumptions of the Rashba model.
