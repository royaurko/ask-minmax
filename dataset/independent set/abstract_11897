The strong coupling constants among members of the heavy spin--3/2 baryons
containing single heavy quark with light pseudoscalar mesons are calculated in
the framework of the light cone QCD sum rules. Using symmetry arguments, the
structure independent relations among different correlation functions are
obtained. It is shown that all possible transitions can be described in terms
of one universal invariant function whose explicit expression is Lorenz
structure dependent.
