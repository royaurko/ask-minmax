The ordinary contact process is used to model the spread of a disease in a
population. In this model, each infected individual waits an exponentially
distributed time with parameter 1 before becoming healthy. In this paper, we
introduce and study the contact process in a randomly evolving environment.
Here we associate to every individual an independent two-state, $\{0,1\},$
background process. Given $\delta_0<\delta_1,$ if the background process is in
state $0,$ the individual (if infected) becomes healthy at rate $\delta_0,$
while if the background process is in state $1,$ it becomes healthy at rate
$\delta_1.$ By stochastically comparing the contact process in a randomly
evolving environment to the ordinary contact process, we will investigate
matters of extinction and that of weak and strong survival. A key step in our
analysis is to obtain stochastic domination results between certain point
processes. We do this by starting out in a discrete setting and then taking
continuous time limits.
