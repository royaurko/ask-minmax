We analyse the (rigid) special geometry of a class of local Calabi-Yau
manifolds given by hypersurfaces in C^4 as W'(x)^2+f_0(x)+v^2+w^2+z^2=0, that
arise in the study of the large N duals of four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric
SU(N) Yang-Mills theories with adjoint field \Phi and superpotential W(\Phi).
The special geometry relations are deduced from the planar limit of the
corresponding holomorphic matrix model. The set of cycles is split into a bulk
sector, for which we obtain the standard rigid special geometry relations, and
a set of relative cycles, that come from the non-compactness of the manifold,
for which we find cut-off dependent corrections to the usual special geometry
relations. The (cut-off independent) prepotential is identified with the
(analytically continued) free energy of the holomorphic matrix model in the
planar limit. On the way, we clarify various subtleties pertaining to the
saddle point approximation of the holomorphic matrix model. A formula for the
superpotential of IIB string theory with background fluxes on these local
Calabi-Yau manifolds is proposed that is based on pairings similar to the ones
of relative cohomology.
