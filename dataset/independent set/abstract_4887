We give several new constructions for moderate rank elliptic curves over
$\mathbb{Q}(T)$. In particular we construct infinitely many rational elliptic
surfaces (not in Weierstrass form) of rank 6 over $\mathbb{Q}$ using
polynomials of degree two in $T$. While our method generates linearly
independent points, we are able to show the rank is exactly 6 \emph{without}
having to verify the points are independent. The method generalizes; however,
the higher rank surfaces are not rational, and we need to check that the
constructed points are linearly independent.
