The acoustic response of a rigid frame porous slab with a periodic set of
inclusions is calculated by use of a multipole method. The acoustic properties,
in particular the absorption, of such a structure are then derived and studied.
Numerical results together with a modal analysis show that the addition of a
periodic set of high-contrast inclusions leads to quasi-modes excitation of
both the slab and the gratings, and to a large increase of the acoustic
absorption of the initial slab, this being partly due to the quasi-modes
excitation.
