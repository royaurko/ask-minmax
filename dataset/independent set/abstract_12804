In this paper, we discuss a new method based on probability generating
functions, to derive Stein operators for discrete approximations. This approach
is then used to obtain Stein operators for various random variables closely
related to Poisson, binomial and negative binomial distributions, which are
then employed in conjunction with well-known perturbation to Stein's method.
Some approximation results are derived and a comparison of two different
operators which may be applied to the same distribution is made. This is
illustrated for example by the binomial convoluted with Poisson approximation
to sums of independent as well as dependent indicator random variables.
