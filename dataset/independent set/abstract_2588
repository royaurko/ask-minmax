Hubble plots of the distance of stellar objects vs. recession velocity
normally assume the red shift is wholly Doppler and ignore any gravitational
contribution. This is unwarranted: gravity and Doppler velocity red shifts are
found to be separable and contribute about equally. A recent data set, to
Z=1.2, by Riess (1), was analyzed. Upon plotting distance vs. Doppler velocity,
the slope of the Hubble plot increases. The Hubble plot is also curved,
upwards, and this can be understood in terms of the relativistic metric changes
of the space through which the light travels. On fitting the data to a simple
model of a big bang of constant density, this finds the total mass of the big
bang is M=21.1x10^52 kg. When present actual distance is plotted vs. Doppler
velocity, the plot is linear and agrees with Hubble's concept, without
acceleration. Time since the big bang is longer than the 14 billion years that
had been thought, 23.5 billion years. The Hubble constant hence shrinks from
Ho=71 to Ho=41.6. This is an independent affirmation of a recent CMB finding of
a low Ho=35.
