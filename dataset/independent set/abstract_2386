We summarize two sets of signals at HERA in supersymmetric models with
explicitly broken R-parity. (1) The resonant production of single squarks
through an operator $L_1Q_i{ \bar D}_j$. (2) The MSSM production of a squark
and a slepton followed by R-parity violating decays via the operators
$L_iQ_j{\bar D}_k$. The first case allows for a very large mass reach:
$m_{\tilde q}\leq 275\gev$ for moderate couplings. For masses $\sim 100\gev$
couplings down to $\lam\geq10^{-3}$ can be probed. In the second case the
production mechanism is independent of the R-parity violating Yukawa couplings.
The full generation structure and very low couplings, $10^{-6}$(!!), can be
probed. In the most optimistic case the mass reach is $170,195,205\gev$ for the
operators $L_{\tau,\mu,e}Q{\bar D}$ respectively. We conclude that HERA offers
a {\it very promising} discovery potential for \rpv\ SUSY.}}
