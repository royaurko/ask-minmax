In this paper, we study the number of compact sets needed in an infinite
family of convex sets with a local intersection structure to imply a bound on
its piercing number, answering a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Gr\"unbaum.
Namely, if in an infinite family of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ we know that
out of every $p$ there are $q$ which are intersecting, we determine if having
some compact sets implies a bound on the number of points needed to intersect
the whole family. We also study variations of this problem.
