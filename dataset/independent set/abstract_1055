We obtain factorized domain wall partition functions for two sets of
trigonometric vertex models: 1. The N-state Deguchi-Akutsu models, for N = {2,
3, 4} (and conjecture the result for all N >= 5), and 2. The sl(r+1|s+1)
Perk-Schultz models, for {r, s = \N}, where (given the symmetries of these
models) the result is independent of {r, s}.
