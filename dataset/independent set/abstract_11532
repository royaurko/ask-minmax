In this paper, memories built from components subject to transient faults are
considered. A fault-tolerant memory architecture based on low-density
parity-check codes is proposed and the existence of reliable memories for the
adversarial failure model is proved. The proof relies on the expansion property
of the underlying Tanner graph of the code. An equivalence between the
Taylor-Kuznetsov (TK) scheme and Gallager B algorithm is established and the
results are extended to the independent failure model. It is also shown that
the proposed memory architecture has lower redundancy compared to the TK
scheme. The results are illustrated with specific numerical examples.
