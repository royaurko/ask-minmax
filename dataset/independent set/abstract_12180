We derive an approximation approach to evolution of the longitudinal
structure function, by using a Laplace-transform method. We solve the master
equation and derive the longitudinal structure function as a function of the
initial condition $F_{L}(x,Q^{2}_{0})$ at small x. Our results are independent
of the longitudinal coefficient functions and extend from the leading order
(LO) up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). The comparisons with H1 data
and other parameterizations are made and results show that they are in
agreement with H1 data and some phenomenological models.
