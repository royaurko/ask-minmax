We present a procedure for determining independently the lattice structure
and the vibrational properties of the same individual nano-object. For the
example of an individual single-walled carbon nanotube we demonstrate the
determination of the structural indices (n,m) of the nanotube by electron
diffraction and of the frequencies of vibrational modes by micro-Raman
spectroscopy. The precise and independent determination of both structure and
mode frequencies allows for direct and unambiguous verification of molecular
dynamical calculations and of conclusions drawn from Raman-only experiments.
