This review paper presents an overview of the theoretical and experimental
progress on the study of matter-wave dark solitons in atomic Bose-Einstein
condensates. Upon introducing the general framework, we discuss the statics and
dynamics of single and multiple matter-wave dark solitons in the quasi
one-dimensional setting, in higher-dimensional settings, as well as in the
dimensionality crossover regime. Special attention is paid to the connection
between theoretical results, obtained by various analytical approaches, and
relevant experimental observations.
