We consider the solution $u$ to the one-dimensional parabolic Anderson model
with homogeneous initial condition $u(0, \cdot) \equiv 1$, arbitrary drift and
a time-independent potential bounded from above. Under ergodicity and
independence conditions we derive representations for both the quenched
Lyapunov exponent and, more importantly, the $p$-th annealed Lyapunov exponents
for {\it all} $p \in (0, \infty).$ These results enable us to prove the
heuristically plausible fact that the $p$-th annealed Lyapunov exponent
converges to the quenched Lyapunov exponent as $p \downarrow 0.$ Furthermore,
we show that $u$ is $p$-intermittent for $p$ large enough. As a byproduct, we
compute the optimal quenched speed of the random walk appearing in the
Feynman-Kac representation of $u$ under the corresponding Gibbs measure. In
this context, depending on the negativity of the potential, a phase transition
from zero speed to positive speed appears.
