In this update, we present the new version of the random number generator
(RNG) library RNGSSELIB, which, in particular, contains fast SSE realizations
of a number of modern and most reliable generators \cite{RNGSSELIB1}. The new
features are: i) Fortran compatibility and examples of using the library in
Fortran; ii) new modern and reliable generators; iii) the abilities to jump
ahead inside RNG sequence and to initialize up to $10^{19}$ independent random
number streams with block splitting method.
