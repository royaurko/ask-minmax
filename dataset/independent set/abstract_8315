The covariogram of a compact set A contained in R^n is the function that to
each x in R^n associates the volume of A intersected with (A+x). Recently it
has been proved that the covariogram determines any planar convex body, in the
class of all convex bodies. We extend the class of sets in which a planar
convex body is determined by its covariogram. Moreover, we prove that there is
no pair of non-congruent planar polyominoes consisting of less than 9 points
that have equal discrete covariogram.
