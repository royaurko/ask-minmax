There is a result of Diaconis and Freedman which says that, in a limiting
sense, for large collections of high-dimensional data most one-dimensional
projections of the data are approximately Gaussian. This paper gives
quantitative versions of that result. For a set of deterministic vectors
$\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ in $\R^d$ with $n$ and $d$ fixed, let $\theta\in\s^{d-1}$ be
a random point of the sphere and let $\mu_n^\theta$ denote the random measure
which puts mass $\frac{1}{n}$ at each of the points
$\inprod{x_1}{\theta},...,\inprod{x_n}{\theta}$. For a fixed bounded Lipschitz
test function $f$, $Z$ a standard Gaussian random variable and $\sigma^2$ a
suitable constant, an explicit bound is derived for the quantity $\ds\P[|\int f
d\mu_n^\theta-\E f(\sigma Z)|>\epsilon]$. A bound is also given for
$\ds\P[d_{BL}(\mu_n^\theta, N(0,\sigma^2))>\epsilon]$, where $d_{BL}$ denotes
the bounded-Lipschitz distance, which yields a lower bound on the waiting time
to finding a non-Gaussian projection of the $\{x_i\}$ if directions are tried
independently and uniformly on $\s^{d-1}$.
