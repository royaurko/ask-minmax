Recently, background independent open-string field theory has been formally
defined in the space of all two-dimensional world-sheet theories. In this
paper, to make the construction more concrete, I compute the action for an
off-shell tachyon field of a certain simple type. From the computation it
emerges that, although the string field action does not coincide with the
world-sheet (matter) partition function in general, these functions do coincide
on shell. This can be demonstrated in general, as long as matter and ghosts are
decoupled.
