Higher-order counter automata (\HOCS) can be either seen as a restriction of
higher-order pushdown automata (\HOPS) to a unary stack alphabet, or as an
extension of counter automata to higher levels. We distinguish two principal
kinds of \HOCS: those that can test whether the topmost counter value is zero
and those which cannot.
  We show that control-state reachability for level $k$ \HOCS with $0$-test is
complete for \mbox{$(k-2)$}-fold exponential space; leaving out the $0$-test
leads to completeness for \mbox{$(k-2)$}-fold exponential time. Restricting
\HOCS (without $0$-test) to level $2$, we prove that global (forward or
backward) reachability analysis is $\PTIME$-complete. This enhances the known
result for pushdown systems which are subsumed by level $2$ \HOCS without
$0$-test.
  We transfer our results to the formal language setting. Assuming that $\PTIME
\subsetneq \PSPACE \subsetneq \mathbf{EXPTIME}$, we apply proof ideas of
Engelfriet and conclude that the hierarchies of languages of \HOPS and of \HOCS
form strictly interleaving hierarchies. Interestingly, Engelfriet's
constructions also allow to conclude immediately that the hierarchy of
collapsible pushdown languages is strict level-by-level due to the existing
complexity results for reachability on collapsible pushdown graphs. This
answers an open question independently asked by Parys and by Kobayashi.
