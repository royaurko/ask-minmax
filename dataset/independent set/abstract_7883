We construct a generalization for the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of
gravity. New parameters are introduced into the action to include the
non-dynamical Holst term, independently from the topological Nieh-Yan class.
Finally, we consider the new parameters as fields and analyze the solutions
coming from their equations of motion. The new fields introduce torsional
contributions to the theory that modify Einstein's equations.
