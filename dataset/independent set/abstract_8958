We study the Hausdorff dimension of Poissonian cutout sets defined via
inhomogeneous intensity measures on Ahlfors-regular metric spaces. We obtain
formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of such cutouts in self-similar and
self-conformal spaces using the multifractal decomposition of the average
densities for the natural measures.
