We construct a nontrivial set of invariants for any multipartite mixed states
under the SLOCC symmetry. These invariants are given by hyperdeterminants and
independent from basis change. In particular, a family of d^2 invariants for
arbitrary d-dimensional even partite mixed states are explicitly given.
