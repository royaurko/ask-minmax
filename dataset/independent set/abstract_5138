Given a Cantor-type subset $\Omega$ of a smooth curve in $\mathbb R^{d+1}$,
we construct examples of sets that contain unit line segments with directions
from $\Omega$ and exhibit analytical features similar to those of classical
Kakeya sets of arbitrarily small $(d+1)$-dimensional Lebesgue measure. The
construction is based on probabilistic methods relying on the tree structure of
$\Omega$, and extends to higher dimensions an analogous planar result of
Bateman and Katz. In particular, the existence of such sets implies that the
directional maximal operator associated with the direction set $\Omega$ is
unbounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^{d+1})$ for all $1\leq p<\infty$.
