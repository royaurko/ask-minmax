We study the mechanism by which gravitational actions reproduce the trace
anomalies of the holographically related conformal field theories. Two
universal features emerge: a) the ratios of type B trace anomalies in any even
dimension are independent of the gravitational action, being uniquely
determined by the underlying algebraic structure b) the normalization of the
type A and the overall normalization of the type B anomalies are given by
action dependent expressions with the dimension dependence completely fixed.
