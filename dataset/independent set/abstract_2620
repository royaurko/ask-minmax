In this paper, we study the set of $\Delta$-filtered modules of
quasi-hereditary algebras arising from quotients of the double of quivers of
type $A$. Our main result is that for any fixed $\Delta$-dimension vector,
there is a unique (up to isomorphism) exceptional $\Delta$-filtered module. We
then apply this result to show that there is always an open adjoint orbit in
the nilpotent radical of a seaweed Lie algebra in $\mathrm{gl}_{n}(\field)$,
thus answering positively in this $\mathrm{gl}_{n}(\field)$ case to a question
raised independently by Michel Duflo and Dmitri Panyushev. An example of a
seaweed Lie algebra in a simple Lie algebra of type $E_{8}$ not admitting an
open orbit in its nilpotent radical is given.
