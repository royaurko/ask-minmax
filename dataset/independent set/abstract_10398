The nearest-neighbor level spacing distribution is numerically investigated
by directly diagonalizing disordered Anderson Hamiltonians for systems of sizes
up to 100 x 100 x 100 lattice sites. The scaling behavior of the level
statistics is examined for large spacings near the delocalization-localization
transition and the correlation length exponent is found. By using
high-precision calculations we conjecture a new interpolation of the critical
cumulative probability, which has size-independent asymptotic form \ln I(s)
\propto -s^{\alpha} with \alpha = 1.0 \pm 0.1.
