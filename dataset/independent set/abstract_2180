The Clauser-Horne/Eberhard inequality has taken center stage in tests of
locality thanks to its immunity to the detection loophole. I describe a local
model that violates the inequality using a plausible mechanism relying upon a
parameter of the apparatus, the emission rate. The effect is generated through
the analysis of time-tagged data using a standard windowed coincidence method;
however, the detection times are not functions of the measurement settings. The
analysis does not introduce the nonlocal behavior typical of previous
coincidence window models. This finding has implications for the design and
interpretation of experiments, as it shows that the coincidence window loophole
cannot be eliminated by a demonstration of independence of the detection times
and settings. The paper describes a reliable coincidence counting method and
shows that it delivers an accurate count of true coincidences. Recent
experimental tests of local realism based on the Clauser-Horne/Eberhard
inequality are considered and it is shown that in one case (Christensen et al.)
the emission rate is appropriately limited to ensure valid counting, and the
data confirms local realism; in a second case (Giustina et al.) the experiment
fails to appropriately limit the emission rate, and the claimed violation can
be accounted for locally.
