We use polynomial techniques to derive structural results on R\'edei type
blocking sets from information on their bisecants. We apply our results to
point sets of $PG(2,q)$ with few odd-secants. In particular, we improve the
lower bound of Balister, Bollob\'as, F\"uredi and Thompson on the number of
odd-secants of a $(q+2)$-set in $PG(2,q)$ and we answer a related open question
of Vandendriessche. We prove structural results for semiovals and derive the
non existence of semiovals of size $q+3$ when 3 does not divide $q$ and $q>5$.
This extends a result of Blokhuis who classified semiovals of size $q+2$, and a
result of Bartoli who classified semiovals of size $q+3$ when $q\leq 17$. In
the $q$ even case we can say more applying a result of Sz\H{o}nyi and Weiner
about the stability of sets of even type. We also obtain new proof to a result
of G\'acs and Weiner about $(q+t,t)$-arcs of type $[0,2,t]$ and to one part of
a result of Ball, Blokhuis, Brouwer, Storme and Sz\H{o}nyi about functions over
$GF(q)$ determining less than $(q+3)/2$ directions.
