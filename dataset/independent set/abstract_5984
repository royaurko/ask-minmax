Amato et al.[arXiv:1205.6418] maintain that certain data published in
Carpinteri et al.[2] are not the result of independent measurements, and are in
any case affected by uncertainties such that our conclusions are not valid. We
will provide clarification regarding the validity of the disputed analyses,
showing that they, like the others reported in the original article, are
independent and that the uncertainties affecting them in no way invalidate our
conclusions.
