We study neutrino-induced nucleon knockout from nuclei. Expressions for the
induced polarization are derived within the framework of the
independent-nucleon model and the non-relativistic plane-wave approximation.
Large dissimilarities in the nucleon polarization asymmetries are observed
between neutrino- and antineutrino-induced processes. These asymmetries
represent a potential way to distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos in
neutral-current neutrino-scattering on nuclei. We discuss astrophysical
applications of these polarization asymmetries. Our findings are illustrated
for neutrino scattering on $^{16}$O and $^{208}$Pb.
