We prove the following result: If $G$ be a connected graph on $n \ge 6$
vertices, then there exists a set of vertices $D$ with $|D| \le \frac{n}{3}$
and such that $V(G) \setminus N[D]$ is an independent set, where $N[D]$ is the
closed neighborhood of $D$. Furthermore, the bound is sharp. This seems to be
the first result in the direction of partial domination with constrained
structure on the graph induced by the non-dominated vertices, which we further
elaborate in this paper.
