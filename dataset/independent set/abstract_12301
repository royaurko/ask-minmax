We present fundamental parameters of 4 massive eclipsing binaries in the
young massive cluster Westerlund 1. The goal is to measure accurate masses and
radii of their component stars, which provide much needed constraints for
evolutionary models of massive stars. Accurate parameters can further be used
to determine a dynamical lower limit for the magnetar progenitor and to obtain
an independent distance to the cluster. Our results confirm and extend the
evidence for a high mass for the progenitor of the magnetar.
