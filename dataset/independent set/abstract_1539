Self-scaled barrier functions on self-scaled cones were introduced through a
set of axioms in 1994 by Y.E. Nesterov and M.J. Todd as a tool for the
construction of long-step interior point algorithms. This paper provides firm
foundation for these objects by exhibiting their symmetry properties, their
intimate ties with the symmetry groups of their domains of definition, and
subsequently their decomposition into irreducible parts and algebraic
classification theory. In a first part we recall the characterisation of the
family of self-scaled cones as the set of symmetric cones and develop a
primal-dual symmetric viewpoint on self-scaled barriers, results that were
first discovered by the second contributor. We then show in a short, simple proof
that any pointed, convex cone decomposes into a direct sum of irreducible
components in a unique way, a result which can also be of independent interest.
We then show that any self-scaled barrier function decomposes in an essentially
unique way into a direct sum of self-scaled barriers defined on the irreducible
components of the underlying symmetric cone. Finally, we present a complete
algebraic classification of self-scaled barrier functions using the
correspondence between symmetric cones and Euclidean Jordan algebras.
