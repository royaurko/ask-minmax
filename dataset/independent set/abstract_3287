A search for scalar particles decaying via narrow resonances into two photons
in the mass range $65-600$ GeV is performed using 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}$
= 8 TeV $pp$ collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large
Hadron Collider. The recently discovered Higgs boson is treated as a
background. No significant evidence for an additional signal is observed. The
results are presented as limits at the 95 % confidence level on the production
cross-section of a scalar boson times branching ratio into two photons, in a
fiducial volume where the reconstruction efficiency is approximately
independent of the event topology. The upper limits set extend over a
considerably wider mass range than previous searches.
