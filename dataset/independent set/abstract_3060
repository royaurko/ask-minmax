The 8 TeV LHC Higgs search data just released indicates the existence of a
scalar resonance with mass ~ 125 GeV. We examine the implications of the data
reported by ATLAS, CMS and the Tevatron collaborations on understanding the
properties of this scalar by performing joint fits on its couplings to other
Standard Model particles. We discuss and characterize to what degree this
resonance has the properties of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs, and consider
what implications can be extracted for New Physics in a (mostly)
model-independent fashion. We find that, if the Higgs couplings to fermions and
weak vector bosons are allowed to differ from their standard values, the SM is
~ 2 sigma from the best fit point to current data. Fitting to a possible
invisible decay branching ratio, we find BR_{inv} = 0.05\pm 0.32\ (95% C.L.) We
also discuss and develop some ways of using the data in order to bound or rule
out models which modify significantly the properties of this scalar resonance
and apply these techniques to the global current data set.
