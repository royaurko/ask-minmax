The scalar mode density perturbations in a the warm inflationary scenario are
analysed with a view to predicting the amount of non-gaussianity produced by
this scenario. The analysis assumes that the inflaton evolution is strongly
damped by the radiation, with damping terms that are temperature independent.
Entropy fluctuations during warm inflation play a crucial role in generating
non-gaussianity and result in a distinctive signal which should be observable
by the Planck satellite.
