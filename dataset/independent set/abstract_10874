We present the one-loop anomalous dimension matrices for the chiral-even
twist-3 (nonsinglet) conformal operators, which govern the scale-dependence of
the vector meson light-cone wave functions through the conformal expansion. It
is clarified that the constraints from the charge-conjugation invariance and
the chirality conservation allow only one independent anomalous dimension
matrix for each conformal spin.
