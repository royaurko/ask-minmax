We study those groups that act properly discontinuously, cocompactly, and
isometrically on CAT(0) spaces with isolated flats and the Relative Fellow
Traveller Property. The groups in question include word hyperbolic CAT(0)
groups as well as geometrically finite Kleinian groups and numerous
2-dimensional CAT(0) groups. For such a group we show that there is an
intrinsic notion of a quasiconvex subgroup which is equivalent to the inclusion
being a quasi-isometric embedding. We also show that the visual boundary of the
CAT(0) space is actually an invariant of the group. More generally we show that
each quasiconvex subgroup of such a group has a canonical limit set which is
independent of the choice of overgroup.
  The main results in this article were established by Gromov and Short in the
word hyperbolic setting and do not extend to arbitrary CAT(0) groups.
