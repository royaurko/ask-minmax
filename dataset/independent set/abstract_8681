The scale-invariant spacings lemma due to Arratia, Barbour and Tavar{\'e}
establishes the distributional identity of a self-similar Poisson process and
the set of spacings between the points of this process. In this note we connect
this result with properties of a certain set of extreme points of the unit
Poisson process in the positive quadrant.
