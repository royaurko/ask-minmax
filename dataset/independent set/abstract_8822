We characterize the set of diagonals of the unitary orbit of a self-adjoint
operator with a finite spectrum. Our result extends the Schur-Horn theorem from
a finite dimensional setting to an infinite dimensional Hilbert space analogous
to Kadison's theorem for orthogonal projections and the second contributor's result
for operators with three point spectrum.
