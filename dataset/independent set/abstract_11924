Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods often suffer from long correlation
times. Consequently, these methods must be run for many steps to generate an
independent sample. In this paper a method is proposed to overcome this
difficulty. The method utilizes information from rapidly equilibrating coarse
Markov chains that sample marginal distributions of the full system. This is
accomplished through exchanges between the full chain and the auxiliary coarse
chains. Results of numerical tests on the bridge sampling and
filtering/smoothing problems for a stochastic differential equation are
presented.
