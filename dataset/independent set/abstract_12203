In this note we use an example of Mukai to construct semistable bundles of
rank 3 with 6 independent sections on a curve of genus 9 or 11 with Clifford
index strictly less than the Clifford index of the curve. The example also
allows us to show the non-emptiness of some Brill-Noether loci with negative
expected dimension.
