Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are closed subsets of a Euclidean space such that
$A\cap B\neq\varnothing$, and we aim to find a point in this intersection with
the help of the sequences $(a_n)_\nnn$ and $(b_n)_\nnn$ generated by the
\emph{method of alternating projections}. It is well known that if $A$ and $B$
are convex, then $(a_n)_\nnn$ and $(b_n)_\nnn$ converge to some point in $A\cap
B$. The situation in the nonconvex case is much more delicate. In 1990,
Combettes and Trussell presented a dichotomy result that guarantees either
convergence to a point in the intersection or a nondegenerate compact continuum
as the set of cluster points.
  In this note, we construct two sets in the Euclidean plane illustrating the
continuum case. The sets $A$ and $B$ can be chosen as countably infinite unions
of closed convex sets. In contrast, we also show that such behaviour is
impossible for finite unions.
