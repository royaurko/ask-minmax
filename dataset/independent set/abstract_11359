We generalize the surjectivity result of the $p$-adic monodromy for the
ordinary locus of a Siegel moduli space by Faltings and Chai (independently by
Ekedahl) to that for any $p$-rank stratum. We discuss irreducibility and
connectedness of some $p$-rank strata of the moduli spaces with parahoric level
structure. Finer results are obtained on the Siegel 3-fold with Iwahori level
structure.
