A new type of spectroscopy for high-resolution studies of spin waves that
relies on resonant scattering of hard x-rays is introduced. The energy transfer
in the scattering process is encoded in the precession of the polarization
vector of the scattered photons. Thus, the energy resolution of such a
spectroscopy is independent of the bandwidth of the probing radiation. The
measured quantity resembles the intermediate scattering function of the
magnetic excitations in the sample. At pulsed x-ray sources, especially x-ray
lasers, the proposed technique allows to take single-shot spectra of the
magnetic dynamics. The method opens new avenues to study low-energy
non-equilibrium magnetic processes in a pump-probe setup.
