A hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) approach is employed to quantify the influence of
inelastic deformation on the microstructural evolution of polycrystalline
materials. This approach couples a time explicit material point method (MPM)
for deformation with a calibrated Monte Carlo model for grain boundary motion.
A rate-independent crystal plasticity model is implemented to account for
localized plastic deformations in polycrystals. The dislocation energy
difference between grains provides an additional driving force for texture
evolution. This plastic driving force is then brought into a MC paradigm via
parametric links between MC and sharp-interface (SI) kinetic models. The MC
algorithm is implemented in a parallelized setting using a checkerboard
updating scheme. As expected, plastic loading favors texture evolution for
grains which have a bigger Schmid factor with respect to the loading direction,
and these are the grains most easily removed by grain boundary motion. A
macroscopic equation is developed to predict such texture evolution.
