We model the generation of words with independent unequal probabilities of
occurrence of letters. We prove that the probability $p(r)$ of occurrence of
words of rank $r$ has a power asymptotics. As distinct from the paper published
earlier by B. Conrad and M. Mitzenmacher, we give a brief proof by elementary
methods and obtain an explicit formula for the exponent of the power law.
