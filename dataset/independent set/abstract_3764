We determine the neutrino parameters for MSW and vacuum oscillations (active
and sterile neutrinos) that are allowed by the separate, and collective,
imposition of the constraints from total event rates in the chlorine, GALLEX,
SAGE, and SuperKamiokande experiments (504 days), the SuperKamiokande electron
energy spectrum, and the SuperKamiokande zenith-angle dependence. The small
mixing angle MSW solution is acceptable at the 7% C.L. (8% for sterile nu's)
and the vacuum solution is acceptable at the 6% C.L. . The best-fit global MSW
solution for active neutrinos is: Delta m^2 = 5 x 10^-6 eV^2, sin^2 (2 theta) =
5.5 x 10^{-3} (and for sterile neutrinos: Delta m^2 = 4 x 10^-6 eV^2, sin^2 (2
theta) = 7 x 10^-3). For vacuum oscillations, the best-fit solution is: Delta
m^2 = 6.5 x 10^-11 eV^2, sin^2 (2 theta) = 0.75 . An arbitrary combination of
undistorted (no oscillations) pp, 7Be, 8B, and CNO neutrino fluxes is
inconsistent with the combined data sets at the 3.5 sigma C.L., independent of
astrophysical considerations. We use improved calculations of solar model
fluxes, neutrino absorption cross sections and energy spectra, and a detailed
evaluation of regeneration effects.
