We study the Price of Anarchy of mechanisms for the fundamental problem of
social welfare maximization in one-sided matching settings, when agents have
general cardinal preferences over a finite set of items. We consider both the
complete and incomplete information settings and show that the two most
well-studied mechanisms in literature, Probabilistic Serial and Random Priority
have a Price of Anarchy of $O(\sqrt{n})$. We complement our results with a
lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ on the Price of Anarchy of \emph{all}
mechanisms. As a result, we conclude that these mechanisms are optimal.
