We give sufficient conditions for the uniform hyperbolicity of certain
nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. In particular, we show that local
diffeomorphisms that are nonuniformly expanding on sets of total probability
are necessarily uniformly expanding. We also present a version of this result
for diffeomorphisms with nonuniformly hyperbolic sets.
