We will study perturbations of the polynomials $P_\lambda$, of the form
$$Q_\lambda= P_\lambda +Q$$ in the space of centered monic polynomials, where
$P_\lambda$ is the polynomial family defined by
$$P_{\lambda}(z)=\frac{\lambda}{p}z^p+(1-\frac{\lambda}{p}) z ^{p+1}$$ with
$\lambda \in \Lambda= \{z: |z-1| <1\}$, studied by Benedetto, who showed that
for a dense set of parameters, the polynomials $P_\lambda$ have a wandering
disc contained in the filled Julia set.
  We will show an analogous result for the family $Q_\lambda$, obtaining the
following consequence:
  The polynomials $P_\lambda$ belong to $\bar{\mathrm{E}}_{p+1}$ where
$\mathrm{E}_{p+1}$ denotes the set of polynomials that have a wandering disc in
the filled Julia set, in the space of centered monic polynomials of degree
$p+1$.
