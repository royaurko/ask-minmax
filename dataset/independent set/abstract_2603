When a weak photon decay competes with a strong photon decay in a 3-level
atom, the weak occasionally prevails over the strong photon. This is the
shelving phenomenon. It is assumed in this paper to occur objectively and
autonomously, independent of external observation or lack of observation.
  We here consider an auxiliary rule-set called the nRules that triggers a
non-unitary mechanism that applies to all macroscopic measurements, as well as
to many microscopic processes including shelving. These rules are shown below
to describe the shelving process in complete detail without resorting to the
notion of null measurement, or to an external measurement of any kind. They
describe the V and the Lambda shelving configurations, as well as the two
cascade configurations.
