Let $\mathbf{A}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{np}}(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X}-p\mathbf {I}_n)$
where $\mathbf{X}$ is a $p\times n$ matrix, consisting of independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) real random variables $X_{ij}$ with mean zero
and variance one. When $p/n\to\infty$, under fourth moment conditions a central
limit theorem (CLT) for linear spectral statistics (LSS) of $\mathbf{A}$
defined by the eigenvalues is established. We also explore its applications in
testing whether a population covariance matrix is an identity matrix.
