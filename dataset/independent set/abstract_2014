We critically examine how the evolution of the matter density field in
cosmological simulations is affected by details of setting up initial
conditions. We show that it is non-trivial to realise an initial distribution
of matter in N-body/hydrodynamic simulations so that the baryon and dark matter
density fluctuations and their velocities evolve consistently as theoretically
predicted. We perform a set of cosmological simulations and use them to
distinguish and verify an appropriate method for generating initial conditions.
We show that a straightforward way of applying the Zel'dovich approximation to
each component using distinct transfer functions results in an incorrect growth
of density fluctuations and that it is necessary to correct velocities at the
initial epoch. The unperturbed uniform particle distribution must be also
generated appropriately to avoid tight coupling of the baryonic and dark matter
components. We recommend using independent ``glass'' particle distributions,
using distinct transfer functions for baryons and dark matter, and taking into
account the difference in the velocity fields at the initialisation epoch. The
proposed method will be useful for studies of the evolution of the
intergalactic medium and the formation of the first cosmological objects using
numerical simulations.
