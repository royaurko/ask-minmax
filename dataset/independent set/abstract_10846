The Coleman-Glashow sum-rule for magnetic moments is always fulfilled in the
chiral quark model, independently of SU(3) symmetry breaking. This is due to
the structure of the wave functions, coming from the non-relativistic quark
model. Experimentally, the Coleman-Glashow sum-rule is violated by about ten
standard deviations. To overcome this problem, two models of wave functions
with configuration mixing are studied. One of these models violates the
Coleman-Glashow sum-rule to the right degree and also reproduces the octet
baryon magnetic moments rather accurately.
