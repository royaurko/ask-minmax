By subtracting from a recent lattice measurement of the thermal
vector-current correlator the known 5-loop vacuum contribution, we demonstrate
that the remainder is small and shows no visible short-distance divergence. It
can therefore in principle be subjected to model-independent analytic
continuation. Testing a particular implementation, we obtain estimates for the
flavour-diffusion coefficient (2 pi T D \gsim 0.8) and electrical conductivity
which are significantly smaller than previous results. Although systematic
errors remain beyond control at present, some aspects of our approach could be
of a wider applicability.
