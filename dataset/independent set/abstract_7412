A fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) method provides a promising
alternative to the commonly used coupled-cluster (CC) methods, in the domain of
benchmark noncovalent interaction energy calculations. This is mainly true for
a low-order polynomial CPU cost scaling of FN-DMC and favorable FN error
cancellation leading to benchmark interaction energies accurate to 0.1
kcal/mol. While it is empirically accepted that the FN-DMC results depend
weakly on the one-particle basis sets used to expand the guiding functions,
limits of this assumption remain elusive. Our recent work indicates that
augmented triple zeta basis sets are sufficient to achieve a benchmark level of
0.1 kcal/mol. Here we report on a possibility of significant truncation of the
one-particle basis sets without any visible bias on the overall accuracy of the
final FN-DMC energy differences. The approach is tested on a set of seven small
noncovalent closed-shell complexes including a water dimer. The reported
findings enable cheaper high-quality FN-DMC benchmarks.
