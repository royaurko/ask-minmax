We study N=2 superconformal theories on Euclidean and Lorentzian
four-manifolds with a view toward applications to holography and localization.
The conditions for supersymmetry are equivalent to a set of differential
constraints including a "generalised" conformal Killing spinor equation
depending on various background fields. We solve these equations in the general
case and give very explicit expressions for the auxiliary fields that we need
to turn on to preserve some supersymmetry. As opposed to what has been observed
for the N=1 case, the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry turn out to be
almost independent of the signature of spacetime, with the exception of few
degenerate cases including the topological twist. Generically, the only
geometrical constraint coming from supersymmetry is the existence of a
conformal Killing vector on the manifold, all other constraints determine the
background auxiliary fields.
