Starting from a process in the nonnegative quadrant whose components are
independent Bessel processes, an additional drift of the same kind is added to
each component which depends on the other component. Strong existence and
uniqueness are obtained for a large set of parameters. The question of hitting
the corner is the source of main difficulties. Some properties of the usual
one-dimensional Bessel processes are preserved. The results are reminiscent of
the study of a Brownian motion with oblique reflection in the quadrant.
Actually, the same skew symmetry condition is involved when looking for a
stationary distribution in product form when adding a constant drift. The terms
of the product are now gamma distributions in place of exponential ones.
