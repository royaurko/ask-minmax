We examine a special linear combination of balanced very-well-poised
$\tphia$ basic hypergeometric series that is known to satisfy a
transformation. We call this $\Phi$ and show that it satisfies certain
three-term contiguous relations. From two sets of contiguous relations for
$\Phi$ we obtain fifty-six pairwise linearly independent solutions to a
three-term recurrence that generalizes the recurrence for Askey-Wilson
polynomials. The associated continued fraction is evaluated using Pincherle's
theorem. From this continued fraction we are able to derive a discrete system
of biorthogonal rational functions. This ties together Wilson's results for
rational biorthogonality, Watson's $q$-analogue of Ramanujan's Entry 40
continued fraction and a conjecture of Askey concerning the latter. Some new
$q$-series identities are also obtained. One is an important three-term
transformation for $\Phi$'s which generalizes all the known two and three-term
$\ephis$ transformations. Others are new and unexpected quadratic identities
for these very-well-poised $\ephis$'s.
