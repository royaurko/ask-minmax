In this paper we prove a sufficient condition for the existence of a Hamilton
cycle, which is applicable to a wide variety of graphs, including relatively
sparse graphs. In contrast to previous criteria, ours is based on only two
properties: one requiring expansion of ``small'' sets, the other ensuring the
existence of an edge between any two disjoint ``large'' sets. We also discuss
applications in positional games, random graphs and extremal graph theory.
