For the calculation of polarization transfer observables for quasielastic
scattering of protons on nuclei, a formalism in the context of the Relativistic
Plane Wave Impulse Approximation is developed, in which the interaction matrix
is expanded in terms of a complete set of 44 independent invariant amplitudes.
A boson-exchange model is used to predict the 39 amplitudes which were omitted
in the formerly used five-term parameterization(the SPVAT form) of the
nucleon-nucleon scattering matrix. Use of the complete set of amplitudes
eliminates the arbitrariness of the five-term representation.
