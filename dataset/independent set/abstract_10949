The phase convention independent measure of CP violation for three
generations of leptons is evaluated at different energy scales. Unlike in the
quark sector, this quantity does not vary much between the weak and the grand
unification scales. The behavior of the measure of CP violation in the Standard
Model is found to be different from that in the extensions of the Standard
Model.
