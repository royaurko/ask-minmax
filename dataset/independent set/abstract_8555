In the Twin Towers of Hanoi version of the well known Towers of Hanoi Problem
there are two coupled sets of pegs. In each move, one chooses a pair of pegs in
one of the sets and performs the only possible legal transfer of a disk between
the chosen pegs (the smallest disk from one of the pegs is moved to the other
peg), but also, simultaneously, between the corresponding pair of pegs in the
coupled set (thus the same sequence of moves is always used in both sets). We
provide upper and lower bounds on the length of the optimal solutions to
problems of the following type. Given an initial and a final position of N
disks in each of the coupled sets, what is the smallest number of moves needed
to simultaneously obtain the final position from the initial one in each set?
Our analysis is based on the use of a group, called Hanoi Towers group, of
rooted ternary tree automorphisms, which models the original problem in such a
way that the configurations on N disks are the vertices at level N of the tree
and the action of the generators of the group represents the three possible
moves between the three pegs. The twin version of the problem is analyzed by
considering the action of Hanoi Towers group on pairs of vertices.
