We show that there exist solutions of drift-diffusion equations in two
dimensions with divergence-free super-critical drifts, that become
discontinuous in finite time. We consider classical as well as fractional
diffusion. However, in the case of classical diffusion and time-independent
drifts we prove that solutions satisfy a modulus of continuity depending only
on the local $L^1$ norm of the drift, which is a super-critical quantity.
