It is shown that the only associative algebras with a trivial center defined
on functions of $\Rl^N$ by an integral kernel are generalized Moyal algebras,
corresponding to some particular operator ordering. Similarly, the only such
Lie algebras are generalized Moyal or Poisson Lie algebras. In both cases these
structures are isomorphic respectively to the Moyal algebra, the Moyal Lie
algebra and the Poisson Lie algebra. These results are independent of $N$,
which is necessarily even, and generalize previous work on the subject.
