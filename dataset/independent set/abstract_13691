We prove that there is a residual set of families of smooth or analytic
unimodal maps with quadratic critical point and negative Schwarzian derivative
such that almost every non-regular parameter is Collet-Eckmann with
subexponential recurrence of the critical orbit. Those conditions lead to a
detailed and robust statistical description of the dynamics. This proves the
Palis conjecture in this setting.
