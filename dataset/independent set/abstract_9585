Following the construction of the general effective theory for dark matter
direct detection in 1203.3542, we perform an analysis of the experimental
constraints on the full parameter space of elastically scattering dark matter.
We review the prescription for calculating event rates in the general effective
theory and discuss the sensitivity of various experiments to additional nuclear
responses beyond the spin-independent (SI) and spin-dependent (SD) couplings:
an angular-momentum-dependent (LD) and spin-and-angular-momentum-dependent
(LSD) response, as well as a distinction between transverse and longitudinal
spin-dependent responses. We consider the effect of interference between
different operators and in particular look at directions in parameter space
where such cancellations lead to holes in the sensitivity of individual
experiments. We explore the complementarity of different experiments by looking
at the improvement of bounds when experiments are combined. Finally, our scan
through parameter space shows that within the assumptions on models and on the
experiments' sensitivity that we make, no elastically scattering dark matter
explanation of DAMA is consistent with all other experiments at 90%, though we
find points in parameter space that are ruled out only by about a factor of 2
in the cross-section.
