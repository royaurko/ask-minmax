We consider multichannel deconvolution in a periodic setting with long-memory
errors under three different scenarios for the convolution operators, i.e.,
super-smooth, regular-smooth and box-car convolutions. We investigate global
performances of linear and hard-thresholded non-linear wavelet estimators for
functions over a wide range of Besov spaces and for a variety of loss functions
defining the risk. In particular, we obtain upper bounds on convergence rates
using the $L^p$-risk $(1 \le p < \infty)$. Contrary to the case where the
errors follow independent Brownian motions, it is demonstrated that
multichannel deconvolution with errors that follow independent fractional
Brownian motions with different Hurst parameters results in a much more
involved situation. An extensive finite-sample numerical study is performed to
supplement the theoretical findings.
