We show that the novel figure eight singularity in a pseudoholomorphic quilt
can be continuously removed when composition of Lagrangian correspondences is
cleanly immersed. The proof of this result requires a collection of
width-independent elliptic estimates that allow for non-standard complex
structures on the domain.
