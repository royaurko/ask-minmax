We present that by combining Crossing Statistic and Smoothing method one can
reconstruct the expansion history of the universe with a very high precision
without considering any prior on the cosmological quantities such as the
equation of state of dark energy. We show that the presented method performs
very well in reconstruction of the expansion history of the universe
independent of the underlying models and it works well even for non-trivial
dark energy models with fast or slow changes in the equation of state of dark
energy. Accuracy of the reconstructed quantities along with independence of the
method to any prior or assumption gives the proposed method advantages to the
other non-parametric methods proposed before in the literature. Applying on the
Union 2.1 supernovae combined with WiggleZ BAO data we present the
reconstructed results and test the consistency of the two data sets in a model
independent manner. Results show that latest available supernovae and BAO data
are in good agreement with each other and spatially flat LCDM model is in
concordance with the current data.
