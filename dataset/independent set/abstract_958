We define and discuss a set of (4N - 4) parameters that can be used to
analyse events in which N jets have been produced in high energy hadron-hadron
collisions. These multijet variables are the multijet mass and (4N - 5)
independent dimensionless parameters. To illustrate the use of the variables
QCD predictions are presented for events with up to five jets produced at the
Fermilab Tevatron Proton-Antiproton Collider. These QCD predictions are
compared with the predictions of a model in which multijet events uniformly
populate the N-body phase-space.
