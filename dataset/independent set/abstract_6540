Let $f$ be a quadratic polynomial which has an irrationally indifferent
fixed point $\alpha$. Let $z$ be a biaccessible point in the Julia set of $f$.
Then:
  1. In the Siegel case, the orbit of $z$ must eventually hit the critical
point of $f$.
  2. In the Cremer case, the orbit of $z$ must eventually hit the fixed point
$\alpha$. Siegel polynomials with biaccessible critical point certainly exist,
but in the Cremer case it is possible that biaccessible points can never
exist.
  As a corollary, we conclude that the set of biaccessible points in the Julia
set of a Siegel or Cremer quadratic polynomial has Brolin measure zero.
