The state-of-the-art error correcting codes are based on large random
constructions (random graphs, random permutations, ...) and are decoded by
linear-time iterative algorithms. Because of these features, they are
remarkable examples of diluted mean-field spin glasses, both from the static
and from the dynamic points of view. We analyze the behavior of decoding
algorithms using the mapping onto statistical-physics models. This allows to
understand the intrinsic (i.e. algorithm independent) features of this
behavior.
