Intervals in binary or n-ary relations or other discrete structures
generalize the concept of interval in a linearly ordered set. Join-irreducible
partitions into intervals are characterized in the lattice of all interval
decompositions of a set, in a general sense of intervals defined axiomatically.
This characterization is used to show that the lattice of interval
decompositions is balanced.
