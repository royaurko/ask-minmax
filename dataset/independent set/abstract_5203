In this paper we consider quasi-concave set functions defined on
antimatroids. There are many equivalent axiomatizations of antimatroids, that
may be separated into two categories: antimatroids defined as set systems and
antimatroids defined as languages. An algorthmic characterization of
antimatroids, that considers them as set systems, was given in (Kempner, Levit
2003). This characterization is based on the idea of optimization using set
functions defined as minimum values of linkages between a set and the elements
from the set complement. Such set functions are quasi-concave. Their behavior
on antimatroids was studied in (Kempner, Muchnik 2003), where they were applied
to constraint clustering. In this work we investigate a duality between
quasi-concave set functions and linkage functions. Our main finding is that
quasi-concave set functions on an antimatroid may be represented as minimum
values of some monotone linkage functions.
