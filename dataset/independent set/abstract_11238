In this paper we prove that the Casson-Gordon invariants of the connected sum
of two knots split when the Alexander polynomials of the knots are coprime. As
one application, for any knot K, all but finitely many algebraically slice
twisted doubles of K are linearly independent in the knot concordance group.
