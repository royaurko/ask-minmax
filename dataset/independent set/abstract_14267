Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points on the plane in general position. We say that
a set $\Gamma$ of convex polygons with vertices in $P$ is a convex
decomposition of $P$ if: Union of all elements in $\Gamma$ is the convex hull
of $P,$ every element in $\Gamma$ is empty, and for any two different elements
of $\Gamma$ their interiors are disjoint. A minimal convex decomposition of $P$
is a convex decomposition $\Gamma'$ such that for any two adjacent elements in
$\Gamma'$ its union is a non convex polygon. It is known that $P$ always has a
minimal convex decomposition with at most $\frac{3n}{2}$ elements. Here we
prove that $P$ always has a minimal convex decomposition with at most
$\frac{10n}{7}$ elements.
