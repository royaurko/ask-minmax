Investigating the link between postcritical behaviors and the relations of
saddle basic sets for Axiom A polynomial skew products on C^2, we characterize
various properties concerning the three kinds of accumulation sets defined by
DeMarco and Hruska in terms of the saddle basic sets. We also give a new
example of higher degree.
