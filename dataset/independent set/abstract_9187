One loop anomalies and their dependence on antifields for general gauge
theories are investigated within a Pauli-Villars regularization scheme. For
on-shell theories {\it i.e.}, with open algebras or on-shell reducible
theories, the antifield dependence is cohomologically non trivial. The
associated Wess-Zumino term depends also on antifields. In the classical basis
the antifield independent part of the WZ term is expressed in terms of the
anomaly and finite gauge transformations by introducing gauge degrees of
freedom as the extra dynamical variables. The complete WZ term is reconstructed
from the antifield independent part.
