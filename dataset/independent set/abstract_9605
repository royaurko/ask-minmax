We study private broadcasting of two messages to two groups of receivers over
independent parallel channels. One group consists of an arbitrary number of
receivers interested in a common message, whereas the other group has only one
receiver. Each message must be kept confidential from the receiver(s) in the
other group. Each of the sub-channels is degraded, but the order of receivers
on each channel can be different. While corner points of the capacity region
were characterized in earlier works, we establish the capacity region and show
the optimality of a superposition strategy. For the case of parallel Gaussian
channels, we show that a Gaussian input distribution is optimal. We also
discuss an extension of our setup to broadcasting over a block-fading channel
and demonstrate significant performance gains using the proposed scheme over a
baseline time-sharing scheme.
