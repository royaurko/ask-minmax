We consider the generic problem of performing a global fit to many
independent data sets each with a different overall multiplicative
normalization uncertainty. We show that the methods in common use to treat
multiplicative uncertainties lead to systematic biases. We develop a method
which is unbiased, based on a self--consistent iterative procedure. We
demonstrate the use of this method by applying it to the determination of
parton distribution functions with the NNPDF methodology, which uses a Monte
Carlo method for uncertainty estimation.
