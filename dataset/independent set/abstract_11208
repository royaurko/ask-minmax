We give a model-independent derivation of general intersecting rules for
spacelike branes (S-branes) in arbitrary dimensions $d$. This is achieved by
directly solving bosonic field equations for supergravity coupled to a dilaton
and antisymmetric tensor fields with minimal ans\"{a}tze. We compare the
results with those in eleven-dimensional supergravity and other solutions.
