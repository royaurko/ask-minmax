In this article, we introduce the concept of normal families of bicomplex
holomorphic functions to obtain a bicomplex Montel theorem. Moreover, we give a
general definition of Fatou and Julia sets for bicomplex polynomials and we
obtain a characterization of bicomplex Fatou and Julia sets in terms of Fatou
set, Julia set and filled-in Julia set of one complex variable. Some 3D visual
examples of bicomplex Julia sets are also given for the specific slice
$\bold{j}=0$.
