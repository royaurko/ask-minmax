We provide evidence for a high precision model-independent low momentum
nucleon-nucleon interaction. Performing a momentum-space renormalization group
decimation, we find that the effective interactions constructed from various
high precision nucleon-nucleon interaction models, such as the Paris, Bonn,
Nijmegen, Argonne, CD Bonn and Idaho potentials, are identical. This
model-independent low momentum interaction, called V_{low k}, reproduces the
same phase shifts and deuteron pole as the input potential models, without
ambiguous assumptions on the high momentum components, which are not
constrained by low energy data and lead to model-dependent results in many-body
applications. V_{low k} is energy-independent and does not necessitate the
calculation of the Brueckner G matrix.
