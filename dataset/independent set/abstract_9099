We discuss the case of simultaneous mixing of gauge bosons and mixing of
fermions in a model independent way and for a variety of extra-fermion
representations.
  In this context we analyze a class of lepton family violating processes,
namely Z --> e tau, Z --> mu tau, Z --> e mu, mu --> e e e, tau --> e e e, tau
--> mu mu mu, tau --> e mu mu and tau --> mu e e in the presence of one extra
neutral gauge boson, Z', with universal, non-universal or family changing
couplings.
  We derive bounds on the combined effect of Z-Z' mixing and ordinary--exotic
lepton mixing.
