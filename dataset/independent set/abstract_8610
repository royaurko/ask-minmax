We study the rate of growth of sharp fronts of the Quasi-geostrophic equation
and 2D incompressible Euler equations.. The development of sharp fronts are due
to a mechanism that piles up level sets very fast. Under a semi-uniform
collapse, we obtain a lower bound on the minimum distance between the level
sets.
