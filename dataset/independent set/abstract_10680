A model of the universe as a self-organized critical system is considered.
The universe evolves to a state independently of the initial conditions at the
edge of chaos. The critical state is an attractor of the dynamics. Random
metric fluctuations exhibit noise without any characteristic length scales, and
the power spectrum for the fluctuations has a self-similar fractal behavior. In
the early universe, the metric fluctuations smear out the local light cones
removing the horizon problem.
