We discuss decays and productions for the possible molecular states formed by
bottom mesons B (B*) and anti-B (anti-B*). The twin resonances found by Belle,
Zb(10610) and Zb(10650), are such candidates. The spin wave functions of the
molecular states are rearranged into those of heavy and light spin degrees of
freedom by using the re-coupling formulae of angular momentum. By applying the
heavy quark symmetry we derive model independent relations among various decay
and production rates, which can be tested in experiments.
