In this paper, we define a Banach SNL space to be a Banach space with a
certain kind of linear map from it into its dual, and we develop the theory of
linear $L$-positive subsets of Banach SNL spaces with Banach SNL dual spaces.
We use this theory to give simplified proofs of some recent results of
Bauschke, Borwein, Wang and Yao, and also of the classical Brezis-Browder
theorem.
