We consider $N\times N$ random matrices of the form $H = W + V$ where $W$ is
a real symmetric or complex Hermitian Wigner matrix and $V$ a real, diagonal,
random or deterministic matrix whose entries are independent of $W$. We assume
subexponential decay for the matrix entries of $W$ and we choose $V$ so that
the eigenvalues of $W$ and $V$ are typically of the same order. For a large
class of diagonal matrices $V$ we show that the local statistics in the bulk of
the spectrum are universal in the limit of large $N$.
