A polyomino graph $H$ is a connected finite subgraph of the infinite plane
grid such that each finite face is surrounded by a regular square of side
length one and each edge belongs to at least one square. In this paper, we show
that if $K$ is a maximum resonant set of $H$, then $H-K$ has a unique perfect
matching. We further prove that the maximum forcing number of a polyomino graph
is equal to its Clar number. Based on this result, we have that the maximum
forcing number of a polyomino graph can be computed in polynomial time. We also
show that if $K$ is a maximal alternating set of $H$, then $H-K$ has a unique
perfect matching.
