Computable analysis and effective descriptive set theory are both concerned
with complete metric spaces, functions between them and subsets thereof in an
effective setting. The precise relationship of the various definitions used in
the two disciplines has so far been neglected, a situation this paper is meant
to remedy.
  As the role of the Cauchy completion is relevant for both effective
approaches to Polish spaces, we consider the interplay of effectivity and
completion in some more detail.
