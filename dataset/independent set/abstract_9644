We consider several properties commonly (but not universally) possessed by
B\"acklund transformations between hyperbolic Monge-Amp\`ere equations:
wavelike nature of the underlying equations, preservation of independent
variables, quasilinearity of the transformation, and autonomy of the
transformation. The goal of this paper is to show that, while these properties
all appear to depend on the formulation of both the underlying PDEs and the
B\"acklund transformation in a particular coordinate system, in fact they all
have intrinsic geometric meaning, independent of any particular choice of local
coordinates. The problem of {\em classifying} B\"acklund transformations with
these properties will be considered in a future paper.
