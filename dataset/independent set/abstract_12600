The modified SNIP indicator of Elsevier, as recently explained by Waltman et
al. (2013) in this journal, solves some of the problems which Leydesdorff &
Opthof (2010 and 2011) indicated in relation to the original SNIP indicator
(Moed, 2010 and 2011). The use of an arithmetic average, however, remains
unfortunate in the case of scientometric distributions because these can be
extremely skewed (Seglen, 1992 and 1997). The new indicator cannot (or hardly)
be reproduced independently when used for evaluation purposes, and remains in
this sense opaque from the perspective of evaluated units and scholars.
