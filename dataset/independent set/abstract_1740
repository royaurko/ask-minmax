Architectural modeling is an integral part of modern software development. In
particular, diverse systems benefit from precise architectural models since
similar components can often be reused between different system variants.
However, during all phases of diverse system development, system variability
has to be considered and modeled by appropriate means. Delta modeling is a
language-independent approach for modeling system variability. A set of diverse
systems is represented by a core system and a set of deltas specifying
modifications to the core system. In this paper, we give a first sketch of how
to apply delta modeling in MontiArc, an existing architecture description
language, in order to obtain an integrated modeling language for architectural
variability. The developed language, MontiArc, allows the modular modeling of
variable software architectures and supports proactive as well as extractive
product line development.
