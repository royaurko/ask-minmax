We describe standing wave patterns induced by an attractive finite-ranged
external potential inside a large Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). As the
potential depth increases, the time independent Gross-Pitaevskii equation
develops pairs of solutions that have nodes in their wavefunction. We elucidate
the nature of these states and study their dynamical stability. Although we
study the problem in a two-dimensional BEC subject to a cylindrically symmetric
square-well potential of a radius that is comparable to the coherence length of
the BEC, our analysis reveals general trends, valid in two and three
dimensions, independent of the symmetry of the localized potential well, and
suggestive of the behavior in general, short- and large-range potentials. One
set of nodal BEC wavefunctions resembles the single particle n node bound state
wavefunction of the potential well, the other wavefunctions resemble the n-1
node bound-state wavefunction with a kink state pinned by the potential. The
second state, though corresponding to the lower free energy value of the pair
of n node BEC states, is always unstable, whereas the first can be dynamically
stable in intervals of the potential well depth, implying that the standing
wave BEC can evolve from a dynamically unstable to stable, and back to unstable
status as the potential well is adiabatically deepened, a phenomenon that we
refer to as "reentrant dynamical stability".
