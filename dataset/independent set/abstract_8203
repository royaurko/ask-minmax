The Maxwell integral equations expressing Ampere's and Faraday's laws are
shown to be affected by heavy physical approximations. The usual deduction from
them, moreover, of the corresponding set of differential Maxwell equations is
based, in general, on a wrong use of the Stokes theorem. The equivalence,
therefore, between the two sets of equations must be reconsidered. Interesting
conclusions may be drawn from the comparison between the experimental set-ups
of the Faraday's law and of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
