The phase diagram of superconducting $U\!Pt_{3}$ in pressure-temperature
plane, together with the neutron scattering data is studied within a two
component superconducting order parameter scenario. In order to give a
qualitative explanation to the experimental data a set of two linearly
independent antiferromagnetic moments which emerge appropriately at the
temperature \mbox{$T_{N}\sim 10\cdot T_{c}$} and \mbox{$T_{m}\sim T_{c}$} and
couple to superconductivity is proposed. Several constraints on the fourth
order coefficients in the Ginzburg-Landau free energy are obtained.
