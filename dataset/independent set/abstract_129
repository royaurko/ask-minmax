We introduce and study the toric fiber product of two ideals in polynomial
rings that are homogeneous with respect to the same multigrading. Under the
assumption that the set of degrees of the variables form a linearly independent
set, we can explicitly describe generating sets and Groebner bases for these
ideals. This allows us to unify and generalize some results in algebraic
statistics.
