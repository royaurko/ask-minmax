We investigate matter symmetries of cylindrically symmetric static
spacetimes. These are classified for both cases when the energy-momentum tensor
is non-degenerate and also when it is degenerate. It is found that the
non-degenerate energy-momentum tensor gives either three, four, five, six,
seven or ten independent matter collineations in which three are isometries and
the rest are proper. The worth mentioning cases are those where we obtain the
group of matter collineations finite-dimensional even the energy-momentum
tensor is degenerate. These are either three, four, five or ten. Some examples
are constructed satisfying the constraints on the energy-momentum tensor.
