The inequalities proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 170404 (2010)] are not
Bell's inequalities in the usual sense: there are local classical models that
violate these inequalities. Thus, their violation demonstrates nonlocality only
under assumptions about the physical implementation and moreover they cannot be
used as a device-independent test of nonlocality.
