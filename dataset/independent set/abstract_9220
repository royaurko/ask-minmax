A simple closed curve $\gamma$ in the real projective plane $P^2$ is called
anti-convex if for each point $p$ on the curve, there exists a line which is
transversal to the curve and meets the curve only at $p$. We shall prove the
relation $i(\gamma)-2\delta(\gamma)=3$ for anti-convex curves, where
$i(\gamma)$ is the number of independent (true) inflection points and
$\delta(\gamma)$ the number of independent double tangents. This formula is a
refinement of the classical M\"obius theorem. We shall also show that there are
three inflection points on a given anti-convex curve such that the tangent
lines at these three inflection points cross the curve only once. Our approach
is axiomatic and can be applied in other situations. For example, we prove
similar results for curves of constant width as a corollary.
