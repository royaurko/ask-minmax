We have measured the effective mass, m, and Lande g-factor in very dilute
two-dimensional electron systems in silicon. Two independent methods have been
used: (i) measurements of the magnetic field required to fully polarize the
electrons' spins and (ii) analysis of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. We
have observed a sharp increase of the effective mass with decreasing electron
density while the g-factor remains nearly constant and close to its value in
bulk silicon. The corresponding strong rise of the spin susceptibility may be a
precursor of a spontaneous spin polarization; unlike in the Stoner scenario, it
originates from the enhancement of the effective mass rather than the increase
of g-factor. Furthermore, using tilted magnetic fields, we have found that the
enhanced effective mass is independent of the degree of spin polarization and,
therefore, its increase is not related to spin exchange effects, in
contradiction with existing theories. Our results show that the dilute 2D
electron system in silicon behaves well beyond a weakly interacting Fermi
liquid.
