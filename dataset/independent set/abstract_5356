We present a search for Lorentz violation with 8249 candidate electron
antineutrino events taken by the Double Chooz experiment in 227.9 live days of
running. This analysis, featuring a search for a sidereal time dependence of
the events, is the first test of Lorentz invariance using a reactor-based
antineutrino source. No sidereal variation is present in the data and the
disappearance results are consistent with sidereal time independent
oscillations. Under the Standard-Model Extension (SME), we set the first limits
on fourteen Lorentz violating coefficients associated with transitions between
electron and tau flavor, and set two competitive limits associated with
transitions between electron and muon flavor.
