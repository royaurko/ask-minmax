The modular technology of development of the problem-oriented CAD expansions
is applied to a task of designing of protection of the buildings from the
lightning with realization in program system TechnoCAD GlassX. The system model
of the drawings of lightning protection is developed including the structured
parametric representation (properties of objects and their interdependence,
general settings and default settings) and operations with it, which
efficiently automate designing
