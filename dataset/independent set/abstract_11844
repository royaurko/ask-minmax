The `Internal Linear Combination' (ILC) component separation method has been
extensively used on the data of the WMAP space mission, to extract a single
component, the CMB, from the WMAP multifrequency data. We extend the ILC
approach for reconstructing millimeter astrophysical emissions beyond the CMB
alone. In particular, we construct a Constrained ILC to extract clean maps of
both the CMB or the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich (SZ) effect, with vanishing
contamination from the other. The performance of the Constrained ILC is tested
on simulations of Planck mission observations, for which we successfully
reconstruct independent estimates of the CMB and of the thermal SZ.
