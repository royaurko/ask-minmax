The influence of the Bose - Einstein interference effect on the joint WW
hadronic decay is discussed. It is shown that the weight method incorporating
this effect into Monte Carlo generators produces in a natural way an excess of
average multiplicity as compared to the independent decay of two W bosons. The
quantitative results for the average multiplicity and momentum distribution of
charged pions, obtained with a simple parametrization of weights compatible
with the observed shape of the "Bose - Einstein ratio", agree well with the
existing data.
