We investigate the stability of a spatially homogeneous and isotropic
non-singular cosmological model. We show that the complete set of independent
perturbations (the electric part of the perturbed Weyl tensor and the perturbed
shear) are regular and well behaved functions which have no divergences,
contrary to previous claims in the literature.
