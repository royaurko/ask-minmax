We investigate the possibility of constraining the dark energy equation of
state by measuring the ratio of Einstein radii in a strong gravitational lens
system with two source planes. This quantity is independent of the Hubble
parameter and directly measures the growth of angular diameter distances as a
function of redshift. We investigate the prospects for a single double source
plane system and for a forecast population of systems discovered by
re-observing a population of single source lenses already known from a
photometrically selected catalogue such as CASSOWARY or from a
spectroscopically selected catalogue such as SLACS. We find that constraints
comparable to current data-sets (15% uncertainty on the dark equation of state
at 68%CL) are possible with a handful of double source plane systems. We also
find that the method's degeneracy between Omega_M and w is almost orthogonal to
that of CMB and BAO measurements, making this method highly complimentary to
current probes.
