We show that the set of the equivalence classes of multifoliate structures is
in one-to-one correspondence with the set of equivalence classes of finite
complete projective systems of vector space epimorphisms. After that we give
the complete description of all product preserving bundle functors on the
categories of multifibered and multifoliate manifolds.
