Based on observations of points uniformly distributed over a convex set in
$\R^d$, a new estimator for the volume of the convex set is proposed. The
estimator is minimax optimal and also efficient non-asymptotically: it is
nearly unbiased with minimal variance among all unbiased oracle-type
estimators. Our approach is based on a Poisson point process model and as an
ingredient, we prove that the convex hull is a sufficient and complete
statistic. No hypotheses on the boundary of the convex set are imposed. In a
numerical study, we show that the estimator outperforms earlier estimators for
the volume. In addition, an improved set estimator for the convex body itself
is proposed.
