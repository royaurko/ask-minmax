We construct a set of extremal D1-D5-P solutions, by taking appropriate
limits in a known family of nonextremal 3-charge solutions. The extremal
geometries turn out to be completely smooth, with no horizon and no
singularity. The solutions have the right charges to be the duals of a family
of CFT microstates which are obtained by spectral flow from the NS vacuum.
