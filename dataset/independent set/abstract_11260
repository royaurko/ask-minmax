This note contains a new proof of a theorem of Gang Xiao saying that the
bicanonical map of a surface S of general type is generically finite if and
only if the second plurigenus of S is strictly larger than 2. Such properties
are also studied for adjoint linear systems |K_S+L|, where L is any divisor
with at least 2 linearly independent sections.
