In this article we investigate consistency and asymptotic normality of the
maximum likelihood and the posterior distribution of the parameters in the
context of state space stochastic differential equations (SDE's). We then
extend our asymptotic theory to random effects models based on systems of state
space SDE's, covering both independent and identical and independent but
nonidentical collections of state space SDE's. We also address asymptotic
inference in the case of multidimensional linear random effects, and in
situations where the data are available in discretized forms. It is important
to note that asymptotic inference, either in the classical or in the Bayesian
paradigm, has not been hitherto investigated in state space SDE's.
