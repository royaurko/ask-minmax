We study the impact parameter dependence of solutions to the
Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation. We argue that if the kernel of the BK
integral equation is regulated to cutoff infrared singularities, then it can be
approximated by an equation without diffusion in impact parameter. For some
purposes, when momentum scales large compared to $\Lambda_{QCD}$ are probed,
the kernel may be approximated as massless. In particular, we find that the
Froissart bound limit is saturated for physical initial conditions and seem to
be independent of the cutoff so long as the cutoff is sufficiently large
compared to the momentum scale associated with the large distance falloff of
the impact parameter distribution.
