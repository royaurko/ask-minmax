Catalysis of dynamical symmetry breaking by a constant magnetic field in
(3+1) dimensions is considered. We use the three flavour Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio
type model with 't Hooft and eight-quark interaction terms. It is shown that
the multi-quark interactions introduce new additional features to this
phenomenon: (a) the local minimum of the effective potential catalyzed by the
constant magnetic field is smoothed out with increasing strength of the field
at the characteristic scale H~10^{19} G, (b) the multi-quark forces generate
independently another local minimum associated with a larger dynamical fermion
mass. This state may exist even for multi-quark interactions with a subcritical
set of couplings, and is globally stable with respect to a further increase of
the magnetic field.
