Effects due to non-pointlike behaviour of pions in the process
$e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ can arise for hard photons in the final state. By
means of a Monte Carlo event generator, which also includes the contribution of
the direct decay $\phi\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$, we estimate these effects in the
framework of Resonance Perturbation Theory. We consider angular cuts used in
the KLOE analysis of the pion form factor at threshold. A method to reveal the
effects of non-pointlike behaviour of pions in a model-independent way is
proposed.
