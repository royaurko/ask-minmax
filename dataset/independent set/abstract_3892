We discuss the localization of scalar, fermion, and gauge field zero modes on
a $3-$brane that resides at the intersection of two $4-$branes in
six-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This set-up has been introduced in the
context of brane world models and, higher-dimensional versions of it, in string
theory. In both six- and ten-dimensional cases, it has been shown that
four-dimensional gravity can be reproduced at the intersection, due to the
existence of a massless, localized graviton zero-mode. However, realistic
scenarios require also the Standard Model to be localized on the $3-$brane. In
this paper, we discuss under which conditions a higher-dimensional field
theory, propagating on the above geometry, can have a zero-mode sector
localized at the intersection and find that zero modes can be localized only if
masses and couplings to the background curvature satisfy certain relations. We
also consider the case when other 4-branes cut the bulk at some distance from
the intersection and argue that, in the probe brane approximation, there is no
significant effect on the localization properties at the $3-$brane. The case of
bulk fermions is particularly interesting, since the properties of the geometry
allow localization of chiral modes independently.
