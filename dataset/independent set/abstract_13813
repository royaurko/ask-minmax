We extend the definition of a semidualizing module to associative rings. This
enables us to define and study Auslander and Bass classes with respect to a
semidualizing bimodule C. We then study the classes of C-flats, C-projectives,
and C-injectives, and use them to provide a characterization of the modules in
the Auslander and Bass classes. We extend Foxby equivalence to this new
setting. This paper contains a few results which are new in the commutative,
noetherian setting.
