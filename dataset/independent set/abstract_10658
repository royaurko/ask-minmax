User interfaces that adapt their characteristics to those of the user are
referred to as adaptive interfaces. We propose Adaptive Agent Oriented Software
Architecture (AAOSA) as a new way of designing adaptive interfaces. AAOSA is a
new approach to software design based on an agent-oriented architecture. In
this approach agents are considered adaptively communicating concurrent modules
which are divided into a white box module responsible for the communications
and learning, and a black box which is responsible for the independent
specialized processes of the agent. A distributed learning policy that makes
use of this architecture is used for purposes of system adaptability.
