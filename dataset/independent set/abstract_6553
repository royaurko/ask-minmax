In 1891 Cantor presented two proofs with the purpose to establish a general
theorem that any set can be replaced by a set of greater power. Cantor's power
set theorem can be considered to be an extension of Cantor's 1891 second proof
and its argument makes use of a well-known self-referring statement. In this
article it is shown that, defining the relative complement of the
self-referring statement, Cantor's power set theorem cannot be derived.
Moreover, it is given a refutation of the first proof, the so-called Cantor's
diagonal argument.
