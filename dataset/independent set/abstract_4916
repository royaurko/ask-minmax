We consider decomposition of coordinate independent states into SO(9)xSU(2)
representations in SU(2) Matrix theory. To see what and how many
representations appear in the decomposition, we compute the character, which is
given by a trace over the coordinate independent states, and decompose it into
the sum of products of SO(9) and SU(2) characters.
