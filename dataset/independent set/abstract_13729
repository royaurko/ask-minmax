We give new formulas for Grothendieck polynomials of two types. One type
expresses any specialization of a Grothendieck polynomial in at least two sets
of variables as a linear combination of products Grothendieck polynomials in
each set of variables, with coefficients Schubert structure constants for
Grothendieck polynomials. The other type is in terms of chains in the Bruhat
order. We compare this second type to other constructions of Grothendieck
polynomials within the more general context of double Grothendieck polynomials
and the closely related H-polynomials. Our methods are based upon the geometry
of permutation patterns.
