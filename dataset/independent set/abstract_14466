In this paper, we deduce some properties of f-sets of connected graphs. We
introduce the concept of fixing share of each vertex of a fixing set D to see
the participation of each vertex in fixing a connected graph G. We also define
a parameter, called the fixing percentage, by using the concept of fixing
share, which is helpful in determining the measure of the amount of fixing done
by the elements of a fixing set D in G. It is shown that for every positive
integer N, there exists a graph G with dtr(G)-Det(G)>= N, where dtr(G) is the
determined number and Det(G) is the determining number of G.
