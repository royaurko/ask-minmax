We find the evolution of arbitrary excitations on 2-charge supertubes, by
mapping the supertube to a string carrying traveling waves. We argue that when
the coupling is increased from zero the energy of excitation leaks off to
infinity, and when the coupling is increased still further a new set of long
lived excitations emerge. We relate the excitations at small and large
couplings to excitations in two different phases in the dual CFT. We conjecture
a way to distinguish bound states from unbound states among 3-charge BPS
geometries; this would identify black hole microstates among the complete set
of BPS geometries.
