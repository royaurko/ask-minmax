In this paper we present a feasibility study for measuring the combination of
the Unitarity Triangle angle 2$\beta +\gamma$ with a time dependent Dalitz
analysis in $B^0$ decays using $D^- K^0 \pi^+$ final states following the
method proposed in [1]. For this study we build a model for this decay using
the latest experimental information and we investigate the possibility of
fitting together with 2$\beta +\gamma$ all the relevant strong amplitudes and
phases of the decay model.
