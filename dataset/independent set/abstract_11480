We have developed external-cavity diode lasers, where the wavelength
selection is assured by a low loss interference filter instead of the common
diffraction grating. The filter allows a linear cavity design reducing the
sensitivity of the wavelength and the external cavity feedback against
misalignment. By separating the feedback and wavelength selection functions,
both can be optimized independently leading to an increased tunability of the
laser. The design is employed for the generation of laser light at 698, 780 and
852 nm. Its characteristics make it a well suited candidate for space-born
lasers.
