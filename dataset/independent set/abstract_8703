We extend and generalize the results of Scheiderer (2006) on the
representation of polynomials nonnegative on two-dimensional basic closed
semialgebraic sets. Our extension covers some situations where the defining
polynomials do not satisfy the transversality condition. Such situations arise
naturally when one considers semialgebraic sets invariant under finite group
actions.
