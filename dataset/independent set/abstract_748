By implementing a recent technique for the determination of stochastic
eigendirections of two coupled stochastic variables, we investigate the
evolution of fluctuations of NO2 concentrations at two monitoring stations in
the city of Lisbon, Portugal. We analyze the stochastic part of the
measurements recorded at the monitoring stations by means of a method where the
two concentrations are considered as stochastic variables evolving according to
a system of coupled stochastic differential equations. Analysis of their
structure allows for transforming the set of measured variables to a set of
derived variables, one of them with reduced stochasticity. For the specific
case of NO2 concentration measures, the set of derived variables are well
approximated by a global rotation of the original set of measured variables. We
conclude that the stochastic sources at each station are independent from each
other and typically have amplitudes of the order of the deterministic
contributions. Such findings show significant limitations when predicting such
quantities. Still, we briefly discuss how predictive power can be increased in
general in the light of our methods.
