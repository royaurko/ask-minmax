Two types of spatiotemporal chaos exhibited by ensembles of coupled nonlinear
oscillators are analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA). For
diffusively coupled complex Ginzburg-Landau oscillators that exhibit smooth
amplitude patterns, ICA extracts localized one-humped basis vectors that
reflect the characteristic hole structures of the system, and for nonlocally
coupled complex Ginzburg-Landau oscillators with fractal amplitude patterns,
ICA extracts localized basis vectors with characteristic gap structures.
Statistics of the decomposed signals also provide insight into the complex
dynamics of the spatiotemporal chaos.
