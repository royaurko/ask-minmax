Two dimensional gravity with torsion is proved to be equivalent to special
types of generalized 2d dilaton gravity. E.g. in one version, the dilaton field
is shown to be expressible by the extra scalar curvature, constructed for an
independent Lorentz connection corresponding to a nontrivial torsion.
Elimination of that dilaton field yields an equivalent torsionless theory,
nonpolynomial in curvature. These theories, although locally equivalent exhibit
quite different global properties of the general solution. We discuss the
example of a (torsionless) dilaton theory equivalent to the $R^2 + T^2$--model.
Each global solution of this model is shown to split into a set of global
solutions of generalized dilaton gravity. In contrast to the theory with
torsion the equivalent dilaton one exhibits solutions which are asymptotically
flat in special ranges of the parameters. In the simplest case of ordinary
dilaton gravity we clarify the well known problem of removing the Schwarzschild
singularity by a field redefinition.
