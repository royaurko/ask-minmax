Starting from the observation that reversible processes cannot increase the
purity of any input state, we study deterministic physical processes, which map
a set of states to a set of pure states. Such a process must map any state to
the same pure output, if purity is demanded for the input set of all states.
But otherwise, when the input set is restricted, it is possible to find
non-trivial purifying processes. For the most restricted case of only two input
states, we completely characterize the output of any such map. We furthermore
consider maps, which combine the property of purity and reversibility on a set
of states, and we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on sets, which
permit such processes.
