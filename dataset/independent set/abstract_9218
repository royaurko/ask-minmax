In the convolution model $Z\_i=X\_i+ \epsilon\_i$, we give a model selection
procedure to estimate the density of the unobserved variables $(X\_i)\_{1 \leq
i \leq n}$, when the sequence $(X\_i)\_{i \geq 1}$ is strictly stationary but
not necessarily independent. This procedure depends on wether the density of
$\epsilon\_i$ is super smooth or ordinary smooth. The rates of convergence of
the penalized contrast estimators are the same as in the independent framework,
and are minimax over most classes of regularity on ${\mathbb R}$. Our results
apply to mixing sequences, but also to many other dependent sequences. When the
errors are super smooth, the condition on the dependence coefficients is the
minimal condition of that type ensuring that the sequence $(X\_i)\_{i \geq 1}$
is not a long-memory process.
