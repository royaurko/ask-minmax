We put forward three simple algorithms to generate Kochen-Specker sets used
for parity proof of Kochen-Specker theorem in three-qubit system. These
algorithms enables us to generate 320, 640 and 64 Kochen-Specket sets with 36,
38 and 40 rays, respectively. No any computer calculation is required, every
step in the algorithms is determined by the method of picking the rays that
repeat 4 times in the KS sets.
