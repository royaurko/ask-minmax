We examine the ATLAS and CMS 7 & 8 TeV multijet supersymmetry (SUSY) searches
requiring the incidence of a single lepton in the framework of the
supersymmetric grand unified model No-Scale Flipped SU(5) with extra
vector-like flippon multiplets derived from F-Theory, or F-SU(5) for short.
Investigated are five multijet+lepton SUSY searches: 4.7/fb ATLAS 7 TeV gluino
and light stop searches, as well as 13/fb ATLAS and 9.7/fb CMS 8 TeV light stop
searches. Most significantly, all five leptonic SUSY searches represent
statistically independent data samples. Findings show that all five orthogonal
sets of leptonic LHC observations give a lower bound to the gaugino mass scale
at M_{1/2} >= 680 GeV, with all the current best fits correlating within a
narrow region. Furthermore, eight statistically independent LHC SUSY search
regions (leptonic + all-hadronic) accessible to the No-Scale F-SU(5) model
space intersect with all the currently operating beyond the Standard Model
experiments within the range of M_{1/2} = 680-850 GeV, with the upper bound
established by the lower experimental limit of the anomalous magnetic moment
(g_{mu}-2)/2 of the muon. We emphasize that this region of the F-SU(5) model
space may not be fully probed by leptonic SUSY searches at the LHC until the 13
TeV LHC energizes in 2015. Additionally, we describe an efficient technique for
the effective statistical disentanglement of searches sensitive to mutually
overlapping event spaces.
