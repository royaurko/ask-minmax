The compatibility of neutrino-nucleus deep inelastic scattering data within
the universal, factorizable nuclear parton distribution functions has been
studied independently by several groups in the past few years. The conclusions
are contradictory, ranging from a violation of the universality up to a good
agreement, most of the controversy originating from the use of the
neutrino-nucleus data from the NuTeV Collaboration. Here, we pay attention to
non-negligible differences in the absolute normalization between different
neutrino data sets. We find that such variations are large enough to prevent a
tensionless fit to all data simultaneously and could therefore misleadingly
point towards nonuniversal nuclear effects. We propose a concrete method to
deal with the absolute normalization and show that an agreement between
independent neutrino data sets is established.
