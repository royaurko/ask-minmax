Two sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ are called homometric if they have the same
covariogram, where the covariogram of a finite subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ is
the function associating to each $u \in \mathbb{R}^d$ the cardinality of $K
\cap (K+u)$. Understanding the structure of homometric sets is important for a
number of areas of mathematics and applications.
  If two sets are homometric but do not coincide up to translations and point
reflections, we call them nontrivially homometric. We study nontrivially
homometric pairs of lattice-convex sets, where a set $K$ is called
lattice-convex with respect to a lattice $\mathbb{M} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ if
$K$ is the intersection of $\mathbb{M}$ and a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$.
This line of research was initiated in 2005 by Daurat, G\'erard and Nivat and,
independently, by Gardner, Gronchi and Zong.
  All pairs of nontrivially homometric lattice-convex sets that have been known
so far can be written as direct sums $S \oplus T$ and $S \oplus (-T)$, where
$T$ is lattice-convex and the underlying lattice is the direct sum of $T$ and
some sublattice. We study pairs of nontrivially homometric lattice-convex sets
assuming this particular form and establish a necessary and a sufficient
condition for the lattice-convexity of $S \oplus T$. This allows us to
explicitly describe all nontrivially homometric pairs in dimension two, under
the above assumption, and to construct examples of nontrivially homometric
pairs of lattice-convex sets for each $d \ge 3$.
