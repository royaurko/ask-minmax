We examine the localization properties of the 2D Anderson Hamiltonian with
off-diagonal disorder. Investigating the behavior of the participation numbers
of eigenstates as well as studying their multifractal properties, we find
states in the center of the band which show critical behavior up to the system
size $N= 200 \times 200$ considered. This result is confirmed by an independent
analysis of the localization lengths in quasi-1D strips with the help of the
transfer-matrix method. Adding a very small additional onsite potential
disorder, the critical states become localized.
