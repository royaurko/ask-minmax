We update the standard model predictions for the branching ratios of the
decays B -> (K,K*,Xs) l^+ l^-, with l=e,mu. Using the measurements of BR(B ->
Xs gamma) and BR(B -> K l^+ l^-) as well as the upper limits on BR(B -> (K*,Xs)
l^+ l^-)$, we work out model independent bounds on the relevant Wilson
coefficients. We show the impact of such bounds on the parameter space of the
MSSM with minimal flavour violation and of supersymmetric models with
additional sources of flavour changing.
