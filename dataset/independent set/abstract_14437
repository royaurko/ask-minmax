This paper proposes a model, the linear model, for randomly generating logic
programs with low density of rules and investigates statistical properties of
such random logic programs. It is mathematically shown that the average number
of answer sets for a random program converges to a constant when the number of
atoms approaches infinity. Several experimental results are also reported,
which justify the suitability of the linear model. It is also experimentally
shown that, under this model, the size distribution of answer sets for random
programs tends to a normal distribution when the number of atoms is
sufficiently large.
