In the paper we give an exhaustive arithmetic criterion of adjacency in prime
graph $GK(G)$ for every finite nonabelian simple group $G$. By using this
criterion for all finite simple groups an independence set with the maximal
number of vertices, an independence set containing 2 with the maximal number of
vertices, and the orders of these independence sets are given. We assemble this
information in the tables at the end of the paper. Several applications of
obtained results for various problems of finite group theory are considered.
