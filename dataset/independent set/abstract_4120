In this paper we study the strict majority bootstrap percolation process on
graphs. Vertices may be active or passive. Initially, active vertices are
chosen independently with probability p. Each passive vertex becomes active if
at least half of its neighbors are active (and thereafter never changes its
state). If at the end of the process all vertices become active then we say
that the initial set of active vertices percolates on the graph. We address the
problem of finding graphs for which percolation is likely to occur for small
values of p. Specifically, we study a graph that we call r-wheel: a ring of n
vertices augmented with a universal vertex where each vertex in the ring is
connected to its r closest neighbors to the left and to its r closest neighbors
to the right. We prove that the critical probability is 1/4. In other words, if
p>1/4 then for large values of r percolation occurs with probability
arbitrarily close to 1 as n goes to infinity. On the other hand, if p<1/4 then
the probability of percolation is bounded away from 1.
