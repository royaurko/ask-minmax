In this paper, controllability of systems defined on graphs is discussed. We
consider the problem of controllability of the network for a family of matrices
carrying the structure of an underlying directed graph. A one-to-one
correspondence between the set of leaders rendering the network controllable
and zero forcing sets is established. To illustrate the proposed results,
special cases including path, cycle, and complete graphs are discussed.
Moreover, as shown for graphs with a tree structure, the proposed results of
the present paper together with the existing results on the zero forcing sets
lead to a minimal leader selection scheme in particular cases.
