Results of applying analytic perturbation theory (APT) to the Bjorken sum
rule are presented. We study the third-order QCD correction within the analytic
approach and investigate its renormalization scheme dependence. We demonstrate
that, in the framework of the method, theoretical predictions of the Bjorken
sum rule are, practically, scheme independent for the entire interval of
momentum transfer.
