We explore the consequences of an ideal I of real polynomials having a real
radical initial ideal, both for the geometry of the real variety of I and as an
application to sums of squares representations of polynomials. We show that if
in_w(I) is real radical for a vector w in the tropical variety, then w is in
the logarithmic set of the real variety. We also give algebraic sufficient
conditions for w to be in the logarithmic limit set of a more general
semialgebraic set. If in addition the entries of w are positive, then the
corresponding quadratic module is stable. In particular, if in_w(I) is real
radical for some positive vector w then the set of sums of squares modulo I is
stable. This provides a method for checking the conditions for stability given
by Powers and Scheiderer.
