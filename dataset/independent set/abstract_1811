Let $2^{[n]}$ denote the power set of $[n]:=\{1,2,..., n\}$. A collection
$\B\subset 2^{[n]}$ forms a $d$-dimensional {\em Boolean algebra} if there
exist pairwise disjoint sets $X_0, X_1,..., X_d \subseteq [n]$, all non-empty
with perhaps the exception of $X_0$, so that $\B={X_0\cup \bigcup_{i\in I}
X_i\colon I\subseteq [d]}$. Let $b(n,d)$ be the maximum cardinality of a family
$\F\subset 2^X$ that does not contain a $d$-dimensional Boolean algebra.
Gunderson, R\"odl, and Sidorenko proved that $b(n,d) \leq c_d n^{-1/2^d} \cdot
2^n$ where $c_d= 10^d 2^{-2^{1-d}}d^{d-2^{-d}}$.
  In this paper, we use the Lubell function as a new measurement for large
families instead of cardinality. The Lubell value of a family of sets $\F$ with
$\F\subseteq \tsupn$ is defined by $h_n(\F):=\sum_{F\in \F}1/{{n\choose |F|}}$.
We prove the following Tur\'an type theorem. If $\F\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ contains
no $d$-dimensional Boolean algebra, then $h_n(\F)\leq 2(n+1)^{1-2^{1-d}}$ for
sufficiently large $n$. This results implies $b(n,d) \leq C n^{-1/2^d} \cdot
2^n$, where $C$ is an absolute constant independent of $n$ and $d$. As a
consequence, we improve several Ramsey-type bounds on Boolean algebras. We also
prove a canonical Ramsey theorem for Boolean algebras.
