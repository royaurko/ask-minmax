In a recent paper by the contributors a general result characterizing two-sided
LIL behavior for real valued random variables has been established. In this
paper, we show that there are analogous results in the Banach space setting.
One of our main new tools is an improved Fuk-Nagaev type inequality in Banach
space which should be of independent interest.
