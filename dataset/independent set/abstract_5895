We examine the transformation of particle trajectories in models with
deformations of Special Relativity that have an energy-dependent and
observer-independent speed of light. These transformations necessarily imply
that the notion of what constitutes the same space-time event becomes dependent
on the observer's inertial frame. To preserve observer-independence, the such
arising nonlocality should not be in conflict with our knowledge of particle
interactions. This requirement allows us to derive strong bounds on
deformations of Special Relativity and rule out a modification to first order
in energy over the Planck mass.
