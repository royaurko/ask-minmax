The usual formulations of time-dependent mechanics start from a given
splitting $Y=R\times M$ of the coordinate bundle $Y\to R$. From physical
viewpoint, this splitting means that a reference frame has been chosen.
Obviously, such a splitting is broken under reference frame transformations and
time-dependent canonical transformations. Our goal is to formulate
time-dependent mechanics in gauge-invariant form, i.e., independently of any
reference frame. The main ingredient in this formulation is a connection on the
bundle $Y\to R$ which describes an arbitrary reference frame. We emphasize the
following peculiarities of this approach to time-dependent mechanics. A phase
space does not admit any canonical contact or presymplectic structure which
would be preserved under reference frame transformations, whereas the canonical
Poisson structure is degenerate. A Hamiltonian fails to be a function on a
phase space. In particular, it can not participate in a Poisson bracket so that
the evolution equation is not reduced to the Poisson bracket. This fact becomes
relevant to the quantization procedure. Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations
of time-dependent mechanics are not equivalent. A degenerate Lagrangian admits
a set of associated Hamiltonians, none of which describes the whole mechanical
system given by this Lagrangian.
