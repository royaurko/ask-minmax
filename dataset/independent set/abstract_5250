We prove that for a torus homeomorphism isotopic to the identity and with a
lift whose rotation set is an interval, either every rational point in the
rotation set is realized by a periodic orbit, or there exists an annular,
essential, periodic set. In the latter case we give a qualitative description
of the dynamics.
