Conditions are given which imply that analytic iterated function systems
(IFS's) in the complex plane have uniformly perfect attractor sets. In
particular, it is shown that the attractor set of a finitely generated
conformal IFS is uniformly perfect when it contains two or more points. Also,
an example of a finitely generated analytic attractor set which is not
uniformly perfect is given.
