The set of linear, differential operators preserving the vector space of
couples of polynomials of degrees n and n-2 in one real variable leads to an
abstract associative graded algebra A(2). The irreducible, finite dimensional
representations of this algebra are classified into five infinite discrete sets
and one exceptional case. Their matrix elements are given explicitely. The
results are related to the theory of quasi exactly solvable equations.
