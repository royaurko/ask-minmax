Given a set S of n points in R^D, and an integer k such that 0 <= k < n, we
show that a geometric graph with vertex set S, at most n - 1 + k edges, maximum
degree five, and dilation O(n / (k+1)) can be computed in time O(n log n). For
any k, we also construct planar n-point sets for which any geometric graph with
n-1+k edges has dilation Omega(n/(k+1)); a slightly weaker statement holds if
the points of S are required to be in convex position.
