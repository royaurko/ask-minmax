We demonstrate that electron-electron interactions fundamentally restrict the
penetration length of superconducting correlations into a diffusive normal
metal (N) attached to a superconductor (S). We evaluate the subgap
magnetoconductance $G$ of SN hybrids in the presence of electron-electron
interactions and demonstrate that the effect of the magnetic field on $G$ is
twofold: It includes ($i$) additional temperature independent dephasing of
Cooper pairs and ($ii$) Zeeman splitting between the states with opposite
spins. The dephasing length of Cooper pairs can be directly extracted from
measurements of the subgap magnetoconductance in SN systems at low
temperatures.
