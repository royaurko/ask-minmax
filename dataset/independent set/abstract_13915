Single electron transistors (SETs) are fabricated by placing single walled
carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) on a 100 nm wide local Al/Al2O3 bottom gate and then
contacting with Pd electrodes. Coulomb oscillations up to 125 K were observed
and charging energies of 12-15 meV with level spacing of ~5 meV were measured
from the Couloumb diamond, in agreement with a dot size of ~100 nm, implying
that the local gate defines the dot size by bending SWNT at the edges and
controls its operation. This "mechanical template" approach may facilitate
large scale fabrication of SET devices using SWNT.
