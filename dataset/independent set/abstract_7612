We propose a pregeometrical formulation of Berkovits' open
Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz (RNS) superstring field theories. We show that Berkovits'
open RNS superstring field theories arise by expanding around particular
solutions of the classical equations of motion for this theory. Our action
contains pure ghost operators only and so is formally background independent.
