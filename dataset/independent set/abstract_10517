The kinetics of the diffusion-controlled chemical reactions A+A+...+A->0 that
occur at catalytic centers periodically arranged along a straight line is
considered. Modes of the behavior of reaction probability W(t) were studied at
different times and different densities of the catalyst. Within the
Smoluchowski approximation, it was rigorously proved that at large times the
function W(t) is independent of the lattice period. This means that, in the
given asymptotic mode, the probability of the reaction on a lattice with a
catalyst placed in each lattice site is the same as on a lattice with a
catalyst placed in sparse sites.
