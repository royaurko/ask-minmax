In computer simulations we find that particles can scatter in bent crystal
lattices with effective radiation length down to a few micron or 300-700 times
shorter than in the corresponding amorphous materials. We derive a theoretical
estimate independent of energy for the effective radiation length that is in
agreement with our simulations for C, Si, Ge, and W crystal lattices. We show
that in the ongoing collimation experiment at the Tevatron a crystal-based
smart scattering material could outperform a channeling crystal in efficiency
of collimation reducing the local background rate by a factor of 40.
