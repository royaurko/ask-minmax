A comparative study of the lattice Landau gauge gluon and ghost propagators
for SU(2) and SU(3) pure Yang-Mills theories is carried out. The data were
specially produced with equivalent lattice parameters to allow for a careful
comparison of the two cases. We find very good agreement between the two
theories. Our results seem to confirm the predicton of Schwinger-Dyson
equations that the infrared exponents are independent of the gauge group SU(N).
