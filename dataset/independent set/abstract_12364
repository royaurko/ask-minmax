A theoretical model for polydisperse systems of hard spheres is said to be
truncatable when the excess free energy depends on the size distribution
through a finite number $K$ of moments. This Note proves an exact scaling
relation for truncatable free energies, which allows to reduce the effective
degrees of freedom to $K-2$ independent combinations of the moments.
