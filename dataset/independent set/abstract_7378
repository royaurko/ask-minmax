An integer additive set-indexer is defined as an injective function
$f:V(G)\rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0}$ such that the induced function $g_f:E(G)
\rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0}$ defined by $g_f (uv) = f(u)+ f(v)$ is also
injective, where $f(u)+f(v)$ is the sumset of $f(u)$ and $f(v)$. If
$g_f(uv)=k~\forall~uv\in E(G)$, then $f$ is said to be a $k$-uniform integer
additive set-indexer. An integer additive set-indexer $f$ is said to be a
strong integer additive set-indexer if $|g_f(uv)|=|f(u)|.|f(v)|~\forall ~ uv\in
E(G)$. In this paper, we study the characteristics of certain graph classes and
graph powers that admit strong integer additive set-indexers.
