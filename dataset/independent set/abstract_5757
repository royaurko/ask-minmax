Using chiral symmetry we investigate the leading SU(3) violation in
light-cone distribution functions phi_M(x) of the pion, kaon, and eta. It is
shown that terms non-analytic in the quark masses do not affect the shape, and
only appear in the decay constants. Predictive power is retained including the
leading analytic m_q operators. With the symmetry violating corrections we
derive useful model independent relations between phi_pi, phi_eta, and phi_K.
Using the soft-collinear effective theory we discuss how factorization
generates the subleading chiral coefficients.
