A new approach to relativistic elasticity theory is proposed. In this
approach the theory becomes a gauge--type theory, with the diffeomorphisms of
the material space playing the role of gauge transformations. The dynamics of
the elastic material is expressed in terms of three independent, hyperbolic,
second order partial differential equations imposed on three (independent)
gauge potentials. The relationship with the Carter-Quintana approach is
discussed.
