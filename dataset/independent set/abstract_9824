For an ad-nilpotent ideal $i$ of a Borel subalgebra of $sl_{l+1}(C)$, we
denote by $I_i$ the maximal subset $I$ of the set of simple roots such that $i$
is an ad-nilpotent ideal of the standard parabolic subalgebra $p_I$. We use the
bijection given by G.E. Andrews, C. Krattenthaler, L. Orsina and P. Papi
between the set of ad-nilpotent ideals of a Borel subalgebra in $sl_{l+1}(C)$
and the set of Dyck paths of length $2l+2$, to explicit a bijection between
ad-nilpotent ideals $i$ of the Borel subalgebra such that the cardinality of
$I_i$ is equal to $r$ and the Dyck paths of length $2l+2$ having $r$ occurence
"udu". We obtain also a duality between antichains of cardinality $p$ and $l-p$
in the set of positive roots.
