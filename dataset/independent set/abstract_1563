In this work, we discovered a fundamental connection between selection for
protein stability and emergence of preferred structures of proteins. Using
standard exact 3-dimensional lattice model we evolve sequences starting from
random ones and determining exact native structure after each mutation.
Acceptance of mutations is biased to select for stable proteins. We found that
certain structures, wonderfold, are independently discovered numerous times as
native states of stable proteins in many unrelated runs of selection. Diversity
of sequences that fold into wonderfold structures gives rise to superfamilies,
i.e. sets of dissimilar sequences that fold into the same or very similar
structures. Wonderfolds appear to be the most designable structures out of
complete set of compact lattice proteins. Furthermore, proteins having
wondefolds as their native structure tend to be most thermostable among all
evolved proteins. This effect is purely due to the favorable geometric
properties of wonderfolds and, thus, dominates any dependence on sequences. The
present work establishes a model of prebiotic structure selection, which
identifies dominant structural patterns emerging upon optimization of proteins
for survival in hot environment. Convergently discovered prebiotic initial
superfamilies with wonderfold structures could have served as a seed for
subsequent biological evolution involving gene duplications and divergence.
