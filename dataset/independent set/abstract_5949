In this paper we consider a viscoelastic string whose deformation is
controlled at one end. We study the relations and the controllability of the
couples traction/velocity and traction/deformation and we show that the first
couple behaves very like as in the purely elastic case, while new phenomena
appears when studying the couple of the traction and the deformation. Namely,
while traction and velocity are independent (for large time), traction and
deformation are related at each time but the relation is not so strict. In fact
we prove that an arbitrary number of "Fourier" components of the traction and,
independently, of the deformation can be assigned at any time.
