The dynamics of two interacting spins coupled to separate bosonic baths is
studied. An analytical solution in Born approximation for arbitrary spectral
density functions of the bosonic environments is found. It is shown that in the
non-Markovian cases concurrence "lives" longer or reaches greater values.
