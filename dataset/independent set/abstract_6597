It is shown how unbound electron wave functions can be expanded in a suitably
chosen localized basis sets for any desired range of energies. In particular,
we focus on the use of gaussian basis sets, commonly used in first-principles
codes. The possible usefulness of these basis sets in a first-principles
description of field emission or scanning tunneling microscopy at large bias is
illustrated by studying a simpler related phenomenon: The lifetime of an
electron in a H atom subjected to a strong electric field.
