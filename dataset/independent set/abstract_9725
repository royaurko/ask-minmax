From an algebraic construction of the mKdV hierarchy we observe that the
space component of the Lax operator play a role of an universal algebraic
object. This fact induces the universality of a gauge transformation that
relates two field configurations of a given member of the hierarchy. Such gauge
transformation generates the Backlund transformation (BT). In this paper we
propose a systematic construction of Backlund Transformation for the entire
mKdV hierarchy form the known Type-II BT of the sinh-Gordon theory.
  We explicitly construct the BT of the first few integrable models associated
to positive and negative grade-time evolutions. Solutions of these
transformations for several cases describing the transition from vacuum-vacuum
and the vacuum to one-soliton solutions which determines the value for the
auxiliary field and the the Backlund parameter respectively, independently of
the model. The same follows for the scattering of two one-soliton solutions.
The resultant delay is determined by a condition independent of the model
considered.
