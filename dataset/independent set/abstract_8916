A real $x$ is $\Delta^1_1$-Kurtz random ($\Pi^1_1$-Kurtz random) if it is in
no closed null $\Delta^1_1$ set ($\Pi^1_1$ set). We show that there is a cone
of $\Pi^1_1$-Kurtz random hyperdegrees. We characterize lowness for
$\Delta^1_1$-Kurtz randomness as being $\Delta^1_1$-dominated and
$\Delta^1_1$-semi-traceable.
