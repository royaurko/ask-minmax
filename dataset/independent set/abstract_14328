We consider integrable models, or in general any model defined by an
$R$-matrix, on random surfaces, which are discretized using random Manhattan
lattices. The set of random Manhattan lattices is defined as the set dual to
the lattice random surfaces embedded on a regular d-dimensional lattice. They
can also be associated with the random graphs of multiparticle scattering
nodes. As an example we formulate a random matrix model where the partition
function reproduces the annealed average of the XXZ Heisenberg model over all
random Manhattan lattices. A technique is presented which reduces the random
matrix integration in partition function to an integration over their
eigenvalues.
