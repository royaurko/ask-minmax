Let $(X,T)$ be a topological dynamical system. A pair of points $(x,y)\in
X^2$ is called Banach proximal if for any $\epsilon>0$, the set
$\{n\in\mathbb{Z}:\ d(T^nx,T^ny)<\epsilon\}$ has Banach density one. We study
the structure of the Banach proximal relation. An useful tool is the notion of
the support of a topological dynamical system. We show that a dynamical system
is strongly proximal if and only if every pair in $X^2$ is Banach proximal. A
subset $S$ of $X$ is Banach scrambled if every two distinct points in $S$ form
a Banach proximal pair but not asymptotic. We construct a dynamical system with
the whole space being a Banach scrambled set. Even though the Banach proximal
relation of the full shift is of first category, it has a dense Mycielski
invariant Banach scrambled set. We also show that for an interval map it is
Li-Yorke chaotic if and only if it has a Cantor Banach scrambled set.
