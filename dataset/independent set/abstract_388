Maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) are used to encode conditional independence
relations in DAG models with hidden variables. Different MAGs may represent the
same set of conditional independences and are called Markov equivalent. This
paper considers MAGs without undirected edges and shows conditions under which
an arrow in a MAG can be reversed or interchanged with a bi-directed edge so as
to yield a Markov equivalent MAG.
