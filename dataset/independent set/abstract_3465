This paper introduces the notions of independence and conditional
independence in valuation-based systems (VBS). VBS is an axiomatic framework
capable of representing many different uncertainty calculi. We define
independence and conditional independence in terms of factorization of the
joint valuation. The definitions of independence and conditional independence
in VBS generalize the corresponding definitions in probability theory. Our
definitions apply not only to probability theory, but also to Dempster-Shafer's
belief-function theory, Spohn's epistemic-belief theory, and Zadeh's
possibility theory. In fact, they apply to any uncertainty calculi that fit in
the framework of valuation-based systems.
