We propose a new consistent method to test of the distance-duality (DD)
relation which related angular diameter distances (DA) to the luminosity
distances (DL) in a cosmology-independent way. In order to avoid any bias
brought by redshift incoincidence between galaxy clusters and Type Ia Supernave
(SNe Ia), as well as to ensure the integrity of the galaxy clusters samples, we
obtain the luminosity distance of a certain SN Ia point at the same redshift of
the corresponding galaxy cluster by interpolating from the nearby SNe Ia. With
the observational data at the same redshifts of the angular diameter distances
from the complete 38 galaxy cluster sample for the spherical model and the
corrected luminosity distances interpolated from the Union2 set, we find that
$\eta \equiv {D_L}{(1+z)}^{-2}/{D_A}=1$ is satisfied within $2\sigma$
confidence level for various parameterizations of $\eta(z)$, which are more
stringent than previous testing results without considering redshift bias.
