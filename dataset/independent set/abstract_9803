For a system of N qubits, spanning a Hilbert space of dimension d=2^N, it is
known that there exists d+1 mutually unbiased bases. Different construction
algorithms exist, and it is remarkable that different methods lead to sets of
bases with different properties as far as separability is concerned. Here we
derive the four sets of nine bases for three qubits, and show how they are
unitarily related. We also briefly discuss the four-qubit case, give the
entanglement structure of sixteen sets of bases,and show some of them, and
their interrelations, as examples. The extension of the method to the general
case of N qubits is outlined.
