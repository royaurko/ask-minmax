We prove concentration results for $\ell_p^n$ operator norms of rectangular
random matrices and eigenvalues of self-adjoint random matrices. The random
matrices we consider have bounded entries which are independent, up to a
possible self-adjointness constraint. Our results are based on an isoperimetric
inequality for product spaces due to Talagrand.
