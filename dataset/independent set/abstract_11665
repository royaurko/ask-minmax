We interpret a normal surface in a (singular) three-manifold in terms of the
homology of a chain complex. This allows us to study the relation between
normal surfaces and their quadrilateral co-ordinates. Specifically, we give a
proof of an (unpublished) observation independently given by Casson and
Rubinstein saying that quadrilaterals determine a normal surface up to vertex
linking spheres. We also characterise the quadrilateral coordinates that
correspond to a normal surface in a (possibly ideal) triangulation.
