In this paper we give a new characterization of simple sets of polynomials B
with the property that the set of B-multiplier sequences contains all
Q-multiplier sequence for every simple set Q. We characterize sequences of real
numbers which are multiplier sequences for every simple set Q, and obtain some
results toward the partitioning of the set of classical multiplier sequences.
