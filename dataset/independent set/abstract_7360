We present a set of parton distribution functions (PDFs), based on the
NNPDF2.3 set, which includes a photon PDF, and QED contributions to parton
evolution. We describe the implementation of the combined QCD+QED evolution in
the NNPDF framework. We then provide a first determination of the full set of
PDFs based on deep-inelastic scattering data and LHC data for W and Z/gamma*
Drell-Yan production, using leading-order QED and NLO or NNLO QCD. We compare
the ensuing NNPDF2.3QED PDF set to the older MRST2004QED set. We perform a
preliminary investigation of the phenomenological implications of NNPDF2.3QED:
specifically, photon-induced corrections to direct photon production at HERA,
and high-mass dilepton and W pair production at the LHC.
