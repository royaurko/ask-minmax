Several popular extensions of the Standard Model predict extra vector fields
that transform as triplets under the gauge group SU(2)_L. These multiplets
contain Z' and W' bosons, with masses and couplings related by gauge
invariance. We review some model-independent results about these new vector
bosons, with emphasis on di-lepton and lepton-plus-missing-energy signals at
the LHC.
