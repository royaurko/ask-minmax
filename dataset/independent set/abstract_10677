The construction of a massive (~ 40 ton) spherical antennas for gravitational
wave astronomy has been proposed by a number of groups worldwide. Summed over
all five quadrupole modes, the sphere has a direction-independent cross
section, permitting full-sky coverage. Combined with its enhanced sensitivity
due to its multi-nature and increased mass, sphereical detectors make ideal
instruments for observational astronomy. Numerical calculations have shown that
gravitational-wave signals from coalescing neutron star binaries and dynamic
instabilities of rapidly rotating stars in the Virgo cluster can be resolved
with a spherical antenna with a near quantum-limited sensitivity.
