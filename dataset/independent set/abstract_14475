We consider Lagrange interpolation on the set of finitely many intervals.
This problem is closely related to the least deviating polynomial from zero on
such sets. We will obtain lower and upper estimates for the corresponding
Lebesgue constant. The case of two intervals of equal lengths is simpler, and
an explicit construction for two non-symmetric intervals will be given only in
a special case.
