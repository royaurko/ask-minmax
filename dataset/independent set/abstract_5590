We propose a strategy for approximating Pareto optimal sets based on the
global analysis framework proposed by Smale (Dynamical systems, New York, 1973,
pp. 531-544). The method highlights and exploits the underlying manifold
structure of the Pareto sets, approximating Pareto optima by means of
simplicial complexes. The method distinguishes the hierarchy between singular
set, Pareto critical set and stable Pareto critical set, and can handle the
problem of superposition of local Pareto fronts, occurring in the general
nonconvex case. Furthermore, a quadratic convergence result in a suitable
set-wise sense is proven and tested in a number of numerical examples.
