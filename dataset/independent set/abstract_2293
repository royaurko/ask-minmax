The velocity distribution of inelastic granular gas is examined numerically
on two dimensional hard disk system in nearly elastic regime using molecular
dynamical simulations. The system is prepared initially in the equilibrium
state with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, then after a several inelastic
collisions per particle, the system falls in the state that the Boltzmann
equation predicts with the stationary form of velocity distribution. It turns
out, however, that due to the velocity correlation the form of the distribution
function does not stay time-independent, but is gradually returning to the
Maxwellian immediately after the initial transient till the clustering
instability sets in. It shows that, even in the homogeneous cooling state, the
velocity correlation in the inelastic system invalidates the assumption of
molecular chaos and the prediction by the Boltzmann equation fails.
