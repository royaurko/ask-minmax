This paper establishes a blow-up criterion of strong solutions to the
two-dimensional compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. The criterion
depends on the density, but is independent of the velocity and the magnetic
field. More precisely, once the strong solutions blow up, the $L^{\infty}$-norm
for the density tends to infinity. In particular, the vacuum in the solutions
is allowed.
