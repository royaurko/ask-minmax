The trace set of a Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ ist the set of length of closed
geodesics in the surface $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$. Luo and Sarnak showed
that the trace set of a cofinite arithmetic Fuchsian group satisfies the
bounded clustering property. Sarnak then conjectured that the B-C property
actually characterizes arithmetic Fuchsian groups. Schmutz stated the even
stronger conjecture that a cofinite Fuchsian group is arithmetic if its trace
set has linear growth. He proposed a proof of this conjecture in the case when
the group $\Gamma$ contains at least one parabolic element, but unfortunately
this proof contains a gap. In the present paper we point out this gap and we
prove Sarnak's conjecture under the assumption that the Fuchsian group $\Gamma$
contains parabolic elements.
