Let M be a smooth finite-dimensional manifold, G a Lie group, and \Phi:G x M
--> M a smooth action. Consider the following mapping $\phi: C^{\infty}(M,G)
--> C^{\infty}(M,M)$, defined by $\phi(\alpha)(x) = \alpha(x)\cdot x$, for
$\alpha\in C^{\infty}(M,G)$ and $x\in M$. In this paper we describe the
structure of inverse images of elements of $C^{\infty}(M,M)$ under $\phi$ for
$\dim G=1$, i.e. when $G$ is either $R^1$ or $S^1$. As an application we obtain
a new proof of the well-known theorem by M. Newman concerning the interior of
the fixed point set of a Lie group action.
