Threshold enhancements like the X(4660) and depletion effects as the X(4260)
are listed as c-cbar resonances in the Particle Data Group tables. We will
discuss these observations, and present a list of further c-cbar enhancements,
which are more likely to represent true vector charmonium excitations. We will
furthermore discuss the importance of the observed Z resonances, viz. Z(4050),
Z(4250), and Z(4430), for the family of charm-strange mesons. Another piece of
very important information that can be extracted from the present data is the
universal, flavor independent frequency of 190 MeV for mesons, due to the
quark-antiquark oscillations within the glue environment. Finally, we will show
hints from the data at a further flavor-independent quantity, having a value of
76 +-2 MeV, the origin of which is not yet understood.
