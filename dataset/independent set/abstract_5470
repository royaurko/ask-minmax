This paper introduces semiopen and semiclosed soft sets in soft topological
spaces. The notions of interior and closure are generalized using these sets. A
detail study is carried out on properties of semiopen, semiclosed soft sets,
semi interior and semi closure of a soft set in a soft topological space.
Various forms of soft functions, like semicontinuous, irresolute, semiopen soft
functions are introduced and characterized. Further soft semicompactness,soft
semiconnectedness and soft semiseparation axioms are introduced and studied.
