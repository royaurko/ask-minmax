Let $f$ be an orientation preserving homeomorphism of $S^2$ which has a
(nontrivial) continuum $X$ as a minimal set. Then there are exactly two
connected components of $S^2\setminus X$ which are left invariant by $f$ and
all the others are wandering. The Carath\'eodory rotation number of an
invariant component is irrational.
