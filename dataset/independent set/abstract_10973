Neutrinos can scatter electrons in water detectors through their magnetic
moments and charge radii in addition to the charged and neutral currents
channels. The recent solar neutrino charged current event rates announced by
SNO with the earlier solar and atmospheric neutrino observations from
Super-Kamiokande allows us to put upper bounds of $\mu <10^{-9} \mu_B$ on
neutrino magnetic moments and $<r^2> < 10^{-31} cm^2$ on the neutrino charge
radii. For the electron and muon neutrinos these bounds are comparable with
existing bounds but for tau neutrinos these bounds are three orders of
magnitude more stringent than earlier terrestrial bounds. These bounds are
independent of any specific model of neutrino oscillations.
