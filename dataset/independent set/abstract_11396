A light reflection technique is used to measure quantitatively the surface
elevation of Faraday waves. The performed measurements cover a wide parameter
range of driving frequencies and sample viscosities. In the capillary wave
regime the bifurcation diagrams exhibit a frequency independent scaling
proportional to the wavelength. We also provide numerical simulations of the
full Navier-Stokes equations, which are in quantitative agreement up to
supercritical drive amplitudes of 20%. The validity of an existing perturbation
analysis is found to be limited to 2.5% overcriticaly.
