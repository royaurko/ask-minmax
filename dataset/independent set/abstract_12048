The well known Andrews-Curtis Conjecture [2] is still open. In this paper, we
establish its finite version by describing precisely the connected components
of the Andrews-Curtis graphs of finite groups. This finite version has
independent importance for computational group theory. It also resolves a
question asked in [5] and shows that a computation in finite groups cannot lead
to a counterexample to the classical conjecture, as suggested in [5].
