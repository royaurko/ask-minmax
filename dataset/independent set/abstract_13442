The mechanisms of solid-state electron transport (ETp) via a monolayer of
immobilized Azurin (Az) was examined by conducting probe atomic force
microscopy (CP-AFM), both as function of temperature (248 - 373K) and of
applied tip force (6-12 nN). By varying both temperature and force in CP-AFM,
we find that the ETp mechanism can alter with a change in the force applied via
the tip to the proteins. As the applied force increases, ETp via Az changes
from temperature-independent to thermally activated at high temperatures. This
is in contrast to the Cu-depleted form of Az (apo-Az), where increasing the
applied force causes only small quantitative effects, that fit with a decrease
in electrode spacing. At low force ETp via holo-Az is temperature-independent
and thermally activated via apo-Az. This observation agrees with
macroscopic-scale measurements, thus confirming that the difference in ETp
dependence on temperature between holo- and apo-Az is an inherent one that may
reflect a difference in rigidity between the two forms. An important
implication of these results, which depend on CP-AFM measurements over a
significant temperature range, is that for ETp measurements on floppy systems,
such as proteins, the stress applied to the sample should be kept constant or,
at least controlled during measurement.
