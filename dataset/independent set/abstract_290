This paper describes an approach that uses flat-spacetime dimension
estimators to estimate the manifold dimension of causal sets that can be
faithfully embedded into curved spacetimes. The approach is invariant under
coarse graining and can be implemented independently of any specific curved
spacetime. Results are given based on causal sets generated by random
sprinklings into conformally flat spacetimes in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions, as well
as one generated by a percolation dynamics.
