We show that the one-loop QCD correction to deeply-virtual Compton scattering
can be factorized into the finite perturbative contributions and the
collinearly-divergent terms, which correspond to the matrix elements of the
off-forward parton distributions. As a by-product, we obtain the
next-to-leading order coefficient functions in the generalized operator product
expansion of two vector currents.
