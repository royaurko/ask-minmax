We study several basic dispersive models with random periodic initial data
such that the different Fourier modes are independent random variables.
Motivated by the vast Physics literature on related topics, we then study how
much the Fourier modes of the solution at later times remain decorrelated. Our
results are sensitive to the resonances associated with the dispersive relation
and to the particular choice of the initial data.
