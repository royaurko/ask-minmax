A coloring of a matroid is an assignment of colors to the elements of its
ground set. We restrict to proper colorings - those for which elements of the
same color form an independent set. Seymour proved that a $k$-colorable matroid
is also colorable from any lists of size $k$. We generalize this theorem to the
case when lists have still fixed sizes, but not necessarily equal. For any
fixed size of lists assignment $\ell$, we prove that, if a matroid is colorable
from a particular lists of size $\ell$, then it is colorable from any lists of
size $\ell$. This gives an explicit necessary and sufficient condition for a
matroid to be list colorable from any lists of a fixed size. As an application,
we show how to use our condition to derive several base exchange properties.
