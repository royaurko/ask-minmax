In this paper we describe the analytic and numerical evaluation of the
$\gamma\gamma\to \gamma Z$ process cross section and the $Z\to
\gamma\gamma\gamma$ decay rate within the SANC system multi-channel approach at
the one-loop accuracy level with all masses taking into account. The
corresponding package for numeric calculations is presented. For checking of
the results correctness we make a comparison with other independent
calculations.
