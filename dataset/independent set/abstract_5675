We consider a local moment which is coupled by a non-random Kondo $J$ to a
band of conduction electrons in a random potential. We prove an analog of
Anderson's theorem in a large-N limit of this model. The theorem states that
when the disorder is weak, the disorder-averaged low-temperature thermodynamics
is independent of the strength of the disorder; remarkably, it further states
that fluctuation effects in the long-time limit are {\it independent even of
the realization of the disorder}. We discuss the relationship of this theorem
to theoretical and experimental studies of similar problems.
