A quasi-schemoid is a small category with a particular partition of the set
of morphisms. We define a homotopy relation on the category of quasi-schemoids
and study its fundamental properties. As a homotopy invariant, the homotopy set
of self-homotopy equivalences on a quasi-schemoid is introduced. The main
theorem enables us to deduce that the homotopy invariant for the quasi-schemoid
induced by a finite group is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the given
group.
