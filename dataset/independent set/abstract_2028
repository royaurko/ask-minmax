A multi-hop synchronous wirelss network is said to be unknown if the nodes
have no knowledge of the topology. A basic task in wireless network is that of
broadcasting a message (created by a fixed source node) to all nodes of the
network. The multi-broadcast that consists in performing a set of r independent
broadcasts. In this paper, we study the completion and the termination time of
distributed protocols for both the (single) broadcast and the multi-broadcast
operations on unknown networks as functions of the number of nodes n, the
maximum eccentricity D, the maximum in-degree Delta, and the congestion c of
the networks. We establish new connections between these operations and some
combinatorial concepts, such as selective families, strongly-selective families
(also known as superimposed codes), and pairwise r-different families. Such
connections, combined with a set of new lower and upper bounds on the size of
the above families, allow us to derive new lower bounds and new distributed
protocols for the broadcast and multi-broadcast operations. In particular, our
upper bounds are almost tight and improve exponentially over the previous
bounds when D and Delta are polylogarithmic in n. Network topologies having
``small'' eccentricity and ``small'' degree (such as bounded-degree expanders)
are often used in practice to achieve efficient communication.
