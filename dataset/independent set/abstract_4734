We propose a model of opinion dynamics which describes two major types of
social influence -- conformity and independence. Conformity in our model is
described by the so called outflow dynamics (known as Sznajd model). According
to sociologists' suggestions, we introduce also a second type of social
influence, known in social psychology as independence. Various social
experiments have shown that the level of conformity depends on the society. We
introduce this level as a parameter of the model and show that there is a
continuous phase transition between conformity and independence.
