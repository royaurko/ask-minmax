This paper concerns the set $\hat{\mathcal{M}}$ of pseudo-Anosovs which occur
as monodromies of fibrations on manifolds obtained from the magic 3-manifold
$N$ by Dehn filling three cusps with a mild restriction. We prove that for each
$g$ (resp. $g \not\equiv 0 \pmod{6}$), the minimum among dilatations of
elements (resp. elements with orientable invariant foliations) of
$\hat{\mathcal{M}}$ defined on a closed surface $\varSigma_g$ of genus $g$ is
achieved by the monodromy of some $\varSigma_g$-bundle over the circle obtained
from $N(\tfrac{3}{-2})$ or $N(\tfrac{1}{-2})$ by Dehn filling two cusps. These
minimizers are the same ones identified by Hironaka, Aaber-Dunfiled,
Kin-Takasawa independently. In the case $g \equiv 6 \pmod{12}$ we find a new
family of pseudo-Anosovs defined on $\varSigma_g$ with orientable invariant
foliations obtained from N(-6) or N(4) by Dehn filling two cusps. We prove that
if $\delta_g^+$ is the minimal dilatation of pseudo-Anosovs with orientable
invariant foliations defined on $\varSigma_g$, then $$ \limsup_{\substack{g
\equiv 6 \pmod{12} g \to \infty}} g \log \delta^+_g \le 2 \log \delta(D_5)
\approx 1.0870,$$ where $\delta(D_n)$ is the minimal dilatation of
pseudo-Anosovs on an $n$-punctured disk. We also study monodromies of
fibrations on N(1). We prove that if $\delta_{1,n}$ is the minimal dilatation
of pseudo-Anosovs on a genus 1 surface with $n$ punctures, then $$ \limsup_{n
\to \infty} n \log \delta_{1,n} \le 2 \log \delta(D_4) \approx 1.6628. $$
