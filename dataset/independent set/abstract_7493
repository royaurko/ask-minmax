A rigorous and simple perturbative proof of Luttinger's theorem is sketched
for Fermi liquids in two and three dimensions. It is proved that in the finite
volume, the quasi-particle density is independent of the interaction strength.
The thermodynamic limit is then controlled to all orders in perturbation
theory.
