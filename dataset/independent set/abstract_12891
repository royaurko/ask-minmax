We propose a class of waveguides operating near cutoff such that
electromagnetic energy is mainly bound to the cladding rather than the
dielectric core to achieve subdiffraction confinement of light. The cladding
incorporates an alternating stack of thin films that exhibit uniaxial form
birefringence with a high contrast between the effective principal dielectric
constants. In contrast to conventional dielectric waveguides, the effective
modal length for the fundamental mode of the proposed waveguide diverges at a
much slower rate for core thicknesses less than a twentieth of the illumination
wavelength, and is comparable to that attainable for plasmonic waveguides. The
proposed waveguide can be exploited for important applications such as
optoelectronic integration, and the fundamental mode exhibits a near-uniform
spatial field distribution potentially allowing for position-independent
spontaneous emission enhancement effects.
