A new class of distributional transformations is introduced, characterized by
equations relating function weighted expectations of test functions on a given
distribution to expectations of the transformed distribution on the test
function's higher order derivatives. The class includes the size and zero bias
transformations, and when specializing to weighting by polynomial functions,
relates distributional families closed under independent addition, and in
particular the infinitely divisible distributions, to the family of
transformations induced by their associated orthogonal polynomial systems. For
these families, generalizing a well known property of size biasing, sums of
independent variables are transformed by replacing summands chosen according to
a multivariate distribution on its index set by independent variables whose
distributions are transformed by members of that same family. A variety of the
transformations associated with the classical orthogonal polynomial systems
have as fixed points the original distribution, or a member of the same family
with different parameter.
