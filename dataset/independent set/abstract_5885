bnlearn is an R package which includes several algorithms for learning the
structure of Bayesian networks with either discrete or continuous variables.
Both constraint-based and score-based algorithms are implemented, and can use
the functionality provided by the snow package to improve their performance via
parallel computing. Several network scores and conditional independence
algorithms are available for both the learning algorithms and independent use.
Advanced plotting options are provided by the Rgraphviz package.
