We consider infinite particle system on the positive half-line moving
independently of each other. When a particle hits the boundary it immediately
disappears, and the boundary moves to the right on some fixed quantity
(particle size). We study the speed of the boundary movement (growth). Possible
applications - dynamics of the traffic jam growth, growth of thrombus, epitaxy.
Nontrivial mathematics is related to the correlation between particle dynamics
and boundary growth.
