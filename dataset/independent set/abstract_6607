We introduce the idea of (s,t)-closure and delta-sets and show that
(s,t)-closed beta-sets which are contained set-wise in (s,t)-closed delta-sets
are also contained partition-wise. This implies the maximal (s,t)-core
partition theorem of Olsson and Stanton. Along the way, we reprove the
(s,s+1)-core case, originally proved by Olsson and Stanton, using new
techniques, and several lemmas and propositions regarding the containment of
partitions are presented as well. Finally, we study how these apply to
partitions which are T-core.
