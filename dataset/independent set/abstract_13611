A two-loop calculation of the renormalization group $\beta$--function in a
momentum subtraction scheme with massive quarks is presented using the
background field formalism. The results have been obtained by using a set of
new generalized recurrence relations proposed recently by one of the contributors
(O.V.T.). The behavior of the mass dependent effective coupling constant is
investigated in detail. Compact analytic results are presented.
