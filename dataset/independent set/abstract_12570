We give a simple sufficient condition for Quinn's "bordism-type" spectra to
be weakly equivalent to commutative symmetric ring spectra. We also show that
the symmetric signature is (up to weak equivalence) a monoidal transformation
between symmetric monoidal functors, which implies that the Sullivan-Ranicki
orientation of topological bundles is represented by a ring map between
commutative symmetric ring spectra. In the course of proving these statements
we give a new description of symmetric L theory which may be of independent
interest.
