The renormalization group is used to sum the leading-log (LL) contributions
to the effective action for a large constant external gauge field in terms of
the one-loop renormalization group (RG) function beta, the next-to-leading-log
(NLL) contributions in terms of the two-loop RG function etc. The log
independent pieces are not determined by the RG equation, but can be fixed by
the anomaly in the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Similar considerations
can be applied to the effective potential V for a scalar field phi; here the
log independent pieces are fixed by the condition V'(phi=v)=0.
