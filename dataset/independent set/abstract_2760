We study pure phase damping of two qubits due to fluctuating fields. As
frequently employed, decoherence is thus described in terms of random unitary
(RU) dynamics, i.e., a convex mixture of unitary transformations. Based on a
separation of the dynamics into an average Hamiltonian and a noise channel, we
are able to analytically determine the evolution of both entanglement and
purity. This enables us to characterize the dynamics in a concurrence-purity
(CP) diagram: we find that RU phase damping dynamics sets constraints on
accessible regions in the CP plane. We show that initial state and dynamics
contribute to final entanglement independently.
