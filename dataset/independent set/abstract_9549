The Regge trajectories, upon which string theory is based, behave as rigid
rotators rather than vibrating strings. The same relation, between the angular
momentum, and the square of the mass, can be found in gravity, the electroweak,
and strong interactions. The angle deficit for cosmic strings is shown to be an
angle excess that is related to the increase of the circumference of a
uniformly rotating disc. Schr\"odinger's time independent equation with a
centrifugal barrier gives an automorphic function that can be constructed as
the ratio of its two independent solutions for values of the angular momentum
lying outside of their positive, integer values. If the fixed points 0 and
$\infty$ in the z-plane correspond to $-i$ and $+i$ in the $\omega$-plane, then
elliptic substitutions tessellate the $\omega$-plane in the form of cresents,
while if the fixed points correspond to -1 and +1 in the $\omega$-plane are
source and sink, just like the lines of force between positive and negative
charges. The unit disc undergoes a stretching by a Lorentz transform.
