In this paper, we introduce model-independent data analysis procedures for
identifying inelastic WIMP-nucleus scattering as well as for reconstructing the
mass and the mass splitting of inelastic WIMPs simultaneously and separately.
Our simulations show that, with O(50) observed WIMP signals from one
experiment, one could already distinguish the inelastic WIMP scattering
scenarios from the elastic one. By combining two or more data sets with
positive signals, the WIMP mass and the mass splitting could even be
reconstructed with statistical uncertainties of less than a factor of two.
