Noether's theorem and the invariances of the Willmore functional are used to
derive conservation laws that are satisfied by the critical points of the
Willmore energy subject to generic constraints. We recover in particular
previous results independently obtained by R. Capovilla and J. Guven, and by T.
Riviere. Several examples are considered in details.
