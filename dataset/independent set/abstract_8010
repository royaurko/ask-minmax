A stratification of a singular set, e.g. an algebraic or analytic variety,
is, roughly, a partition of it into manifolds so that these manifolds fit
together "regularly". A classical theorem of Whitney says that any complex
analytic set has a stratification. This result was extended by Lojasiewicz to
real (semi)analytic sets. In this paper we present a short geometric proof of
existence of stratifications based on Thom's transversality theorem and
Milnor's curve selection lemma and not relying on difficult results of
Lojasiewicz.
