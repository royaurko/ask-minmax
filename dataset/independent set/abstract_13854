We present a family of Bell inequalities involving only two measurement
settings of each party for N>2 qubits. Our inequalities include all the
standard ones with fewer than N qubits and thus gives a natural generalization.
It is shown that all the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states violate the
inequalities maximally, with an amount that grows exponentially as
2^{{(N-2)}/2}. The inequalities are also violated by some states that do
satisfy all the standard Bell inequalities. Remarkably, our results yield in an
efficient and simple way an implementation of nonlocality tests of many qubits
favorably within reach of the well-established technology of linear optics.
