The problem of linear modulation classification using likelihood based
methods is considered. Asymptotic properties of most commonly used classifiers
in the literature are derived. These classifiers are based on hybrid likelihood
ratio test (HLRT) and average likelihood ratio test (ALRT), respectively. Both
a single-sensor setting and a multi-sensor setting that uses a distributed
decision fusion approach are analyzed. For a modulation classification system
using a single sensor, it is shown that HLRT achieves asymptotically vanishing
probability of error (Pe) whereas the same result cannot be proven for ALRT. In
a multi-sensor setting using soft decision fusion, conditions are derived under
which Pe vanishes asymptotically. Furthermore, the asymptotic analysis of the
fusion rule that assumes independent sensor decisions is carried out.
