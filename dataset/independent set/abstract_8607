Let f be a polynomial endomorphism of degree d>1 of C^k (k>1) which extends
to a holomorphic endomorphism of P^k. Assume that the maximal order Julia set
of f is laminated by real hypersurfaces in some open set. We show that f is
homogenous and is a polynomial lift of a Lattes endomorphism of P^{k-1}.
