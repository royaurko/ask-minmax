We discuss measures, invariant measures on definable groups, and genericity,
often in an NIP (failure of the independence property) environment. We complete
the proof of the third contributor's conjectures relating definably compact groups
$G$ in saturated $o$-minimal structures to compact Lie groups. We also prove
some other structural results about such $G$, for example the existence of a
left invariant finitely additive probability measure on definable subsets of
$G$. We finally introduce a new notion "compact domination" (domination of a
definable set by a compact space) and raise some new conjectures in the
$o$-minimal case.
