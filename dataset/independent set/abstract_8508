This paper is concerned with non-parametric estimation of the entropy in
ranked set sampling. Theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are
studied. The proposed estimator is compared with the rival estimator in simple
random sampling. The applications of the proposed estimator to the mutual
information estimation as well as estimation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence
are provided. Several Monte-Carlo simulation studies are conducted to examine
the performance of the estimator. The results are applied to the long-leaf pine
(pinus palustris) trees and the body fat percentage data sets to illustrate
applicability of theoretical results.
