We describe how substantial domain-independent language-processing systems
for French and Spanish were quickly developed by manually adapting an existing
English-language system, the SRI Core Language Engine. We explain the
adaptation process in detail, and argue that it provides a fairly general
recipe for converting a grammar-based system for English into a corresponding
one for a Romance language.
