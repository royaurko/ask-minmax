A PC based high speed silicon microstrip beam telescope consisting of several
independent modules is presented. Every module contains an AC-coupled double
sided silicon microstrip sensor and a complete set of analog and digital signal
processing electronics. A digital bus connects the modules with the DAQ PC. A
trigger logic unit coordinates the operation of all modules of the telescope.
The system architecture allows easy integration of any kind of device under
test into the data acquisition chain. Signal digitization, pedestal correction,
hit detection and zero suppression are done by hardware inside the modules, so
that the amount of data per event is reduced by a factor of 80 compared to
conventional readout systems. In combination with a two level data acquisition
scheme, this allows event rates up to 7.6 kHz. This is a factor of 40 faster
than conventional VME based beam telescopes while comparable analog performance
is maintained achieving signal to noise ratios of up to 70:1. The telescope has
been tested in the SPS testbeam at CERN. It has been adopted as the reference
instrument for testbeam studies for the ATLAS pixel detector development.
