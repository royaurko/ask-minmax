The quasiparticle lifetime and the related transport relaxation times are the
fundamental quantities which must be known in order to obtain a description of
the transport properties of the high T_c superconductors. Studies of these
quantities have been undertaken previously for the d-wave, high T_c
superconductors for the case of temperature-independent elastic impurity
scattering. However, much less is known about the temperature-dependent
inelastic scattering. Here we give a detailed description of the
characteristics of the temperature-dependent quasiparticle-quasiparticle
scattering in d-wave superconductors, and find that this process gives a
natural explanation of the rapid variation with temperature of the electrical
transport relaxation rate.
