We show that spin-polarized electron transmission across
semiconductor/superconductor (Sm/S) hybrid structures depends sensitively on
the degree of spin polarization as well as the strengths of potential and
spin-flip scattering at the interface. We demonstrate that increasing the Fermi
velocity mismatch in the Sm and S regions can lead to enhanced junction
transparency in the presence of spin polarization. We find that the Andreev
reflection amplitude at the superconducting gap energy is a robust measure of
the spin polarization magnitude, being independent of the strengths of
potential and spin-flip scattering and the Fermi velocity of the
superconductor.
