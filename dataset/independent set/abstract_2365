We present a search for the decay $B^{+} \to \tau^{+} \nu_{\tau}$ in $88.9
\times 10^{6}$ $\Upsilon(4S)$ decays recorded with the BABAR detector at the
SLAC $B$-Factory. A sample of semi-exclusive, semi-leptonic B decays ($B^{-}
\to D^{0} \ell^{-} \bar{\nu_{\ell}}X$), where $X$ is either a photon,
$\pi^{0}$, or nothing, is used to identify the daughter particles that are
associated with the other $B$ meson in each event. These particles are searched
for evidence of a one-prong leptonic $B^{+} \to \tau^{+} \nu_{\tau}$ decay. For
this data sample we set a preliminary upper limit on the branching fraction of
$\mathcal{B}(B^{+} \to \tau^{+} \nu_{\tau}) < 4.9 \times 10^{-4}$ at the 90%
confidence level. This result is then combined with a statistically independent
BABAR search for $B^{+} \to \tau^{+} \nu_{\tau}$ to give a combined preliminary
limit of $\mathcal{B}(B^{+} \to \tau^{+} \nu_{\tau}) < 4.1 \times 10^{-4}$.
