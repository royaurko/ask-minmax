We consider the set of finite random words $\mathcal A^\star$, with
independent letters drawn from a finite or infinite totally ordered alphabet
according to a general probability distribution. On a specific subset of
$\mathcal A^\star$, considering certain factorization of the words which are
labelled with the ranks, base on the lexicographical order, we prove that the
normalized position of the ranks of factors, are uniform, when the length of
the word goes to infinity.
