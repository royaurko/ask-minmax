Query answering in Answer Set Programming (ASP) is usually solved by
computing (a subset of) the cautious consequences of a logic program. This task
is computationally very hard, and there are programs for which computing
cautious consequences is not viable in reasonable time. However, current ASP
solvers produce the (whole) set of cautious consequences only at the end of
their computation. This paper reports on strategies for computing cautious
consequences, also introducing anytime algorithms able to produce sound answers
during the computation.
