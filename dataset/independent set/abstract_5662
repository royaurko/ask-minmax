This letter presents a theoretical derivation of an estimate for a radio
source jet kinetic luminosity. The expression yields jet powers that are
quantitatively similar to a more sophisticated empirical relation published by
the Willott, Blundell and Rawlings at Oxford. The formula allows one to
estimate the jet kinetic luminosity from the measurement of the optically thin
radio lobe emission in quasars and radio galaxies. Motivated by recent X-ray
observation, the derivation assumes that most of the energy in the lobes is in
plasma thermal energy with a negligible contribution from magnetic energy (not
equipartition). The close agreement of the two independent expressions makes
the veracity of these estimates seem very plausible.
