We derive a set of gauge independent gap equations for Higgs boson and vector
boson masses for the SU(2) Higgs model in three dimensions. The solutions can
be associated with the Higgs phase and the symmetric phase, respectively. In
the Higgs phase the calculated masses are in agreement with results from
perturbation theory. In the symmetric phase a non-perturbative vector boson
mass is generated by the non-abelian gauge interactions, whose value is rather
independent of the scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. For small values of
$\lambda$ the phase transition is first-order. Its strength decreases with
increasing $\lambda$, and at a critical value $\lambda_c$ the first-order
transition changes to a crossover. Based on a perturbative matching the
three-dimensional theory is related to the four-dimensional theory at high
temperatures. The critical Higgs mass $m_H^c$, corresponding to the critical
coupling $\lambda_c$, is estimated to be below 100 GeV. The ``symmetric phase''
of the theory can be interpreted as a Higgs phase whose parameters are
determined non-perturbatively. The obtained Higgs boson and vector boson masses
are compared with recent results from lattice Monte Carlo simulations.
