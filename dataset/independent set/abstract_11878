The formalism for analysing the magnetic field distribution in Pauli limited
superconductors developed earlier is applied to the field dependence of the
vortex lattice static linewidth measured in Muon Spin Rotation ($\mu$SR)
experiments. In addition to writing analytical formulae for the static
linewidth for the vortex structure in the limit of independent vortices (i.e.
moderate magnetic fields), we use Abrikosov's analysis to describe the field
variations of the static linewidth at the approach of the superconductor to
metal transition in the limit where the critical field is determined by Pauli
depairing.
