The new notion of maturity-independent risk measures is introduced and
contrasted with the existing risk measurement concepts. It is shown, by means
of two examples, one set on a finite probability space and the other in a
diffusion framework, that, surprisingly, some of the widely utilized risk
measures cannot be used to build maturity-independent counterparts. We
construct a large class of maturity-independent risk measures and give
representative examples in both continuous- and discrete-time financial models.
