I illustrate how to define an isolated-photon cross section which is
independent of the parton-to-photon fragmentation contribution, it is infrared
safe to all orders in perturbative QCD, and it is exclusive in the kinematical
variables of the photon and of the accompanying jets. This isolation
prescription is applicable to any kind of polarized or unpolarized hard
collisions. It can also be used without any modifications in the case of two or
more isolated photons in the final state. I present results for one-photon
production in hadronic collisions, and I compare them with existing results
obtained in the framework of the conventional cone approach.
