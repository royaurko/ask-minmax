We introduce a semi-schematic mode-coupling model to describe the slow
dynamics in molecular liquids, retaining explicitly only the description of the
center of mass degrees of freedom. Angular degrees of freedom are condensed in
a q-vector independent coupling parameter. We compare the time and q-dependence
of the density fluctuation correlators with numerical data from a 250 ns long
molecular dynamics simulation. Notwithstanding the choice of a network-forming
liquid as a model for comparing theory and simulation, the model describes the
main static and dynamic features of the relaxation in a broad q-vector range.
