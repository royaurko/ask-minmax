$M$-ary signal transmission over AWGN channel with additive $Q$-ary
interference where the sequence of i.i.d. interference symbols is known
causally at the transmitter is considered. Shannon's theorem for channels with
side information at the transmitter is used to formulate the capacity of the
channel. It is shown that by using at most $MQ-Q+1$ out of $M^Q$ input symbols
of the \emph{associated} channel, the capacity is achievable. For the special
case where the Gaussian noise power is zero, a sufficient condition, which is
independent of interference, is given for the capacity to be $\log_2 M$ bits
per channel use. The problem of maximization of the transmission rate under the
constraint that the channel input given any current interference symbol is
uniformly distributed over the channel input alphabet is investigated. For this
setting, the general structure of a communication system with optimal precoding
is proposed. The extension of the proposed precoding scheme to continuous
channel input alphabet is also investigated.
