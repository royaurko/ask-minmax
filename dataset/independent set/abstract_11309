In this paper we develop Poisson geometry for non-commutative algebras. This
generalizes the bi-symplectic geometry which was recently, and independently,
introduced by Crawley-Boevey, Etingof and Ginzburg.
  Our (quasi-)Poisson brackets induce classical (quasi-)Poisson brackets on
representation spaces. As an application we show that the moduli spaces of
representations associated to the deformed multiplicative preprojective
algebras recently introduced by Crawley-Boevey and Shaw carry a natural Poisson
structure.
