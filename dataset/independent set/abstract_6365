We study a model-independent parameterization of the vector pion form factor
that arises from the constraints of analyticity and unitarity. Our description
should be suitable up to s^(1/2) ~ 1.2 GeV and allows a model-independent
determination of the mass of the rho(770) resonance. We analyse the
experimental data on tau^- -> pion^- pion^0 nu_tau and e^+ e^- -> pion^+ pion^-
in this framework, and its consequences on the low-energy observables worked
out by chiral perturbation theory. An evaluation of the two pion contribution
to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a_{mu}, and to the fine structure
constant, alpha(M_Z^2), is also performed.
