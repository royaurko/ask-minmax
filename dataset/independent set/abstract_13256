The differential and partially integrated cross sections are considered for
bremsstrahlung from high-energy electrons in atomic field with the exact
account of this field. The consideration exploits the quasiclassical electron
Green's function and wave functions in an external electric field. It is shown
that the Coulomb corrections to the differential cross section are very
susceptible to screening. Nevertheless, the Coulomb corrections to the cross
section summed up over the final-electron states are independent of screening
in the leading approximation over a small parameter $1/mr_{scr}$ ($r_{scr}$ is
a screening radius, $m$ is the electron mass, $\hbar=c=1$). Bremsstrahlung from
an electron beam of the finite size on heavy nucleus is considered as well.
Again, the Coulomb corrections to the differential probability are very
susceptible to the beam shape, while those to the probability integrated over
momentum transfer are independent of it, apart from the trivial factor, which
is the electron-beam density at zero impact parameter. For the Coulomb
corrections to the bremsstrahlung spectrum, the next-to-leading terms with
respect to the parameters $m/\epsilon$ ($\epsilon$ is the electron energy) and
$1/mr_{scr}$ are obtained.
