We develop correlated random measures, random measures where the atom weights
can exhibit a flexible pattern of dependence, and use them to develop powerful
hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric models. Hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric
models are usually built from completely random measures, a Poisson-process
based construction in which the atom weights are independent. Completely random
measures imply strong independence assumptions in the corresponding
hierarchical model, and these assumptions are often misplaced in real-world
settings. Correlated random measures address this limitation. They model
correlation within the measure by using a Gaussian process in concert with the
Poisson process. With correlated random measures, for example, we can develop a
latent feature model for which we can infer both the properties of the latent
features and their dependency pattern. We develop several other examples as
well. We study a correlated random measure model of pairwise count data. We
derive an efficient variational inference algorithm and show improved
predictive performance on large data sets of documents, web clicks, and
electronic health records.
