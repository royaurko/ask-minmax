In the paper "Constraint Quantization of Open String in Background $B$ field
and Noncommutative D-brane", it is claimed that the boundary conditions lead to
an infinite set of secondary constraints and Dirac brackets result in a
non-commutative Poisson structure for D-brain. Here we show that contrary to
the arguments in that paper, the set of secondary constraints on the boundary
is finite and the non-commutativity algebra can not be obtained by evaluating
the Dirac brackets.
