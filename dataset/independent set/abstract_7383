We present a novel approach for recognizing what we call targetable named
entities; that is, named entities in a targeted set (e.g, movies, books, TV
shows). Unlike many other NER systems that need to retrain their statistical
models as new entities arrive, our approach does not require such retraining,
which makes it more adaptable for types of entities that are frequently
updated. For this preliminary study, we focus on one entity type, movie title,
using data collected from Twitter. Our system is tested on two evaluation sets,
one including only entities corresponding to movies in our training set, and
the other excluding any of those entities. Our final model shows F1-scores of
76.19% and 78.70% on these evaluation sets, which gives strong evidence that
our approach is completely unbiased to any par- ticular set of entities found
during training.
