In this paper, a complete classification of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)
spacetime by using approximate Noether approach is presented. Considered
spacetime is discussed for three different types of universe i.e. flat, open
and closed. Different forms of cosmic scale factor $a$ with respect to the
nature of the universe, which posses the nontrivial Noether gauge symmetries
(NGS) are reported. The perturbed Lagrangian corresponding to FRW metric in the
Noether equation is used to get Noether operators. For different types of
universe minimal and maximal set of Noether operators are reported. A list of
Noether operators are also computed which is not only independent from the
choice of the cosmic scale factor but also the choice type of universe.
Further, corresponding energy type first integral of motions are also
calculated.
