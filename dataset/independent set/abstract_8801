We study the pointwise regularity properties of the L\'evy fields introduced
by T. Mori; these fields are the most natural generalization of L\'evy
processes to the multivariate setting. We determine their spectrum of
singularities, and we show that their H\"older singularity sets satisfy a large
intersection property in the sense of K. Falconer.
