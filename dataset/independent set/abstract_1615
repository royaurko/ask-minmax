In 1960s Shiryaev developed Bayesian theory of change detection in
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequences. In Shiryaev's
classical setting the goal is to minimize an average detection delay under the
constraint imposed on the average probability of false alarm. Recently,
Tartakovsky and Veeravalli (2005) developed a general Bayesian asymptotic
change-point detection theory (in the classical setting) that is not limited to
a restrictive i.i.d. assumption. It was proved that Shiryaev's detection
procedure is asymptotically optimal under traditional average false alarm
probability constraint, assuming that this probability is small. In the present
paper, we consider a less conventional approach where the constraint is imposed
on the global, supremum false alarm probability. An asymptotically optimal
Bayesian change detection procedure is proposed and thoroughly evaluated for
both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. models when the global false alarm probability
approaches zero.
