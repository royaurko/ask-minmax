Polynomial and spline quasi-interpolants (QIs) are practical and effective
approximation operators. Among their remarkable properties, let us cite for
example: good shape properties, easy computation and evaluation (no linear
system to solve), uniform boundedness independently of the degree (polynomials)
or of the partition (splines), good approximation order. We shall emphasize new
results on various types of univariate and multivariate polynomial or spline
QIs, depending on the nature of coefficient functionals, which can be
differential, discrete or integral. We shall also present some applications of
QIs to numerical methods.
