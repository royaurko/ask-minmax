The precise measurement of binding energy, total width and DDpi branching
fraction, constrains, in a model independent way, the loosely bound hadron
molecule interpretation of X(3872). A full discernment is not yet possible on
the basis of present data. Similar considerations might be extended to all
those Y,Z resonances susceptible of a molecular description.
