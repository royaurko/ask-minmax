We characterize microlocal regularity of Colombeau generalized functions by
an appropriate extension of the classical notion of micro-ellipticity to
pseudodifferential operators with slow scale generalized symbols. Thus we
obtain an alternative, yet equivalent, way to determine generalized wave front
sets, which is analogous to the original definition of the wave front set of
distributions via intersections over characteristic sets. The new methods are
then applied to regularity theory of generalized solutions of
(pseudo-)differential equations, where we extend the general noncharacteristic
regularity result for distributional solutions and consider propagation of
generalized singularities for homogeneous first-order hyperbolic equations.
