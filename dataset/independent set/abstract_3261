In this paper, we construct hybrid T-Trefftz polygonal finite elements. The
displacement field within the polygon is repre- sented by the homogeneous
solution to the governing differential equation, also called as the T-complete
set. On the boundary of the polygon, a conforming displacement field is
independently defined to enforce continuity of the displacements across the
element boundary. An optimal number of T-complete functions are chosen based on
the number of nodes of the polygon and degrees of freedom per node. The
stiffness matrix is computed by the hybrid formulation with auxiliary
displacement frame. Results from the numerical studies presented for a few
benchmark problems in the context of linear elasticity shows that the proposed
method yield highly accurate results.
