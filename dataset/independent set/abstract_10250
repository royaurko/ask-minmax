We show that for g > 2k+2 the k-rational homotopy type of the moduli space
M_{g,n} of algebraic curves of genus g with n punctures is independent of g,
and the space M_{g,n} is k-formal. This implies the existence of a limiting
rational homotopy type of M_{g,n} as g goes to infinity and the formality of
it.
