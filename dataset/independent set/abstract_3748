A search for first and second generation leptoquarks has been done with the
D\O \ detector at Fermilab's p\={p} collider with $\sqrt{s}=1.8$ TeV. 95\% C.L.
mass limits for first generation scalar leptoquarks have been recently
published. The number for the total integrated luminosity used in the first
generation leptoquark analysis has changed (via a change in the total inelastic
cross section) since the publication. The new limits are 130 GeV/c$^{2}$ and
116 GeV/c$^{2}$ for a respective 100\% and 50\% decay branching ratio of the
leptoquark to electron. The preliminary upper limit on the cross section from
the search for second generation scalar leptoquarks has set limits on the mass
of the second generation leptoquark of 97 GeV/c$^{2}$ for 100\% branching to
muons and 80 GeV/c$^{2}$ for 50\% branching. In contrast with leptoquark
detection thresholds at e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ and e-p machines, these limits are
independent of the unknown coupling of the leptoquark to leptons and quarks.
