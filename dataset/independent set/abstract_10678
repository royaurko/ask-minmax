It is shown via the principle of path independence that the (time gauge)
constraint algebra derived in (Class. Quantum Grav. 5 (1988) pg. 1405) for
vielbein General Relativity is a generic feature of any covariant theory
formulated in a vielbein frame. In the process of doing so, the relationship
between the coordinate and orthonormal frame algebera is made explicit.
