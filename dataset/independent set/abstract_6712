We consider accumulation of periodic points in local uniformly quasiregular
dynamics. Given a local uniformly quasiregular mapping $f$ with a countable and
closed set of isolated essential singularities and their accumulation points on
a closed Riemannian manifold, we show that points in the Julia set are
accumulated by periodic points. If, in addition, the Fatou set is non-empty and
connected, the accumulation is by periodic points in the Julia set itself. We
also give sufficient conditions for the density of repelling periodic points.
