We calculate the SU(3)-breaking corrections to the hyperon vector coupling
$f_1(0)$ up to $\mathcal{O}(p^4)$ in covariant baryon chiral perturbation
theory with dynamical octet and decuplet contributions. We find that the
decuplet contributions are of similar or even larger size than the octet ones.
Combining both, we predict positive SU(3)-breaking corrections to all the four
independent $f_1(0)$'s (assuming isospin symmetry), which are consistent,
within uncertainties, with the latest results form large $N_c$ fits, chiral
quark models, and quenched lattice QCD calculations.
