It is shown that $D=4$ $N=1$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory with an appropriate
supermultiplet of matter can be twisted on compact K\"ahler manifold. The
conditions of cancellation of anomalies of BRST charge are found. The twisted
theory has an appropriate BRST charge. We find a non-trivial set of physical
operators defined as classes of the cohomology of this BRST \op . We prove that
the physical correlators are independent on external K\"ahler metric up to a
power of a ratio of two Ray-Singer torsions for the Dolbeault cohomology
complex on a K\"ahler manifold. The correlators of local physical \op s turn
out to be independent of anti-holomorphic coordinates defined with a complex
structure on the K\"ahler manifold. However a dependence of the correlators on
holomorphic coordinates can still remain. For a hyperk\"ahler metric the
physical correlators turn out to be independent of all coordinates of
insertions of local physical \op s.
