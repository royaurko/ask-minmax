A quasiparticle model of the quark-gluon plasma is compared with lattice QCD
data for purely imaginary chemical potential. Net quark number density,
susceptibility as well as the deconfinement border line in the phase diagram of
strongly interacting matter are investigated. In addition, the impact of
baryo-chemical potential dependent quasiparticle masses is discussed. This
accomplishes a direct test of the model for non-zero baryon density. The found
results are compared with lattice QCD data for real chemical potential by means
of analytic continuation and with a different (independent) set of lattice QCD
data at zero chemical potential.
