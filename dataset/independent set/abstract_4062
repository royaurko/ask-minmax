In this paper we present a model independent analysis method following
Bayesian statistics to analyse data from a generic counting experiment and
apply it to the search for neutrinos from point sources. We discuss a test
statistic defined following a Bayesian framework that will be used in the
search for a signal. In case no signal is found, we derive an upper limit
without the introduction of approximations. The Bayesian approach allows us to
obtain the full probability density function for both the background and the
signal rate. As such, we have direct access to any signal upper limit. The
upper limit derivation directly compares with a frequentist approach and is
robust in the case of low-counting observations. Furthermore, it allows also to
account for previous upper limits obtained by other analyses via the concept of
prior information without the need of the ad hoc application of trial factors.
To investigate the validity of the presented Bayesian approach, we have applied
this method to the public IceCube 40-string configuration data for 10 nearby
blazars and we have obtained a flux upper limit, which is in agreement with the
upper limits determined via a frequentist approach. Furthermore, the upper
limit obtained compares well with the previously published result of IceCube,
using the same data set.
