In the paper, a simple condition guaranteing the finiteness property for a
bounded set of matrices is presented. Given a bounded set S of real or complex
matrices, it is shown that existence of a sequence of matrix products such that
the spectrum of each matrix in this sequence is uniformly sub-peripheral and
tends to the joint spectral radius of S, guarantees the spectral finiteness
property for S.
