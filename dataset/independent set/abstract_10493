We report two-dimensional phase-field simulations of locally-conserved
coarsening dynamics of random fractal clusters with fractal dimension D=1.7 and
1.5. The correlation function, cluster perimeter and solute mass are measured
as functions of time. Analyzing the correlation function dynamics, we identify
two different time-dependent length scales that exhibit power laws in time. The
exponents of these power laws are independent of D, one of them is apparently
the classic exponent 1/3. The solute mass versus time exhibits dynamic scaling
with a D-dependent exponent, in agreement with a simple scaling theory.
