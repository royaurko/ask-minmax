We define the notion of ordinal computability by generalizing standard Turing
computability on tapes of length $\omega$ to computations on tapes of arbitrary
ordinal length. We show that a set of ordinals is ordinal computable from a
finite set of ordinal parameters if and only if it is an element of Goedel's
constructible universe L. This characterization can be used to prove the
generalized continuum hypothesis in L.
