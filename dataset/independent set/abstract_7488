The Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations are solved in the strong-coupling
limit, where real-space (preformed) pairs bose-condense with finite
center-of-mass momenta. There are two energy scales in this regime, a
temperature independent incoherent gap $\Delta_p$ and a temperature dependent
coherent gap $\Delta_c (T)$, modulated in real space. The single-particle
density of states (DOS) reveals checkerboard modulations similar to the
tunnelling DOS in cuprates.
