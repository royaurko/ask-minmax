We classify the maximal $m$-distance sets in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ which contain
the representation of the Johnson graph $J(n, m)$ for $m = 2, 3$. Furthermore,
we determine the necessary and sufficient condition for $n$ and $m$ such that
the representation of the Johnson graph $J(n, m)$ is not maximal as an
$m$-distance set. Also, we classify the maximal two-distance sets in
$\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ which contain the representation of $J(n - 1, 2)$.
