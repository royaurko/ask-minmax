Filiz et al. (2008) proposed a model for the pattern of defaults seen among a
group of firms at the end of a given time period. The ingredients in the model
are a graph, where the vertices correspond to the firms and the edges describe
the network of interdependencies between the firms, a parameter for each vertex
that captures the individual propensity of that firm to default, and a
parameter for each edge that captures the joint propensity of the two connected
firms to default. The correlated default model can be re-rewritten as a
standard Ising model on the graph by identifying the set of defaulting firms in
the default model with the set of sites in the Ising model for which the spin
is +1. We ask whether there is a suitable continuous time Markov chain taking
values in the subsets of the vertex set such that the initial state of the
chain is the empty set, each jump of the chain involves the inclusion of a
single extra vertex, the distribution of the chain at some fixed time horizon
time is the one given by the default model, and the distribution of the chain
for other times is described by a probability distribution in the same family
as the default model. We show for three simple but financially natural special
cases that this is not possible outside of the trivial case where there is
complete independence between the firms.
