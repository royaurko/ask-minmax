Recent work in compressed sensing theory shows that $n\times N$ independent
and identically distributed (IID) sensing matrices whose entries are drawn
independently from certain probability distributions guarantee exact recovery
of a sparse signal with high probability even if $n\ll N$. Motivated by signal
processing applications, random filtering with Toeplitz sensing matrices whose
elements are drawn from the same distributions were considered and shown to
also be sufficient to recover a sparse signal from reduced samples exactly with
high probability. This paper considers Toeplitz block matrices as sensing
matrices. They naturally arise in multichannel and multidimensional filtering
applications and include Toeplitz matrices as special cases. It is shown that
the probability of exact reconstruction is also high. Their performance is
validated using simulations.
