Markov networks are models for compactly representing complex probability
distributions. They are composed by a structure and a set of numerical weights.
The structure qualitatively describes independences in the distribution, which
can be exploited to factorize the distribution into a set of compact functions.
A key application for learning structures from data is to automatically
discover knowledge. In practice, structure learning algorithms focused on
"knowledge discovery" present a limitation: they use a coarse-grained
representation of the structure. As a result, this representation cannot
describe context-specific independences. Very recently, an algorithm called
CSPC was designed to overcome this limitation, but it has a high computational
complexity. This work tries to mitigate this downside presenting CSGS, an
algorithm that uses the Grow-Shrink strategy for reducing unnecessary
computations. On an empirical evaluation, the structures learned by CSGS
achieve competitive accuracies and lower computational complexity with respect
to those obtained by CSPC.
