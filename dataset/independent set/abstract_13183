We report the results of a survey for novae in and between the galaxies of
the Fornax cluster. Our survey provides strong evidence that intracluster novae
exist and that they provide a useful, independent measure of the intracluster
light in Fornax. We discovered six strong nova candidates in six distinct
epochs spanning eleven years from 1993 to 2004. The data were taken with the 4m
and the 1.5m telescopes at CTIO. The spatial distribution of the nova
candidates is consistent with $\sim$16-41% of the total light in the cluster
being in the intracluster light, based on the ratio of the number of novae we
discovered in intracluster space over the total number of novae discovered plus
a simple completeness correction factor. This estimate is consistent with
independent measures of intracluster light in Fornax and Virgo using
intracluster planetary nebulae. The accuracy of the intracluster light
measurement improves with each survey epoch as more novae are discovered.
