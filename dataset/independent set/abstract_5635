We say that a set $A$ \emph{$t$-intersects} a set $B$ if $A$ and $B$ have at
least $t$ common elements. A family $\mathcal{A}$ of sets is said to be
\emph{$t$-intersecting} if each set in $\mathcal{A}$ $t$-intersects any other
set in $\mathcal{A}$. Families $\mathcal{A}_1, \mathcal{A}_2, ...,
\mathcal{A}_k$ are said to be \emph{cross-$t$-intersecting} if for any $i$ and
$j$ in $\{1, 2, ..., k\}$ with $i \neq j$, any set in $\mathcal{A}_i$
$t$-intersects any set in $\mathcal{A}_j$. We prove that for any finite family
$\mathcal{F}$ that has at least one set of size at least $t$, there exists an
integer $\kappa \leq |\mathcal{F}|$ such that for any $k \geq \kappa$, both the
sum and the product of sizes of any $k$ cross-$t$-intersecting sub-families
$\mathcal{A}_1, ..., \mathcal{A}_k$ (not necessarily distinct or non-empty) of
$\mathcal{F}$ are maxima if $\mathcal{A}_1 = ... = \mathcal{A}_k = \mathcal{L}$
for some largest $t$-intersecting sub-family $\mathcal{L}$ of $\mathcal{F}$. We
then study the smallest possible value of $\kappa$ and investigate the case $k
< \kappa$; this includes a cross-intersection result for straight lines that
demonstrates that it is possible to have $\mathcal{F}$ and $\kappa$ such that
for any $k < \kappa$, the configuration $\mathcal{A}_1 = ... = \mathcal{A}_k =
\mathcal{L}$ is neither optimal for the sum nor optimal for the product. We
also outline solutions for various important families $\mathcal{F}$, and we
provide solutions for the case when $\mathcal{F}$ is a power set.
