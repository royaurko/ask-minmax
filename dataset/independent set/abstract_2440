We find a canonical $N{=}2$ superconformal algebra (SCA) in the BRST complex
associated to any affine Lie algebra $\ghhat$ with $\gh$ semisimple. In
contrast with the similar known results for the Virasoro, $N{=}1$
supervirasoro, and $\W_3$ algebras, this SCA does not depend on the particular
``matter'' representation chosen. Therefore it follows that every gauged WZNW
model with data $(\gg\supset\gh, k)$ has an $N{=}2$ SCA with central charge
$c=3\dim\gh$ independent of the level $k$. In particular, this associates to
every embedding $sl(2) \subset \gg$ a one-parameter family of $c{=}9$ $N{=}2$
supervirasoro algebras. As a by-product of the construction, one can deduce a
new set of ``master equations'' for generalized $N{=}2$ supervirasoro
constructions which is simpler than the one considered thus far.
