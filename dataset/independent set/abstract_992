We consider a specialization $Y_M(q,t)$ of the Tutte polynomial of a matroid
$M$ which is inspired by analogy with the Potts model from statistical
mechanics. The only information lost in this specialization is the number of
loops of $M$. We show that the coefficients of $Y_M(1-p,t)$ are very simply
related to the ranks of the Whitney homology groups of the opposite partial
orders of the independent set complexes of the duals of the truncations of
$M$. In particular, we obtain a new homological interpretation for the
coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a matroid.
