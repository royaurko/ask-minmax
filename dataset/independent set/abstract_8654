Let $D$ be a large category which is cocomplete. We construct a model
structure (in the sense of Quillen) on the category of small functors from $D$
to simplicial sets. As an application we construct homotopy localization
functors on the category of simplicial sets which satisfy a stronger universal
property than the customary homotopy localization functors do.
