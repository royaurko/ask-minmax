Bose-Einstein condensation in a gas of magnons pumped by an incoherent
pumping source is experimentally studied at room temperature. We demonstrate
that the condensation can be achieved in a gas of bosons under conditions of
incoherent pumping. Moreover, we show the critical transition point is almost
independent of the frequency spectrum of the pumping source and is solely
determined by the density of magnons. The electromagnetic power radiated by the
magnon condensate was found to scale quadratically with the pumping power,
which is in accordance with the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation in magnon
gases.
