This article gives an overview on the status of experimental searches for
dark matter at the end of 2014. The main focus is on direct searches for weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs) using underground-based low-background
detectors, especially on the new results published in 2014. WIMPs are excellent
dark matter candidates, predicted by many theories beyond the standard model of
particle physics, and are expected to interact with the target nuclei either
via spin-independent (scalar) or spin-dependent (axial-vector) couplings.
Non-WIMP dark matter candidates, especially axions and axion-like particles are
also briefly discussed.
