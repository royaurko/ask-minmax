We have studied dynamical responses and the Jarzynski equality (JE) of
classical open systems described by the generalized Caldeira-Leggett model with
the nonlocal system-bath coupling. In the derived non-Markovian Langevin
equation, the nonlinear nonlocal dissipative term and state-dependent diffusion
term yielding multiplicative colored noise satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation
relation. Simulation results for harmonic oscillator systems have shown the
following: (a) averaged responses of the system $< x >$ to applied sinusoidal
and step forces significantly depend on model parameters of magnitudes of
additive and multiplicative noises and the relaxation time of colored noise,
although stationary marginal probability distribution functions are independent
of them, (b) a combined effect of nonlinear dissipation and multiplicative
colored noise induces enhanced fluctuations $< [x-< x>]^2 >$ for an applied
sinusoidal force, and (c) the JE holds for an applied ramp force independently
of the model parameters with a work distribution function which is (symmetric)
Gaussian and asymmetric non-Gaussian for additive and multiplicative noises,
respectively. It has been shown that the non-Markovian Langevin equation in the
local and over-damped limits is quite different from the widely adopted
phenomenological Markovian Langevin equation subjected to multiplicative noise.
