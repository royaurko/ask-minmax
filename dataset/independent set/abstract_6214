Here we are concerned with a special issue of billiard invisibility, where a
bounded set with a piecewise smooth boundary in Euclidean space is identified
with a body with mirror surface, and the billiard in the complement of the set
is identified with the dynamics of light rays outside the body in the framework
of geometric optics. We show that in this setting it is possible to construct a
body invisible from two points.
