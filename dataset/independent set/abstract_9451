This is an expository article on the theory of Kuranishi structure and is
based on a series of pdf files we uploaded for the discussion of the google
group named `Kuranishi' (with its administrator H. Hofer). There we replied to
several questions concerning Kuranishi structure raised by K. Wehrheim. At this
stage we submit this article to the e-print arXiv, all the questions or
objections asked in that google group were answered, supplemented or confuted
by us. We first discuss the abstract theory of Kuranishi structure and virtual
fundamental chain/cycle. This part can be read independently from other parts.
We then describe the construction of Kuranishi structure on the moduli space of
pseudoholomorphic curves, including the complete analytic detail of the gluing
construction as well as the smoothness of the resulting Kuranishi structure.
The case of S^1 equivariant Kuranishi structure which appears in the study of
time independent Hamiltonian and the moduli space of Floer's equation is
included.
