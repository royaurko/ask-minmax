Let alpha \in (1, 2] and X be an R^d-valued alpha-stable process with
independent and symmetric components starting in 0. We consider the closure S_t
of the path described by X on the interval [0, t] and its convex hull Z_t. The
first result of this paper provides a formula for certain mean mixed volumes of
Z_t and in particular for the expected first intrinsic volume of Z_t. The
second result deals with the asymptotics of the expected volume of the stable
sausage Z_t+B (where B is an arbitrary convex body with interior points) as t
\to 0.
