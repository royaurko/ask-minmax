In their paper, "A new application of random matrices: Ext(C*_red(F_2)) is
not a group", Haagerup and Thorbjornsen prove an extension of Voiculescu's
random matrix model for independent complex self-adjoint Gaussian random
matrices. We generalize their result to random matrices with real or symplectic
entries (the GOE- and the GSE-ensembles) and random matrix ensembles related to
these.
