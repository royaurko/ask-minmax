The application of effective field theories to hadronic parity violation in
two- and three-nucleon systems is described. These methods provide several
important advantages over the traditionally used meson-exchange models, e.g.,
model independence and the possibility to reliably estimate theoretical errors.
We focus on the so-called "pionless" theory and describe calculations of
various two- and three-nucleon observables. The role of parity-violating
three-nucleon interactions is also discussed.
