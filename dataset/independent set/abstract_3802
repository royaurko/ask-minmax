We introduce the concept of bi-conformal transformation, as a generalization
of conformal ones, by allowing two orthogonal parts of a manifold with metric
$\G$ to be scaled by different conformal factors. In particular, we study their
infinitesimal version, called bi-conformal vector fields. We show the
differential conditions characterizing them in terms of a "square root" of the
metric, or equivalently of two complementary orthogonal projectors. Keeping
these fixed, the set of bi-conformal vector fields is a Lie algebra which can
be finite or infinite dimensional according to the dimensionality of the
projectors. We determine (i) when an infinite-dimensional case is feasible and
its properties, and (ii) a normal system for the generators in the
finite-dimensional case. Its integrability conditions are also analyzed, which
in particular provides the maximum number of linearly independent solutions. We
identify the corresponding maximal spaces, and show a necessary geometric
condition for a metric tensor to be a double-twisted product. More general
``breakable'' spaces are briefly considered. Many known symmetries are
included, such as conformal Killing vectors, Kerr-Schild vector fields,
kinematic self-similarity, causal symmetries, and rigid motions.
