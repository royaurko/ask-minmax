A simple explanation for the logarithmic aging of the photoconductivity in
yttriumhydride is proposed. We show that the scaling (``simple'' aging) of the
relaxation response with the illumination time t_w is consistent with the
superposition of independently relaxing excitations with time offsets
distributed over a window of width t_w.
