Some recent theoretical work on inclusive B decays relevant for the model
independent determination of |V_{ub}| and |V_{cb}| is summarized. The
theoretical predictions and their reliability for several differential decay
distributions in B -> X_{c,u}e nu and B -> X_s gamma are reviewed. These can be
used to determine certain important HQET matrix elements. The upsilon expansion
and ways of testing it are discussed.
