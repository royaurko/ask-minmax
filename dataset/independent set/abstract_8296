Three pulsar timing arrays are now producing high quality data sets. As
reviewed in this paper, these data sets are been processed to 1) develop a
pulsar-based time standard, 2) search for errors in the solar system planetary
ephemeris and 3) detect gravitational waves. It is expected that the data sets
will significantly improve in the near future by combining existing
observations and by using new telescopes.
