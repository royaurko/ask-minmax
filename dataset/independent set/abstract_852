There has been concern in the literature about the methodology of using
secondary calibration timepoints when estimating evolutionary divergence dates.
Such timepoints are divergence time estimates that have been derived from one
molecular data set on the basis of a primary external calibration timepoint,
and which are then used independently on a second data set. Logically, the
primary and secondary calibration points must be mutually consistent, in the
sense that it must be possible to predict each time point from the other.
However, the attempt by Shaul and Graur (2002, Gene 300: 59-61) to assess the
reliability of secondary timepoints is flawed because they presented time
estimates without presenting confidence intervals on those estimates, and so it
was not possible to make any explicit hypothesis tests of divergence times.
Also, they inappropriately excluded some of the data, which leads to a very
biased estimate of one of the divergence times. Here, I present a re-analysis
of the same data set, with more appropriate methodology, and come to the
conclusion that no inconsistencies are involved. However, it is clear from the
analysis that molecular data often have such large confidence intervals that
they are uninformative, and thus cannot be used for reliable hypothesis tests.
