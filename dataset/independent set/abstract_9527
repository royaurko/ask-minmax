We describe a survey in the ELAIS N2 region with the VLA at 43.4 GHz, carried
out with 1627 independent snapshot observations in D-configuration and covering
about 0.5 square degrees. One certain source is detected, a
previously-catalogued flat-spectrum QSO at z=2.2. A few (<5) other sources may
be present at about the 3sigma level, as determined from positions of
source-like deflections coinciding with blue stellar objects, or with sources
from lower-frequency surveys. Independently we show how all the source-like
detections identified in the data can be used with a maximum-likelihood
technique to constrain the 43-GHz source counts at a level of ~7 mJy. Previous
estimates of the counts at 43 GHz, based on lower-frequency counts and spectral
measurements, are consistent with these constraints, although the present
results are suggestive of somewhat higher surface densities at the 7 mJy level.
They do not provide direct evidence of intrusion of a previously unknown source
population, although the several candidate sources need examination before such
a population can be ruled out.
