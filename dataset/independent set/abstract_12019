This paper provides an outline of a formal approach that we are developing
for modelling Virtual Organisations (VOs) and their Breeding Environments
(VBEs). We propose different levels of representation for the functional
structures and processes that VBEs and VOs involve, which are independent of
the specificities of the infrastructures (organisational and technical) that
support the functioning of VBEs. This allows us to reason about properties of
tasks performed within VBEs and services provided through VOs without
committing to the way in which they are implemented.
