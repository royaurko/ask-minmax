A general canonical curve X determines a finite set T(X) of hyperplanes,
which is in bijective correspondence with the set of odd theta-characteristics
of X. The definition of T(X) can be extended to certain singular curves, in a
way that is compatible with degenerations. If X is a Deligne-Mumford stable
curve (or a cuspidal curve), we describe the enumerative and local geometry of
T(X); this is applied to show that some singular curves are uniquely determined
by T(X). This work generalizes the preliminary steps used in AG/0008239 (with
E. Sernesi) to show that a general curve of genus 3 can be recovered from its
odd theta-characteristics.
