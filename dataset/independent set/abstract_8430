The set of badly approximable $m \times n $ matrices is known to have
Hausdorff dimension $mn $. Each such matrix comes with its own approximation
constant $c$, and one can ask for the dimension of the set of badly
approximable matrices with approximation constant greater than or equal to some
fixed $c$. In the one-dimensional case, a very precise answer to this question
is known. In this note, we obtain upper and lower bounds in higher dimensions.
