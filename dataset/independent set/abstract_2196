We report the results of monitoring the four images of the gravitational lens
MG 0414+0534 at 15 GHz. In 35 VLA maps spanning 180 days, we measure
root-mean-square variations in the image light curves of ~3.5% mostly due to
variations in the flux density calibration. The flux ratios, which are
independent of flux density calibration variations, show root-mean-square
variability of 1-3%. Extensive simulations of the data analysis process show
that the observed variations in the flux ratios are likely to be due entirely
to errors in the deconvolution process. It is possible that some of the
observed variation is due to the source; however, the signal-to-noise ratio is
too small to make a time delay determination using a data set of this size.
