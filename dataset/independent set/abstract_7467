The boundary condition dependence of the critical behavior for the three
dimensional Anderson transition is investigated. A strong dependence of the
scaling function and the critical conductance distribution on the boundary
conditions is found, while the critical disorder and critical exponent are
found to be independent of the boundary conditions.
