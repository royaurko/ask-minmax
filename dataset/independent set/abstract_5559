A Besicovitch set is a set which contains a unit line segment in any
direction. It is known that the Minkowski and Hausdorff dimensions of such a
set must be greater than or equal to 5/2 in \R^3. In this paper we show that
the Minkowski dimension must in fact be greater than 5/2 + \epsilon for some
absolute constant \epsilon > 0. One observation arising from the argument is
that Besicovitch sets of near-minimal dimension have to satisfy certain strong
properties, which we call ``stickiness,'' ``planiness,'' and ``graininess.''
  The purpose of this paper is to improve upon the known bounds for the
Minkowski dimension of Besicovitch sets in three dimensions. As a by-product of
the argument we obtain some strong conclusions on the structure of Besicovitch
sets with almost-minimal Minkowski dimension.
