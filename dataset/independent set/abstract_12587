In this paper we investigate jump-diffusion processes in random environments
which are given as the weak solutions to SDE's. We formulate conditions
ensuring existence and uniqueness in law of solutions. We investigate Markov
property. To prove uniqueness we solve a general martingale problem for \cadlag
processes. This result is of independent interest. In the last section we
present application of our results considering generalized exponential Levy
model.
