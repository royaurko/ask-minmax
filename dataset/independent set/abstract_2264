Several problematical epochs in cosmology, including the recent period of
structure formation (and acceleration), require us to understand cosmic
evolution during times when the basis of FRW expansion, the cosmological
principle, does not completely hold true. We consider that the breakdown of
isotropy and homogeneity at such times may be an important key towards
understanding cosmic evolution. To study this, we examine fluctuations in the
high-z supernova data to search for signs of large-scale anisotropy in the
Hubble expansion. Using a cosmological-model-independent statistical analysis,
we find mild evidence of real anisotropy in various circumstances. We consider
the significance of these results, and the importance of further searches for
violations of the cosmological principle.
