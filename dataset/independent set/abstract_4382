We have selected 42 elliptical galaxies from the literature and estimated
their velocity dispersions at the effective radius ($\sigma_{\re}$) and at 0.54
effective radii ($\vff$). We find by a dynamical analysis that the normalized
velocity dispersion of the dark halo of an elliptical galaxy $\vdm$ is roughly
$\sigma_{\re}$ multiplied by a constant, which is almost independent of the
core radius or the anisotropy parameter of each galaxy. Our sample analysis
suggests that $\vdm^{*}$ lies in the range 178-198 km s$^{-1}$. The power law
relation we find between the luminosity and the dark matter velocity dispersion
measured in this way is $(L/L^{*}) = (\vdm/\vdm^{*})^\gamma$, where $\gamma$ is
between 2-3. These results are of interest for strong gravitational lensing
statistics studies.
  In order to determine the value of $\vdm^{*}$, we calculate $\mstar$ in the
same $\bt$ band in which $\vdm^{*}$ has been estimated. We select 131
elliptical galaxies as a complete sample set with apparent magnitudes $\bt$
between 9.26 and 12.19. We find that the luminosity function is well fitted to
the Schechter form, with parameters $\mstar$ = -19.66 + 5$\cdot\log_{10}h \pm
0.30$, $\alpha = 0.15 \pm 0.55$, and the normalization constant $\phi^{*} =
(1.34 \pm 0.30) \times 10^{-3} h^{3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, with the Hubble constant
$\hnot$ = 100 $h$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This normalization implies that
morphology type E galaxies make up (10.8 $\pm$ 1.2) per cent of all galaxies.
