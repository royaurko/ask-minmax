In these lectures the properties of magnetically charged black holes are
described. In addition to the standard Reissner-N\"ordstrom solution, there are
new types of static black holes that arise in theories containing electrically
charged massive vector mesons. These latter solutions have nontrivial matter
fields outside the horizon; i.e., they are black holes with hair. While the
solutions carrying unit magnetic charge are spherically symmetric, those with
more than two units of magnetic charge are not even axially symmetric. These
thus provide the first example of time-independent black hole solutions that
have no rotational symmetry.
