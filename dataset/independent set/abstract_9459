The computation of the energy spectra of Standard Model particles originated
from the annihilation/decay of dark matter particles is of primary importance
in indirect searches of dark matter. We compute how the inclusion of
electroweak corrections significantly alter such spectra when the mass M of
dark matter particles is larger than the electroweak scale: soft electroweak
gauge bosons are copiously radiated opening new channels in the final states
which otherwise would be forbidden if such corrections are neglected. All
stable particles are therefore present in the final spectrum, independently of
the primary channel of dark matter annihilation/decay. Such corrections are
model independent.
