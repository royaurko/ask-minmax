The Maunder Minimum (1645-1715 approximately) was a period of very low solar
activity and a strong hemispheric asymmetry, with most of sunspots in the
southern hemisphere. In this paper, two data sets of sunspot latitudes during
the Maunder minimum have been recovered for the international scientific
community. The first data set is constituted by latitudes of sunspots appearing
in the catalogue published by Gustav Sp\"orer nearly 130 years ago. The second
data set is based on the sunspot latitudes displayed in the butterfly diagram
for the Maunder Minimum which was published by Ribes and Nesme-Ribes almost 20
years ago. We have calculated the asymmetry index using these data sets
confirming a strong hemispherical asymmetry in this period. A machine-readable
version of this catalogue with both data sets is available in the Historical
Archive of Sunspot Observations (http://haso.unex.es) and in the appendix of
this article.
