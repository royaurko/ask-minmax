For any polynomial ideal $I$, let the minimal triangular set contained in the
reduced Buchberger-Gr\"obner basis of $I$ with respect to the purely
lexicographical term order be called the W-characteristic set of $I$. In this
paper, we establish a strong connection between Ritt's characteristic sets and
Buchberger's Gr\"obner bases of polynomial ideals by showing that the
W-characteristic set $C$ of $I$ is a Ritt characteristic set of $I$ whenever
$C$ is an ascending set, and a Ritt characteristic set of $I$ can always be
computed from $C$ with simple pseudo-division when $C$ is regular. We also
prove that under certain variable ordering, either the W-characteristic set of
$I$ is normal, or irregularity occurs for the $j$th, but not the $(j+1)$th,
elimination ideal of $I$ for some $j$. In the latter case, we provide explicit
pseudo-divisibility relations, which lead to nontrivial factorizations of
certain polynomials in the Buchberger-Gr\"obner basis and thus reveal the
structure of such polynomials. The pseudo-divisibility relations may be used to
devise an algorithm to decompose arbitrary polynomial sets into normal
triangular sets based on Buchberger-Gr\"obner bases computation.
