In a monotonic sequence game, two players alternately choose elements of a
sequence from some fixed ordered set. The game ends when the resulting sequence
contains either an ascending subsequence of length a or a descending one of
length d. We investigate the behaviour of this game when played on finite
linear orders or Q and provide some general observations for play on arbitrary
ordered sets.
