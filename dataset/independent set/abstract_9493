For each $n\geq 1$, let $ {X_{in}, \quad i \geq 1} $ be independent copies of
a nonnegative continuous stochastic process $X_{n}=(X_n(t))_{t\in T}$ indexed
by a compact metric space $T$. We are interested in the process of partial
maxima [\tilde M_n(u,t) =\max \{X_{in}(t), 1 \leq i\leq [nu]},\quad u\geq 0,\
t\in T.] where the brackets $[\,\cdot\,]$ denote the integer part. Under a
regular variation condition on the sequence of processes $X_n$, we prove that
the partial maxima process $\tilde M_n$ weakly converges to a superextremal
process $\tilde M$ as $n\to\infty$. We use a point process approach based on
the convergence of empirical measures. Properties of the limit process are
investigated: we characterize its finite-dimensional distributions, prove that
it satisfies an homogeneous Markov property, and show in some cases that it is
max-stable and self-similar. Convergence of further order statistics is also
considered. We illustrate our results on the class of log-normal processes in
connection with some recent results on the extremes of Gaussian processes
established by Kabluchko.
