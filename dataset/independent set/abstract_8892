We consider the urn setting with two different objects, ``good'' and ``bad'',
and analyze the number of draws without replacement until a good object is
picked. Although the expected number of draws for this setting is a standard
textbook exercise, we compute the variance, and show that this distribution
converges to the geometric distribution.
