We investigate the dependence of the Drell-Yan cross section on lepton polar
and azimuthal angles, as generated by the lowest-order QCD annihilation and
Compton processes. We focus in particular on the azimuthal-angular
distributions, which are of the form cos(phi) and cos(2phi). At small
transverse momentum q_T of the lepton pair, q_T << Q, with Q the pair mass,
these terms are known to be suppressed relative to the phi-independent part of
the Drell-Yan cross section by one or two powers of the transverse momentum.
Nonetheless, as we show, like the phi-independent part they are subject to
large logarithmic corrections, whose precise form however depends on the
reference frame chosen. These logarithmic contributions ultimately require
resummation to all orders in the strong coupling. We discuss the potential
effects of resummation on the various angular terms in the cross section and on
the Lam-Tung relation.
