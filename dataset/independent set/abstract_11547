We study analytically the intermediate and late-time behaviour of the massive
scalar field in the background of static spherically symmetric brane black hole
solutions. The intermediate behavoiur of the scalar field reveals the
dependence on the field's parameter mass as well as the multiple moment l,
while the late-time behaviour has the power-law decay rate independent of those
factors.
