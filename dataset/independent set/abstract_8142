This paper addresses the problem of representing the set of repairs of a
possibly inconsistent database by means of a disjunctive database.
Specifically, the class of denial constraints is considered. We show that,
given a database and a set of denial constraints, there exists a (unique)
disjunctive database, called canonical, which represents the repairs of the
database w.r.t. the constraints and is contained in any other disjunctive
database with the same set of minimal models. We propose an algorithm for
computing the canonical disjunctive database. Finally, we study the size of the
canonical disjunctive database in the presence of functional dependencies for
both repairs and cardinality-based repairs.
