Teichmueller curves are geodesic discs in Teichmueller space that project to
algebraic curves $C$ in the moduli space $M_g$. Some Teichm\"uller curves can
be considered as components of Hurwitz spaces. We show that the absolute Galois
group $G_\QQ$ acts faithfully on the set of these embedded curves. We also
compare the action of $G_\QQ$ on $\pi_1(C)$ with the one on $\pi_1(M_g)$ and
obtain a relation in the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group, seemingly independent
of the known ones.
