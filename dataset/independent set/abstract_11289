We introduce the boolean convolution for probability measures on the unit
circle. Roughly speaking, it describes the distribution of the product of two
boolean independent unitary random variables. We find an analogue of the
characteristic function and determine all infinitely divisible probability
measures on the unit circle for the boolean convolution.
