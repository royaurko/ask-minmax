In this article, we study the (d-1)-volume and the covering numbers of the
medial axis of a compact set of the Euclidean d-space. In general, this volume
is infinite; however, the (d-1)-volume and covering numbers of a filtered
medial axis (the mu-medial axis) that is at distance greater than R from the
compact set will be explicitely bounded. The behaviour of the bound we obtain
with respect to mu, R and the covering numbers of the compact set K are
optimal.
  From this result we deduce that the projection function on a compact subset K
of the Euclidean d-space depends continuously on the compact set K, in the L^1
sense. This implies in particular that Federer's curvature measure of a compact
set with positive reach can be reliably estimated from a Hausdorff
approximation of this set, regardless of any regularity assumption on the
approximation.
