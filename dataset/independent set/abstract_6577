We sharpen the Evolving set methodology of Morris and Peres and extend it to
study convergence in total variation, relative entropy, $L^2$ and other
distances. Bounds in terms of a modified form of conductance are given which
apply even for walks with no holding probability. These bounds are found to be
strictly better than earlier Evolving set bounds, may be substantially better
than conductance profile results derived via Spectral profile, and drastically
sharpen Blocking Conductance bounds if there are no bottlenecks at small sets.
