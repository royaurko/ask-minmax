We define spacetimes that are asymptotically flat, except for a deficit solid
angle $\alpha$, and present a definition of their ``ADM'' mass, which is finite
for this class of spacetimes, and, in particular, coincides with the value of
the parameter $M$ of the global monopole spacetime studied by Vilenkin and
Barriola . Moreover, we show that the definition is coordinate independent, and
explain why it can, in some cases, be negative.
