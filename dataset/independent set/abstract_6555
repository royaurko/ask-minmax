We classify the twisted tensor products of a finite set algebra with a two
elements set algebra using colored quivers obtained through considerations
analogous to Ore extensions. This provides also a classification of entwining
structures between a finite set algebra and the grouplike coalgebra on two
elements. The resulting 2-nilpotent algebras have particular features with
respect to Hochschild (co)homology and cyclic homology.
