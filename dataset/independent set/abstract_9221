We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the sum of M independent
continuous random variables modulo 1 to converge to the uniform distribution in
L^1([0,1]), and discuss generalizations to discrete random variables. A
consequence is that if X_1, ..., X_M are independent continuous random
variables with densities f_1, ..., f_M, for any base B as M \to \infty for many
choices of the densities the distribution of the digits of X_1 * ... * X_M
converges to Benford's law base B. The rate of convergence can be quantified in
terms of the Fourier coefficients of the densities, and provides an explanation
for the prevalence of Benford behavior in many diverse systems.
