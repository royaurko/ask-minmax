It is known that in a stationary Brownian queue with both arrival and service
processes equal in law to Brownian motion, the departure process is a Brownian
motion, that is, Burke's theorem in this context. In this short note we prove
convergence to this invariant measure: if we have an arbitrary continuous
process satisfying some mild conditions as initial arrival process and pass it
through an infinite tandem network of queues, the resulting process weakly
converges to a Brownian motion. We assume independent and exponential initial
workloads for all queues.
