Given a pair of fusion categories $C$ and $D$, we may form the free product
$C * D$ and the tensor product $C \boxtimes D$. It is natural to think of the
tensor product as a quotient of the free product. What other quotients are
possible?
  When $C=D=A_2$, there is an infinite family of quotients interpolating
between the free product and the tensor product (closely related to the
$A_{2n-1}^{(1)}$ and $D_{n+2}^{(1)}$ subfactors at index 4). Bisch and Haagerup
discovered one example of such an intermediate quotient when $C=A_2$ and
$D=T_2$, and suggested that there might be another family here. We show that
such quotients are characterized by parameters $n \geq 1$ and $\omega$ with
$\omega^{2n}=1$. For $n=1,2,3$, we show $\omega$ must be 1, and construct the
corresponding quotient ($n=1$ is the tensor product, $n=2$ is the example
discovered by Bisch and Haagerup, and $n=3$ is new). We further show that there
are no such quotients for $4 \leq n \leq 10$. Our methods also apply to the
case when $C=D=T_2$, and we prove similar results there.
  During the preparation of this manuscript we learnt of an independent result
of Liu's on subfactors. With the translation between the subfactor and fusion
category settings provided here, it follows there are no such quotients for any
$n \geq 4$.
