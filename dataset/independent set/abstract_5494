In this paper we study fundamental directional properties of sets under the
assumption of condition (SSP) (introduced in a previous paper). We show several
transversality theorems in the singular case and an (SSP)-structure preserving
theorem. As an illustration, our transversality results are used to prove
several facts concerning complex analytic varieties. The (SSP)-property is most
suitable for understanding transversality in the Lipschitz category. This
property is shared by a large class of sets, in particular by subanalytic sets
or by definable sets in an o-minimal structure.
