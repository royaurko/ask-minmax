We have studied galaxy two-point angular correlations as a function of color
using 4-m plate photometry in two independent fields. Each field consists of
over 2900 galaxies with magnitudes 20<B_J <23.5 in an area of approximately 750
arcmin^2 . We find that the autocorrelation amplitude of the bluest 15% of
galaxies is surprisingly strong, with a relative increase in clustering
amplitude of a factor of 6 over that of the complete data set, while exhibiting
a power law slope consistent with the canonical value of -0.8. These very blue
galaxies are also found to be weakly correlated with galaxies of median color
and marginally anti-correlated with the reddest subset. These correlation
properties are incompatible with existing simple models of the galaxy
distribution; they suggest that a significant fraction, more than 50%, of these
very blue galaxies are a faint population which lie at nearby redshifts z<0.3.
