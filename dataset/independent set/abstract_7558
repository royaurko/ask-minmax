Interactions of heavy Majorana neutrinos in the thermal phase of the early
universe may be the origin of the cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry.
Successful baryogenesis, independent of initial conditions, is possible for
neutrino masses in the range $10^{-3} {eV} \leq m_i \lesssim 0.1$ eV.
Remarkably, this mass window is consistent with the evidence for neutrino
masses from oscillations.
