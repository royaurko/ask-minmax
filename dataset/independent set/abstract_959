We consider a low-energy supersymmetric scenario in which the effects of
heavy supersymmetric interactions are included in a model-independent manner
through a series of supersymmetric SU(3)_C*SU(2)_L*U(1)_Y invariant operators;
we explicitly construct all such operators of dimension less or equal than 6.
From this set, those operators generated at tree level by the underlying theory
are isolated since under weak coupling conditions they are expected to provide
the largest effects in low-energy processes. Potential deviations from low
energy predictions in process such as proton decay, neutrinoless double-beta
decay and flavor changing neutral currents are analyzed as illustrations of the
method.
