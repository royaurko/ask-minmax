Identifying anomalies and contamination in datasets is important in a wide
variety of settings. In this paper, we describe a new technique for estimating
contamination in large, discrete valued datasets. Our approach considers the
normal condition of the data to be specified by a model consisting of a set of
distributions. Our key contribution is in our approach to contamination
estimation. Specifically, we develop a technique that identifies the minimum
number of data points that must be discarded (i.e., the level of contamination)
from an empirical data set in order to match the model to within a specified
goodness-of-fit, controlled by a p-value. Appealing to results from large
deviations theory, we show a lower bound on the level of contamination is
obtained by solving a series of convex programs. Theoretical results guarantee
the bound converges at a rate of $O(\sqrt{\log(p)/p})$, where p is the size of
the empirical data set.
