We consider the non-analytic terms in the spin susceptibility arising as a
result of rescaterring of pairs of quasiparticles. We emphasize the importance
of rescattering in the Cooper channel for the analysis of the temperature
dependences in the two-dimensional electron systems in the ballistic regime. In
the calculation of the linear in $T$ term we use angular harmonics in the
Cooper channel, because for each harmonic the interaction amplitude is
renormalized independently. We observe, that as a consequence of strong
renormalizations in the Cooper ladder, the temperature derivative of the spin
susceptibility may change its sign at low temperatures.
