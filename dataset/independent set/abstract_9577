High speed photometric observations of the spectroscopically-discovered PG
1159 star SDSS J034917.41-005917.9 in 2007 and 2009 reveal a suite of pulsation
frequencies in the range of 1038 - 3323 microHz with amplitudes between 3.5 and
18.6 mmag. SDSS J034917.41-005917.9 is therefore a member of the GW Vir class
of pulsating pre-white dwarfs. We have identified 10 independent pulsation
frequencies that can be fitted by an asymptotic model with a constant period
spacing of 23.61 +/- 0.21 s, presumably associated with a sequence of l = 1
modes. The highest amplitude peak in the suite of frequencies shows evidence
for a triplet structure, with a frequency separation of 14.4 microHz. Five of
the identified frequencies do not fit the l = 1 sequence, but are, however,
well-modeled by an independent asymptotic sequence with a constant period
spacing of 11.66 +/- 0.13 s. It is unclear to which l mode these frequencies
belong.
