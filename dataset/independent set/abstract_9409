We study semileptonic B meson decays B to K_1(1270) l^+ l^- and K_1(1400) l^+
l^- (l=e, mu, tau), where the strange P-wave mesons, K_1(1270) and K_1(1400),
are the mixtures of the K_{1A} and K_{1B}, which are the 1^3P_1 and 1^1P_1
states, respectively. We show that the ratio R_l = Br(B to K_1(1400) l^+
l^-)/Br(B to K_1(1270) l^+ l^-), insensitive to new-physics parameters, is
suitable for determining the K_1(1270)-K_1(1400) mixing angle, theta_{K_1}. The
forward-backward asymmetry shows a weak theta_{K_1}-dependence for B to
K_1(1270) mu^+ mu^-, but relatively strong for B to K_1(1400) mu^+ mu^-. We
investigate model-independent new-physics corrections to operators relevant to
the b to s l^+ l^- electroweak-penguin and weak-box diagrams. Furthermore, for
the B to K_1(1270) mu^+ mu^- decay the position of the forward-backward
asymmetry zero, which is almost independent of the value of theta_{K_1}, can be
dramatically changed under variation of new-physics parameters.
