Symplectic 4-manifolds $(X,\omega)$ with $b_+{=}1$ are roughly classified by
the canonical class $K$ and the symplectic form $\omega$ depending upon the
sign of $K^2$ and $K\cdot \omega$. Examples are known for each category except
for the case when the manifold satisfies $K^2=0$, $K\cdot \omega >0$, $b_1=2$,
and fails to be of Lefschetz type. The purpose of this paper is to construct an
infinite number of examples of such manifolds. Furthermore, we will show that
these manifolds have very special properties -- they are not complex manifolds,
their Seiberg-Witten invariants are independent of the chamber structure, and
they do not have metrics of positive scalar curvature.
