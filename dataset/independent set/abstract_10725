The standard energy conditions of classical general relativity are applied to
FLRW cosmologies containing sudden future singularities. Here we show, in a
model independent way, that although such cosmologies can satisfy the null,
weak and strong energy conditions, they always fail to satisfy the dominant
energy condition. They require a divergent spacelike energy flux in all but the
comoving frame.
