Opinion mining aims at extracting useful subjective information from reliable
amounts of text. Opinion mining holder recognition is a task that has not been
considered yet in Arabic Language. This task essentially requires deep
understanding of clauses structures. Unfortunately, the lack of a robust,
publicly available, Arabic parser further complicates the research. This paper
presents a leading research for the opinion holder extraction in Arabic news
independent from any lexical parsers. We investigate constructing a
comprehensive feature set to compensate the lack of parsing structural
outcomes. The proposed feature set is tuned from English previous works coupled
with our proposed semantic field and named entities features. Our feature
analysis is based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and semi-supervised
pattern recognition techniques. Different research models are evaluated via
cross-validation experiments achieving 54.03 F-measure. We publicly release our
own research outcome corpus and lexicon for opinion mining community to
encourage further research.
