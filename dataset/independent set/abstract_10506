The mixing properties (or sensitivity to initial conditions) of
two-dimensional Henon map have been explored numerically at the edge of chaos.
Three independent methods, which have been developed and used so far for the
one-dimensional maps, have been used to accomplish this task. These methods are
(i)measure of the divergence of initially nearby orbits, (ii)analysis of the
multifractal spectrum and (iii)computation of nonextensive entropy increase
rates. The obtained results strongly agree with those of the one-dimensional
cases and constitute the first verification of this scenario in two-dimensional
maps. This obviously makes the idea of weak chaos even more robust.
