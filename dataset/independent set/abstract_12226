This paper establishes Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov type equations for
time-changed Gaussian processes. Examples include those equations for a
time-changed fractional Brownian motion with time-dependent Hurst parameter and
for a time-changed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The time-change process
considered is the inverse of either a stable subordinator or a mixture of
independent stable subordinators.
