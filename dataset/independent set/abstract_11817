We investigate the role of the choice of the upper phase space limit Q in the
Curci-Furmanski-Petronzio (CFP) factorization scheme, which exploits
dimensional regularization MS scheme. We examine how the choice of Q influences
the evaluation of the standard DGLAP (inclusive) evolution kernels, gaining
experience needed in the construction of the exclusive Monte Carlo modelling of
the NLO DGLAP evolution. In particular, we uncover three types of mechanisms
which assure the independence on Q of the inclusive DGLAP kernels calculated in
the CFP scheme. We use the examples of three types of the Feynman diagrams to
illustrate our analysis.
