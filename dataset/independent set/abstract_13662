In the paper we consider Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators in nonhomogeneous
spaces. We are going to prove the analogs of classical results for homogeneous
spaces. Namely, we prove that a Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operator is of weak type
if it is bounded in $L^2$. We also prove several versions of Cotlar's
inequality for maximal singular operator. One version of Cotlar's inequality
(a simpler one) is proved in Euclidean setting, another one in a more abstract
setting when Besicovich covering lemma is not available. We obtain also the
weak type of maximal singular operator from these inequalities.
