Let $\mathcal A\subset\mathbb P^{k-1}$ be a rank $k$ arrangement of $n$
hyperplanes, with the property that any $k$ of the defining linear forms are
linearly independent (i.e., $\mathcal A$ is called $k-$generic). We show that
for any $j=1,\ldots,k$, the subspace arrangement with defining ideal generated
by the $(n-j)-$fold products of the defining linear forms of $\mathcal A$, is
set-theoretic complete intersection, which is equivalent to saying that star
configurations have this property.
