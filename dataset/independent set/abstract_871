The problem of determining the mathematical model of the dynamics of
multi-dimensional control systems in the presence of noise under the condition
that the correlation functions cannot be found. Known statistical dynamics of
linear systems is a more effective alternative. Background information is
presented in the form of individual implementations nonergodic stochastic
processes. Such a realization is deterministic functions. We introduce the
concept of systems of sets of signals for the components on the semiring. For
the system of sets of linearly dependent and linearly independent of the
measured signals of a certain frequency properties. Frequency method is
designed to deal with the noise on the set of deterministic functions. Example
is the determination of the dynamic characteristics of the aircraft in
accordance with the data obtained in one automatic landing.
