We calculate the energy and wave functions of two particles confined to two
spatial dimensions interacting via arbitrary anisotropic potentials with
negative or zero net volume. The general rigorous analytic expressions are
given in the weak coupling limit where universality or model independence are
approached. The monopole part of anisotropic potentials is crucial in the
universal limit. We illustrate the universality with a system of two
arbitrarily polarized cold dipolar molecules in a bilayer. We discuss the
transition to universality as function of polarization and binding energy, and
compare analytic and numerical results obtained by the stochastic variational
method. The universal limit is essentially reached for experimentally
accessible strengths.
