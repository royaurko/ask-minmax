Let $\{X_i,i=1,2,...\}$ be i.i.d. standard gaussian variables. Let
$S_n=X_1+...+X_n$ be the sequence of partial sums and $$ L_n=\max_{0\leq
i<j\leq n}\frac{S_j-S_i}{\sqrt{j-i}}. $$ We show that the distribution of
$L_n$, appropriately normalized, converges as $n\to\infty$ to the Gumbel
distribution. In some sense, the the random variable $L_n$, being the maximum
of $n(n+1)/2$ dependent standard gaussian variables, behaves like the maximum
of $Hn \log n$ independent standard gaussian variables. Here, $H\in (0,\infty)$
is some constant. We also prove a version of the above result for the Brownian
motion.
