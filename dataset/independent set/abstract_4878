We construct lepton flavour-dependent and basis-independent measures of
R-parity violation in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard
Model (MSSM). We work in the context of exact supersymmetry, neglecting the
effects of Higgs vacuum expectation values and soft supersymmetry-breaking
terms. We devote particular attention to appropriate choices of flavour
eigenstates, and to the counting and enumeration of R-violating invariants in
two- and three-generation models. We also make an indicative application of our
results to derive possible basis-independent cosmological upper bounds on
flavour-dependent violation of R parity.
