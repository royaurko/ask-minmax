Let ${\mathcal S}$ denote the set of all univalent analytic functions
$f(z)=z+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}a_n z^n$ on the unit disk $|z|<1$. In 1946 B.
Friedman found that the set $\mathcal S$ of those functions which have integer
coefficients consists of only nine functions. In a recent paper Hiranuma and
Sugawa proved that the similar set obtained for the functions with half-integer
coefficients consists of twelve functions in addition to the nine. In this
paper, the main aim is to discuss the class of all sense-preserving univalent
harmonic mappings $f$ on the unit disk with integer or half-integer
coefficients for the analytic and co-analytic parts of $f$. Secondly, we
consider the class of univalent harmonic mappings with integer coefficients,
and consider the convexity in real direction and convexity in imaginary
direction of these mappings. Thirdly, we determine the set of univalent
harmonic mappings with half-integer coefficients which are convex in real
direction or convex in imaginary direction.
