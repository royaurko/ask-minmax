We prove a Thullen type extension theorem of plurisubharmonic functions
across a closed complete pluripolar set, which generalizes a theorem of Siu.
Our approach depends on an Ohsawa-Takegoshi type extension theorem for a single
point in a bounded complete K\"ahler domain, which is of independent interest.
