We study the conformal symmetry described by $SL(2,R)_L \times SL(2,R)_R$ in
the nonextremal Kerr black hole case. We calculate the central charges
$c_{L,R}$ separately on a stretched horizon by the Hamiltonian gravity. In
order to get two sets of conformal symmetry, we consider two Killing vectors
each of which depends on either one of the two independent coordinates
separated in the spirit of point-splitting from the angular coordinate of the
corotating frame at the horizon. Then, we obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
by the Cardy formula.
