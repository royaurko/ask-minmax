We study the dynamics of ELKO in the context of accelerated phase of our
universe. To avoid the fine tuning problem associated with the initial
conditions, it is required that the dynamical equations lead to an early-time
attractor. In the earlier works, it was shown that the dynamical equations
containing ELKO fields do not lead to early-time stable fixed points. In this
work, using redefinition of variables, we show that ELKO cosmology admits
early-time stable fixed points. More interestingly, we show that ELKO cosmology
admit two sets of attractor points corresponding to slow and fast-roll
inflation. The fast-roll inflation attractor point is unqiue for ELKO as it is
independent of the form of the potential. We also discuss the plausible choice
of interaction terms in these two sets of attractor points and constraints on
the coupling constant.
