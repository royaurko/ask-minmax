The searches for heavy Higgs bosons and supersymmetric (SUSY) particles at
the LHC have left the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with an
unusual spectrum of SUSY particles, namely, all squarks are beyond a few TeV
while the Higgs bosons other than the one observed at 125 GeV could be
relatively light. In light of this, we study a scenario characterized by two
scales: the SUSY breaking scale or the squark-mass scale $(M_S)$ and the heavy
Higgs-boson mass scale $(M_A)$.We perform a survey of the MSSM parameter space
with $M_S < 10^{10}$ GeV and $M_A < 10^4$ GeV such that the lightest Higgs
boson mass is within the range of the observed Higgs boson as well as
satisfying a number of constraints. The set of constraints include the
invisible decay width of the $Z$ boson and that of the Higgs boson, the
chargino-mass limit, dark matter relic abundance from Planck, the
spin-independent cross section of direct detection by LUX, and gamma-ray flux
from dwarf spheroidal galaxies and gamma-ray line constraints measured by Fermi
LAT. Survived regions of parameter space feature the dark matter with correct
relic abundance, which is achieved through either coannihilation with
charginos, $A/H$ funnels, or both. We show that future measurements, e.g.,
XENON1T and LZ, of spin-independent cross sections can further squeeze the
parameter space.
