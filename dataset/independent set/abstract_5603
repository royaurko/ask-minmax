In this paper we present and start analyzing the iCub World data-set, an
object recognition data-set, we acquired using a Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
scheme and the iCub humanoid robot platform. Our set up allows for rapid
acquisition and annotation of data with corresponding ground truth. While more
constrained in its scopes -- the iCub world is essentially a robotics research
lab -- we demonstrate how the proposed data-set poses challenges to current
recognition systems. The iCubWorld data-set is publicly available. The data-set
can be downloaded from: http://www.iit.it/en/projects/data-sets.html.
