New lower bounds on the total variation distance between the distribution of
a sum of independent Bernoulli random variables and the Poisson random variable
(with the same mean) are derived via the Chen-Stein method. The new bounds rely
on a non-trivial modification of the analysis by Barbour and Hall (1984) which
surprisingly gives a significant improvement. A use of the new lower bounds is
addressed.
