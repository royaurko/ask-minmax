In previous papers, we studied the asymptotic behaviour of
$S_N(A,X)=(2N+1)^{-d/2}\sum_{n \in A_N} X_n,$ where $X$ is a centered,
stationary and weakly dependent random field, and $A_N=A \cap [-N,N]^d$, $A
\subset \mathbb{Z}^d$. This leads to the definition of asymptotically
measurable sets, which enjoy the property that $S_N(A;X)$ has a Gaussian weak
limit for any $X$ belonging to a certain class. Here we extend this type of
results to the case of weakly dependent triangular arrays and present an
application of this technique to regression models. Indeed, we prove that CLT
and related results hold for $X_n^N=\varphi(\xi_n^N,Y_n^N), n \in
\mathbb{Z}^d$, where $\varphi$ satisfies certain regularity conditions, $\xi$
and $Y$ are independent random fields, $\xi$ is weakly dependent and $Y$
satisfies some Strong Law of Large Numbers.
