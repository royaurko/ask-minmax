Recent surveys of multiplicity fluctuations, transverse momentum
fluctuations, and two-particle azimuthal correlations are presented for several
collision systems as a function of centrality and transverse momentum. Both
multiplicity and transverse momentum fluctuations exhibit a power law scaling
as a function of the number of participants that is independent of the
collision system. Although these observations are consistent with critical
behavior, the critical exponent $\eta$ measured using azimuthal correlations is
seen to be independent of centrality and collision system. Also observed in the
azimuthal correlations is a displaced away side peak in central Au+Au
collisions when the pairs are restricted to low transverse momentum.
