We consider an $n$-dimensional spherically symmetric, asymptotically
Euclidean manifold with two ends and a codimension 1 trapped set which is
degenerately hyperbolic. By separating variables and constructing a
semiclassical parametrix for a time scale polynomially beyond Ehrenfest time,
we show that solutions to the linear Schr\"odiner equation with initial
conditions localized on a spherical harmonic satisfy Strichartz estimates with
a loss depending only on the dimension $n$ and independent of the degeneracy.
The Strichartz estimates are sharp up to an arbitrary $\beta>0$ loss. This is
in contrast to \cite{ChWu-lsm}, where it is shown that solutions satisfy a
sharp local smoothing estimate with loss depending only on the degeneracy of
the trapped set, independent of the dimension.
