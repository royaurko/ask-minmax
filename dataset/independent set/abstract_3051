At pressure $\sim$ 25.7 bar the flux, $F$, carried by solid \4he for $T >$
100 mK depends on the net chemical potential difference between two reservoirs
in series with the solid, $\Delta \mu$, and obeys $F \sim (\Delta \mu)^b$,
where $b \approx 0.3$ is independent of temperature. At fixed $\Delta \mu$ the
temperature dependence of the flux, $F$, can be adequately represented by $F
\sim - \ln(T/\tau)$, $\tau \approx 0.6$ K, for $0.1 \leq T \leq 0.5$ K. A
single function $F = F_0(\Delta \mu)^b\ln(T/\tau)$ fits all of the available
data sets in the range 25.6 - 25.8 bar reasonably well. We suggest that the
mass flux in solid \4he for $T > 100$ mK may have a Luttinger liquid-like
behavior in this bosonic system.
