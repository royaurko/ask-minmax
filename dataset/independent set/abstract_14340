We show for each positive integer $a$ that, if $\mathcal{M}$ is a
minor-closed class of matroids not containing all rank-$(a+1)$ uniform
matroids, then there exists an integer $c$ such that either every rank-$r$
matroid in $\mathcal{M}$ can be covered by at most $r^c$ rank-$a$ sets, or
$\mathcal{M}$ contains the GF$(q)$-representable matroids for some prime power
$q$ and every rank-$r$ matroid in $\mathcal{M}$ can be covered by at most
$cq^r$ rank-$a$ sets. In the latter case, this determines the maximum density
of matroids in $\mathcal{M}$ up to a constant factor.
