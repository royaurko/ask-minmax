We study in which way Kolmogorov complexity and instance complexity affect
properties of r.e. sets. We show that the well-known 2log n upper bound on the
Kolmogorov complexity of initial segments of r.e.\ sets is optimal and
characterize the T-degrees of r.e. sets which attain this bound. The main part
of the paper is concerned with instance complexity of r.e. sets. We construct a
nonrecursive r.e. set with instance complexity logarithmic in the Kolmogorov
complexity. This refutes a conjecture of Ko, Orponen, Sch"oning, and Watanabe.
In the other extreme, we show that all wtt-complete set and all Q-complete sets
have infinitely many hard instances.
