We consider the cubic Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation (NLS) in one space
dimension, either focusing or defocusing. We prove that the solutions satisfy
a-priori local in time Hs bounds in terms of the Hs size of the initial data
for s >=-1/4 . This improves earlier results of Christ-Colliander-Tao [2] and
of the contributors [12]. The new ingredients are a localization in space and local
energy decay, which we hope to be of independent interest.
