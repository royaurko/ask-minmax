We analize the different ways for the spontaneous breaking of the gauge
symmetry, for the $[SU(6)]^3\otimes Z_3$ family unification model. In
particular we study the consequences of a previous selection for the vacuum
expectation values of the Higgs fields, showing that such set predicts unwanted
flavor changing neutral currents at the $m_Z=91 GeVs$ mass scale. A new set of
vacuum expectation values which solves this problem is proposed.
