Gaussian process surrogates of computationally expensive computer codes
provide fast statistical approximations to model physical processes. The
training of these surrogates depends on the set of design points chosen to run
the expensive simulator. However, such training set is bound to be limited and
quantifying the resulting uncertainty in the hyper-parameters of the emulator
by uni-modal distributions is likely to induce bias. This paper proposes a
computationally efficient sampler based on an extension of the Asymptotically
Independent Markov Sampling, a recently developed algorithm for Bayesian
inference and extended to optimisation problems. Structural uncertainty of the
emulator is obtained as a by-product of the Bayesian treatment of the
hyper-parameters. Model uncertainty is also acknowledged through numerical
stabilisation measures by including a nugget term in the formulation of the
probability model. The efficiency of the proposed sampler is illustrated in
examples where multi-modal distributions are encountered. For the purposes of
reproducibility, further development, and use in other applications, we made
the code used to generate the examples in this paper freely available for
