We provide a comprehensive model-independent analysis of rare decays
involving the b --> s transition to put constraints on dimension-six Delta(F)=1
effective operators. The constraints are derived from all the available
up-to-date experimental data from the B-factories, CDF and LHCb. The
implications and future prospects for observables in b --> s l+l- and b --> s
nu nu transitions in view of improved measurements are also investigated. The
present work updates and generalises previous studies providing, at the same
time, a useful tool to test the flavour structure of any theory beyond the SM.
