This expository paper, aimed at the reader without much background in set
theory or logic, gives an overview of Cohen's proof (via forcing) of the
independence of the continuum hypothesis. It emphasizes the broad outlines and
the intuitive motivation while omitting most of the proofs. The reader must of
course consult standard textbooks for the missing details, but this article
provides a map of the forest so that the beginner will not get lost while
forging through the trees.
