For Axiom A diffeomorphisms and equilibrium states, we prove a Large
deviations result for the sequence of successive return times into a fixed
Borel set, under some assumption on the boundary. Our result relies on and
extends the work by Chazottes and Leplaideur who considered cylinder sets of a
Markov partition.
