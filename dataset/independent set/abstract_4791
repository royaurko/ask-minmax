We consider some properties of the intersection of deleted digits Cantor sets
with their translates. We investigate conditions on the set of digits such
that, for any t between zero and the dimension of the deleted digits Cantor set
itself, the set of translations such that the intersection has Hausdorff
dimension equal to t is dense in the set F of translations such that the
intersection is non-empty. We make some simple observations regarding
properties of the set F, in particular, we characterize when F is an interval,
in terms of conditions on the digit set.
