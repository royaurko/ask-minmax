We study a class of Wilson Loops in N =4, D=4 Yang-Mills theory belonging to
the chiral ring of a N=2, d=1 subalgebra. We show that the expectation value of
these loops is independent of their shape. Using properties of the chiral ring,
we also show that the expectation value is identically 1. We find the same
result for chiral loops in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in three,
five and six dimensions. In seven dimensions, a generalized Konishi anomaly
gives an equation for chiral loops which closely resembles the loop equations
of the three dimensional Chern-Simons theory.
