In this paper the local order of convergence used in iterative methods to
solve nonlinear systems of equations is revisited, where shorter alternative
analytic proofs of the order based on developments of multilineal functions are
shown. Most important, an adaptive multi-precision arithmetics is used hereof,
where in each step the length of the mantissa is defined independently of the
knowledge of the root. Furthermore, generalizations of the one dimensional case
to m-dimensions of three approximations of computational order of convergence
are defined. Examples illustrating the previous results are given.
