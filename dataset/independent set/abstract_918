Weak gravitational lensing studies of clusters of galaxies provide
complimentary information to that from X-ray data; the measured signal depends
only on the cluster's projected mass, independent of dynamical assumptions.
Here we apply a maximum-entropy method algorithm for reconstructing the
two-dimensional density distribution to two sets of shear data for the high
redshift cluster MS1054-03, courtesy of Clowe et al (2000) and Hoekstra et al
(2000).
