Consider a tensor product of finite-dimensional irreducible gl_{N+1}-modules
and its decomposition into irreducible modules. The gl_{N+1} Gaudin model
assigns to each multiplicity space of that decomposition a commutative (Bethe)
algebra of linear operators acting on the multiplicity space. The Bethe ansatz
method is a method to find eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Bethe algebra.
One starts with a critical point of a suitable (master) function and constructs
an eigenvector of the Bethe algebra.
  In this paper we consider the algebra of functions on the critical set of the
associated master function and show that the action of this algebra on itself
is isomorphic to the action of the Bethe algebra on a suitable subspace of the
multiplicity space.
  As a byproduct we prove that the Bethe vectors corresponding to different
critical points of the master function are linearly independent and, in
particular, nonzero.
