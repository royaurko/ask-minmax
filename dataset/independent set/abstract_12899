We study the ergodic properties of a two-dimensional self-gravitating system
using molecular dynamics simulations and applying three tests for ergodicity: a
direct method comparing the time average of a particle momentum to ensemble
averages, sojourn times statistics for cells in momentum space and the
dynamical functional method. These methods are also applied to a short-range
interacting system for comparison purposes. Our results show a two-dimensional
self-gravitating system takes a very long time to establish ergodicity which is
independent on particle number, at variance with what is observed in a few
simplified models of long-range interacting systems.
