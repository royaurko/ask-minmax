Two recent papers (Ghez et al. 2008, Gillessen et al. 2009) have estimated
the mass of and the distance to the massive black hole in the center of the
Milky Way using stellar orbits. The two astrometric data sets are independent
and yielded consistent results, even though the measured positions do not match
when simply overplotting the two sets. In this letter we show that the two sets
can be brought to excellent agreement with each other when allowing for a small
offset in the definition of the reference frame of the two data sets. The
required offsets in the coordinates and velocities of the origin of the
reference frames are consistent with the uncertainties given in Ghez et al.
(2008). The so combined data set allows for a moderate improvement of the
statistical errors of mass of and distance to Sgr A*, but the overall
accuracies of these numbers are dominated by systematic errors and the
long-term calibration of the reference frame. We obtain R0 = 8.28 +- 0.15(stat)
+- 0.29(sys) kpc and M(MBH) = 4.30 +- 0.20(stat) +- 0.30(sys) x 10^6 Msun as
best estimates from a multi-star fit.
