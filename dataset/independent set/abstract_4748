Let (X, Z) be a continuous random vector. In this paper, we define the notion
of a nonparametric residual of X on Z that is always independent of the
predictor Z. We study its properties and show that the proposed notion of
residual matches with the usual residual (error) in a multivariate normal
regression model. Given a random vector (X, Y, Z), we use this notion of
residual to show that the conditional independence between X and Y, given Z, is
equivalent to the mutual independence of the residuals (of X on Z and Y on Z)
and Z. This result is used to develop a test for conditional independence.
