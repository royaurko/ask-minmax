The theory of decoherent histories is checked for the requirement of
statistical independence of subsystems. Strikingly, this is satisfied only when
the decoherence functional is diagonal in both its real a n d imaginary parts.
In particular, the condition of consistency (or weak decoherence) required for
the assignment of probabilities appears to be ruled out. The same conclusion is
obtained independently, by claiming a plausible dynamical robustness of
decoherent histories.
