In this paper, we introduce the topological structure of fuzzy parametrized
soft sets and fuzzy parametrized soft mappings. We define the notion of
quasi-coincidence for fuzzy parametrized soft sets and investigated basic
properties of it. We study the closure, interior, base, continuity and
compactness and properties of these concepts in fuzzy parametrized soft
topological spaces
