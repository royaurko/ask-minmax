We have found that the current- voltage characteristics of
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3(-delta)/Nb:SrTiO3 rectifying junctions are quantitatively
well-described by (thermally-assisted) tunneling with an effectively
temperature-independent Schottky barrier under no magnetic field, while those
of the oxygen deficient junction remarkably deviate from such a simple behavior
as magnetic field is applied. These results indicate a new form of
magnetoresistance arising from magnetic field changes of the interface band
diagram via the strong electron-spin coupling in manganites.
