We prove that any continuous and convex stationary ergodic Hamiltonian admits
critical subsolutions, which are strict outside the random Aubry set. They make
up, in addition, a dense subset of all critical subsolutions with respect to a
suitable metric. If the Hamiltonian is additionally assumed of Tonelli type,
then there exist strict subsolutions of class $\CC^{1,1}$ in $\R^N$. The proofs
are based on the use of Lax--Oleinik semigroups and their regularizing
properties in the stationary ergodic environment, as well as on a generalized
notion of Aubry set.
