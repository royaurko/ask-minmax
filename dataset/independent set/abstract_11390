Using the theory of extensors developed in a previous paper we present a
theory of the parallelism structure on arbitrary smooth manifold. Two kinds of
Cartan connection operators are introduced and both appear in intrinsic
versions (i.e., frame independent) of the first and second Cartan structure
equations. Also, the concept of deformed parallelism structures and relative
parallelism structures which play important role in the understanding of
geometrical theories of the gravitational field are investigated.
