We study the ergodic properties of Delone-Anderson operators, using the
framework of randomly coloured Delone sets and Delone dynamical systems. In
particular, we show the existence of the integrated density of states and,
under some assumptions on the geometric complexity of the underlying Delone
sets, we obtain information on the almost-sure spectrum of the family of random
operators. We then exploit these results to study the Lifshitz-tail behaviour
of the integrated density of states of a Delone-Anderson operator at the bottom
of the spectrum. Furthermore, we use Lifshitz-tail estimates as an input for
the multi-scale analysis to prove dynamical localization.
