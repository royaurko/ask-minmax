This is an exposition of much of Sections VI.3 and XVIII.3 of "Proper and
Improper Forcing", including preservations for "no random reals over V", "reals
of V form a non-meager set", "every dense open set contains a dense open set in
V", weak bounding, and weak $\omega^\omega$-bounding. The current version of
part I covering Sections VI.1 and VI.2 is available from the contributor.
