New data on high-pT spectra of J/psi measured by the CDF Collaboration at the
Tevatron are analyzed in the framework of z-scaling. F-dependence of
z-presentation of the data is used to construct the scaling function of J/psi.
The energy independence of the scaling function is used to predict inclusive
cross section of prompt J/psi production in bar pp collisions at high-pT. The
concept of z-scaling is considered to reflect the general features of high-pT
particle production in hadron-hadron and hadron-nucleus collisions. Violation
of z-scaling is suggested to consider as a signature of new physics.
