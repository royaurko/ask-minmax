A dependent theory is a (first order complete theory) T which does not have
the independence property. A main result here is: if we expand a model of T by
the traces on it of sets definable in a bigger model then we preserve its being
dependent. Another one justifies the cofinality restriction in the theorem
(from a previous work) saying that pairwise perpendicular indiscernible
sequences, can have arbitrary dual-cofinalities in some models containing them.
