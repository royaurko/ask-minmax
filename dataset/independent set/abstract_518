Multiple sets of synthetic spectra of OB-binary stars are used to test the
suitability of disentangling for deriving accurate spectroscopic orbits. Given
a set of spectra with broad phase coverage and sufficient total integration
time (almost independent of the number of spectra), it appears that
disentangling yields accurate and reliable semi-amplitudes of the spectroscopic
orbits (other parameters being fixed). Methods for estimating the uncertainties
on the derived semi-amplitudes are investigated.
