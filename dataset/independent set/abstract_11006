The centrality dependence of thermal parameters describing hadron
multiplicities and intermediate-mass dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions
at SPS and RHIC is analyzed. From experimental hadron multiplicities we deduce
evidence for strangeness saturation at high energy and maximum centrality. The
observed dilepton spectra can be parameterized by a centrality independent
temperature.
