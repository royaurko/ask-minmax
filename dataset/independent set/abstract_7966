We prove an operator-theoretic reconstruction of the Beilinson-Bloch
regulator for compact Riemann surfaces, using loop operators and the
Connes-Karoubi character for Fredholm modules. The proof includes a new
computation of the Connes-Karoubi character for Steinberg symbols of the
circle, which relies on the work of Helton and Howe but is independent of the
Carey-Pincus theory of joint torsion.
