We extend Goodwillie's classification of finitary linear functors to
arbitrary small functors. That is we show that every small linear simplicial
functor from spectra to simplicial sets is weakly equivalent to a filtered
colimit of representable functors represented in cofibrant spectra. Moreover,
we present this classification as a Quillen equivalence of the category of
small functors from spectra to simplicial sets equipped with the linear model
structure and the opposite of the pro-category of spectra with the strict model
structure.
