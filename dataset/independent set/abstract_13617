We develop differential calculus and gauge theory on a finite set G. An
elegant formulation is obtained when G is supplied with a group structure and
in particular for a cyclic group. Connes' two-point model (which is an
essential ingredient of his reformulation of the standard model of elementary
particle physics) is recovered in our approach. Reductions of the universal
differential calculus to `lower-dimensional' differential calculi are
considered. The `complete reduction' leads to a differential calculus on a
periodic lattice which is related to q-calculus.
