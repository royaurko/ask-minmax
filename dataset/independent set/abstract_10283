Several of the models for origin of the highest energy cosmic rays also
predict significant neutrino fluxes. A common factor of the models is that they
must provide sufficient power to supply the observed energy in the
extragalactic component of the cosmic radiation. The assumption that a
comparable amount of energy goes into high-energy neutrinos allows a
model-independent estimate of the neutrino signal that may be expected.
