In order to explain the recently reported result on the double beta decay
$(0\nu\beta\beta)$ experiment, together with the earlier established data on
LMA MSW solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations, we generate the textures
of the nearly degenerate as well as the inverted hierarchical models of the
left-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrices within the framework of the see-saw
mechanism in a model independent way.
 The leptonic mixings are generated from the texture of the right- handed
Majorana mass matrices while keeping the Dirac neutrino mass matrices in
diagonal forms.
