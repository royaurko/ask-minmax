We consider within a finite element approach the usage of different
adaptively refined meshes for different variables in systems of nonlinear,
time-depended PDEs. To resolve different solution behaviours of these
variables, the meshes can be independently adapted. The resulting linear
systems are usually much smaller, when compared to the usage of a single mesh,
and the overall computational runtime can be more than halved in such cases.
Our multi-mesh method works for Lagrange finite elements of arbitrary degree
and is independent of the spatial dimension. The approach is well defined, and
can be implemented in existing adaptive finite element codes with minimal
effort. We show computational examples in 2D and 3D ranging from dendritic
growth to solid-solid phase-transitions. A further application comes from fluid
dynamics where we demonstrate the applicability of the approach for solving the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with Lagrange finite elements of the
same order for velocity and pressure. The approach thus provides an easy to
implement alternative to stabilized finite element schemes, if Lagrange finite
elements of the same order are required.
