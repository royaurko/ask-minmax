Systems of germs of sets in infinite-dimensional spaces are introduced and
studied. Such a system corresponds to a local zero-set of an ideal of the ring
of analytic functions of infinite number of variables. Conversely, this system
of germs defines the ideal of germs of analytic functions vanishing on it. A
theorem of zeros is proved, stating that this ideal is the radical (in the
complex case) or real radical (in the real case) of the initial ideal.
