We continue the analysis of prime and semiprime operations over
one-dimensional domains started in \cite{Va}. We first show that there are no
bounded semiprime operations on the set of fractional ideals of a
one-dimensional domain. We then prove the only prime operation is the identity
on the set of ideals in semigroup rings where the ideals are minimally
generated by two or fewer elements. This is not likely the case in semigroup
rings with ideals of three or more generators since we are able to exhibit that
there is a non-identity prime operations on the set of ideals of
$k[[t^3,t^4,t^5]]$.
