A directed dominating set in a directed graph $D$ is a set $S$ of vertices of
$V$ such that every vertex $u \in V(D) \setminus S$ has an adjacent vertex $v$
in $S$ with $v$ directed to $u$. The directed domination number of $D$, denoted
by $\gamma(D)$, is the minimum cardinality of a directed dominating set in $D$.
The directed domination number of a graph $G$, denoted $\Gamma_d(G)$, which is
the maximum directed domination number $\gamma(D)$ over all orientations $D$ of
$G$. The directed domination number of a complete graph was first studied by
Erd\"{o}s [Math. Gaz. 47 (1963), 220--222], albeit in disguised form. We extend
this notion to directed domination of all graphs. If $\alpha$ denotes the
independence number of a graph $G$, we show that if $G$ is a bipartite graph,
we show that $\Gamma_d(G) = \alpha$. We present several lower and upper bounds
on the directed domination number.
