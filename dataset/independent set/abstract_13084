We analyze the response of an inertial two-level Unruh-DeWitt particle
detector coupled to a polymer quantized scalar field in four-dimensional
Minkowski spacetime, within first-order perturbation theory. Above a critical
rapidity $\beta_c \approx 1.3675$, independent of the polymer mass scale
$M_\star$, two drastic changes occur: (i) the detector's excitation rate
becomes nonvanishing; (ii) the excitation and de-excitation rates are of order
$M_\star$, for arbitrarily small detector energy gap. We argue that
qualitatively similar results hold for any Lorentz violating theory in which
field modes with spatial momentum $k$ have excitation energy of the form $|k|\
f(|k|/M_\star)$ where the function $f$ dips below unity.
