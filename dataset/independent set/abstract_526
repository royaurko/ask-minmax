For linear evolution control system described by
$\dot{x}=Ax(t)+Bu(t),x(0)=x_{0}$ ($A$ generates a strongly continuous semigroup
${S(t)}_{t\ge 0}$ in a Banach space $X$; $B$ is a linear unbounded operator),
the attainable set $K(t)$ is studied. Conditions of the independence of $t$ for
its closure $\bar{K(t)}$ are established. Controllability conditions for some
classes of evolution systems are obtained.
