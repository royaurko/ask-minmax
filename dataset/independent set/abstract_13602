The response of the QCD vacuum to quark chemical potentials on the order of
the pion mass is studied within the context of chiral perturbation theory. For
two colour QCD diquark condensation sets in when the baryon chemical potential
becomes larger than the pion mass. This leading order result is confirmed at
next to leading order. Next a set of massive spin-one vectors is included in
the effective Lagrangian and the vector masses are calculated at leading order.
Massless vector modes appear when the baryon chemical potential is equal to the
mass of the lightest vector at zero chemical potential. This suggest vector
condensation.
