Given a compact subset $F$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, the visible part $V_\theta F$
of $F$ from direction $\theta$ is the set of $x$ in $F$ such that the half-line
from $x$ in direction $\theta$ intersects $F$ only at $x$. It is suggested that
if $\dim_H F \geq 1$ then $\dim_H V_\theta F = 1$ for almost all $\theta$,
where $\dim_H$ denotes Hausdorff dimension. We confirm this when $F$ is a
self-similar set satisfying the convex open set condition and such that the
orthogonal projection of $F$ onto every line is an interval. In particular the
underlying similarities may involve arbitrary rotations and $F$ need not be
connected.
