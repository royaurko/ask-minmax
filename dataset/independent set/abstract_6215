For infinitely many primes $p=4k+1$ we give a slightly improved upper bound
for the maximal cardinality of a set $B\subset \ZZ_p$ such that the difference
set $B-B$ contains only quadratic residues. Namely, instead of the "trivial"
bound $|B|\leq \sqrt{p}$ we prove $|B|\leq \sqrt{p}-1$, under suitable
conditions on $p$. The new bound is valid for approximately three quarters of
the primes $p=4k+1$.
