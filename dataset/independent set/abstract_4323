Soft sets, as a mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainty, have recently
gained considerable attention, including some successful applications in
information processing, decision, demand analysis, and forecasting. To
construct new soft sets from given soft sets, some operations on soft sets have
been proposed. Unfortunately, such operations cannot keep all classical
set-theoretic laws true for soft sets. In this paper, we redefine the
intersection, complement, and difference of soft sets and investigate the
algebraic properties of these operations along with a known union operation. We
find that the new operation system on soft sets inherits all basic properties
of operations on classical sets, which justifies our definitions.
