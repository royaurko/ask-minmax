The change of the probability of proton emission in nuclear photoeffect due
to an intense coherent (laser) field is discussed near the threshold, where the
hindering effect of the Coulomb field of the remainder nucleus is essential.
The ratio of laser-assisted and laser free differential cross section is
deduced and found to be independent of the polarization state of the $\gamma $
field and the two types of initial nuclear state considered. The numerical
values of this ratio are given at some characteristic parameters of the intense
field.
