Univariate spline discrete quasi-interpolants (abbr. dQIs) are approximation
operators using B-spline expansions with coefficients which are linear
combinations of discrete values of the function to be approximated. When
working with nonuniform partitions, the main challenge is to find dQIs which
have both good approximation orders and bounded uniform norms independent of
the given partition. Near-best dQIs are obtained by minimizing an upper bound
of the infinite norm of dQIs depending on a certain number of free parameters,
thus reducing this norm. This paper is devoted to the study of some families of
near-best dQIs of approximation order 2.
