An inner model M is MINIMAL if there is a class A such that <M,A> is amenable
yet has no transitive proper elementary submodel. We study minimal universes in
the context of 0#. For example we prove: If 0# exists then there is an inner
model which is minimal and locally generic over L(i.e., every set in the inner
model is set-generic over L). This answers a question of Mack Stanley.
