Let $\CC$ be a Hom-finite triangulated 2-Calabi-Yau category with a
cluster-tilting object $T$. Under a constructibility condition we prove the
existence of a set $\mathcal G^T(\CC)$ of generic values of the cluster
character associated to $T$. If $\CC$ has a cluster structure in the sense of
Buan-Iyama-Reiten-Scott, $\mathcal G^T(\CC)$ contains the set of cluster
monomials of the corresponding cluster algebra. Moreover, these sets coincide
if $\mathcal C$ has finitely many indecomposable objects.
  When $\CC$ is the cluster category of an acyclic quiver and $T$ is the
canonical cluster-tilting object, this set coincides with the set of generic
variables previously introduced by the contributor in the context of acyclic cluster
algebras. In particular, it allows to construct $\Z$-linear bases in acyclic
cluster algebras.
