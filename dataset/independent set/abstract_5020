For every $n\in\N$, let $X_{1n},..., X_{nn}$ be independent copies of a
zero-mean Gaussian process $X_n=\{X_n(t), t\in T\}$. We describe all processes
which can be obtained as limits, as $n\to\infty$, of the process
$a_n(M_n-b_n)$, where $M_n(t)=\max_{i=1,...,n} X_{in}(t)$ and $a_n, b_n$ are
normalizing constants. We also provide an analogous characterization for the
limits of the process $a_nL_n$, where $L_n(t)=\min_{i=1,...,n} |X_{in}(t)|$.
