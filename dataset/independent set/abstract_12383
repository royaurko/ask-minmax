The entropy spectrum of a spherically symmetric black hole was derived via
the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule in Majhi and Vagenas's work. Extending
this work to charged and rotating black holes, we quantize the horizon area and
the entropy of an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) black hole via the
Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule and the adiabatic invariance. The result
shows the area spectrum and the entropy spectrum are respectively equally
spaced and independent on the parameters of the black hole.
