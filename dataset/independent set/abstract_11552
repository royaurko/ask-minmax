An extension of Drude model is proposed that accounts for spin and spin-orbit
interaction of charge carriers. Spin currents appear due to combined action of
the external electric field, crystal field and scattering of charge carriers.
The expression for spin Hall conductivity is derived for metals and
semiconductors that is independent of the scattering mechanism. In cubic
metals, spin Hall conductivity $\sigma_s$ and charge conductivity $\sigma_c$
are related through $\sigma_s = [2 \pi \hbar/(3mc^2)]\sigma_c^2$ with $m$ being
the bare electron mass. Theoretically computed value is in agreement with
experiment.
