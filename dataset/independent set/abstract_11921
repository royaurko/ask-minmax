We use a method of Buzzard to study p-adic families of different types of
modular forms - classical, over imaginary quadratic fields and totally real
fields. In the case of totally real fields of even degree, we get local
constancy of dimensions of spaces of fixed slope and varying weight. For
imaginary quadratic fields we obtain bounds independent of the weight on the
dimensions of such spaces.
