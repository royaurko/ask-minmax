We reply to a recent comment [arXiv:1002.2445] and describe why the chemical
potential conjugate to the mass of linear aggregates is not an independent
parameter in the ensemble that the total length is free to adjust. It is only
in the (unphysical) ensemble of fixed total polymer length that such a chemical
potential can act as an independent control parameter for the aggregate radius.
