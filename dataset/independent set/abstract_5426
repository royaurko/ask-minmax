A partition of the positive integers into sets $A$ and $B$ {\em avoids} a
set $S\subset\N$ if no two distinct elements in the same part have a sum in
$S$. If the partition is unique, $S$ is {\em uniquely avoidable.} For any
irrational $\alpha>1$, Chow and Long constructed a partition which avoids the
numerators of all convergents to $\alpha$, and conjectured that the set
$S_\alpha$ which this partition avoided was uniquely avoidable. We prove that
the set of numerators of convergents is uniquely avoidable if and only if the
continued fraction for $\alpha$ has infinitely many partial quotients equal to
1. We also construct the set $S_\alpha$ and show that it is always uniquely
avoidable.
