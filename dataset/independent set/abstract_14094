We present a method for estimating the edge of a two-dimensional bounded set,
given a finite random set of points drawn from the interior. The estimator is
based both on projections on C^1 bases and on extreme points of the point
process. We give conditions on the Dirichlet's kernel associated to the C^1
bases for various kinds of convergence and asymptotic normality. We propose a
method for reducing the negative bias and illustrate it by a simulation.
