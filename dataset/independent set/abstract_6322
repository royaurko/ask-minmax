A new tool to extract cross-identifications and radio continuum spectra from
radio catalogues contained in the VIZIER database of the CDS is presented. The
code can handle radio surveys at different frequencies with different
resolutions. It has been applied to 22 survey catalogues at 11 different
frequencies containing a total of 3.5 million sources, which resulted in over
700000 independent radio cross-identifications and ~67000 independent radio
spectra with more than two frequency points. A validation of the code has been
performed using independent radio cross-correlations from the literature. The
mean error of the determined spectral index is +-0.3. The code produces an
output of variable format that can easily be adapted to the purpose of the
user.
