In this paper, we determine completely the Lyubeznik numbers
$\lambda_{i,j}(A)$ of the local ring $A$ at the vertex of the affine cone over
a nonsingular projective variety $V$, where $V$ is defined over a field of
characteristic zero, in terms of the dimensions of the algebraic de Rham
cohomology spaces of $V$. In particular, we prove that these numbers are
intrinsic numerical invariants of $V$, even though a priori their definition
depends on an embedding into projective space. This provides supporting
evidence for a positive answer to the question of embedding-independence for
arbitrary varieties in characteristic zero, which is still open.
