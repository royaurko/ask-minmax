In this work we present an explicit representation of the orthonormal
Bernstein polynomials and demonstrate that they can be generated from a linear
combination of non-orthonormal Bernstein polynomials. In addition, we report a
set of $n$ Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue equations, where each of the $n$
eigenvalue equations have the orthonormal Bernstein polynomials of degree $n$
as their solution set. We also show that each of the $n$ Sturm-Liouville
operators are naturally self-adjoint. While the orthonormal Bernstein
polynomials can be used in a variety of different applications, we demonstrate
the utility of these polynomials here by using them in a generalized Fourier
series to approximate curves and surfaces. Using the orthonormal Bernstein
polynomial basis, we show that highly accurate approximations to curves and
surfaces can be obtained by using small sized basis sets. Finally, we
demonstrate how the orthonormal Bernstein polynomials can be used to find the
set of control points of Bezier curves or Bezier surfaces that best approximate
a function.
