Lattice formulation of Finite Baryon Density QCD is problematic from computer
simulation point of view; it is well known that for light quark masses the
reconstructed partition function fails to be positive in a wide region of
parameter space. For large bare quark masses, instead, it is possible to obtain
more sensible results; problems are still present but restricted to a small
region. We present evidence for a saturation transition independent from the
gauge coupling $\beta$ and for a transition line that, starting from the
temperature critical point at $\mu=0$, moves towards smaller $\beta$ with
increasing $\mu$ as expected from simplified phenomenological arguments.
