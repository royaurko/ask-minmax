The moduli space of stable bundles of rank 2 and degree 1 on a Riemann
surface has rational cohomology generated by the so-called universal classes.
The work of Baranovsky, King-Newstead, Siebert-Tian and Zagier provided a
complete set of relations between these classes, expressed in terms of a
recursion in the genus.
  This paper accomplishes the same thing for the non-compact moduli spaces of
Higgs bundles, in the sense of Hitchin and Simpson. There are many more
independent relations than for stable bundles, but in a sense the answer is
simpler, since the formulas are completely explicit, not recursive. The results
of Kirwan on equivariant cohomology for holomorphic circle actions are of key
importance.
  Together, Parts I and II describe the cohomology rings of spaces of rank 2
Higgs bundles at essentially the same level of detail as is known for stable
bundles.
