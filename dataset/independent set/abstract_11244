Hara and Smith independently proved that in a normal $\mQ$-Gorenstein ring of
characteristic $p \gg 0$, the test ideal coincides with the multiplier ideal
associated to the trivial divisor. We extend this result for a pair $(R,
\Delta)$ of a normal ring $R$ and an effective $\mQ$-Weil divisor $\Delta$ on
$\Spec R$. As a corollary, we obtain the equivalence of strongly F-regular
pairs and klt pairs.
