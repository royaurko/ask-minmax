We study the singular Bott-Chern classes introduced by Bismut, Gillet and
Soule. Singular Bott-Chern classes are the main ingredient to define direct
images for closed immersions in arithmetic K-theory. In this paper we give an
axiomatic definition of a theory of singular Bott-Chern classes, study their
properties, and classify all possible theories of this kind. We identify the
theory defined by Bismut, Gillet and Soule as the only one that satisfies the
additional condition of being homogeneous. We include a proof of the arithmetic
Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem for closed immersions that generalizes a
result of Bismut, Gillet and Soule and was already proved by Zha. This result
can be combined with the arithmetic Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem for
submersions to extend this theorem to projective morphisms. As a byproduct of
this study we obtain two results of independent interest. First, we prove a
Poincare lemma for the complex of currents with fixed wave front set, and
second we prove that certain direct images of Bott-Chern classes are closed.
