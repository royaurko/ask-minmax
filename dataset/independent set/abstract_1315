In D-brane models, different part of the 4-dimensional gauge group might
originate from D-branes wrapping different cycles in the internal space, and
then the standard model gauge couplings at the compactification scale are
determined by different cycle-volume moduli. We point out that those
cycle-volume moduli can naturally have universal vacuum expectation values up
to small deviations suppressed by 1/8\pi^2 if they are stabilized by KKLT-type
non-perturbative superpotential. This dynamical unification of gauge couplings
is independent of the detailed form of the moduli K\"ahler potential, but
relies crucially on the existence of low energy supersymmetry. If supersymmetry
is broken by an uplifting brane as in KKLT compactification, again
independently of the detailed form of the moduli K\"ahler potential, the
moduli-mediated gaugino masses at the compactification scale are universal
also, and are comparable to the anomaly-mediated gaugino masses. As a result,
both the gauge coupling unification at high energy scale and the mirage
mediation pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking masses are achieved naturally
even when the different sets of the standard model gauge bosons originate from
D-branes wrapping different cycles in the internal space.
