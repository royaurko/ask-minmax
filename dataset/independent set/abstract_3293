We study the effects of Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV) in the scalar lepton
sector of the MSSM on precision observables such as the W-boson mass and the
effective weak leptonic mixing angle, and on the Higgs-boson mass predictions.
The slepton mass matrices are parameterized in a model-independent way by a
complete set of dimensionless parameters which we constrain through LFV decay
processes and the precision observables. We find regions where both conditions
are similarly constraining. The necessary prerequisites for the calculation
have been added to FeynArts and FormCalc and are thus publicly available for
further studies. The obtained results are available in FeynHiggs.
