Finite type invariants (also known as Vassiliev invariants) of pure braids
are considered from a group-theoretic point of view. New results include a
construction of a universal invariant with integer coefficients based on the
Magnus expansion of a free group and a calculation of numbers of independent
invariants of each type for all pure braid groups.
