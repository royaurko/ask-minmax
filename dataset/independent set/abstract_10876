In the effective field theory framework, we consider the effect of
supersymmetry breaking via gaugino condensation and supergravity in the hidden
sector gauge group on the hidden sector vacuum angle $\theta_h$. The $\theta_h$
parameter dependence of the potential yields phenomenologically acceptable
invisible axion solutions if the $U(1)_R$ symmetry is broken down to a discrete
subgroup $Z_N$ with $N\ge 3$ (N=4 is marginal). Anomalous U(1) superstring
models are good candidates for this invisible axion resolution of the strong CP
puzzle.
