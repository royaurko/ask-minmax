We extract two-photon exchange amplitudes for the elastic electron-proton
scattering at Q^2=2.5 GeV^2 from the unpolarized cross-section and recent
polarization transfer measurements. There are three independent amplitudes, but
only one of them, \delta G_M, can be determined with a reasonable
accuracy(about 10%). The result is in good agreement with theoretical
predictions. Rough estimates for two other amplitudes are obtained.
