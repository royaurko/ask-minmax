Despite large uncertainties in the $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ transverse momentum
($q_T$) distributions for $q_T\lsim 10$ GeV, the ratio of the distributions
varys little. The uncertainty in the ratio of $W$ to $Z$ $q_T$ distributions is
on the order of a few percent, independent of the details of the
nonperturbative parameterization.
