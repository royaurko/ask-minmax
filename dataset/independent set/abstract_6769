In this article, we investigate the existence of joins in the weak order of
an infinite Coxeter group W. We give a geometric characterization of the
existence of a join for a subset X in W in terms of the inversion sets of its
elements and their position relative to the imaginary cone. Finally, we discuss
inversion sets of infinite reduced words and the notions of biconvex and
biclosed sets of positive roots.
