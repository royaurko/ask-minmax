At present, restrictions on the spin-independent parameter space of WIMP dark
matter searches have been limited to the results provided by relatively heavy
nuclei experiments, based on the conventional wisdom that only such experiments
can provide significant spin-independent limits. We examine this wisdom,
showing that light nuclei experiments can in fact provide comparable limits
given comparable exposures, and indicating the potential of light nuclei
detectors to simultaneously and competitively contribute to the search for both
spin-independent and -dependent WIMP dark matter.
