We introduce two partially ordered sets, $P^A_n$ and $P^B_n$, of the same
cardinalities as the type-A and type-B noncrossing partition lattices. The
ground sets of $P^A_n$ and $P^B_n$ are subsets of the symmetric and the
hyperoctahedral groups, consisting of permutations which avoid certain
patterns. The order relation is given by (strict) containment of the descent
sets. In each case, by means of an explicit order-preserving bijection, we show
that the poset of restricted permutations is an extension of the refinement
order on noncrossing partitions. Several structural properties of these
permutation posets follow, including self-duality and the strong Sperner
property. We also discuss posets $Q^A_n$ and $Q^B_n$ similarly associated with
noncrossing partitions, defined by means of the excedence sets of suitable
pattern-avoiding subsets of the symmetric and hyperoctahedral groups.
