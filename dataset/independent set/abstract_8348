For every symmetrically normed ideal $\mathcal{E}$ of compact operators, we
give a criterion for the existence of a continuous singular trace on
$\mathcal{E}$. We also give a criterion for the existence of a continuous
singular trace on $\mathcal{E}$ which respects Hardy-Littlewood majorization.
We prove that the class of all continuous singular traces on $\mathcal{E}$ is
strictly wider than the class of continuous singular traces which respect
Hardy-Littlewood majorization. We establish a canonical bijection between the
set of all traces on $\mathcal{E}$ and the set of all symmetric functionals on
the corresponding sequence ideal. Similar results are also proved in the
setting of semifinite von Neumann algebras.
