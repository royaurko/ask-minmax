A representation of the SO(3) group is mapped into a maximally entangled two
qubit state according to literatures. To show the evolution of the entangled
state, a model is set up on an maximally entangled electron pair, two electrons
of which pass independently through a rotating magnetic field. It is found that
the evolution path of the entangled state in the SO(3) sphere breaks an odd or
even number of times, corresponding to the double connectedness of the SO(3)
group. An odd number of breaks leads to an additional $\pi$ phase to the
entangled state, but an even number of breaks does not. A scheme to trace the
evolution of the entangled state is proposed by means of entangled photon pairs
and Kerr medium, allowing observation of the additional $\pi$ phase.
