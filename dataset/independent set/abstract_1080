By modeling a linear, anisotropic and inhomogeneous magnetodielectric medium
with two independent set of harmonic oscillators, electromagnetic field is
quantized in such a medium. The electric and magnetic polarizations of the
medium are expressed as linear combinations of the ladder operators describing
the magnetodielectric medium. The Maxwell and the constitutive equations of the
medium are obtained as the Heisenberg equations of the total system. The
electric and magnetic susceptibilities of the medium are obtained in terms of
the tensors coupling the medium with the electromagnetic field. The explicit
forms of the electromagnetic field operators are obtained in terms of the
ladder operators of the medium.
