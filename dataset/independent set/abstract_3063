The distribution of returns in financial time series exhibits heavy tails. In
empirical studies, it has been found that gaps between the orders in the order
book lead to large price shifts and thereby to these heavy tails. We set up an
agent based model to study this issue and, in particular, how the gaps in the
order book emerge. The trading mechanism in our model is based on a
double-auction order book, which is used on nearly all stock exchanges. In
situations where the order book is densely occupied with limit orders we do not
observe fat-tailed distributions. As soon as less liquidity is available, a gap
structure forms which leads to return distributions with heavy tails. We show
that return distributions with heavy tails are an order-book effect if the
available liquidity is constrained. This is largely independent of the specific
trading strategies.
