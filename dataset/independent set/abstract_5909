We establish that if a scheme can control a time-independent system
arbitrarily coupled to a generic finite bath over a short period of time $T$
with control precision $O(T^{N+1})$, it can also realize the control with the
same order of precision on smoothly time-dependent systems. This result extends
the validity of various universal dynamical control schemes to arbitrary
analytically time-dependent systems.
