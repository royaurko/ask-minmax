We consider $n$ independent, identically distributed one-dimensional Brownian
motions, $B_j(t)$, where $B_j(0)$ has a rapidly decreasing, smooth density
function $f$. The empirical quantiles, or pointwise order statistics, are
denoted by $B_{j:n}(t)$, and we are interested in a sequence of quantiles
$Q_n(t) = B_{j(n):n}(t)$, where $j(n)/n \to \alpha \in (0,1)$. This sequence
converges in probability in $C[0,\infty)$ to $q(t)$, the $\alpha$-quantile of
the law of $B_j(t)$. Our main result establishes the convergence in law in
$C[0,\infty)$ of the fluctuation processes $F_n = n^{1/2}(Q_n - q)$. The limit
process $F$ is a centered Gaussian process and we derive an explicit formula
for its covariance function. We also show that $F$ has many of the same local
properties as $B^{1/4}$, the fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H
= 1/4$. For example, it is a quartic variation process, it has H\"older
continuous paths with any exponent $\gamma < 1/4$, and (at least locally) it
has increments whose correlation is negative and of the same order of magnitude
as those of $B^{1/4}$.
