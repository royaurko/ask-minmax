We propose a kinematical enhancement of the t tbar charge asymmetry at the
LHC by selecting events with the t tbar centre of mass frame highly boosted
along the beam axis. This kinematical selection increases the asymmetries and
their significance up to a factor of two in a rather model-independent fashion.
Hence, it can be a perfect complement to enhance model discrimination at the
LHC.
