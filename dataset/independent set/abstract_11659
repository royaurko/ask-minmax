Bit error rate (BER) prediction over channel realisations has emerged as an
active research area. In this paper, we give analytical signal to interference
and noise ratio (SINR) evaluation of MIMO-OFDM systems using an iterative
receiver. Using this analytical SINR expression, we propose an accurate BER
prediction method based on effective exponential SINR mapping (EESM) method. We
show by simulations that our method is independent of the channel realisation
and of the MIMO scheme. It is only dependent on the modulation and coding
scheme.
