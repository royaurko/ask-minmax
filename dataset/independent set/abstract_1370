We perform an integral reduction for the 3-loop effective gauge coupling and
screening mass of QCD at high temperatures, defined as matching coefficients
appearing in the dimensionally reduced effective field theory (EQCD).
Expressing both parameters in terms of a set master (sum-) integrals, we show
explicit gauge parameter independence. The lack of suitable methods for solving
the comparatively large number of master integrals forbids the complete
evaluation at the moment. Taking one generic class of masters as an example, we
highlight the calculational techniques involved. The full result would allow to
improve on one of the classic probes for the convergence of the weak-coupling
expansion at high temperatures, namely the comparison of full and effective
theory determinations of the spatial string tension. Furthermore, the full
result would also allow to determine one new contribution of order O(g**7) to
the pressure of hot QCD.
