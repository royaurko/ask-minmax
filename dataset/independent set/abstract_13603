We study the quark-antiquark potential of quenched SU(3) lattice gauge theory
with the Luescher-Weisz action. After blocking the gauge fields with the
recently proposed hypercubic transformation we compute the Sommer parameter,
extract the lattice spacing a and set the scale at 6 different values of the
gauge coupling in a range from a = 0.084 fm to 0.136 fm.
