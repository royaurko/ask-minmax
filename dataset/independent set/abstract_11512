The physical meaning of the EPR--chameleon experiment proposed in
AcRe00b,AcRe01a, in which the EPR correlations are reproduced by local,
independent, deterministic choices is re-examined. In addition we extend the
mathematical model of AcRe00b,AcRe01a by showing that the dynamics considered
there is effectively the reduced dynamics of a fully reversible evolution. We
also propose a new protocol, more directly corresponding to real experiments,
in which the local computers only send back to the central one the results of
the evaluation of $\pm1$--valued functions. The program to run the experiment
is available from the WEB-page: http://volterra.mat.uniroma2.it.
