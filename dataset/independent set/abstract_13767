We characterize the three-dimensional spaces admitting at least six or at
least seven equidistant points. In particular, we show the existence of
$C^\infty$ norms on $\R^3$ admitting six equidistant points, which refutes a
conjecture of Lawlor and Morgan (1994, Pacific J. Math \textbf{166}, 55--83),
and gives the existence of energy-minimizing cones with six regions for certain
uniformly convex norms on $\R^3$. On the other hand, no differentiable norm on
$\R^3$ admits seven equidistant points. A crucial ingredient in the proof is a
classification of all three-dimensional antipodal sets. We also apply the
results to the touching numbers of several three-dimensional convex bodies.
