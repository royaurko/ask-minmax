In the dark energy star picture a compact object is transparent at radio and
optical frequencies, and acts as a defocusing lens. Thus the object itself
appears as a luminous disk whose surface brightness reflects the surface
brightness of the background. In the case of rotating dark energy stars the
image will also contain background independent emission features. In this note
we provide simple analytic formulae for the separation of these features as a
function of angular momentum and viewing angle. In the case of rapid rotation
these features will appear to lie within the shadow expected if the compact
object were a black hole.
