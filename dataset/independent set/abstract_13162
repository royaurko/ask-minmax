We compare the large scale galaxy clustering between the North and South SDSS
early data release (EDR) and also with the clustering in the APM Galaxy Survey.
The three samples are independent and cover an area of 150, 230 and 4300 square
degrees respectively. We combine SDSS data in different ways to approach the
APM selection. Given the good photometric calibration of the SDSS data and the
very good match of its North and South number counts, we combine them in a
single sample. The joint clustering is compared with equivalent subsamples in
the APM. The final sampling errors are small enough to provide an independent
test for some of the results in the APM. We find evidence for an inflection in
the shape of the 2-point function in the SDSS which is very similar to what is
found in the APM. This feature has been interpreted as evidence for non-linear
gravitational growth. By studying higher order correlations, we can also
confirm good agreement with the hypothesis of Gaussian initial conditions (and
small biasing) for the structure traced by the large scale SDSS galaxy
distribution.
