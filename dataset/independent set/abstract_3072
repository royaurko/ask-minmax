This work presents a new inclusive search for supersymmetry (SUSY) by the
ATLAS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass
energy sqrt(s) = 7 TeV in final states with jets, missing transverse momentum
and one or more isolated electrons and/or muons. The search is based on data
from the full 2011 data-taking period, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 4.7 inverse fb. Single- and multi-lepton channels are treated
together in one analysis. An increase in sensitivity is obtained by
simultaneously fitting the number of events in statistically independent signal
regions, and the shapes of distributions within those regions. A dedicated
signal region is introduced to be sensitive to decay cascades of SUSY particles
with small mass differences ("compressed SUSY"). Background uncertainties are
constrained by fitting to the jet multiplicity distribution in background
control regions. Observations are consistent with Standard Model expectations,
and limits are set or extended on a number of SUSY models.
