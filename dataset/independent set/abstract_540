We study invariants of three-qubit states under local unitary
transformations, i.e. functions on the space of entanglement types, which is
known to have dimension 6. We show that there is no set of six independent
polynomial invariants of degree less than or equal to 6, and find such a set
with maximum degree 8. We describe an intrinsic definition of a canonical state
on each orbit, and discuss the (non-polynomial) invariants associated with it.
