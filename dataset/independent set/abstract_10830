We report on how a straightforward (albeit technically involved) analytic
study of the 1-loop effective potential in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model, modifies the usual electroweak symmetry breaking conditions involving
$\tan \beta$ and the other free parameters of the model. The study implies new
constraints which (in contrast with the existing ones like $1 \leq \tan \beta
\leq m_t/m_b$) are fully model-independent and exclude more restrictively a
region around $\tan \beta \sim 1$. Further results of this study will be only
touched upon here.
