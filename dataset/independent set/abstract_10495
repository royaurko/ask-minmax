We give a new sampling algorithm for the Potts model based on the
Fortuin-Kasteleyn transformation. The method produces independent samples and
sums up a large number of configurations for each sweep. The partition function
and thermodynamic averages for all values of the temperature can be computed
from a single run. We compare the results with exact 2D Ising model.
