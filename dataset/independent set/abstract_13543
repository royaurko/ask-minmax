Far-Infrared (FIR) photometry from the the Photodetector Array Camera and
Spectrometer (PACS) on the Herschel Space Observatory is presented for 313
nearby, hard X-ray selected galaxies from the 58-month Swift Burst Alert
Telescope (BAT) Active Galactic catalog. The present data do not distinguish
between the FIR luminosity distributions at 70 and 160um for Seyfert 1 and
Seyfert 2 galaxies. This result suggests that if the FIR emission is from the
nuclear obscuring material surrounding the accretion disk, then it emits
isotropically, independent of orientation. Alternatively, a significant
fraction of the 70 and 160um could be from star formation, independent of AGN
type. Using a non-parametric test for partial correlation with censored data,
we find a statistically significant correlation between the AGN intrinsic power
(in the 14-195 keV band ) and the FIR emission at 70 and 160um for Seyfert 1
galaxies. We find no correlation between the 14-195 keV and FIR luminosities in
Seyfert 2 galaxies. The observed correlations suggest two possible scenarios:
(i) if we assume that the FIR luminosity is a good tracer of star formation,
then there is a connection between star formation and the AGN at sub-kiloparsec
scales, or (ii) dust heated by the AGN has a statistically significant
contribution to the FIR emission. Using a Spearman rank-order analysis, the
14-195 keV luminosities for the Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies are weakly
statistically correlated with the F70/F160 ratios.
