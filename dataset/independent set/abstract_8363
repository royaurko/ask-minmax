Let $1\le n\in\Z$. {\it Worst-case efficient dominating sets in digraphs} are
conceived so that their presence in certain strong digraphs $\vec{ST}_n$
corresponds to that of efficient dominating sets in star graphs $ST_n$: The
fact that the star graphs $ST_n$ form a so-called dense segmental neighborly
E-chain is reflected in a corresponding fact for the digraphs $\vec{ST}_n$.
Related chains of graphs and open problems are presented as well.
