The purpose of this note is to describe, in terms of a power series, the
distribution function of the exponential functional, taken at some independent
exponential time, of a spectrally negative L\'evy process \xi with unbounded
variation. We also derive a Geman-Yor type formula for Asian options prices in
a financial market driven by e^\xi.
