This paper presents correct algorithms for answering the following two
questions; (i) Does there exist a causal explanation consistent with a set of
background knowledge which explains all of the observed independence facts in a
sample? (ii) Given that there is such a causal explanation what are the causal
relationships common to every such causal explanation?
