We discuss the dependence of set-valued dynamical systems on parameters.
Under mild assumptions which are often satisfied for random dynamical systems
with bounded noise and control systems, we establish the fact that topological
bifurcations of minimal invariant sets are discontinuous with respect to the
Hausdorff metric, taking the form of lower semi-continuous explosions and
instantaneous appearances. We also characterise these transitions by properties
of Morse-like decompositions.
