We calculate the magnetization of a two-dimensional superconductor in a
perpendicular magnetic field near its Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and at
lower temperatures. We find that the critical behavior is more complex than
assumed in the literature and that, in particular, the critical magnetization
is {\it not} field independent as naive scaling predicts. In the low
temperature phase we find a substantial fluctuation renormalization of the
mean-field result. We compare our analysis with the data on the cuprates.
