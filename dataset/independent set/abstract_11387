We investigate the behavior of the Green functions of Schroedinger operators
near the diagonal. The only non-trivial cases, where the on-diagonal
singularities are non-zero and do not depend on the spectral parameter, are two
and three dimensions. In the case of two dimensions, we show that the
singularity is independent of both the scalar and the gauge potentials. In
dimension three, we obtain conditions for preserving the singularity under
perturbations by non-regular potentials. Some examples illustrating dependence
of the singularity on general scalar and gauge potentials are presented.
