Research on model selection in the context of stochastic differential
equations (SDE's) is almost non-existent in the literature. In particular, when
a system of SDE's is considered, as in random effects models, the problem of
model selection has not been hitherto investigated.
  In this article, we consider a system of SDE's for modeling random effects,
and address the question of model selection using Bayes factors. Specifically,
we develop the asymptotic theory of Bayes factors when the observed processes
associated with the systems of SDE's are independently and identically
distributed, as well as when they are independently but not identically
distributed.
