We present an analysis of the effects of beam deconvolution on noise
properties in CMB measurements. The analysis is built around the artDeco beam
deconvolver code. We derive a low-resolution noise covariance matrix that
describes the residual noise in deconvolution products, both in harmonic and
pixel space. The matrix models the residual correlated noise that remains in
time-ordered data after destriping, and the effect of deconvolution on it. To
validate the results, we generate noise simulations that mimic the data from
the Planck LFI instrument. A $\chi^2$ test for the full 70 GHz covariance in
multipole range $\ell=0-50$ yields a mean reduced $\chi^2$ of 1.0037. We
compare two destriping options, full and independent destriping, when
deconvolving subsets of available data. Full destriping leaves substantially
less residual noise, but leaves data sets intercorrelated. We derive also a
white noise covariance matrix that provides an approximation of the full noise
at high multipoles, and study the properties on high-resolution noise in pixel
space through simulations.
