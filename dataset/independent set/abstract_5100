Since the theory developed by Georg Cantor, mathematicians have taken a sharp
interest in the sizes of infinite sets. We know that the set of integers is
infinitely countable and that its cardinality is Aleph0. Cantor proved in 1891
with the diagonal argument that the set of real numbers is uncountable and that
there cannot be any bijection between integers and real numbers. Cantor states
in particular the Continuum Hypothesis. In this paper, I show that the
cardinality of the set of real numbers is the same as the set of integers. I
show also that there is only one dimension for infinite sets, Aleph.
