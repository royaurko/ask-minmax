Magnetic and transport properties of Ge(1-x-y)Mn(x)Eu(y)Te crystals with
chemical compositions 0.041 < x < 0.092 and 0.010 < y < 0.043 are studied.
Ferromagnetic order is observed at 150 < T < 160 K. Aggregation of magnetic
ions into clusters is found to be the source of almost constant, composition
independent Curie temperatures in our samples. Magnetotransport studies show
the presence of both negative (at T < 25 K) and linear positive (for 25<T <200
K) magnetoresistance effects (with amplitudes not exceeding 2%) in the studied
alloy. Negative magnetoresistance detected at T < 25 K is found to be due to a
tunneling of spin-polarized electrons between ferromagnetic clusters. A linear
positive magnetoresistance is identified to be geometrical effect related with
the presence of ferromagnetic clusters inside semiconductor matrix. The product
of the polarization constant and the inter-grain exchange constant, J_P, varies
between about 0.13 meV and 0.99 meV. Strong anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is
observed for T < T_C with coefficients R_S independent of temperature. The
scaling analysis of the AHE leads to a conclusion that this effect is due to a
skew scattering mechanism.
