If the Higgs is produced with a large enough cross section in the {\em
exclusive} reaction $p + \bar{p} \to p + H + \bar{p}$ it will give rise to a
peak at $M_H$ in the {\em missing mass} ($MM$) spectrum, calculated from the
4-momenta of the beam particles and the outgoing $p$ and $\bar{p}$. The
resolution in $MM$ can be approximately 250 MeV, independent of $M_H$ from 100
GeV to 200 GeV. This high resolution makes a search feasible over nearly this
full mass range at the Tevatron with 15 fb$^{-1}$ as hoped for in Run II.
