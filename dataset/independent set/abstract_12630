Microresonator-based optical frequency combs have been a topic of extensive
research during the last few years. Several theoretical models for the comb
generation have been proposed; however, they do not comprehensively address
experimental results that show a variety of independent comb generation
mechanisms. Here, we present frequency-domain experiments that illuminate the
transition of microcombs into phase-locked states, which show characteristics
of injection locking between ensembles of comb modes. In addition, we
demonstrate the existence of equidistant optical frequency combs that are phase
stable but with non-deterministic phase relationships between individual comb
modes.
