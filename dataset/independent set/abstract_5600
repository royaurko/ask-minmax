We study the growth of polynomials on semialgebraic sets. For this purpose we
associate a graded algebra to the set, and address all kinds of questions about
finite generation. We show that for a certain class of sets, the algebra is
finitely generated. This implies that the total degree of a polynomial
determines its growth on the set, at least modulo bounded polynomials. We
however also provide several counterexamples, where there is no connection
between total degree and growth. In the plane, we give a complete answer to our
questions for certain simple sets, and we provide a systematic construction for
examples and counterexamples. Some of our counterexamples are of particular
interest for the study of moment problems, since none of the existing methods
seems to be able to decide the problem there. We finally also provide new
three-dimensional sets, for which the algebra of bounded polynomials is not
finitely generated.
