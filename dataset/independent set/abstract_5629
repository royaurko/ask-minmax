Motivation: High-throughput proteomics techniques, such as mass spectrometry
(MS)-based approaches, produce very high-dimensional data-sets. In a clinical
setting one is often interested how MS spectra differ between patients of
different classes, for example spectra from healthy patients vs. spectra from
patients having a particular disease. Machine learning algorithms are needed to
(a) identify these discriminating features and (b) classify unknown spectra
based on this feature set. Since the acquired data is usually noisy, the
algorithms should be robust to noise and outliers, and the identified feature
set should be as small as possible.
  Results: We present a new algorithm, Sparse Proteomics Analysis (SPA), based
on the theory of Compressed Sensing that allows to identify a minimal
discriminating set of features from mass spectrometry data-sets. We show how
our method performs on artificial and real-world data-sets.
