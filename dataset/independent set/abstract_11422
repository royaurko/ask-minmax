The effect of noise on a rotational mode of a pendulum excited kinematically
in vertical direction has been analyzed. We have shown that for a weak noise
transitions from oscillations to rotations and vice versa are possible. For a
moderate noise level dynamics of the system is governed by a combination of the
excitation amplitude and stochastic component. Consequently for stronger noise
the rotational solution as an independent sychonized mode has vanished.
