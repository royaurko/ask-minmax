A dialectical rough set theory focussed on the relation between roughly
equivalent objects and classical objects was introduced in \cite{AM699} by the
present contributor. The focus of our investigation is on elucidating the minimal
conditions on the nature of granularity, underlying semantic domain and nature
of the general rough set theories (RST) involved for possible extension of the
semantics to more general RST on a paradigm. On this basis we also formulate a
program in dialectical rough set theory. The dialectical approach provides
better semantics in many difficult cases and helps in formalising a wide
variety of concepts and notions that remain untamed at meta levels in the usual
approaches. This is a brief version of a more detailed forthcoming paper by the
present contributor.
