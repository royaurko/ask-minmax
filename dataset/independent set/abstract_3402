We exactly analyze the vibrational properties of a chain of harmonic
oscillators in contact with local Langevin heat baths. Nonequilibrium
steady-state fluctuations are found to be described by a set of
mode-temperatures, independent of the strengths of both the harmonic
interaction and the viscous damping. Energy is equally distributed between the
conjugate variables of a given mode but differently among different modes, in a
manner which depends exclusively on the bath temperatures and on the boundary
conditions. We outline how bath-temperature profiles can be designed to enhance
or reduce fluctuations at specific frequencies in the power spectrum of the
chain length.
