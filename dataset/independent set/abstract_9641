We show the density of eigenvalues for three classes of random matrix
ensembles is determinantal. First we derive the density of eigenvalues of
product of $k$ independent $n\times n$ matrices with i.i.d. complex Gaussian
entries with a few of matrices being inverted. In second example we calculate
the same for (compatible) product of rectangular matrices with i.i.d. Gaussian
entries and in last example we calculate for product of independent truncated
unitary random matrices. We derive exact expressions for limiting expected
empirical spectral distributions of above mentioned ensembles.
