Let A be a subset of a finite abelian group G. We say that A is sum-free if
there is no solution of the equation x + y = z, with x, y, z belonging to the
set A. Let SF(G) denotes the set of all sum-free subets of $G$ and $\sigma(G)$
denotes the number $ n^{-1}(\log_2 |SF(G)|) $. In this article we shall improve
the error term in the asymptotic formula of $\sigma(G)$ which was obtained
recently by Ben Green and Ruzsa. The methods used are a slight refinement of
methods developed by Ben Green and Ruzsa.
