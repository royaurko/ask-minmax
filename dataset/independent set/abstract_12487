We study the amplitude for the spin-dependent WIMP scattering off nuclei by
including the leading long-range two-body currents in the most important
isovector contribution. We show that such effects are essentially independent
of the target nucleus and, as a result, they can be treated as a mere
renormalization of the effective nucleon cross section or, equivalently, of the
corresponding effective coupling with values around 25%.
