The notions of a proper dyadic subbase and an independent subbase was
introduced by H. Tsuiki to investigate in {0, 1, bot}-sequence codings of
topological spaces. We show that every separable metrizable space has a proper
dyadic subbase whose restriction to the perfect set defined by the
Cantor-Bendixson theorem forms an independent subbase of the restricted space.
