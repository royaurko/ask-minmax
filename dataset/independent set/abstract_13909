For every space $X$ let $\mathcal K(X)$ be the set of all compact subsets of
$X$. Christensen \cite{c:74} proved that if $X, Y$ are separable metrizable
spaces and $F\colon\mathcal{K}(X)\to\mathcal{K}(Y)$ is a monotone map such that
any $L\in\mathcal{K}(Y)$ is covered by $F(K)$ for some $K\in\mathcal{K}(X)$,
then $Y$ is complete provided $X$ is complete. It is well known \cite{bgp} that
this result is not true for non-separable spaces. In this paper we discuss some
additional properties of $F$ which guarantee the validity of Christensen's
result for more general spaces.
