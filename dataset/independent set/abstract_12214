Lattice model of directed self avoiding walk is used to investigate
adsorption properties of a semiflexible sequential copolymer chain on an
impenetrable curved surface on a hexagonal lattice in two dimensions. Walks of
the copolymer chains are directed in a direction away from the surface at a
suitable value of monomer surface attraction, the copolymer chain gets adsorbed
on the surface. To calculate exact value of monomer surface attraction, the
directed walk model have been solved analytically using generating function
method to discuss results when one type monomer of the copolymer chain has
attractive, repulsive or no interaction with the surface. Results obtained show
that adsorption transition point is independent of bending energy of the
copolymer chain.
