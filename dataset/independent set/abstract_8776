We give the class of finite groups which arise as the permutation groups of
cyclic codes over finite fields. Furthermore, we extend the results of Brand
and Huffman et al. and we find the properties of the set of permutations by
which two cyclic codes of length p^r can be equivalent. We also find the set of
permutations by which two quasi-cyclic codes can be equivalent.
