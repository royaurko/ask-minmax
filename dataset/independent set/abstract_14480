We study the higher-derivative equations for gauge potentials of arbitrary
mixed-symmetry type obtained by setting to zero the divergences of the
corresponding curvature tensors. We show that they propagate the same reducible
multiplets as the Maxwell-like second-order equations for gauge fields subject
to constrained gauge transformations. As an additional output of our analysis,
we provide a streamlined presentation of the Ricci-like case, where the traces
of the same curvature tensors are set to zero, and we present a simple
algebraic evaluation of the particle content associated with the Labastida and
with the Maxwell-like second-order equations.
