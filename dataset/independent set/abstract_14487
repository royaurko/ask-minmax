We prove that the nilpotent product of a set of groups $A_{1},\dots, A_{s}$
has finite palindromic width if and only if the palindromic widths of $A_{i},
i=1,\dots, s,$ are finite. We give a new proof that the commutator width of
$F_n \wr K$ is infinite, where $F_n$ is a free group of rank $n \geq 2$ and $K$
a finite group. This result, combining with a result of Fink \cite{f1} gives
examples of groups with infinite commutator width but finite palindromic width
with respect to some generating set.
