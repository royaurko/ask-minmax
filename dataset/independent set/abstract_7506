The model independent analysis of the $dp$ elastic scattering in the
collinear geometry has been performed. It is shown that the measurements of 10
polarization observables of the first and second order realize the complete
experimental program on the determination of the amplitudes of the $dp$
backward elastic scattering reaction.
