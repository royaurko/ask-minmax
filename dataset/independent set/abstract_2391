We apply a recent theoretical analysis of hadronic observables in inclusive
semileptonic heavy hadron decays to the phenomenology of $B$ and $D$ mesons.
Correlated bounds on the nonperturbative parameters $\bar\Lambda$ and
$\lambda_1$ are derived by considering data from $B$ decays and, independently,
data from $D$ decays. The two sets of bounds are found to be consistent with
each other. The data from $B$ decays are then are used to extract a lower limit
on the CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$. We address the issue of the convergence
of the perturbative expansions used in the analysis, and compare our bounds on
$\bar\Lambda$ and $\lambda_1$ to lattice and QCD sum rule results. Finally, we
argue that a comparison of the analyses of $D$ and $D_s$ decays provides
evidence for the applicability of parton-hadron duality in the semileptonic
decay of charmed hadrons.
