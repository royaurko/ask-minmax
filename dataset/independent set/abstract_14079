In this letter we synthesize numerically the L\"{u} attractor starting from
the generalized Lorenz and Chen systems, by switching the control parameter
inside a chosen finite set of values on every successive adjacent finite time
intervals. A numerical method with fixed step size for ODEs is used to
integrate the underlying initial value problem. As numerically and
computationally proved in this work, the utilized attractors synthesis
algorithm introduced by the present contributor before, allows to synthesize the
L\"{u} attractor starting from any finite set of parameter values.
