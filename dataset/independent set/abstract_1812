We construct first a class of Moran fractals in R^d with countably many
generators and non-stationary contraction rates; at each step n, the
contractions depend on n-truncated sequences, and are related to asymptotic
letter frequencies. In some cases the sets of contractions may be infinite at
each step. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of such a fractal is equal to
the zero h of a pressure function. We prove that the dimensions of these sets
depend real analytically on the frequencies. Next, we apply the above
construction to obtain non-stationary fractals E(x; f) \subset R^d, associated
to f-expansions of real numbers x, and study the dependence of these fractals
on x. We consider for instance beta-expansions, the continued fraction
expansion and other f-expansions. By employing the Ergodic Theorem for
invariant absolutely continuous measures and equilibrium measures, and using
some probabilities for which the digits become independent random variables, we
study the function x \to dim_H(E(x; f)) on the respective set of quasinormal
numbers x \in [0; 1). We investigate also another class of fractals \tilde E_f
(x) \subset R^d, for which both the non-stationary contraction vectors and the
asymptotic frequencies depend on the f-representation of x. We obtain then some
properties of the digits of x, related to \tilde E_f (x) and to equilibrium
measures.
