A primitive prime divisor of an element a_n of a sequence (a_1,a_2,a_3,...)
is a prime P that divides a_n, but does not divide a_m for all m < n. The
Zsigmondy set Z of the sequence is the set of n such that a_n has no primitive
prime divisors. Let f : X --> X be a self-morphism of a variety, let D be an
effective divisor on X, and let P be a point of X, all defined over the
algebraic closure of Q. We consider the Zsigmondy set Z(X,f,P,D) of the
sequence defined by the arithmetic intersection of the f-orbit of P with D.
Under various assumptions on X, f, D, and P, we use Vojta's conjecture with
truncated counting function to prove that the set of points f^n(P) with n in
Z(X,f,P,D) is not Zariski dense in X.
