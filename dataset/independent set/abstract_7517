Independent multiple scattering (`Landshoff') contributions to proton-proton
elastic scattering at wide angles are calculated in the quark-diquark model.
Results confirm previous observations about the magnitude of these
contributions. The use of the quark-diquark model extends the applicability of
perturbative QCD calculations down to lower values of momentum transfer
substantially.
