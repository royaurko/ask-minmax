A refinement of manifold data is a computational process, which produces a
denser set of discrete data from a given one. Such refinements are closely
related to multiresolution representations of manifold data by pyramid
transforms, and approximation of manifold-valued functions by repeated
re?nements schemes. Most refinement methods compute each refined element
separately, independently of the computations of the other elements. Here we
propose a global method which computes all the refined elements simultaneously,
using geodesic averages. We analyse repeated re?nements schemes based on this
global approach, and derive conditions guaranteeing strong convergence.
