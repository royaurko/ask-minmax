We study systems containing electrons and nuclei. Based on the fact that the
thermodynamic limit exists for systems with Dirichlet boundary conditions, we
prove that the same limit is obtained if one imposes other boundary conditions
such as Neumann, periodic, or elastic boundary conditions. The result is proven
for all limiting sequences of domains which are obtained by scaling a bounded
open set, with smooth boundary, except for isolated edges and corners.
