Here it is shown that the variation in the fine structure constant measured
by Webb et al. matches the theoretically derived value for the maximum
variation in the electronic charge permitted by the Generalized Second Law of
Thermodynamics for black holes accreting and emitting in the present cosmic
microwave background. It is postulated that the constants of nature,
independently or dependently, vary at the maximal rate allowed by the
Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics.
