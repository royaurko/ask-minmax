We study the transverse momentum dependent quark-gluon-quark correlation
function. Using a spectator diquark model, we calculate the eight
time-reversal-odd interaction-dependent twist-3 quark distributions appearing
in the decomposition of the transverse momentum dependent quark-gluon-quark
correlator. In order to obtain finite results, we assume a dipole form factor
for the nucleon-quark-diquark coupling, instead of a point-like coupling. The
results are compared with the time-reversal-odd interaction-independent twist-3
TMDs calculated in the same model.
