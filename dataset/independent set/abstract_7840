We show that for any elliptic curve (with j invariant not 0 or 1728) over any
field of characteristic different from 2 and 3, there exists an hyperelliptic
curve H of genus 5 with two independent maps to the given elliptic curve. We
also show that, if we want such a curve to be just geometrically hyperelliptic,
so having a degree two map to a conic, then there are some with genus 3.
