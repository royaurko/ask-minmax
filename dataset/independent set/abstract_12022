We experimentally investigate the steady states of two granular assemblies
differing in their material properties and allowed to exchange volume with each
other under external agitation in the vicinity of their jamming transition. We
extract the statistics of various static and dynamic quantities, and uncover a
materials-independent relationship between the average packing fraction and its
fluctuations. This relationship defines an intensive parameter which decouples
from the volume statistics, and remarkably takes the same value in both
subsystems. We also observe that an effective diffusion coefficient also takes
the same value in each subsystem, even as the structural relaxation time
increases over several orders of magnitude. These observations provide strong
constraints on the eventual establishment of a granular equation of state.
