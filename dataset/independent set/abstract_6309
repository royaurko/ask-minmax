In the $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory on the four-dimensional Euclidean lattice,
we confirm the gauge-independent "Abelian" dominance (or the restricted field
dominance) and gauge-independent magnetic-monopole dominance in the string
tension of the linear potential extracted from the Wilson loop in the
fundamental representation. The dual Meissner effect is observed by
demonstrating the squeezing of the chromoelectric field flux connecting a pair
of quark and antiquark. In addition, the circular magnetic-monopole current is
induced around the chromoelectric flux. The type of the dual superconductivity
is also determined by fitting the result with the dual Ginzburg-Landau model.
Thus the dual superconductor picture for quark confinement is supported in a
gauge-independent manner. These results are obtained based on a reformulation
of the lattice Yang-Mills theory based on the change of variables a la
Cho-Duan-Ge-Faddeev-Niemi combined with a non-Abelian Stokes theorem for the
Wilson loop operator. We give a new procedure (called the reduction) for
obtaining the color direction field which plays the central role in this
reformulation.
