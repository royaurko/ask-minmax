We deal with the distributions of holomorphic curves and integral points off
divisors. We will simultaneouly prove an optimal dimension estimate from above
of a subvariety W off a divisor D which contains a Zariski dense entire
holomorphic curve, or a Zariski dense D-integral point set, provided that in
the latter case everything is defined over a number field. Then, if the number
of components of D is large, the estimate leads to the constancy of such a
holomorphic curve or the finiteness of such an integral point set. At the
begining, we extend logarithmic Bloch-Ochiai's Theorem to the Kaehler case.
