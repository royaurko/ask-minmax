We present a framework for the analysis of the error floor of coded slotted
ALOHA (CSA) for finite frame lengths over the packet erasure channel. The error
floor is caused by stopping sets in the corresponding bipartite graph, whose
enumeration is, in general, not a trivial problem. We therefore identify the
most dominant stopping sets for the distributions of practical interest. The
derived analytical expressions allow us to accurately predict the error floor
at low to moderate channel loads and characterize the unequal error protection
inherent in CSA.
