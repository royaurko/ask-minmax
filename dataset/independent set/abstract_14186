We present the complete map of any pair of super Yang-Mills theories to
supergravity theories as dictated by the KLT relations in four dimensions.
Symmetries and the full set of associated vanishing identities are derived. A
graphical method is introduced which simplifies counting of states, and helps
in identifying the relevant set of symmetries.
