It is believed that grain boundary segregation of light interstitials can
serve as possible mechanism of thermal stability in commercially pure
nanostructured titanium alloys. In this paper, using first-principles
calculations, we show that independent segregation of C, N and O atoms at
\Sigma 7 high angle grain boundary in \alpha-Ti is energetically unfavourable.
The presence of interstitial elements near and at the grain boundary interface
results in the increase of the grain boundary width and specific formation
energy.
