The Brownian map is a random geodesic metric space arising as the scaling
limit of random planar maps. We strengthen the so-called confluence of
geodesics phenomenon observed at the root of the map, and with this, reveal
several properties of its rich geodesic structure.
  Our main result is the continuity of the cut locus at typical points. A small
shift from such a point results in a small, local modification to the cut
locus. Moreover, the cut locus is uniformly stable, in the sense that any two
cut loci coincide outside a nowhere dense set.
  We obtain similar stability results for the set of points inside geodesics to
a fixed point. Furthermore, we show that the set of points inside geodesics of
the map is of first Baire category. Hence, most points in the Brownian map are
endpoints.
  Finally, we classify the types of geodesic networks which are dense. For each
$k\in\{1,2,3,4,6,9\}$, there is a dense set of pairs of points which are joined
by networks of exactly $k$ geodesics and of a specific topological form. We
find the Hausdorff dimension of the set of pairs joined by each type of
network. All other geodesic networks are nowhere dense.
