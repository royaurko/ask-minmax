We prove an elementary yet useful inequality bounding the maximal value of
certain linear programs. This leads directly to a bound on the martingale
difference for arbitrarily dependent random variables, providing a
generalization of some recent concentration of measure results. The linear
programming inequality may be of independent interest.
