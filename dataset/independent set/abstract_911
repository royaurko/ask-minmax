A binary game is introduced and analysed. N players have to choose one of the
two sides independently and those on the minority side win. Players uses a
finite set of ad hoc strategies to make their decision, based on the past
record. The analysing power is limited and can adapt when necessary.
Interesting cooperation and competition pattern of the society seem to arise
and to be responsive to the payoff function.
