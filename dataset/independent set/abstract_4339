A frame independent formulation of analytical mechanics in the Newtonian
space-time is presented. The differential geometry of affine values i.e., the
differential geometry in which affine bundles replace vector bundles and
sections of one dimensional affine bundles replace functions on manifolds, is
used. Lagrangian and hamiltonian generating objects, together with the Legendre
transformation independent on inertial frame are constructed.
