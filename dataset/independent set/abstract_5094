The crease set of an event horizon or a Cauchy horizon is an important object
which determines qualitative properties of the horizon. In particular, it
determines the possible topologies of the spatial sections of the horizon. By
Fermat's principle in geometric optics, we relate the crease set and the
Maxwell set of a smooth function in the context of singularity theory. We
thereby give a classification of generic topological structure of the Maxwell
sets and the generic topologies of the spatial section of the horizon.
