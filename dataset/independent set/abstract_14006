Interpolation is an important property of classical and many non classical
logics that has been shown to have interesting applications in computer science
and AI. Here we study the Interpolation Property for the propositional version
of the non-monotonic system of equilibrium logic, establishing weaker or
stronger forms of interpolation depending on the precise interpretation of the
inference relation. These results also yield a form of interpolation for ground
logic programs under the answer sets semantics. For disjunctive logic programs
we also study the property of uniform interpolation that is closely related to
the concept of variable forgetting.
