Abundance observations indicate the presence of rapid-neutron capture (i.e.,
r-process) elements in old Galactic halo and globular cluster stars. These
observations demonstrate that the earliest generations of stars in the Galaxy,
responsible for neutron-capture synthesis and the progenitors of the halo
stars, were rapidly evolving. Abundance comparisons among several halo stars
show that the heaviest neutron-capture elements (including Ba and heavier) are
consistent with a scaled solar system r-process abundance distribution, while
the lighter such elements do not conform to the solar pattern. These
comparisons suggest two r-process sites or at least two different sets of
astrophysical conditions. The large star-to-star scatter observed in the
neutron-capture/iron ratios at low metallicities -- which disappears with
increasing [Fe/H] -- suggests an early, chemically unmixed and inhomogeneous
Galaxy. The stellar abundances indicate a change from the r-process to the slow
neutron capture (i.e., s-) process at higher metallicities in the Galaxy. The
detection of thorium in halo and globular cluster stars offers a promising,
independent age-dating technique that can put lower limits on the age of the
Galaxy.
