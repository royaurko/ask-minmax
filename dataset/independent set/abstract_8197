New concepts of rough natural number systems, recently introduced by the
present contributor, are used to improve most rough set-theoretical measures in
general Rough Set theory (\textsf{RST}) and measures of mutual consistency of
multiple models of knowledge. In this research paper, the explicit dependence
on the axiomatic theory of granules of \cite{AM99} is reduced and more results
on the measures and representation of the numbers are proved.
