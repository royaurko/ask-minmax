The Production Possibility Set (PPS) is defined as a set of inputs and
outputs of a system in which inputs can produce outputs. The Production
Possibility Set of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model is contain of two
types defining hyperplanes (facets); strong and weak efficient facets. In this
paper, the problem of finding weak defining hyperplanes of the PPS of the
CCR-technology is dealt with. We state and prove some properties relative to
our method. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed model, some
numerical examples are finally provided. Our algorithm can easily be
implemented using existing packages for operation research, such as GAMS.
