We study the geometry of germs of definable (semialgebraic or subanalytic)
sets over a $p$-adic field from the metric, differential and measure geometric
point of view. We prove that the local density of such sets at each of their
points does exist. We then introduce the notion of distinguished tangent cone
with respect to some open subgroup with finite index in the multiplicative
group of our field and show, as it is the case in the real setting, that, up to
some multiplicities, the local density may be computed on this distinguished
tangent cone.We also prove that these distinguished tangent cones stabilize for
small enough subgroups. We finally obtain the $p$-adic counterpart of the
Cauchy-Crofton formula for the density. To prove these results we use the
Lipschitz decomposition of definable $p$-adic sets of arXiv:0904.3853v1 and
prove here the genericity of the regularity conditions for stratification such
as $(w_f)$, $(w)$, $(a_f)$, $(b)$ and $(a)$ conditions.
