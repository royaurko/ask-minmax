Recently some contributors concluded that the energy and momentum of the Fiedman
universes, flat and closed, are equal to zero locally and globally (flat
universes) or only globally (closed universes). The similar conclusion was also
done for more general only homogeneous universes (Kasner and Bianchi type I).
Such conclusions originated from coordinate dependent calculations performed
only in comoving Cartesian coordinates by using the so-called {\it
energy-momentum complexes}. By using new coordinate independent expressions on
energy and momentum one can show that the Friedman and more general universes
{\it needn't be energetic nonentity}.
