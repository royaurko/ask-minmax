Let g and p be non-negative integers.
  Let A(g,p) denote the group consisting of all those automorphisms of the free
group on {t_1,...,t_p, x_1,...,x_g, y_1,...y_g} which fix the element
t_1t_2...t_p[x_1,y_1]...[x_g,y_g] and permute the set of conjugacy classes
{[t_1],....,[t_p]}. Labru\`ere and Paris, building on work of Artin, Magnus,
Dehn, Nielsen, Lickorish, Zieschang, Birman, Humphries, and others, showed that
A(g,p) is generated by a set that is called the ADLH set. We use methods of
Zieschang and McCool to give a self-contained, algebraic proof of this result.
Labru\`ere and Paris also gave defining relations for the ADLH set in A(g,p);
we do not know an algebraic proof of this for g > 1. Consider an orientable
surface S(g,p) of genus g with p punctures, such that (g,p) is not (0,0) or
(0,1). The algebraic mapping-class group of S(g,p), denoted M(g,p), is defined
as the group of all those outer automorphisms of the one-relator group with
generating set {t_1,...,t_p, x_1,...,x_g, y_1,...y_g} and relator
t_1t_2...t_p[x_1,y_1]...[x_g,y_g] which permute the set of conjugacy classes
{[t_1],....,[t_p]}. It now follows from a result of Nielsen that M(g,p) is
generated by the image of the ADLH set together with a reflection. This gives a
new way of seeing that M(g,p) equals the (topological) mapping-class group of
S(g,p), along lines suggested by Magnus, Karrass, and Solitar in 1966.
