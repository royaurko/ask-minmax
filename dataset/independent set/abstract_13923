We derive conservation laws from interactions of braid-like excitations of
embedded framed spin networks in Quantum Gravity. We also demonstrate that the
set of stable braid-like excitations form a noncommutative algebra under braid
interaction, in which the set of actively-interacting braids is a subalgebra.
