The Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) approach for exploring inflationary trajectories is
employed in the generation of generalised inflationary non-Gaussian signals
arising from single field inflation. Scale dependent solutions for $f_{NL}$ are
determined via the numerical integration of the three--point function in the
curvature perturbation. This allows the full exploration of single field
inflationary dynamics in the out-of-slow-roll regime and opens up the
possibility of using future observations of non-Gaussianity to constraint the
inflationary potential using model-independent methods. The distribution of
`equilateral' $f_{NL}$ arising from single field inflation with both canonical
and non-canonical kinetic terms are show as an example of the application of
this procedure.
