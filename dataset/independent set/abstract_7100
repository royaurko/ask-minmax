Experiments show that all the derivatives of the thermo-physical variables
are nearly constant. The constant value of the derivatives indicates linear
relationship between the variables. Neither the volume coefficient of thermal
expansion nor the bulk modulus are constant and show pressure and temperature
dependence. Besides the derivatives the only other quantity in the definition
of the volume coefficient of thermal expansion and the bulk modulus is the
volume. It is suggested that the pressure and temperature dependence of these
parameters is resulted from the improper identification of the volume. In solid
phase the actual volume is not an independent variable but rather comprises
from three more fundamental volume components, initial, thermal, and elastic
volumes. The pressure correlates to the elastic volume and the temperature to
the thermal volume. New definitions for the volume coefficient of thermal
expansion and the bulk modulus are proposed by identifying the fundamental
volume parts specifically. The complete separation of the thermal and elastic
volumes is consistent with theory since the vibrational and static energies are
completely independent of each other. Based on the independence of the thermal
and elastic deformations it is suggested that thermo elastic coupling should
not exist in solid phase in the elastic domain with the exception of constant
volume. It is also suggested that the thermo-elastic coupling is irreversible
and exist only in the temperature-pressure direction.
