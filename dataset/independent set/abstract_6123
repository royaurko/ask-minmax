The fundamental property of strongly monotone systems, and strongly
cooperative systems in particular, is the limit set dichotomy due to Hirsch: if
x(0) < y(0), then either omega(x) < omega(y), or omega(x) = omega(y) and both
sets consist of equilibria. We provide here a counterexample showing that this
property need not hold for (non-strongly) cooperative systems.
