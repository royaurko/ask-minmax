This paper is concerned with the distribution of normalized zero-sets of
random entire functions. The normalization of the zero-set is performed in the
same way as that of the counting function for an entire function in Nevanlinna
theory. The result generalizes the Shiffman and Zelditch theory on the
distribution of the zeroes of random holomorphic sections of powers for
positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundles from polynomial functions to entire
functions. Our result can also be viewed as the analogy of Nevanlinna's First
Main Theorem in the theory of the distribution of zero-sets of random entire
functions.
