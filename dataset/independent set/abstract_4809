Intuitive Set Theory (IST) is defined as the theory we get, when we add Axiom
of Monotonicity and Axiom of Fusion to Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. In IST,
Continuum Hypothesis is a theorem, Axiom of Choice is a theorem, Skolem paradox
does not appear, nonLebesgue measurable sets are not possible, and the unit
interval splits into a set of infinitesimals.
