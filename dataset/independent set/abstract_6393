Feedback loops in a dynamic network play an important role in determining the
dynamics of that network. Through a computational study, in this paper we show
that networks with fewer independent negative feedback loops tend to exhibit
more regular behavior than those with more negative loops. To be precise, we
study the relationship between the number of independent feedback loops and the
number and length of the limit cycles in the phase space of dynamic Boolean
networks. We show that, as the number of independent negative feedback loops
increases, the number (length) of limit cycles tends to decrease (increase).
These conclusions are consistent with the fact, for certain natural biological
networks, that they on the one hand exhibit generally regular behavior and on
the other hand show less negative feedback loops than randomized networks with
the same numbers of nodes and connectivity.
