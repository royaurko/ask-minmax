In [Rie08], the second contributor defined a Landau-Ginzburg model for homogeneous
spaces G/P, as a regular function on an affine subvariety of the Langlands dual
group. In this paper, we reformulate this LG model (X^,W_t) in the case of the
odd-dimensional quadric Q_{2m-1} as a rational function on a Langlands dual
projective space, in the spirit of work by R. Marsh and the second contributor
[MR12] for type A Grassmannians and by both contributors [PR13] for Lagrangian
Grassmannians.
  We also compare this LG model with the one obtained independently by
Gorbounov and Smirnov in [GS13], and we use this comparison to deduce part of
[Rie08], Conj. 8.1 for odd-dimensional quadrics.
