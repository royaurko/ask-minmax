We study a hybrid control system in which both discrete and continuous
controls are involved. The discrete controls act on the system at a given set
interface. The state of the system is changed discontinuously when the
trajectory hits predefined sets, namely, an autonomous jump set $A$ or a
controlled jump set $C$ where controller can choose to jump or not. At each
jump, trajectory can move to a different Euclidean space. We allow the cost
functionals to be unbounded with certain growth and hence the corresponding
value function can be unbounded. We characterize the value function as the
unique viscosity solution of the associated quasivariational inequality in a
suitable function class. We also consider the evolutionary, finite horizon
hybrid control problem with similar model and prove that the value function is
the unique viscosity solution in the continuous function class while allowing
cost functionals as well as the dynamics to be unbounded.
