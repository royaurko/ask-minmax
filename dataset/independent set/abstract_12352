We are concerned with the detection of associations between random vectors of
any dimension. Few tests of independence exist that are consistent against all
dependent alternatives. We propose a powerful test that is applicable in all
dimensions and is consistent against all alternatives. The test has a simple
form and is easy to implement. We demonstrate its good power properties in
simulations and on examples.
