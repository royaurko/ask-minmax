A filled skutterudite, La$_{0.5}$Rh$_4$Sb$_{12}$, with a lattice constant of
9.284(2) {\AA} was synthesized using a high-pressure technique. The electrical
resistivity showed semiconducting behavior and the energy gap was estimated to
be more than 0.08 eV. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicated
temperature-independent diamagnetism, which originates from Larmor
diamagnetism. The electrical properties of this compound are more similar to
those of the La$_{0.5}$Rh$_4$As$_{12}$ semiconductor with an energy gap of 0.03
eV than to those of the La$_{0.6}$Rh$_4$P$_{12}$ superconductor.
