A new one-dimensional model, the multicomponent Calogero model of $B_N$-type
confined in the harmonic potential, is introduced. The Lax pair of this model
is determined, and then a set of functionally independent conserved operators
are constructed. Moreover, the energy spectrums of the above model are obtained
by three different methods.
