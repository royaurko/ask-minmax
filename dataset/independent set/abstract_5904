We consider products of independent large random rectangular matrices with
independent entries. The limit distribution of the expected empirical
distribution of singular values of such products is computed. The distribution
function is described by its Stieltjes transform, which satisfies some
algebraic equation. In the particular case of square matrices we get a
well-known distribution which moments are Fuss-Catalan numbers.
