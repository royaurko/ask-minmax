A software library is presented for the polynomial expansion method (PEM) of
the density of states (DOS) developed by two of the contributors (N.F. and Y. M.).
The library provides all necessary functions for the use of the PEM and its
truncated version (TPEM) in a model independent way. The PEM/TPEM replaces the
exact diagonalization of the one electron sector in models for fermions coupled
to classical fields. The computational cost of the algorithm is O(N) -- with N
the number of lattice sites -- for the TPEM which should be contrasted with the
computational cost of the diagonalization technique that scales as O(N^4). The
method is applied for the first time to a double exchange model with finite
Hund coupling and also to diluted spin-fermion models.
