Given a set of transmission eigenvalues, we describe the connection of such a
set to the indicator functions in entire function theory. The indicator
functions control the asymptotic growth rate of the solution of the
Sturm-Liouville problem which has an uniqueness in the inverse spectral theory.
Henceforth, the set of transmission eigenvalues has an inverse spectral
property.
