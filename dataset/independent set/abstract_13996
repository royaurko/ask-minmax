It is shown in this paper that there is a fine correlation of the third order
between the values of the functions $Z[\vp_1(t)]$ and $\tilde{Z}^2(t)$ which
corresponds to two collections of disconnected sets. The corresponding new
asymptotic formula cannot be obtained within known theories of Balasubramanian,
Heath-Brown and Ivic.
