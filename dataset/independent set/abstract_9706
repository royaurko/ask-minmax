For information transmission a discrete time channel with independent
additive Gaussian noise is used. There is also another channel with independent
additive Gaussian noise (the feedback channel), and the transmitter observes
without delay all outputs of the forward channel via that channel. Transmission
of nonexponential number of messages is considered (i.e. transmission rate
equals zero) and the achievable decoding error exponent for such a combination
of channels is investigated. The transmission method strengthens the method
used by contributors earlier for BSC and Gaussian channels. In particular, for small
feedback noise, it allows to gain 33.3\% (instead of 23.6\% earlier in the
similar case of Gaussian channel).
