We discuss three-body recombination of ultra-cold atoms to a weakly bound $s$
level. In this case, characterized by large and positive scattering length $a$
for pair interaction, we find a repulsive effective potential for three-body
collisions, which strongly reduces the recombination probability and makes
simple Jastrow-like approaches absolutely inadequate. In the zero temperature
limit we obtain a universal relation, independent of the detailed shape of the
interaction potential, for the (event) rate constant of three-body
recombination: $\alpha_{\rm rec}=3.9\hbar a^4/m$, where $m$ is the atom mass.
