We discuss the dynamics of linear, scalar perturbations in an almost
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker braneworld cosmology of Randall-Sundrum type II
using the 1+3 covariant approach. We derive a complete set of frame-independent
equations for the total matter variables, and a partial set of equations for
the non-local variables which arise from the projection of the Weyl tensor in
the bulk. The latter equations are incomplete since there is no propagation
equation for the non-local anisotropic stress. We supplement the equations for
the total matter variables with equations for the independent constituents in a
cold dark matter cosmology, and provide solutions in the high and low-energy
radiation-dominated phase under the assumption that the non-local anisotropic
stress vanishes. These solutions reveal the existence of new modes arising from
the two additional non-local degrees of freedom. Our solutions should prove
useful in setting up initial conditions for numerical codes aimed at exploring
the effect of braneworld corrections on the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
power spectrum. As a first step in this direction, we derive the covariant form
of the line of sight solution for the CMB temperature anisotropies in
braneworld cosmologies, and discuss possible mechanisms by which braneworld
effects may remain in the low-energy universe.
