The paper studies algebraic independence of certain reciprocal sums of
Fibonacci and Lucas sequences. Also more general binary recurrences are
considered. The main tool is Mahler's method reducing the investigation of the
algebraic independence of function values to the one of functions if these
satisfy certain types of functional equations.
