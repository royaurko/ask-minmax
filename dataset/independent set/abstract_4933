We briefly review the halo-independent formalism, that allows to compare data
from different direct dark matter detection experiments without making
assumptions on the properties of the dark matter halo. We apply this method to
spin-independent WIMP-nuclei interactions, for both isospin-conserving and
isospin-violating couplings, updating the existing analyses with the addition
of the SuperCDMS bound. We point out that this method can be applied to any
type of WIMP interaction.
