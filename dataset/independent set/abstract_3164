The search for patterns or motifs in data represents an area of key interest
to many researchers. In this paper we present the Motif Tracking Algorithm, a
novel immune inspired pattern identification tool that is able to identify
variable length unknown motifs which repeat within time series data. The
algorithm searches from a neutral perspective that is independent of the data
being analysed and the underlying motifs. In this paper we test the flexibility
of the motif tracking algorithm by applying it to the search for patterns in
two industrial data sets. The algorithm is able to identify a population of
meaningful motifs in both cases, and the value of these motifs is discussed.
