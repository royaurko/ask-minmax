We give improved bounds for our theorem in [GW09], which shows that a system
of linear forms on $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ with squares that are linearly independent
has the expected number of solutions in any linearly uniform subset of
$\mathbb{F}_p^n$. While in [GW09] the dependence between the uniformity of the
set and the resulting error in the average over the linear system was of tower
type, we now obtain a doubly exponential relation between the two parameters.
  Instead of the structure theorem for bounded functions due to Green and Tao
[GrT08], we use the Hahn-Banach theorem to decompose the function into a
quadratically structured plus a quadratically uniform part. This new
decomposition makes more efficient use of the $U^3$ inverse theorem [GrT08].
