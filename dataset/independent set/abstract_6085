In this paper we present multivariate space-time fractional Poisson processes
by considering common random time-changes of a (finite-dimensional) vector of
independent classical (non-fractional) Poisson processes. In some cases we also
consider compound processes. We obtain some equations in terms of some suitable
fractional derivatives and fractional difference operators, which provides the
extension of known equations for the univariate processes.
