An extremal rotating black hole in arbitrary dimension, along with time
translations and rotations, possesses a number of hidden symmetries
characterized by the second rank Killing tensors. As is known, in the near
horizon limit the isometry group of the metric is enhanced to include the
conformal factor SO(2,1). It is demonstrated that for the near horizon extremal
Kerr (NHEK) geometry in arbitrary dimension one of the Killing tensors
decomposes into a quadratic combination of the Killing vectors corresponding to
the conformal group, while the rest is functionally independent.
