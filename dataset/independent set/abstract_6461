Present and future expected limits on interactions between dark matter and
various quarks are thoroughly investigated in a model-independent way. In
particular, the constraints on the interactions from the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) experiment are carefully considered with focusing on mono jet + missing
transverse energy, mono b-jet + missing transverse energy, and top quark(s) +
missing transverse energy channels. Model-independent upper limits (expected
limits) on the cross section times acceptance for non-standard model events are
derived at 7 TeV (8 or 14 TeV) running of the LHC experiment. With assuming
that the dark matter is a singlet real scalar or a singlet Majorana fermion, we
also put constraints on several operators describing its interactions with up,
down, strange, charm, bottom and top quarks. These constraints are compared to
those obtained by cosmological and astrophysical observations of the dark
matter.
