We present the results of a Bayesian analysis of solar neutrino data in terms
of nu_e->nu_{mu,tau} oscillations, independent from the Standard Solar Model
predictions for the solar neutrino fluxes. We show that such a model
independent analysis allows to constraint the values of the neutrino mixing
parameters in limited regions around the usual SMA, LMA, LOW and VO regions.
Furthermore, there is a strong indication in favor of large neutrino mixing and
large values of Delta m^2 (LMA region). We calculate also the allowed ranges of
the neutrino fluxes and we show that they are in good agreement with the
Standard Solar Model prediction. In particular, the ratio of the 8B flux with
its Standard Solar Model prediction is constrained in the interval [0.45,1.42]
with 99.73% probability. Finally, we show that the hypothesis of no neutrino
oscillations is strongly disfavored in a model independent way with respect to
the hypothesis of neutrino oscillations.
