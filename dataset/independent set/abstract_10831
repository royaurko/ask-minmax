If the hierarchy of quark masses comes out of simultaneous dynamical chiral
and flavor symmetry breakings, it is inevitably accompanied by the flavor
mixing. Therefore, these phenomena, independent in the standard model and in
many of its generalizations, become related since they appear out of the same
dynamics. The features of that high energy dynamics may be investigated via
accordance with observed mass hierarchy and mixing.
