This paper addresses the problem of fitting a known distribution to the
innovation distribution in a class of stationary and ergodic time series
models. The asymptotic null distribution of the usual Kolmogorov--Smirnov test
based on the residuals generally depends on the underlying model parameters and
the error distribution. To overcome the dependence on the underlying model
parameters, we propose that tests be based on a vector of certain weighted
residual empirical processes. Under the null hypothesis and under minimal
moment conditions, this vector of processes is shown to converge weakly to a
vector of independent copies of a Gaussian process whose covariance function
depends only on the fitted distribution and not on the model. Under certain
local alternatives, the proposed test is shown to have nontrivial asymptotic
power. The Monte Carlo critical values of this test are tabulated when fitting
standard normal and double exponential distributions. The results obtained are
shown to be applicable to GARCH and ARMA--GARCH models, the often used models
in econometrics and finance. A simulation study shows that the test has
satisfactory size and power for finite samples at these models. The paper also
contains an asymptotic uniform expansion result for a general weighted residual
empirical process useful in heteroscedastic models under minimal moment
conditions, a result of independent interest.
