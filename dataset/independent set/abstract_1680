Point-set embeddings and large-angle crossings are two areas of graph drawing
that independently have received a lot of attention in the past few years. In
this paper, we consider problems in the intersection of these two areas. Given
the point-set-embedding scenario, we are interested in how much we gain in
terms of computational complexity, curve complexity, and generality if we allow
large-angle crossings as compared to the planar case. We investigate two
drawing styles where only bends or both bends and edges must be drawn on an
underlying grid. We present various results for drawings with one, two, and
three bends per edge.
