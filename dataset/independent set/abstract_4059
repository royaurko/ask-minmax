A graph $G$ is called a complete $k$-partite ($k\geq 2$) graph if its
vertices can be partitioned into $k$ independent sets $V_{1},...,V_{k}$ such
that each vertex in $V_{i}$ is adjacent to all the other vertices in $V_{j}$
for $1\leq i<j\leq k$. A complete $k$-partite graph $G$ is a complete balanced
$k$-partite graph if $|V_{1}| = |V_{2}| =... = |V_{k}|$. An edge-coloring of a
graph $G$ with colors $1,...,t$ is an interval $t$-coloring if all colors are
used, and the colors of edges incident to each vertex of $G$ are distinct and
form an interval of integers. A graph $G$ is interval colorable if $G$ has an
interval $t$-coloring for some positive integer $t$. In this paper we show that
a complete balanced $k$-partite graph $G$ with $n$ vertices in each part is
interval colorable if and only if $nk$ is even. We also prove that if $nk$ is
even and $(k-1)n\leq t\leq ((3/2)k-1)n-1$, then a complete balanced $k$-partite
graph $G$ admits an interval $t$-coloring. Moreover, if $k=p2^{q}$, where $p$
is odd and $q\in \mathbb{N}$, then a complete balanced $k$-partite graph $G$
has an interval $t$-coloring for each positive integer $t$ satisfying
$(k-1)n\leq t\leq (2k-p-q)n-1$.
