In this paper we are concerned with the space of tempered ultrahyperfunctions
corresponding to a proper open convex cone. A holomorphic extension theorem
(the version of the celebrated edge of the wedge theorem) will be given for
this setting. As application, a version is also given of the principle of
determination of an analytic function by its values on a non-empty open real
set. The paper finishes with the generalization of holomorphic extension
theorem \`a la Martineau.
