We consider three level atoms driven by two resonant light fields in a ladder
scheme where the upper level is a highly excited Rydberg state. We show that
the dipole--dipole interactions between Rydberg excited atoms prevents the
formation of single particle dark states and leads to strongly correlated
photon emission from atoms separated by distances large compared to the
emission wavelength. For two atoms, correlated photon pairs are emitted with an
angular distribution given by a coherent sum of the independent dipolar fields.
