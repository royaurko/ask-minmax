A heavy Higgs resonance is described in a representation-independent way
which is valid for the whole energy range of 2 -> 2 scattering processes,
including the asymptotic behavior at low and high energies. The low-energy
theorems which follow from to the custodial SU_2 symmetry of the Higgs sector
restrict the possible parameterizations of the lineshape that are consistent in
perturbation theory. Matching conditions are specified which are necessary and
sufficient to relate the parameters arising in different expansions. The
construction is performed explicitly up to next-to-leading order.
