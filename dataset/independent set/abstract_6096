A distortion theory is developed for $S-$unimodal maps. It will be used to
get some geometric understanding of invariant Cantor sets. In particular
attracting Cantor sets turn out to have Lebesgue measure zero. Furthermore the
ergodic behavior of $S-$unimodal maps is classified according to a distortion
property, called the Markov-property.
