In this work we establish trace Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequalities with best
Hardy constants, for weakly mean convex domains. We accomplish this by
obtaining a new weighted Hardy type estimate which is of independent inerest.
We then produce Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequalities for the spectral half
Laplacian. This covers a critical case left open in \cite{FMT1}.
