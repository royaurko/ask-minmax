We numerically analyse the full non-linear hydrodynamic equations of a
sheared nematic fluid under shear stress and strain rate controlled situations
incorporating spatial heterogeneity in the gradient direction. For a certain
range of imposed stress and strain rates, this extended dynamical system shows
signatures of spatio-temporal chaos and transient shear banding. In the chaotic
regime the power spectra of the order parameter stress and the total injected
power shows power law behavior and the total injected power shows a
non-Gaussian, skewed probability distribution, which bear striking resemblance
to elastic turbulence phenomena observed in polymer solutions. The scaling
behavior is independent of the choice of shear rate/stress control method.
