A set of meet-irreducible ideals is described for a class of maximal
triangular almost finite algebras. This set forms a topological space under the
hull-kernel closure, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between closed
sets in this space and ideals in the AF algebra. Some connections with nest
representations and nest-primitive ideals are also described.
