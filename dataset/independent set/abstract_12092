Colonel E.E. Markwick, CB, CBE, FRAS (1853 - 1925) pursued a distinguished
career in the British Army, serving in Great Britain and other parts of the
Empire and rising to the rank of Colonel. He was an original member of the BAA
and went on to become President between 1912 and 1914. His main observational
interest was the study of variable stars and he independently discovered two
variables, RY Sgr and T Cen. He directed the BAA Variable Star Section from
1899 to 1909, organising its work along lines that are largely pursued even to
this day and which other variable star organisations around the world have
emulated.
