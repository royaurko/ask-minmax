We examine the characteristic quantities of pion-emitting sources extracted
by model-independent imaging analysis in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The
moments of the spatial separation of pion pair emission can provide the
characteristic information about the source geometry and coherence. They are
better for describing the non-Gaussian sources with granular and core-halo
structures. An improved granular source model of quark-gluon plasma droplets
can reproduce the main characteristics of the two-pion correlation functions
and source functions in the experiment of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV Au+Au
collisions. The transverse-momentum dependence of the normalized first-order
moments of the separation for the granular source is consistent with that of
the usual interferometry results of source radii, after taking into account the
Lorentz contraction in the direction of transverse momentum of pion pair.
