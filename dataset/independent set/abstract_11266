In a recent paper the contributor obtained optimal bounds for the strong Gaussian
approximation of sums of independent $\R^d$-valued random vectors with finite
exponential moments. The results may be considered as generalizations of
well-known results of Koml\'os--Major--Tusn\'ady and Sakhanenko. The dependence
of constants on the dimension $d$ and on distributions of summands is given
explicitly. Some related problems are discussed.
