Topological subsystem color codes add to the advantages of topological codes
an important feature: error tracking only involves measuring 2-local operators
in a two dimensional setting. Unfortunately, known methods to compute with them
were highly unpractical. We give a mechanism to implement all Clifford gates by
code deformation in a planar setting. In particular, we use twist braiding and
express its effects in terms of certain colored Majorana operators.
