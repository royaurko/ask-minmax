We consider a system of $d$ coupled non-linear stochastic heat equations in
spatial dimension 1 driven by $d$-dimensional additive space-time white noise.
We establish upper and lower bounds on hitting probabilities of the solution
$\{u(t, x)\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}_+, x \in [0, 1]}$, in terms of respectively
Hausdorff measure and Newtonian capacity. We also obtain the Hausdorff
dimensions of level sets and their projections. A result of independent
interest is an anisotropic form of the Kolmogorov continuity theorem.
