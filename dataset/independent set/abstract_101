It has been believed that statistical inequality such as Bell inequality
should be modified once measurement independence (MI), the assumption that
observers can freely choose measurement settings without changing the
probability distribution of hidden variables, is relaxed. However, we show that
there exists the possibility that Bell inequality is still valid even if MI is
relaxed. MI is only a sufficient condition to derive Bell inequality when both
determinism and setting independence, usually called as local realism, are
satisfied. We thus propose a new condition necessary and sufficient for
deriving Bell inequality, called as concealed measurement dependence.
