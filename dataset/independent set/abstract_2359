A potential source of high energy neutrinos is the annihilation of Weakly
Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) collecting in gravitational potential
wells such as the centers of the Earth, the Sun, or the Galaxy. A search for
such a WIMP annihilation signal using the Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) detector
is presented. Super-K observes 1.1 upward through-going muons per day. These
events are caused by high energy (typical E_nu ~ 100 GeV) nu_mu interactions in
the rock under the detector, and are generally consistent with the expected
flux from atmospheric neutrinos. No enhancement of the neutrino signal due to
WIMP annihilation is seen, so upper limits on the possible flux of WIMPS are
set. These limits are compared to those from other such indirect searches, and
a model-independent method is used to compare the Super-K results with
direct-detection WIMP experiments.
