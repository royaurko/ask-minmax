In the compromise model of Deffuant et al., opinions are real numbers between
0 and 1 and two agents are compatible if the difference of their opinions is
smaller than the confidence bound parameter \epsilon. The opinions of a
randomly chosen pair of compatible agents get closer to each other. We provide
strong numerical evidence that the threshold value of \epsilon above which all
agents share the same opinion in the final configuration is 1/2, independently
of the underlying social topology.
