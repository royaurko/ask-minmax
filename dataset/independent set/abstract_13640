We present a noncommutative generalization of Lax formalism of U(N) principal
chiral model in terms of a one-parameter family of flat connections. The Lax
formalism is further used to derive a set of parametric noncommutative
B\"{a}cklund transformation and an infinite set of conserved quantities. From
the Lax pair, we derive a noncommutative version of the Darboux transformation
of the model.
