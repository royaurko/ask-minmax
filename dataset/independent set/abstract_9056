We present novel infrared optical conductivity data on the three layer high
Tc superconductor Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10 at optimal doping. We extend the analysis of
an earlier publication, providing a universal scaling function
sigma(omega,T)=g(omega/T)/T for the optical conductivity. In the present
manuscript we obtain a good scaling collapse of the experimental curves on the
g(omega/T) over a wide range of values of omega/T (at least in range 0 to 10),
if we assume that g(omega/T) is superimposed on a non-universal background
which is temperature independent. We obtain the same result, if in our analysis
we allow this background to have a T-squared temperature dependent correction.
The most striking property of g(omega/T) is, that it corresponds to a
scattering rate which varies linearly as a function of temperature, but which
is independent of the frequency.
