The aim of this paper is to investigate the separability of a spin-1/2 spinor
field in a five-dimensional rotating, charged black hole constructed by Cvetic
and Youm in string theory, in the case when three U(1) charges are set equal.
This black hole solution represents a natural generalization of the famous
four-dimensional Kerr-Newman solution to five dimensions with the inclusion of
a Chern-Simons term to the Maxwell equation. It is shown that the usual Dirac
equation can not be separated by variables in this general spacetime with two
independent angular momenta. However if one supplements an additional
counterterm into the usual Dirac operator, then the modified Dirac equation for
the spin-1/2 spinor particles is separable in this rotating, charged
Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons black hole background geometry. A first-order
symmetry operator that commutes with the modified Dirac operator has exactly
the same form as that previously found in the uncharged Myers-Perry black hole
case. It is expressed in terms of a rank-three totally antisymmetric tensor and
its covariant derivative. This tensor obeys a generalized Killing-Yano equation
and its square is a second-order symmetric Stackel-Killing tensor admitted by
the five-dimensional rotating, charged black hole spacetime.
