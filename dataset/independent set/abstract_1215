We describe an ultracold fermionic set-up where it is possible to synthesize
a superfluid phase with symmetry obtained by locking independent invariance
groups of the normal state. In this phase, named two-flavors symmetry-locking
phase (TFSL), non-Abelian fractional vortices with semi-integer flux and
gapless non-Abelian Goldstone modes localized on them appear. Considerations on
the possible experimental realization of the TFSL are also provided.
