Subleq (Subtract and Branch on result Less than or Equal to zero) is both an
instruction set and a programming language for One Instruction Set Computer
(OISC). We describe a hardware implementation of an array of 28 one-instruction
Subleq processors on a low-cost FPGA board. Our test results demonstrate that
computational power of our Subleq OISC multi-processor is comparable to that of
CPU of a modern personal computer. Additionally, we provide implementation
details of our complier from a C-style language to Subleq.
