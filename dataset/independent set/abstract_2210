We investigate the impact of gas evolution on the expected yields from deep
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect surveys as well as on the expected SZ effect
contribution to fine scale anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background. The
approximate yields from SZ effect surveys are remarkably insensitive to gas
evolution, even though the observable properties of the resulting clusters can
be markedly different. The CMB angular power spectrum at high multipoles due to
the SZ effect from clusters is quite sensitive to gas evolution. We show that
moderate resolution SZ effect imaging of clusters found in deep SZ effect
surveys should allow a good understanding of gas evolution in galaxy clusters,
independent of the details of the nature of the gas evolution. Such an
understanding will be necessary before precise cosmological constraints can be
set from yields of large cluster surveys.
