We study in this article the mathematical properties of a class of
orbital-free kinetic energy functionals. We prove that these models are
linearly stable but nonlinearly unstable, in the sense that the corresponding
kinetic energy functionals are not bounded from below. As a matter of
illustration, we provide an example of an electronic density of simple shape
the kinetic energy of which is negative.
