We consider photoassociation from a state of two free atoms when the
continuum state is close to a magnetic field induced Feshbach resonance and
analyze Fano interference in photoassociation. We show that the minimum in
photoassociation profiles characterized by the Fano asymmetry parameter $q$ is
independent of laser intensity, while the maximum explicitly depends on laser
intensity. We further discuss the possibility of nonlinear Fano effect in
photoassociation near a Feshbach resonance.
