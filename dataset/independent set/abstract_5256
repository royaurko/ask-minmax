A "total dominating set" of a graph G=(V,E) is a subset D of V such that
every vertex in V is adjacent to some vertex in D. Finding a total dominating
set of minimum size is NP-complete on planar graphs and W[2]-complete on
general graphs when parameterized by the solution size. By the meta-theorem of
Bodlaender et al. [FOCS 2009], it follows that there exists a linear kernel for
Total Dominating Set on graphs of bounded genus. Nevertheless, it is not clear
how such a kernel can be effectively constructed, and how to obtain explicit
reduction rules with reasonably small constants. Following the approach of
Alber et al. [J. ACM 2004], we provide an explicit linear kernel for Total
Dominating Set on planar graphs. This result complements several known
constructive linear kernels on planar graphs for other domination problems such
as Dominating Set, Edge Dominating Set, Efficient Dominating Set, or Connected
Dominating Set.
