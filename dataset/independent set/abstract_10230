Social spam produces a great amount of noise on social media services such as
Twitter, which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio that both end users and data
mining applications observe. Existing techniques on social spam detection have
focused primarily on the identification of spam accounts by using extensive
historical and network-based data. In this paper we focus on the detection of
spam tweets, which optimises the amount of data that needs to be gathered by
relying only on tweet-inherent features. This enables the application of the
spam detection system to a large set of tweets in a timely fashion, potentially
applicable in a real-time or near real-time setting. Using two large
hand-labelled datasets of tweets containing spam, we study the suitability of
five classification algorithms and four different feature sets to the social
spam detection task. Our results show that, by using the limited set of
features readily available in a tweet, we can achieve encouraging results which
are competitive when compared against existing spammer detection systems that
make use of additional, costly user features. Our study is the first that
attempts at generalising conclusions on the optimal classifiers and sets of
features for social spam detection over different datasets.
