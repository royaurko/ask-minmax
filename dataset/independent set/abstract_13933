This article provides a simple logical structure, in which affective concepts
(i.e. concepts related to emotions and feelings) can be defined. The set of
affects defined is similar to the set of emotions covered in the OCC model
(Ortony A., Collins A., and Clore G. L.: The Cognitive Structure of Emotions.
Cambridge University Press, 1988), but the model presented in this article is
fully computationally defined.
