This paper introduces modal independence logic MIL, a modal logic that can
explicitly talk about independence among propositional variables. Formulas of
MIL are not evaluated in worlds but in sets of worlds, so called teams. In this
vein, MIL can be seen as a variant of V\"a\"an\"anen's modal dependence logic
MDL. We show that MIL embeds MDL and is strictly more expressive. However, on
singleton teams, MIL is shown to be not more expressive than usual modal logic,
but MIL is exponentially more succinct. Making use of a new form of
bisimulation, we extend these expressivity results to modal logics extended by
various generalized dependence atoms. We demonstrate the expressive power of
MIL by giving a specification of the anonymity requirement of the dining
cryptographers protocol in MIL. We also study complexity issues of MIL and show
that, though it is more expressive, its satisfiability and model checking
problem have the same complexity as for MDL.
