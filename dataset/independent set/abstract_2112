In this thesis we study when a homogeneous polynomial $f$ decomposes or
"splits" additively. Up to base change this means that it is possible to write
$f = g + h$ where $g$ and $h$ are polynomials in independent sets of variables.
This simple idea leads us to define a set $M_f$ of matrices associated to $f$.
Surprisingly, $M_f$ turns out to be a commutative matrix algebra when $deg f
\ge 3$. We show how all (regular) splittings $f = g_1 + ... + g_n$ can be
computed from $M_f$.
  Next we show how to find the minimal free resolution of the graded Artinian
Gorenstein quotient $R/\ann f$, assuming the minimal free resolutions of its
additive components $R/\ann g_i$ are known. From this we get simple formulas
for the Hilbert function $H$ and the graded Betti numbers of $R/\ann f$. We may
use this to compute the dimension of a "splitting subfamily" of the parameter
space $\PGor (H)$. Its closure is quite often an irreducible component of
$\PGor (H)$.
  We will also study degenerations of polynomials that split and see how they
relate to $M_f$. This situation is more difficult, but we are able to prove
several partial results that together cover many interesting cases. In
particular, we prove that $f$ has a regular or degenerate splitting if and only
if the ideal $\ann f$ has at least one generator in its socle degree. Finally,
we look at some generalizations of $M_f$.
