In this paper we consider a class of skew products over transitive subshifts
of finite type with interval fibers. For a natural class of 1-parameter
families we prove that for all but countably many parameter values the
nonwandering set (in particular, the union of all attractors and repellers) has
zero measure. As a consequence, the same holds for a residual subset of the
space of skew products.
