Upper limits on the \nuebar flux at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory have
been set based on the \nuebar charged-current reaction on deuterium. The
reaction produces a positron and two neutrons in coincidence. This distinctive
signature allows a search with very low background for \nuebar's from the Sun
and other potential sources. Both differential and integral limits on the
\nuebar flux have been placed in the energy range from 4 -- 14.8 MeV. For an
energy-independent \nu_e --> \nuebar conversion mechanism, the integral limit
on the flux of solar \nuebar's in the energy range from 4 -- 14.8 MeV is found
to be \Phi_\nuebar <= 3.4 x 10^4 cm^{-2} s^{-1} (90% C.L.), which corresponds
to 0.81% of the standard solar model 8B \nu_e flux of 5.05 x 10^6 cm^{-2}
s^{-1}, and is consistent with the more sensitive limit from KamLAND in the 8.3
-- 14.8 MeV range of 3.7 x 10^2 cm^{-2} s^{-1} (90% C.L.). In the energy range
from 4 -- 8 MeV, a search for \nuebar's is conducted using coincidences in
which only the two neutrons are detected. Assuming a \nuebar spectrum for the
neutron induced fission of naturally occurring elements, a flux limit of
Phi_\nuebar <= 2.0 x 10^6 cm^{-2} s^{-1}(90% C.L.) is obtained.
