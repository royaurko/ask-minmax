We study the merging of two independent Bose-Einstein condensates with
arbitrary initial phase difference, in the framework of a one-dimensional
time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii model. The role of the initial phase difference
in the process is discussed, and various types of phase-sensitive excitations
are identified.
