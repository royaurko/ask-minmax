The running of the non-minimal parameter (\xi) of the interaction of the real
scalar field and scalar curvature is explored within the non-perturbative
setting of the functional renormalization group (RG). We establish the RG flow
in curved space-time in the scalar field sector, in particular derive an
equation for the non-minimal parameter. The RG trajectory is numerically
explored for different sets of initial data.
