In this talk, we discuss the compatibility of different deeply inelastic
neutrino-nucleus data sets and the universal nuclear PDFs. This is an issue
that has lately been investigated by different groups but the conclusions have
been surprisingly contradictory. While some studies have found a good overall
agreement between the nuclear PDFs and the neutrino data, others have claimed
for an incompatibility. Here, we demonstrate that the independent neutrino data
sets from NuTeV, CHORUS and CDHSW collaborations differ in the absolute overall
normalization and that it is not possible to accurately reproduce all the data
simultaneously with a single set of PDFs. Our strategy to overcome this
difficulty and allow a consistent use of all neutrino data in global PDF
analyses is to normalize the data by the integrated cross-sections thereby
cancelling possible inaccuracies in the absolute normalization. Indeed, this
brings all data to a surprisingly good mutual agreement underscoring the
x-dependence of the nuclear modifications in a model-independent way. The
consistency of these data with the present nuclear PDFs is verified by
introducing a method to test the effect of a new data set in an existing global
fit that performed a Hessian error analysis.
