Systems of Newton equations of the form $\ddot{q}=-{1/2}A^{-1}(q)\nabla k$
with an integral of motion quadratic in velocities are studied. These equations
generalize the potential case (when A=I, the identity matrix) and they admit a
curious quasi-Lagrangian formulation which differs from the standard Lagrange
equations by the plus sign between terms. A theory of such quasi-Lagrangian
Newton (qLN) systems having two functionally independent integrals of motion is
developed with focus on two-dimensional systems. Such systems admit a
bi-Hamiltonian formulation and are proved to be completely integrable by
embedding into five-dimensional integrable systems. They are characterized by a
linear, second-order PDE which we call the fundamental equation. Fundamental
equations are classified through linear pencils of matrices associated with qLN
systems. The theory is illustrated by two classes of systems: separable
potential systems and driven systems. New separation variables for driven
systems are found. These variables are based on sets of non-confocal conics. An
effective criterion for existence of a qLN formulation of a given system is
formulated and applied to dynamical systems of the Henon-Heiles type.
