We introduce Euler/X, a toolkit for logic-based taxonomy integration. Given
two taxonomies and a set of alignment constraints between them, Euler/X
provides tools for detecting, explaining, and reconciling inconsistencies;
finding all possible merges between (consistent) taxonomies; and visualizing
merge results. Euler/X employs a number of different underlying reasoning
systems, including first-order reasoners (Prover9 and Mace4), answer set
programming (DLV and Potassco), and RCC reasoners (PyRCC8). We demonstrate the
features of Euler/X and provide experimental results showing its feasibility on
various synthetic and real-world examples.
