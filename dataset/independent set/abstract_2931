Probe-level models have led to improved performance in microarray studies but
the various sources of probe-level contamination are still poorly understood.
Data-driven analysis of probe performance can be used to quantify the
uncertainty in individual probes and to highlight the relative contribution of
different noise sources. Improved understanding of the probe-level effects can
lead to improved preprocessing techniques and microarray design.
  We have implemented probabilistic tools for probe performance analysis and
summarization on short oligonucleotide arrays. In contrast to standard
preprocessing approaches, the methods provide quantitative estimates of
probe-specific noise and affinity terms and tools to investigate these
parameters. Tools to incorporate prior information of the probes in the
analysis are provided as well. Comparisons to known probe-level error sources
and spike-in data sets validate the approach.
