Non-periodic systems have become more important in recent years, both
theoretically and practically. Their description via Delone sets requires the
extension of many standard concepts of crystallography. Here, we summarise some
useful notions of symmetry and aperiodicity, with special focus on the concept
of the hull of a Delone set. Our aim is to contribute to a more systematic and
consistent use of the different notions.
