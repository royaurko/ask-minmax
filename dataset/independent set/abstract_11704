The completeness problem of the bond market model with noise given by the
independent Wiener process and Poisson random measure is studied. Hedging
portfolios are assumed to have maturities in a countable, dense subset of a
finite time interval. It is shown that under some assumptions the market is not
complete unless the support of the Levy measure consists of a finite number of
points. Explicit constructions of contingent claims which can not be replicated
are provided.
