We study the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of large complex correlated
Wishart matrices at the edges of the limiting spectrum. In this setting, the
support of the limiting eigenvalue distribution may have several connected
components. Under mild conditions for the population matrices, we show that for
every generic positive edge of that support, there exists an extremal
eigenvalue which converges almost surely towards that edge and fluctuates
according to the Tracy-Widom law at the scale $N^{2/3}$. Moreover, given
several generic positive edges, we establish that the associated extremal
eigenvalue fluctuations are asymptotically independent. Finally, when the
leftmost edge is the origin, we prove that the smallest eigenvalue fluctuates
according to the hard-edge Tracy-Widom law at the scale $N^2$. As an
application, an asymptotic study of the condition number of large correlated
Wishart matrices is provided.
