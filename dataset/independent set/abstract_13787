We show that a necessary condition for eligibility of a candidate by the set
of de Borda's voting rules in [H. Moulin (1988), Axioms of cooperative decision
making] is not sufficient and we obtain a version of the criterion. Let
$r(a_i)$ be the score vector of a candidate $a_i$, $R$ be the set of all
vectors $r(a_i)$, and let $R'$ be the Pareto boundary of the convex hull $\conv
R$. Then there is a scoring $s$ such that a candidate $a$ wins with respect to
the de Borda voting rule $\beta_s$ if and only if $r(a)\in R'$.
