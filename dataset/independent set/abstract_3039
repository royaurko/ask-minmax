Global frequentist fits to the CMSSM and NUHM1 using the MasterCode framework
are updated to include the public results of searches for supersymmetric
signals using \sim 1/fb of LHC data recorded by ATLAS and CMS and \sim 0.3/fb
of data recorded by LHCb. We also include the constraints imposed by the
electroweak precision and B-physics observables, the cosmological dark matter
density and the XENON100 search for spin-independent dark matter scattering.
Finally we also investigate the impact of a possible Higgs signal around 125
GeV. The various constraints set new bounds on the parameter space of the CMSSM
and the NUHM1. We discuss the impact of the new results from SUSY and Higgs
searches for these bounds and analyze the impact for a future liner e^+e^-
collider.
