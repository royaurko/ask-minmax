It is an elementary fact that if we fix an arbitrary set of $d+1$ affine
independent points $\{p_0,\dots p_d\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, then the Euclidean
distances $\{|x-p_j|\}_{j=0}^d$ determine the point $x$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$
uniquely. In this paper we investigate a similar problem in general normed
spaces which is motivated by this known fact. Namely, we characterize those, at
least $d$-dimensional, real normed spaces $(X, \|\cdot\|)$ such that for every
set of $d+1$ affine independent points $\{p_0,\dots p_d\} \subset X$, the
distances $\{\|x-p_j\|\}_{j=0}^d$ determines the point $x$ lying in the simplex
$\mathrm{Conv}(p_0,\dots p_d)$ uniquely. Surprisingly, the characterization
depends on $d$.
