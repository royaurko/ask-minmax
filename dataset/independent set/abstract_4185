In superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor hybrid junctions, the
barrier edge states are expected to be protected against backscattering, to
generate unconventional proximity effects, and, possibly, to signal the
presence of Majorana fermions. The standards of proximity modes for these types
of structures have to be settled for a neat identification of possible new
entities. Through a systematic and complete set of measurements of the
Josephson properties we find evidence of ballistic transport in coplanar
Al-Bi2Se3-Al junctions that we attribute to a coherent transport through the
topological edge state. The shunting effect of the bulk only influences the
normal transport. This behavior, which can be considered to some extent
universal, is fairly independent of the specific features of superconducting
electrodes. A comparative study of Shubnikov - de Haas oscillations and
Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy gave an experimental signature compatible with
a two dimensional electron transport channel with a Dirac dispersion relation.
A reduction of the size of the Bi2Se3 flakes to the nanoscale is an unavoidable
step to drive Josephson junctions in the proper regime to detect possible
distinctive features of Majorana fermions.
