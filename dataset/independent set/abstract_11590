We characterize the asymptotic behaviour of the weighted power variation
processes associated with iterated Brownian motion. We prove weak convergence
results in the sense of finite dimensional distributions, and show that the
laws of the limiting objects can always be expressed in terms of three
independent Brownian motions X, Y and B, as well as of the local times of Y. In
particular, our results involve ``weighted'' versions of Kesten and Spitzer's
Brownian motion in random scenery. Our findings extend the theory initiated by
Khoshnevisan and Lewis (1999), and should be compared with the recent result by
Nourdin and R\'eveillac (2008), concerning the weighted power variations of
fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index H=1/4.
