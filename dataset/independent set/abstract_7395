Let $\beta>1$. We define a class of similitudes
\[S:=\left\{f_{i}(x)=\dfrac{x}{\beta^{n_i}}+a_i:n_i\in \mathbb{N}^{+}, a_i\in
\mathbb{R}\right\}.\] Taking any finite similitudes $\{f_{i}(x)\}_{i=1}^{m} $
from $S$, it is well known that there is a unique self-similar set $K_1$
satisfying $K_1=\cup_{i=1}^{m} f_{i}(K_1)$. Similarly, another self-similar set
$K_2$ can be generated via the finite contractive maps of $S$. We call
$K_1+K_2=\{x+y:x\in K_1, y\in K_2\}$ the arithmetic sum of two self-similar
sets. In this paper, we prove that $K_1+K_2$ is either a self-similar set or a
unique attractor of some infinite iterated function system. Using this result
we can then calculate the exact Hausdorff dimension of $K_1+K_2$ under some
conditions, which partially provides the dimensional result of $K_1+K_2$ if the
IFS's of $K_1$ and $K_2$ fail the irrational assumption, see Peres and Shmerkin
\cite{PS}.
