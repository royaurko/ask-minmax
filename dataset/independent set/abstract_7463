We investigate a theoretical model applicable to molecular conductors, such
as TTP and $M(dmit)_2$ salts [M=Ni, Pd, Pt], whose charge carriers orig
inate from two kinds of molecular orbitals. The model Hamiltonian consists of
two independent Hubbard chains. The degree of charge transfer between the two
chains is calculated. The results qualitatively agree with some experimental
data.
