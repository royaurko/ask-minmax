In this paper, we consider a family of random Cantor sets on the line and
consider the question of whether the condition that the sum of the Hausdorff
dimensions is larger than one implies the existence of interior points in the
difference set of two independent copies. We give a new and complete proof that
this is the case for the random Cantor sets introduced by Per Larsson.
