Let X be a divergence-free vector field defined on a closed, connected
Riemannian manifold. In this paper, we show the equivalence between the
following conditions:
  1. X is in the C1-interior of the set of expansive divergence-free vector
fields.
  2. X is in the C1-interior of the set of divergence-free vector fields which
satisfy the shadowing property.
  3. X is in the C1-interior of the set of divergence-free vector fields which
satisfy the Lipschitz shadowing property.
  4. X has no singularities and X is Anosov.
