We propose a new set of rotationally and translationally invariant features
for image or pattern recognition and classification. The new features are cubic
polynomials in the pixel intensities and provide a richer representation of the
original image than most existing systems of invariants. Our construction is
based on the generalization of the concept of bispectrum to the
three-dimensional rotation group SO(3), and a projection of the image onto the
sphere.
