Next-to-leading order calculations of heavy quark three-jet production in e^+
e^- annihilation are reviewed. Their application for the measurement of the
b-quark mass at LEP/SLC and to the test of the flavour independence of the
strong coupling constant are discussed. Prospects for future improvements are
studied.
