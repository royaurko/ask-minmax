Let $K$ be a algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 that is complete
with respect to a non-Archimedean absolute value. Let $\phi\in K(z)$ with
$\textrm{deg}(\phi)\geq 2$. In this paper we establish uniform logarithmic
equidistribution of the crucial measures $\nu_{\phi^n}$ attached to the
iterates of $\phi$. These measures were introduced by Rumely in his study of
the Minimal Resultant Locus of $\phi$. Our equidistribution result comes from a
bound on the diameter of points in $\textrm{supp}(\nu_{\phi^n})$ that depends
only on $n$ and $\phi$. We also show that the sets $\textrm{MinResLoc}(\phi^n)$
are bounded independent of $n$, and we give an explicit bound for the radius of
a ball about $\zeta_{\textrm{Gauss}}$ containing $\textrm{Bary}(\mu_\phi)$.
