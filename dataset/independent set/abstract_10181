The joint spectral radius of a finite set of real $d \times d$ matrices is
defined to be the maximum possible exponential rate of growth of long products
of matrices drawn from that set. A set of matrices is said to have the
\emph{finiteness property} if there exists a periodic product which achieves
this maximal rate of growth. J.C. Lagarias and Y. Wang conjectured in 1995 that
every finite set of real $d \times d$ matrices satisfies the finiteness
property. However, T. Bousch and J. Mairesse proved in 2002 that
counterexamples to the finiteness conjecture exist, showing in particular that
there exists a family of pairs of $2 \times 2$ matrices which contains a
counterexample. Similar results were subsequently given by V.D. Blondel, J.
Theys and A.A. Vladimirov and by V.S. Kozyakin, but no explicit counterexample
to the finiteness conjecture has so far been given. The purpose of this paper
is to resolve this issue by giving the first completely explicit description of
a counterexample to the Lagarias-Wang finiteness conjecture. Namely, for the
set \[ \mathsf{A}_{\alpha_*}:= \{({cc}1&1\\0&1), \alpha_*({cc}1&0\\1&1)\}\] we
give an explicit value of \alpha_* \simeq
0.749326546330367557943961948091344672091327370236064317358024...] such that
$\mathsf{A}_{\alpha_*}$ does not satisfy the finiteness property.
