We find that available data on $J/\Psi$ photoproduction at $|t|{\ge}$1 GeV
are energy independent over the range $22{\le}\sqrt{s}{\le}170$ GeV and show a
very soft $t$ dependence. Through a systematic analysis of the data we detect a
new trajectory, which manifests itself at threshold and is energy independent.
The trajectory couples to the axial form factor of the nucleon and can
reproduce the $J/\Psi$ exclusive photoproduction data at large -$t$.
