We consider Scr\"odinger equations with real-valued smooth Hamiltonians, and
non-smooth bounded pseudo-differential potentials, whose symbols may be not
even differentiable. The well-posedness of the Cauchy problem is proved in the
frame of the modulation spaces, and results of micro-local propagation of
singularities are given in terms of Gabor wave front sets.
