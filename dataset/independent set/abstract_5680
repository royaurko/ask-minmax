The ability of a protein to recognise multiple independent target
conformations was demonstrated in [1]. Here we consider the recognition of
correlated configurations, which we apply to funnel design for a single
conformation. The maximum basin of attraction, as parametrised in our model,
depends on the number of amino acid species as ln A, independent of protein
length. We argue that the extent to which the protein energy landscape can be
manipulated is fixed, effecting a trade-off between well breadth, well depth
and well number. This clarifies the scope and limits of protein and
heteropolymer function.
