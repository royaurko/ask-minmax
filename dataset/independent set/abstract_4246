Two-dimensional conformal field theories with extended $\cal{W}$-symmetry
algebras have dual descriptions in terms of weakly coupled higher spin gravity
in AdS$_3\,$ at large central charge. Observables that can be computed and
compared in the two descriptions include R\'enyi and entanglement entropies,
and correlation functions of local operators. We develop techniques for
computing these, in a manner that sheds light on when and why one can expect
agreement between such quantities on each side of the duality. We set up the
computation of excited state R\'enyi entropies in the bulk in terms of
Chern-Simons connections, and show how this directly parallels the CFT
computation of correlation functions. More generally, we consider the vacuum
conformal block for general operators with $\Delta \sim c\,$. When two of the
operators obey ${\Delta \over c} \ll 1\,$, we show by explicit computation that
the vacuum conformal block is computed by a bulk Wilson line probing an
asymptotically AdS$_3$ background with higher spin fields excited, the latter
emerging as the effective bulk description of the excited state produced by the
heavy operators. Among other things, this puts a previous proposal for
computing higher spin entanglement entropy via Wilson lines on firmer footing,
and clarifies its relation to CFT. We also study the corresponding computation
in Toda theory and find that this provides yet another independent way to
arrive at the same result.
