It is argued that the quadratic and linear non-commutative IR divergences
that occur in U(1) theory on non-commutative Minkowski spacetime for small
non-commutativity matrices $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ are gauge-fixing independent. This
implies in particular that the perturbative tachyonic instability produced by
the quadratic divergences of this type in the vacuum polarization tensor is not
a gauge-fixing artifact. Supersymmetry can be introduced to remove from the
renormalized Green functions at one loop, not only the non-logarithmic
non-commutative IR divergences, but also all terms proportional to
$\theta^{\mu\nu}p_\nu$
