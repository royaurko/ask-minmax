The Matsumoto-Yor (MY) property of the generalized inverse Gaussian and gamma
distributions has many generalizations. As observed in [Letac-Weso{\l}owski,
Ann. Probab. \textbf{28} (2000), 1371--1383] the natural framework for
multivariate MY property are symmetric cones, however they prove the result for
the cone of symmetric positive definite real matrices only.
  In this paper we prove the converse to the symmetric cone-variate MY
property, which extends earlier results. The smoothness assumption for
densities of respective variables is reduced to continuity only. It was
possible due to the new solution of a related functional equation for real
functions defined on symmetric cones, which seems to be of independent
interest.
