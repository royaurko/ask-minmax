Our current description of the large-scale Universe is now known with a
precision undreamt of a generation ago. Within the simple standard cosmological
model only six basic parameters are required. The usual parameter set includes
quantities most directly probed by the cosmic microwave background, but the
nature of these quantities is somewhat esoteric. However, many more numbers can
be derived that quantify various aspects of our Universe. Using constraints
from the Planck satellite, in combination with other data sets, we explore
several such quantities, highlighting some specific examples.
