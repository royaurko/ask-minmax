We find that sudden future singularities may also appear in spatially
inhomogeneous Stephani models of the universe. They are temporal pressure
singularities and may appear independently of the spatial finite density
singularities already known to exist in these models. It is shown that the main
advantage of the homogeneous sudden future singularities which is the
fulfillment of the strong and weak energy conditions may not be the case for
inhomogeneous models.
