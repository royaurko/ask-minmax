Let $(\Sigma_A, \sigma)$ be a subshift of finite type and let $M(x)$ be a
continuous function on $\Sigma_A$ taking values in the set of non-negative
matrices. We extend the classical scalar pressure function to this new setting
and prove the existence of the Gibbs measure and the differentiability of the
pressure function. We are especially interested on the case where $M(x)$ takes
finite values $M_1, ..., M_m$. The pressure function reduces to
$P(q):=\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{1}{n} \log \sum_{J \in \sum_{A, n}} \|M_J\|^q$.
The expression is important when we consider the multifractal formalism for
certain iterated function systems with overlaps.
