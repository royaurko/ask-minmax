In this article, we study the set of all solutions of linear differential
equations using Hurwitz series. We first obtain explicit recursive expressions
for solutions of such equations and study the group of differential
automorphisms of the set of all solutions. Moreover, we give explicit formulas
that compute the group of differential automorphisms. We require neither that
the underlying field be algebraically closed nor that the characteristic of the
field be zero.
