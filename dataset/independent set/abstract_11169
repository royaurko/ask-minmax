In the framework of a gauge invariant continuous and non-perturbative
regularization scheme based on the smearing of point like interactions by means
of cutoff functions, we show that the axial anomaly, though cutoff independent,
depends on the shape of the cutoff functions. The standard value for the
strength of the axial anomaly is recovered if we assume that the regularized
gauge invariant axial current is in addition local.
