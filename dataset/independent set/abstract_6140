New self-consistent parameter sets are presented and discussed for muon
collider rings at center-of-mass energies of 10, 30 and 100 TeV. All three
parameter sets attain luminosities of 3 x 10^35 /cm^2/s. The parameter sets
benefit from new insights gained at the HEMC'99 workshop that considered the
feasibility of many-TeV muon colliders.
