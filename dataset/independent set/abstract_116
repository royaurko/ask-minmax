We consider Khintchine type inequalities on the $p$-th moments of vectors of
$N$ pairwise independent Rademacher random variables. We establish that an
analogue of Khintchine's inequality cannot hold in this setting with a constant
that is independent of $N$; in fact, we prove that the best constant one can
hope for is at least $N^{1/2-1/p}$. Furthermore, we show that this estimate is
sharp for exchangeable vectors when $p = 4$. As a fortunate consequence of our
work, we obtain similar results for $3$-wise independent vectors.
