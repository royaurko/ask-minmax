Relaxation method is described on simple superconducting cases in one and two
dimensions in Ginzburg-Landau (GL) formalism. The structure of the algorithm is
given for the case time independent and time dependent GL equation. The
advantages and disadvantages of the algorithm are specified. Particular cases
solved by the relaxation algorithm is unconventional Josephson junction (uJJ),
modified uJJ, SQUID built on the base of uJJ and superconduting current
limiter. The artifacts of relaxation algorithm are described.
