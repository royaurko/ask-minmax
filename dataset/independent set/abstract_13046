A theory of image-potential states is presented for the general case where
these surface electronic states are resonant with a bulk continuum. The theory
extends the multiple scattering approach of Echenique and Pendry into the
strong coupling regime while retaining independence from specific forms of
surface and bulk potentials. The theory predicts the existence of a
well-resolved series of resonances for arbitrary coupling strengths.
Surprisingly, distinct image-potential resonances are thus expected to exist on
almost any metal surface, even in the limiting case of jellium.
