The geometry of Sp(3)/U(3) as a subvariety of Gr(3,6) is explored to explain
several examples given by Mukai of non-abelian Brill-Noether loci, and to give
some new examples. These examples identify Brill-Noether loci of vector bundles
on linear sections of the Lagrangian Grassmannian Sp(3)/U(3) with orthogonal
linear sections of the dual variety and vice versa. A main technical result of
independent interest is the fact that any nodal hyperplane section of the
Lagrangian Grassmannian projected from the node is a linear section of the
Grassmannian Gr(2,6).
