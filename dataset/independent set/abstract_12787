Population dynamics are often subject to random independent changes in the
environment. For the two strategy stochastic replicator dynamic, we assume that
stochastic changes in the environment replace the payoffs and variance. This is
modeled by a continuous time Markov chain in a finite atom space. We establish
conditions for this dynamic to have an analogous characterization of the
long-run behavior to that of the deterministic dynamic. To create intuition, we
first consider the case when the Markov chain has two states. A very natural
extension to the general finite state space of the Markov chain will be given.
