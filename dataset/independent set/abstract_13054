We derive the general Ward identities for scale and special conformal
transformations in theories of single field inflation. Our analysis is model
independent and based on symmetry considerations alone. The identities we
obtain are valid to all orders in the slow roll expansion. For special
conformal transformations, the Ward identities include a term which is
non-linear in the fields that arises due to a compensating spatial
reparametrization. Some observational consequences are also discussed.
