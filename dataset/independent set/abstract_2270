This paper describes the development and use of a lexical semantic database
for the Verbmobil speech-to-speech machine translation system. The motivation
is to provide a common information source for the distributed development of
the semantics, transfer and semantic evaluation modules and to store lexical
semantic information application-independently.
 The database is organized around a set of abstract semantic classes and has
been used to define the semantic contributions of the lemmata in the vocabulary
of the system, to automatically create semantic lexica and to check the
correctness of the semantic representations built up. The semantic classes are
modelled using an inheritance hierarchy. The database is implemented using the
lexicon formalism LeX4 developed during the project.
