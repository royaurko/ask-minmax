We analyze the time reversal of waves in a turbulent medium using the
parabolic Markovian model. We prove that the time reversal resolution can be a
nonlinear function of the wavelength and independent of the aperture. We
establish a duality relation between the turbulence-induced wave spread and the
time-reversal resolution which can be viewed as an uncertainty inequality for
random media. The inequality becomes an equality when the wave structure
function is Gaussian.
