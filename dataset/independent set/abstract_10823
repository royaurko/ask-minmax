The analytical perturbative approach, if taken to the limit of its
applicability, allows one to predict an energy independent limit for the
one-particle invariant density in QCD jets E dn/d^3p at very small momenta p.
This is a direct consequence of the colour coherence in soft gluon branching.
The existing data on the charged and identified particle inclusive spectra
follow this prediction surprisingly well. Further tests of the perturbatively
based picture in the soft region are discussed.
