We study an indexing architecture to store and search in a set of
high-dimensional vectors. This architecture is composed of several memory
units, each of which summarizes a fraction of the database by a single
representative vector. The potential similarity of the query to one of the
vectors stored in the memory unit is gauged by a simple correlation with the
memory unit's representative vector. This representative optimizes the test of
the following hypothesis: the query is independent from any vector in the
memory unit vs. the query is a simple perturbation of one of the stored vector.
  Compared to exhaustive search, our approach finds the most similar database
vectors significantly faster without a noticeable reduction in search quality.
Interestingly, the reduction of complexity is provably better in
high-dimensional spaces. We empirically demonstrate its practical interest in a
large-scale image search scenario. Our evaluation is carried out on standard
benchmarks for large-scale image search and uses off-the-shelf state-of-the-art
descriptors.
