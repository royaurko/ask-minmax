Classical ergodic theory for integer-group actions uses entropy as a complete
invariant for isomorphism of IID (independent, identically distributed)
processes (a.k.a. product measures). This theory holds for amenable groups as
well. Despite recent spectacular progress of Bowen, the situation for
non-amenable groups, including free groups, is still largely mysterious. We
present some illustrative results and open questions on free groups, which are
particularly interesting in combinatorics, statistical physics, and
probability. Our results include bounds on minimum and maximum bisection for
random cubic graphs that improve on all past bounds.
