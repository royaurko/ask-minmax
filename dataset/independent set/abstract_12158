In this paper, we prove that the superhorizon conservation of the curvature
perturbation zeta in single-field inflation holds as an operator statement.
This implies that all zeta-correlators are time independent at all orders in
the loop expansion. Our result follows directly from locality and
diffeomorphism invariance of the underlying theory. We also explore the
relationship between the conservation of zeta, the single-field consistency
relation and the renormalization of composite operators.
