We consider percolation in a multiscale Boolean model. This model is defined
as the union of scaled independent copies of a given Boolean model. The scale
factor of the $n^{\textrm{th}}$ copy is $\rho^{-n}$. We prove, under optimal
integrability assumptions, that no percolation occurs in the multiscale Boolean
model for large enough $\rho$ if the rate of the Boolean model is below some
critical value.
