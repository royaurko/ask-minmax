The greedy algorithm A iterates over a set of uniformly sized independent
sets of a given graph G and checks for each set S which non-neighbor of S, if
any, is best suited to be added to S, until no more suitable non-neighbors are
found for any of the sets. The algorithms receives as arguments the graph, the
heuristic used to evaluate the independent set candidates, and the initial
cardinality of the independent sets, and returns the final set of independent
sets.
