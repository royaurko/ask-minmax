Choose n random, independent points in R^d according to a fixed distribution.
The convex hull of these points is a random polytope. In some cases, central
limit theorems have been proven for the components of f-vectors of random
polytopes constructed in this and similar ways. In this paper, we provide
numerical evidence that the components of the f-vectors of random polytopes
generated according to five different distributions are approximately jointly
Gaussian for large n.
