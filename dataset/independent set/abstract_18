A new notion of vertex independence and rank for a finite graph G is
introduced. The independence of vertices is based on the boolean independence
of columns of a natural boolean matrix associated to G. Rank is the cardinality
of the largest set of independent columns. Some basic properties and some more
advanced theorems are proved. Geometric properties of the graph are related to
its rank and independent sets.
