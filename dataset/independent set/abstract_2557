We have fitted low- and medium-energy benchmark datasets employing methods
used in the MAID/SAID and dynamical model analyses. Independent fits from the
Mainz, RPI, Yerevan, and Kharkov groups have also been performed over the
low-energy region. Results for the multipole amplitudes are compared in order
to gauge the model-dependence of such fits, given identical data and a single
method for error handling.
