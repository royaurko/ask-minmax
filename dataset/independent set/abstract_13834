We study global reflection symmetries of almost periodic functions. In the
non-limit periodic case, we establish an upper bound on the Haar measure of the
set of those elements in the hull which are almost symmetric about the origin.
As an application of this result we prove that in the non-limit periodic case,
the criterion of Jitomirskaya and Simon ensuring absence of eigenvalues for
almost periodic Schr\"odinger operators is only applicable on a set of zero
Haar measure. We complement this by giving examples of limit periodic functions
where the Jitomirskaya-Simon criterion can be applied to every element of the
hull.
