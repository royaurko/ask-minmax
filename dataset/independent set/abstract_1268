The hallmark of a major evolutionary transition, whereby independently
replicating units became grouped together into larger wholes, is the
"decoupling" of fitness of the collective from the individual fitnesses of the
units. It is widely believed that the key element making such decoupling
possible is extensive cooperation between the lower-level entities. Here, it is
demonstrated that cohesive multicellular behavior can arise in a purely
competitive setting as a generic consequence of division of labor. A minimal
theoretical model of competitive coexistence on multiple resources provides an
explicit manifestation of fitness decoupling in a rigorous mathematical sense.
This form of multicellular behavior is not vulnerable to "cheaters" and can be
expected to be widespread in microbial ecosystems.
