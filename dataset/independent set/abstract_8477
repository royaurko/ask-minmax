Cameron and Erd\H{o}s raised the question of how many maximal sum-free sets
there are in $\{1, \dots , n\}$, giving a lower bound of $2^{\lfloor n/4
\rfloor }$. In this paper we prove that there are in fact at most
$2^{(1/4+o(1))n}$ maximal sum-free sets in $\{1, \dots , n\}$. Our proof makes
use of container and removal lemmas of Green as well as a result of
Deshouillers, Freiman, S\'os and Temkin on the structure of sum-free sets.
