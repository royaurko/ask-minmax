In this paper, we theoretically prove a set of fundamental conditions
pertaining discrete velocity sets and corresponding weights. These conditions
provide sufficient conditions for a priori formulation of lattice Boltzmann
models that automatically admit correct hydrodynamic moments up to any given
N-th order.
