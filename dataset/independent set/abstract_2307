Using the axially-symmetric time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation we study
the Josephson oscillation of an attractive Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a
one-dimensional periodic optical-lattice potential. We find that the Josephson
frequency is virtually independent of the number of atoms in the BEC and of the
inter-atomic interaction (attractive or repulsive). We study the dependence of
Josephson frequency on the laser wave length and the strength of the
optical-lattice potential. For a fixed laser wave length (795 nm), the
Josephson frequency decreases with increasing strength as found in the
experiment of Cataliotti {\it et al.} [Science {\bf 293}, 843 (2001)]. For a
fixed strength, the Josephson frequency remains essentially unchanged for a
reasonable variation of laser wave length around 800 nm. However, for a fixed
strength, the Josephson oscillation is disrupted with the increase of laser
wave length beyond 2000 nm leading to a collapse of a sufficiently attractive
BEC. These features of Josephson oscillation can be tested experimentally with
present set ups.
