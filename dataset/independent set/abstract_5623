In this paper we consider first-order logic theorem proving and model
building via approximation and instantiation. Given a clause set we propose its
approximation into a simplified clause set where satisfiability is decidable.
The approximation extends the signature and preserves unsatisfiability: if the
simplified clause set is satisfiable in some model, so is the original clause
set in the same model interpreted in the original signature. A refutation
generated by a decision procedure on the simplified clause set can then either
be lifted to a refutation in the original clause set, or it guides a refinement
excluding the previously found unliftable refutation. This way the approach is
refutationally complete. We do not step-wise lift refutations but conflicting
cores, finite unsatisfiable clause sets representing at least one refutation.
The approach is dual to many existing approaches in the literature because our
approximation preserves unsatisfiability.
