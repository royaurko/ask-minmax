In this paper, we propose cylindrical distributions obtained by combining the
sine-skewed von Mises distribution (circular part) with the Weibull
distribution (linear part). This new model, the WeiSSVM, enjoys numerous
advantages: simple normalizing constant and hence very tractable density,
parameter-parsimony and interpretability, good circular-linear dependence
structure, easy random number generation thanks to known marginal/conditional
distributions, flexibility illustrated via excellent fitting abilities, and a
straightforward extension to the case of directional-linear data. Inferential
issues, such as independence testing, can easily be tackled with our model,
which we apply on two real data sets. We conclude the paper by discussing
future applications of our model.
