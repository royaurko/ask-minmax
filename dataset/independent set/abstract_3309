We consider the ensemble of $N\times N$ ($N\gg 1$) symmetric random matrices
with the bimodal independent distribution of matrix elements: each element
could be either "1" with the probability $p$, or "0" otherwise. We pay
attention to the "diluted" sparse regime, taking $p=1/N +\epsilon$, where
$0<\epsilon \ll 1/N$. In this limit the eigenvalue density, $\rho(\lambda)$, is
essentially singular, consisting of a hierarchical ultrametric set of peaks. We
provide two conjectures concerning the structure of $\rho(\lambda)$: (i) we
propose an equation for the position of sequential (in heights) peaks, and (ii)
we give an expression for the shape of an outbound enveloping curve. We point
out some similarities of $\rho(\lambda)$ with the shapes constructed on the
basis of the Dedekind modular $\eta$-function.
