In this paper, we construct non-trivial solutions to the $2D$-dimensional
field equations of Double Field Theory (DFT) by using a consistent
Scherk-Schwarz ansatz. The ansatz identifies $2(D-d)$ internal directions with
a twist $U^M{}_N$ which is directly connected to the covariant fluxes
$\mathcal{F}_{ABC}$. It exhibits $2(D-d)$ linear independent generalized
Killing vectors $K_I{}^J$ and gives rise to a gauged supergravity in $d$
dimensions. We analyze the covariant fluxes and the corresponding gauged
supergravity with a Minkowski vacuum. We calculate fluctuations around such
vacua and show how they gives rise to massive scalars field and vectors field
with a non-abelian gauge algebra. Because DFT is a background independent
theory, these fields should directly correspond the string excitations in the
corresponding background. For $(D-d)=3$ we perform a complete scan of all
allowed covariant fluxes and find two different kinds of backgrounds: the
single and the double elliptic case. The later is not T-dual to a geometric
background and cannot be transformed to a geometric setting by a field
redefinition either. While this background fulfills the strong constraint, it
is still consistent with the Killing vectors depending on the coordinates and
the winding coordinates, thereby giving a non-geometric patching. This
background can therefore not be described in Supergravity or Generalized
Geometry.
