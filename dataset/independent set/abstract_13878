Talagrand's positivity principle states that one can slightly perturb a
Hamiltonian in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in such a way that the overlap
of two configurations under the perturbed Gibbs' measure will become typically
nonnegative. In this note we observe that abstracting from the setting of the
SK model only improves the result and does not require any modifications in
Talagrand's argument. In this version, for example, positivity principle
immediately applies to the setting of Aizenman-Sims-Starr interpolation. Also,
abstracting from the SK model improves the conditions in the Ghirlanda-Guerra
identities and as a consequence results in a perturbation of smaller order
necessary to ensure positivity of the overlap.
