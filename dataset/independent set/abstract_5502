Private Set Intersection (PSI) is usually implemented as a sequence of
encryption rounds between pairs of users, whereas the present work implements
PSI in a simpler fashion: each set only needs to be encrypted once, after which
each pair of users need only one ordinary set comparison. This is typically
orders of magnitude faster than ordinary PSI at the cost of some ``fuzziness"
in the matching, which may nonetheless be tolerable or even desirable. This is
demonstrated in the case where the sets consist of English words processed with
WordNet.
