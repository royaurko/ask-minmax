When simultaneously reasoning with evidences about several different events
it is necessary to separate the evidence according to event. These events
should then be handled independently. However, when propositions of evidences
are weakly specified in the sense that it may not be certain to which event
they are referring, this may not be directly possible. In this paper a
criterion for partitioning evidences into subsets representing events is
established. This criterion, derived from the conflict within each subset,
involves minimising a criterion function for the overall conflict of the
partition. An algorithm based on characteristics of the criterion function and
an iterative optimisation among partitionings of evidences is proposed.
