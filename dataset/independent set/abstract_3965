Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is an approach to sampling design and
inference in hard-to-reach human populations. Typically, a sampling frame is
not available, and population members are difficult to identify or recruit from
broader sampling frames. Common examples include injecting drug users, men who
have sex with men, and female sex workers. Most analysis of RDS data has
focused on estimating aggregate characteristics, such as disease prevalence.
However, RDS is often conducted in settings where the population size is
unknown and of great independent interest. This paper presents an approach to
estimating the size of a target population based on data collected through RDS.
  The proposed approach uses a successive sampling approximation to RDS to
leverage information in the ordered sequence of observed personal network
sizes. The inference uses the Bayesian framework, allowing for the
incorporation of prior knowledge. A flexible class of priors for the population
size is proposed that aids elicitation. An extensive simulation study provides
insight into the performance of the method for estimating population size under
a broad range of conditions. A further study shows the approach also improves
estimation of aggregate characteristics. A particular choice of the prior
produces interval estimates with good frequentist properties. Finally, the
method demonstrates sensible results when used to estimate the numbers of
sub-populations most at risk for HIV in two cities in El Salvador.
