Log-linear models are a classical tool for the analysis of contingency
tables. In particular, the subclass of graphical log-linear models provides a
general framework for modelling conditional independences. However, with the
exception of special structures, marginal independence hypotheses cannot be
accommodated by these traditional models. Focusing on binary variables, we
present a model class that provides a framework for modelling marginal
independences in contingency tables. The approach taken is graphical and draws
on analogies to multivariate Gaussian models for marginal independence. For the
graphical model representation we use bi-directed graphs, which are in the
tradition of path diagrams. We show how the models can be parameterized in a
simple fashion, and how maximum likelihood estimation can be performed using a
version of the Iterated Conditional Fitting algorithm. Finally we consider
combining these models with symmetry restrictions.
