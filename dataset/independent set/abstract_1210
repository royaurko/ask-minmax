We propose a censored quantile regression estimator motivated by unbiased
estimating equations. Under the usual conditional independence assumption of
the survival time and the censoring time given the covariates, we show that the
proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. We develop an
efficient computational algorithm which uses existing quantile regression code.
As a result, bootstrap-type inference can be efficiently implemented. We
illustrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method by simulation
studies and analysis of a survival data set.
