The measurement of biallelic pair-wise association called linkage
disequilibrium (LD) is an important issue in order to understand the genomic
architecture. A large variety of such measures of association have been
proposed in the literature. We propose and justify six biometrical postulates
which should be fulfilled by a canonical measure of LD. In short, LD measures
are defined as a mapping of probability tables to the set of real numbers. They
should be zero in case of independence and extremal if one of the entries
approaches zero while the marginals are positively bounded. They should reflect
the symmetry group of the tables and be invariant under certain transformations
of the marginals (selection invariance). There scale should have maximum
entropy relative to a calibrating symmetric distribution. None of the
established measures fulfil all of these properties in general. We prove that
there is a unique canonical measure of LD for each choice of a calibrating
distribution. We compa- re the canonical LD measures with other candidates from
the literature. We recommend the canonical measure derived from Jeffreys'
non-informative prior distribution when assessing linkage disequilibrium of SNP
array data. In a second part, we consider various estimators for the
theoretical LD measures discussed and compare them in a simulation study.
