We present an {\it algebraic} isospin approach towards a more straightforward
and model-independent determination of the weak phase $\alpha$ (or $\phi_2$)
and QCD penguin pollution in $B\to \pi\pi$ decays. The world averages of
current experimental data allow us to impose some useful constraints on the
isospin parameters of $B\to \pi\pi$ transitions. We find that the magnitude of
$\alpha$ (or $\phi_2$) extracted from the indirect CP violation in $\pi^+\pi^-$
mode is in agreement with the standard-model expectation from other indirect
measurements, but its four-fold discrete ambiguity has to be resolved in the
near future.
