We give an interpretation of the t=1 specialization of the modified Macdonald
polynomial as a generating function of the energy statistics defined on the set
of paths arising in the context of Box-Ball Systems (BBS-paths for short). We
also introduce one parameter generalizations of the energy statistics on the
set of BBS-paths which all, conjecturally, have the same distribution.
