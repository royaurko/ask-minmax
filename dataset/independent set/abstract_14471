A set of $q$ triangles sharing a common edge is a called a book of size $q$.
Letting $bk(G)$ denote the size of the largest book in a graph $G$, Erd\H{o}s
and Rothschild \cite{erdostwo} asked what the minimal value of $bk(G)$ is for
graphs $G$ with $n$ vertices and a set number of edges where every edge is
contained in at least one triangle. In this paper, we show that for any graph
$G$ with $n$ vertices and $\frac{n^2}{4} - nf(n)$ edges where every edge is
contained in at least one triangle, $bk(G) \geq
\Omega\left(\min{\{\frac{n}{\sqrt{f(n)}}, \frac{n^2}{f(n)^2}\}}\right)$.
