We seek to understand the impact on shape estimators obtained from circular
and elliptical shapelet models under two realistic conditions: (a) only a
limited number of shapelet modes is available for the model, and (b) the
intrinsic galactic shapes are not restricted to shapelet models.
  We create a set of simplistic simulations, in which the galactic shapes
follow a Sersic profile. By varying the Sersic index and applied shear, we
quantify the amount of bias on shear estimates which arises from insufficient
modeling. Additional complications due to PSF convolution, pixelation and pixel
noise are also discussed.
  Steep and highly elliptical galaxy shapes cannot be accurately modeled within
the circular shapelet basis system and are biased towards shallower and less
elongated shapes. This problem can be cured partially by allowing elliptical
basis functions, but for steep profiles elliptical shapelet models still depend
critically on accurate ellipticity priors. As a result, shear estimates are
typically biased low. Independently of the particular form of the estimator,
the bias depends on the true intrinsic galaxy morphology, but also on the size
and shape of the PSF.
  As long as the issues discussed here are not solved, the shapelet method
cannot provide weak-lensing measurements with an accuracy demanded by upcoming
missions and surveys, unless one can provide an accurate and reliable
calibration, specific for the dataset under investigation.
