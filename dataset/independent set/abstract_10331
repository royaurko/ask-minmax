The period-luminosity (PL) relation for Galactic Cepheids is derived with
recent independent distance measurements taken from literature. Our PL relation
confirms the work of Tammann et al. (2003), which showed that the Galactic
Cepheids follow a different PL relation to their LMC counterparts. Our results
also show that the slope of the Galactic PL relation is inconsistent with the
LMC slope with more than 95% confidence. The details of this work can be found
in Ngeow & Kanbur (2004).
