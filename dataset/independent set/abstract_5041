Certain previously known upper bounds on the moments of the norm of
martingales in 2-smooth Banach spaces are improved. Some of these improvements
hold even for sums of independent real-valued random variables. Applications to
concentration of measure on product spaces for separately Lipschitz functions
are presented, including ones concerning the central moments of the norm of the
sums of independent random vectors in any separable Banach space.
