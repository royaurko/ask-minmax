As a test of the new light-front coupled-cluster method in a gauge theory, we
apply it to the nonperturbative construction of the dressed-electron state in
QED, for an arbitrary covariant gauge, and compute the electron's anomalous
magnetic moment. The construction illustrates the spectator and Fock-sector
independence of vertex and self-energy contributions and indicates resolution
of the difficulties with uncanceled divergences that plague methods based on
Fock-space truncation.
