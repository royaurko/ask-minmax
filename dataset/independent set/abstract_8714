We review the philosophical framework of mathematical conceptualism as an
alternative to set-theoretic foundations and show how mainstream mathematics
can be developed on this basis. The paper includes an explicit axiomatization
of the basic principles of conceptualism in a formal system CM set in the
language of third order arithmetic.
