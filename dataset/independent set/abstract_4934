In this series of two papers, we study the logics of dependence and
independence concepts in propositional logic.
  In this first paper, we define propositional dependence logic, propositional
intuitionistic dependence logic, as well as some interesting variants of them.
We study the expressive power of these logics, provide deductive systems and
prove completeness theorems for them.
  Part 2 of this sequence of papers will focus on propositional independence
logic.
