An involution on a finite set is a bijection such as I(I(e))=e for all the
element of the set. A fixed-point free involution on a finite set is an
involution such as I(e)=e for none element of the set. In this article, the
fixed-point free involutions are represented as partitions of the set and some
properties linked to this representation are exhibited. Then an optimal
algorithm to list all the fixed-point free involutions is presented. Its
soundness relies on the representation of the fixed-point free involutions as
partitions. Finally, an implementation of the algorithm is proposed, with an
effective data representation.
