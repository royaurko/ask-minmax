We consider equally-weighted Cantor measures $\mu_{q,b}$ arising from
iterated function systems of the form ${b^{-1}(x+i)}$, $i=0,1,...,q-1$, where
$q<b$. We classify the $(q,b)$ so that they have infinitely many mutually
orthogonal exponentials in $L^2(\mu_{q,b})$. In particular, if $q$ divides $b$,
the measures have a complete orthogonal exponential system and hence spectral
measures. We then characterize all the maximal orthogonal sets $\Lambda$ when
$q$ divides $b$ via a maximal mapping on the $q-$adic tree in which all
elements in $\Lambda$ are represented uniquely in finite $b-$adic expansions
and we can separate the maximal orthogonal sets into two types: regular and
irregular sets. For a regular maximal orthogonal set, we show that its
completeness in $L^2(\mu_{q,b})$ is crucially determined by the certain growth
rate of non-zero digits in the tail of the $b-$adic expansions of the elements.
Furthermore, we exhibit complete orthogonal exponentials with zero Beurling
dimensions. These examples show that the technical condition in Theorem 3.5 of
\cite{[DHSW]} cannot be removed. For an irregular maximal orthogonal set, we
show that under some condition, its completeness is equivalent to that of the
corresponding regularized mapping.
