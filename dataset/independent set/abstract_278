A graph G is well-covered if all its maximal independent sets are of the same
cardinality. Assume that a weight function w is defined on its vertices. Then G
is w-well-covered if all maximal independent sets are of the same weight. For
every graph G, the set of weight functions w such that G is w-well-covered is a
vector space. Given an input claw-free graph G, we present an O(n^6)algortihm,
whose input is a claw-free graph G, and output is the vector space of weight
functions w, for which G is w-well-covered. A graph G is equimatchable if all
its maximal matchings are of the same cardinality. Assume that a weight
function w is defined on the edges of G. Then G is w-equimatchable if all its
maximal matchings are of the same weight. For every graph G, the set of weight
functions w such that G is w-equimatchable is a vector space. We present an
O(m*n^4 + n^5*log(n)) algorithm which receives an input graph G, and outputs
the vector space of weight functions w such that G is w-equimatchable.
