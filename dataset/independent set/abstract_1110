We prove a necessary and sufficient criterion for the exponential stability
of periodic solutions of delay differential equations with large delay. We show
that for sufficiently large delay the Floquet spectrum near criticality is
characterized by a set of curves, which we call asymptotic continuous spectrum,
that is independent on the delay.
