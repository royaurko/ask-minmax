Between 1995-2000, the LEP e+e- collider has been operated above the Z0 peak,
at centre-of-mass energies sqrt(s) = 130-209 GeV. Searches for supersymmetric
particles have been performed using these data samples. The results from the
four LEP experiments have been combined. Model independent limits on the
pair-production cross-sections of supersymmetric particles and constraints on
their masses are presented in the context of the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM) and in the context of gauge-mediated supersymmetry
breaking models (GMSB). Results assuming an R-parity violating scenario are
also reviewed.
