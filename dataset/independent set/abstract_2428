We predict the two-photon width of the pseudoscalar bottomonia, Gamma(eta_b
-> gamma gamma), Gamma(eta'_b -> gamma gamma) and Gamma(eta''_b -> gamma gamma)
within a Heavy-Quark Spin-Symmetry setting following the same line as our
recent work for the corresponding decays for charmonia. Binding-energy effects
are included for excited states and are shown to shift up the eta'_b and
eta''_b widths by 10 %. We point out that the essentially model independent
ratio Gamma(eta_b -> gamma gamma)/Gamma(Upsilon -> ll) and the branching ratio
BR(eta_b -> gamma gamma) obtained could be used to extract the coupling
constant alpha_s.
