The evolution of the structure factor is studied during the phase-ordering
dynamics of the kinetic Ising model with conserved order parameter. A
preasymptotic multiscaling regime is found as in the solution of the
Cahn-Hilliard-Cook equation, revealing that the late stage of phase-ordering is
always approached through a crossover from multiscaling to standard scaling,
independently from the nature of the microscopic dynamics.
