We show that any vacuum initial data set containing a marginally outer
trapped surface S and satisfying a "no KIDs" condition can be perturbed near S
so that S becomes strictly outer trapped in the new vacuum initial data set.
This, together with the results in [9], gives a precise sense in which generic
initial data containing marginally outer trapped surfaces lead to geodesically
incomplete spacetimes.
