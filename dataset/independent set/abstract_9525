By using spontaneous Raman processes in the high gain regime, we produce two
independent Raman Stokes fields from an atomic ensemble. Temporal beating is
observed between the two directly generated Stokes fields in a single
realization. The beat frequency is found to be a result of an AC Stark
frequency shift effect. However, due to the spontaneous nature of the process,
the phases of the two Stokes fields change from one realization to another so
that the beat signal disappears after average over many realizations. On the
other hand, the beat signal is recovered in a two-photon correlation
measurement, showing a two-photon interference effect. The two-photon beat
signal enables us to obtain dephasing information in the Raman process. The
dephasing effect is found to depend on the temperature of the atomic medium.
