Nucleus-nucleus interaction is studied in the framework of the perturbative
QCD with large number of colours and a fixed coupling constant. The pomeron
tree diagrams are summed by an effective field theory. The classical field
equations are solved by iteration procedure, which is found convergent in a
restricted domain of not too high energies and atomic numbers. The found gluon
distributions do not scale, have their maxima close to 2 GeV/c independent of
rapidity and fall towards the central rapidity region. The cross-sections
slowly grow with energy due to the contribution from peripheral collisions,
where evolution remains linear. Simple variational estimates at higher
rapidities confirm this tendency.
