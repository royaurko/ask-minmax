We have shown both experimentally and theoretically that
polarization-independent broad-band absorption of electromagnetic waves by an
overdense plasma, caused by surface plasmon-polaritons (SPP) excitation, can be
achieved due to combination of two factors: a non-zero angle of incidence and a
two-dimensional circular diffraction grating placed at a properly chosen
distance in front of the plasma boundary. Direct detection of SPP has been
achieved for the first time using a miniature antenna imbedded in the plasma.
