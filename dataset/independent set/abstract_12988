We analyze a family of algorithms for computing rational points of
hypersurfaces defined over a finite field based on searches on "vertical
strips", namely searches on parallel lines in a given direction. We consider
two basic models of generation of vertical strips: an "independent" model,
where repetitions are allowed, and a "nonindependent one", where repetitions
are avoided. We determine the asymptotic probability distribution of the number
of searches and show that it decays with an exponential ratio in both models.
We also analyze the probability distribution of outputs, using the notion of
Shannon entropy, and prove that both models are somewhat close to any "ideal"
equidistributed algorithm.
