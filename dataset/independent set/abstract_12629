Thermal fluctuations of a critical system induce long-ranged Casimir forces
between objects that couple to the underlying field. For two dimensional (2D)
conformal field theories (CFT) we derive an exact result for the Casimir
interaction between two objects of arbitrary shape, in terms of (1) the free
energy of a circular ring whose radii are determined by the mutual capacitance
of two conductors with the objects' shape; and (2) a purely geometric energy
that is proportional to conformal charge of the CFT, but otherwise
super-universal in that it depends only on the shapes and is independent of
boundary conditions and other details.
