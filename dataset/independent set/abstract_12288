We determine the quark mass ratio m_c/m_s on the lattice, using Wilson-type
fermions. Configurations with N_f=2 dynamical clover-improved fermions by the
QCDSF collaboration are used, which were made available through the ILDG. In
the valence sector we use a sophisticated, mass-independently O(a)-improved
Wilson-type action with small cut-off effects even in the charm mass region.
After an extrapolation to the physical pion mass, to zero lattice spacing and
to infinite box volume, we find m_c/m_s=11.27(30)(26).
