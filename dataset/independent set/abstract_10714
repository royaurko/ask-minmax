Some issues of the cosmological constant or dark energy are briefly reviewed.
There are an increasing number of observations that constrain the equation of
state of dark energy more stringently and favor the time-independent
cosmological constant. Then a plausible model of dark energy would be a theory
with degenerate perturbative vacua in which its origin is explained by a
nonperturbative effect so that, unlike quintessence, k-essence etc., it is
separable from the perturbative problem why its amplitude is smaller than the
Planckian density by a factor of $\order (10^{-120})$.
