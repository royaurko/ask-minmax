In this paper we deduce a universal result about the asymptotic distribution
of roots of random polynomials, which can be seen as a complement to an old and
famous result of Erdos and Turan. More precisely, given a sequence of random
polynomials, we show that, under some very general conditions, the roots tend
to cluster near the unit circle, and their angles are uniformly distributed.
The method we use is deterministic: in particular, we do not assume
independence or equidistribution of the coefficients of the polynomial.
