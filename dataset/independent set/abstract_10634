The transition from partial to complete spin polarization of two-dimensional
electrons at half filling of the lowest Landau level has been studied using
resistively-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (RDNMR). The nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation time is observed to be density independent in the
partially polarized phase but to increase sharply at the transition to full
polarization. At low temperatures the RDNMR signal exhibits a strong maximum
near the critical density.
