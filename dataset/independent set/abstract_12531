We review the model-independent description of the couplings of the top quark
to the Higgs and gauge bosons in theories beyond the Standard Model. Then we
examine these couplings in the case of arbitrary heavy vector-like quarks
mixing with the third family. We also discuss the couplings of these top
partners, and comment on implications for LHC searches.
