It is shown that gauge field-dependent fermion Dirac operators from lattice
QCD form an ergodic operator family in the probabilistic sense, provided the
gauge field is an ergodic random field. As a consequence, the integrated
density of states of such Dirac operators in the thermodynamic limit exists and
is almost surely independent of the chosen gauge field configuration.
