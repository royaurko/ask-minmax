In this paper we define a new class of metric spaces, called multi-model
Cantor sets. We compute the Hausdorff dimension and show that the Hausdorff
measure of a multi-model Cantor set is finite and non-zero. We then show that a
bilipschitz map from one multi-model Cantor set to another has constant
Radon-Nikodym derivative on some clopen. We use this to obtain an invariant up
to bilipschitz homeomorphism.
