For a Banach space $X$ by $Conv_H(X)$ we denote the space of non-empty closed
convex subsets of $X$, endowed with the Hausdorff metric. We prove that for any
closed convex set $C\subset X$ and its metric component $H_C=\{A\in
Conv_H(X):d_H(A,C)<\infty\}$ in $Conv_H(X)$, the following conditions are
equivalent: (1) $C$ is approximatively polyhedral, which means that for every
$\epsilon>0$ there is a polyhedral convex subset $P\subset X$ on Hausdorff
distance $d_H(P,C)<\epsilon$ from $C$; (2) $C$ lies on finite Hausdorff
distance $d_H(C,P)$ from some polyhedral convex set $P\subset X$; (3) the
metric space $(H_C,d_H)$ is separable; (4) $H_C$ has density
$dens(H_C)<\mathfrak c$; (5) $H_C$ does not contain a positively hiding convex
set $P\subset X$.
  If the Banach space $X$ is finite-dimensional, then the conditions (1)--(5)
are equivalent to: (6) $C$ is not positively hiding; (7) $C$ is not infinitely
hiding.
  A convex subset $C\subset X$ is called {\em positively hiding} (resp. {\em
infinitely hiding}) if there is an infinite set $A\subset X\setminus C$ such
that $\inf_{a\in A}dist(a,C)>0$ (resp. $\sup_{a\in A}dist(a,C)=\infty$) and for
any distinct points $a,b\in A$ the segment $[a,b]$ meets the set $C$.
