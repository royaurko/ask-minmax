We use the inverse pressure concept to estimate the stable dimension for
hyperbolic non-invertible maps which are conformal in the stable fibers. The
non-invertible case is different than the diffeomorphism case. In particular we
show that if the map is open on the respective basic set, then the stable
dimension is constant everywhere. We prove also in this setting the Lipschitz
continuity of the stable distribution.
