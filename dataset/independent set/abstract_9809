We consider the solution $\{u(t,x);t\geq0,x\in\mathbf{R}\}$ of a system of
$d$ linear stochastic wave equations driven by a $d$-dimensional symmetric
space-time L\'{e}vy noise. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition on
the characteristic exponent of the L\'{e}vy noise, which describes exactly when
the zero set of $u$ is non-void. We also compute the Hausdorff dimension of
that zero set when it is non-empty. These results will follow from more general
potential-theoretic theorems on the level sets of L\'{e}vy sheets.
