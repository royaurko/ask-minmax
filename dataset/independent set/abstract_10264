We have identified 4 Cepheids and 5 Miras using KPNO 4m BVRI images of an
outer field in M101. The Cepheid and Mira periods range from 30 to 60 days and
350 to 800 days, respectively. We derive independent Cepheid and Mira distance
moduli that agree within experimental uncertainties. We find a true distance
modulus of 29.08 +- 0.13 mag.
