Denote by $K_p(n,k)$ the random subgraph of the usual Kneser graph $K(n,k)$
in which edges appear independently, each with probability $p$. Answering a
question of Bollob\'as, Narayanan, and Raigorodskii,we show that there is a
fixed $p<1$ such that a.s. (i.e., with probability tending to 1 as $k \to
\infty$) the maximum independent sets of $K_p(2k+1, k)$ are precisely the sets
$\{A\in V(K(2k+1,k)): x\in A\}$ ($x\in [2k+1]$).
  We also complete the determination of the order of magnitude of the
"threshold" for the above property for general $k$ and $n\geq 2k+2$. This is
new for $k\sim n/2$, while for smaller $k $ it is a recent result of Das and
Tran.
