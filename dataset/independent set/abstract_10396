We present the exact Bethe Ansatz solution of a multichannel model of one-
dimensional correlated electrons coupled antiferromagnetically to a magnetic
impurity of arbitrary spin S. The solution reveals that interactions in the
bulk make the magnetic impurity drive both spin and charge fluctuations,
producing a mixed valence at the impurity site, with an associated effective
spin S_eff > S in the presence of a magnetic field. The screening of the
impurity spin is controlled by its size independently of the number of
channels, in contrast to the multichannel Kondo effect for free electrons.
