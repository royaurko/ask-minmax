We consider the problem of computing the minimum of a polynomial function g
on a basic closed semialgebraic set E in R^n. We present a probabilistic
symbolic algorithm to find a finite set of sample points of the subset E^{min}
of E where the minimum of g is attained, provided that E^{min} is non-empty and
has at least one compact connected component.
