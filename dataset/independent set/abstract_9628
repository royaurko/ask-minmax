The paper applies the so-called 'Canonical-Darboux-Transformation' (CDT)
method to reproduce general expressions for rational potentials (RPs) quantized
in terms of exceptional orthogonal polynomial systems (X-OPSs). The benchmark
of the new method recently developed by the contributor for implicit potentials
solvable via hypergeometric functions is that rationally-extended SUSY partners
of the original potential are quantized in terms of sequences of the so-called
'Gauss-seed' (GS) Heine polynomials starting from a polynomial of non-zero
order. The common mark of the Darboux-Poschl-Teller (DPT) potential and
isotonic oscillator discussed in this paper is that the appropriate rational
Sturm-Liouville (RSL) equations have energy-independent characteristic
exponents at both singular end points and as a result the appropriate sequences
of GS Heine polynomials turn into X-OPSs with infinitely many members.
