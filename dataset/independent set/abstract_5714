We derive model-independent constraints on Higgs mass and couplings from
associated signals for higher masses, accessible at LEP2. This work is
motivated by the fact that, in many extensions of the standard model, the Higgs
boson can have substantial "invisible" decay modes, for example, into light or
massless weakly interacting Goldstone bosons associated to the spontaneous
violation of lepton number below the weak scale.
