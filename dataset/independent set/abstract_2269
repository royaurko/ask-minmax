Morphological analysis is an important subtask in text-to-speech conversion,
hyphenation, and other language engineering tasks. The traditional approach to
performing morphological analysis is to combine a morpheme lexicon, sets of
(linguistic) rules, and heuristics to find a most probable analysis. In
contrast we present an inductive learning approach in which morphological
analysis is reformulated as a segmentation task. We report on a number of
experiments in which five inductive learning algorithms are applied to three
variations of the task of morphological analysis. Results show (i) that the
generalisation performance of the algorithms is good, and (ii) that the lazy
learning algorithm IB1-IG performs best on all three tasks. We conclude that
lazy learning of morphological analysis as a classification task is indeed a
viable approach; moreover, it has the strong advantages over the traditional
approach of avoiding the knowledge-acquisition bottleneck, being fast and
deterministic in learning and processing, and being language-independent.
