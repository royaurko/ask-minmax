In this note we present a second independent proof for the theorem introduced
previously that establishes an isomorphism between SU(2) and LB1 X LB1 X LB1.
Since the local groups LB1 and LB2 are isomorphic, it was also previously
proved a similar result for LB2 X LB2 X LB2. We are going to reverse the three
sets of tetrads that are going to be used in order to prove this new version.
Instead of choosing three SU(2) different tetrads keeping the electromagnetic
tetrad the same for all three sets of SU(2) tetrads, we are going to keep fixed
the SU(2) tetrad, that is, we are going to pick just one SU(2) tetrad but
choose three different arbitrary but fixed electromagnetic tetrads in order to
gauge locally the only local SU(2) tetrad involved in our new version of this
theorem. The same result will be obtained via an alternative but equivalent
way.
