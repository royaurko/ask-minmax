We outline a formalism and develop a computational procedure to treat the
process of multiphoton ionization (MPI) of atomic targets in strong laser
fields. We treat the MPI process nonperturbatively as a decay phenomenon by
solving a coupled set of the integral Lippmann-Schwinger equations. As basic
building blocks of the theory we use a complete set of field-free atomic
states, discrete and continuous. This approach should enable us to provide both
the total and differential cross-sections of MPI of atoms with one or two
electrons. As an illustration, we apply the proposed procedure to a simple
model of MPI from a square well potential and to the hydrogen atom.
