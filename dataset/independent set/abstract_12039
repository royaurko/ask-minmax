Based on the assumption that the probability density of finding a free
particle is independent of position, we infer the form of the eigenfunction for
the free particle, $\bra{x} p > = \exp(ipx/\hbar)/\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}$. The
canonical commutation relation between the momentum and position operators and
the Ehrenfest theorem in the free particle case are derived solely from
differentiation of the delta function and the form of $\bra{x} p >$.
