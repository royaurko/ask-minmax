Let F in S_k(Sp(2g, Z)) be a cuspidal Siegel eigenform of genus g with
normalized Hecke eigenvalues mu_F(n). Suppose that the associated automorphic
representation pi_F is locally tempered everywhere. For each c>0 we consider
the set of primes p for which |mu_F(p)| >= c and we provide an explicit upper
bound on the density of this set. In the case g=2, we also provide an explicit
upper bound on the density of the set of primes p for which mu_F(p) >= c.
