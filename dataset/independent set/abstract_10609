We present results from density functional theory and computer simulations
that unambiguously predict the occurrence of first-order freezing transitions
for a large class of ultrasoft model systems into cluster crystals. The
clusters consist of fully overlapping particles and arise without the existence
of attractive forces. The number of particles participating in a cluster scales
linearly with density, therefore the crystals feature density-independent
lattice constants. Clustering is accompanied by polymorphic bcc-fcc
transitions, with fcc being the stable phase at high densities.
