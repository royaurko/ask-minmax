Using an artificial mouth with an accurate pressure control, the onset of the
pressure oscillations inside the mouthpiece of a simplified clarinet is studied
experimentally. Two time profiles are used for the blowing pressure: in a first
set of experiments the pressure is increased at constant rates, then decreased
at the same rate. In a second set of experiments the pressure rises at a
constant rate and is then kept constant for an arbitrary period of time. In
both cases the experiments are repeated for different increase rates. Numerical
simulations using a simplified clarinet model blown with a constantly
increasing mouth pressure are compared to the oscillating pressure obtained
inside the mouthpiece. Both show that the beginning of the oscillations appears
at a higher pressure values than the theoretical static threshold pressure, a
manifestation of bifurcation delay. Experiments performed using an interrupted
increase in mouth pressure show that the beginning of the oscillation occurs
close to the stop in the increase of the pressure. Experimental results also
highlight that the speed of the onset transient of the sound is roughly the
same, independently of the duration of the increase phase of the blowing
pressure.
