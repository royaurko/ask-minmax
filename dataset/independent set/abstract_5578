We give several different geometric characterizations of the situation in
which the parallel set $F_\epsilon$ of a self-similar set $F$ can be described
by the inner $\epsilon$-parallel set $T_{-\epsilon}$ of the associated
canonical tiling $\mathcal T$, in the sense of \cite{SST}. For example,
$F_\epsilon=T_{-\epsilon} \cup C_\epsilon$ if and only if the boundary of the
convex hull $C$ of $F$ is a subset of $F$, or if the boundary of $E$, the
unbounded portion of the complement of $F$, is the boundary of a convex set. In
the characterized situation, the tiling allows one to obtain a tube formula for
$F$, i.e., an expression for the volume of $F_\epsilon$ as a function of
$\epsilon$. On the way, we clarify some geometric properties of canonical
tilings.
  Motivated by the search for tube formulas, we give a generalization of the
tiling construction which applies to all self-affine sets $F$ having empty
interior and satisfying the open set condition. We also characterize the
relation between the parallel sets of $F$ and these tilings.
