Considered are I class constraints in the tetrad-connection formulation of
Regge calculus. One of these is well-known Gauss law which generates rotations
in the local frames associated with tetrahedrons in the continuous time 3D
section. Another two types of these are new, satisfied by definition of Regge
manifold and having no I class analogs in the continuum general relativity.
Constraints of the first type express vanishing of the dual squares of
antisymmetric tensors of the triangles in the 3D section thus ensuring each
such tensor being a bivector. Constraints of the second type are trigonometric
relations between areas of triangles of 3D section caused by that the set of
areas is redundant as compared to the set of linklengts.
