We show how constraints on the time integrated event rate from a given dark
matter (DM) direct detection experiment can be used to set a stringent
constraint on the amplitude of the annual modulation signal in another
experiment. The method requires only very mild assumptions about the properties
of the local DM distribution: that it is temporally stable on the scale of
months and spatially homogeneous on the ecliptic. We apply the method to the
annual modulation signal in DAMA/LIBRA, which we compare to the bounds derived
from the constraints on the time-averaged rates from XENON10, XENON100, CDMS
and SIMPLE. Assuming a DM mass of 10 GeV, we show that a DM interpretation of
the DAMA/LIBRA signal is excluded at 6.3sigma (4.6sigma) for isospin conserving
(violating) spin-independent interactions, and at 4.9sigma for spin-dependent
interactions on protons.
