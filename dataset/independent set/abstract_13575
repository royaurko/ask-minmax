Vegetation is the most common and most reliable stabilizer of loose soil or
sand. This ancient technique is for the first time cast into a set of equations
of motion describing the competition between aeolian sand transport and
vegetation growth. Our set of equations is then applied to study quantitatively
the transition between barchans and parabolic dunes driven by the dimensionless
fixation index $\theta$ which is the ratio between dune characteristic erosion
rate and vegetation growth velocity. We find a fixation index $\theta_c$ below
which the dunes are stabilized characterized by scaling laws.
