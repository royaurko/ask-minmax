We relate two formerly independent areas: Formal concept analysis and logic
of domains. We will establish a correspondene between contextual attribute
logic on formal contexts resp. concept lattices and a clausal logic on coherent
algebraic cpos. We show how to identify the notion of formal concept in the
domain theoretic setting. In particular, we show that a special instance of the
resolution rule from the domain logic coincides with the concept closure
operator from formal concept analysis. The results shed light on the use of
contexts and domains for knowledge representation and reasoning purposes.
