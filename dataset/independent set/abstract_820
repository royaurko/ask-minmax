We study a long standing conjecture on the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the compatibility of multi-state characters: There exists a
function $f(r)$ such that, for any set $C$ of $r$-state characters, $C$ is
compatible if and only if every subset of $f(r)$ characters of $C$ is
compatible. We show that for every $r \ge 2$, there exists an incompatible set
$C$ of $\lfloor\frac{r}{2}\rfloor\cdot\lceil\frac{r}{2}\rceil + 1$ $r$-state
characters such that every proper subset of $C$ is compatible. Thus, $f(r) \ge
\lfloor\frac{r}{2}\rfloor\cdot\lceil\frac{r}{2}\rceil + 1$ for every $r \ge 2$.
This improves the previous lower bound of $f(r) \ge r$ given by Meacham (1983),
and generalizes the construction showing that $f(4) \ge 5$ given by Habib and
To (2011). We prove our result via a result on quartet compatibility that may
be of independent interest: For every integer $n \ge 4$, there exists an
incompatible set $Q$ of
$\lfloor\frac{n-2}{2}\rfloor\cdot\lceil\frac{n-2}{2}\rceil + 1$ quartets over
$n$ labels such that every proper subset of $Q$ is compatible. We contrast this
with a result on the compatibility of triplets: For every $n \ge 3$, if $R$ is
an incompatible set of more than $n-1$ triplets over $n$ labels, then some
proper subset of $R$ is incompatible. We show this upper bound is tight by
exhibiting, for every $n \ge 3$, a set of $n-1$ triplets over $n$ taxa such
that $R$ is incompatible, but every proper subset of $R$ is compatible.
