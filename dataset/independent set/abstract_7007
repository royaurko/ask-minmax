We study the generalization of split, k-branch split, and intersection cuts
from Mixed Integer Linear Programming to the realm of Mixed Integer Nonlinear
Programming. Constructing such cuts requires calculating the convex hull of the
difference between a convex set and an open set with a simple geometric
structure. We introduce two techniques to give precise characterizations of
such convex hulls and use them to construct split, k-branch split, and
intersection cuts for several classes of non-polyhedral sets. In particular, we
give simple formulas for split cuts for essentially all convex sets described
by a single quadratic inequality. We also give simple formulas for k-branch
split cuts and some general intersection cuts for a wide variety of convex
quadratic sets.
