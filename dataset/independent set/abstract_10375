An exactly solvable electron model of a confined system with inverse-square
interaction is presented. The ground state is given by the Jastrow-product
wavefunction of power-law form. We discuss the results in connection with
conductance oscillations observed in semiconductor nanostructures, for which
single-electron charging effects play a crucial role. Due to the internal spin
degrees of freedom, there appear two independent periods of the conductance
oscillations in very narrow channels even at zero temperature.
