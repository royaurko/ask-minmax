We treat the problem of testing mutual independence between m continuous
observations when the available sample size n is comparable to m. As test
statistics, we consider sums of squared rank correlations between pairs of
random variables. Specific examples we study are sums of squares formed from
Kendall's tau and from Spearman's rho. In the asymptotic regime where m/n
converges to a positive constant, the null distribution of these statistics is
shown to converge to a normal limit. The proofs are based on results for sums
of squares of rank-based U-statistics.
