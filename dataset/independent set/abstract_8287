We show that the knowledge of the set of the Cauchy data on the boundary of a
bounded open set in $\R^n$, $n\ge 3$, for the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator
with $L^\infty$ magnetic and electric potentials determines the magnetic field
and electric potential inside the set uniquely. The proof is based on a
Carleman estimate for the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator with a gain of two
derivatives.
