We study a mathematical model describing the dynamics of a pluripotent stem
cell population involved in the blood production process in the bone marrow.
This model is a differential equation with a time delay. The delay describes
the cell cycle duration and is uniformly distributed on an interval. We obtain
stability conditions independent of the delay. We also show that the
distributed delay can destabilize the entire system. In particularly, it is
shown that Hopf bifurcations can occur.
