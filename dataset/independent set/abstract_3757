Unphysical effects associated with finite lattice spacing and partial
quenching may lead to the presence of unphysical terms in chiral extrapolation
formulae. These unphysical terms must then be removed during data analysis
before physical predictions can be made. In this work, we show that through
next-to-leading order, there are no unphysical counterterms in the
extrapolation formulae, expressed in lattice-physical parameters, for meson
scattering lengths in theories with Ginsparg-Wilson valence quarks. Our work
applies to most sea quark discretization, provided that chiral perturbation
theory is a valid approximation. We demonstrate our results with explicit
computations and show that, in favorable circumstances, the extrapolation
formulae do not depend on the unknown constant C_Mix appearing at lowest order
in the mixed action chiral Lagrangian. We show that the I=1 KK scattering
length does not depend on C_Mix in contrast to the I=3/2 K-pi scattering
length. In addition, we show that these observables combined with f_K / f_pi
and the I=2 pi-pi scattering length share only two linearly independent sets of
counterterms, providing a means to test the mixed action theory at one lattice
spacing. We therefore make a prediction for the I=1 KK scattering length.
