We identify active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the Groth-Westphal Survey Strip
(GSS) using the independent and complementary selection techniques of optical
spectroscopy and photometric variability. We discuss the X-ray properties of
these AGN using Chandra/XMM data for this region. From a sample of 576 galaxies
with high quality spectra we identify 31 galaxies with AGN signatures. Seven of
these have broad emission lines (Type 1 AGNs). We also identify 26 galaxies
displaying nuclear variability in HST WFPC2 images of the GSS separated by ~7
years. The primary overlap of the two selected AGN samples is the set of
broad-line AGNs, of which 80% appear as variable. Only a few narrow-line AGNs
approach the variability threshold. The broad-line AGNs have an average
redshift of z~1.1 while the other spectroscopic AGNs have redshifts closer to
the mean of the general galaxy population (z~0.7). Eighty percent of the
identified broad-line AGNs are detected in X-rays and these are among the most
luminous X-ray sources in the GSS. Only one narrow-line AGN is X-ray detected.
Of the variable nuclei galaxies within the X-ray survey, 27% are X-ray
detected. We find that 1.9+/-0.6% of GSS galaxies to V=24 are broad-line AGNs,
1.4+/-0.5% are narrow-line AGNs, and 4.5+/-1.4% contain variable nuclei. The
fraction of spectroscopically identified BLAGNs and NLAGNs at z~1 reveals a
marginally significant increase of 1.3+/-0.9% when compared to the local
population.
