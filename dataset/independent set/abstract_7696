The Coulomb potential produced by an ultrarelativistic particle (such as a
heavy ion) in uniform motion is shown in the appropriate gauge to factorize
into a longitudinal Dirac delta function of (z - t) times the simple two
dimensional potential solution in the transverse direction. This form makes
manifest the source of the energy independence of the interaction.
