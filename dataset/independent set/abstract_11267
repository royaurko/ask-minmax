An independent random cascade measure is specified by a random generator, a
vector of dimension c with non-negative components. The dimension c is called
the branching cascade parameter. It is shown under certain restrictions that,
if this measure has two generators with a.s. positive components, and the ratio
ln c_1/ln c_2 for their branching parameters is an irrational number, then this
measure is a Lebesgue measure. In other words, when c is a power of an integer
number p and the p is minimal for c, then a cascade measure that has the
property of intermittency specifies p uniquely.
