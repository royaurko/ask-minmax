Identifying the quark-gluon plasma requires convincing experimental evidence
that partons move independently throughout the environment created in a heavy
ion collision and with densities expected from equilibrium considerations. In
lattice calculations, charge correlations suggest that quarks exist
independently, and are not merely exchanged from hadronic object to another.
Many experimental signatures (J/Psi suppression, quark number scaling, etc.)
suggest that quarks are not confined to their original singlets, but these
signatures do not make a clear case that quarks move independently or that they
have the expected densities. I discuss a class of measurements that parallel
lattice observables and has the prospect of investigating whether partonic
charges move independently.
