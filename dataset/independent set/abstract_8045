We give the definition of Lazard and Hall sets in the context of transitive
factorizations of free monoids. The equivalence of the two properties is
proved. This allows to build new effective bases of free partially commutative
Lie algebras. The commutation graphs for which such sets exist are completely
characterized and we explicit, in this context, the classical PBW rewriting
process.
