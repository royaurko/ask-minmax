Recently the first physically realistic protocol amplifying the randomness of
Santha-Vazirani sources using a finite number of no-signaling devices and with
a constant rate of noise has been proposed, however there still remained the
open question whether this can be accomplished under the minimal conditions
necessary for the task. Namely, is it possible to achieve randomness
amplification using only two no-signaling devices and in a situation where the
violation of a Bell inequality implies only an upper bound for some outcome
probability for some setting combination? Here, we solve this problem and
present the first device-independent protocol for the task of randomness
amplification of Santha-Vazirani sources using a device consisting of only two
non-signaling components. We show that the protocol can amplify any such source
that is not fully deterministic into a totally random source while tolerating a
constant noise rate and prove the security of the protocol against general
no-signaling adversaries. The minimum requirement for a device-independent Bell
inequality based protocol for obtaining randomness against no-signaling attacks
is that every no-signaling box that obtains the observed Bell violation has the
conditional probability $P(\textbf{x}| \textbf{u})$ of at least a single
input-output pair $(\textbf{u}, \textbf{x})$ bounded from above. We show how
one can construct protocols for randomness amplification in this minimalistic
scenario.
