This paper is concerned with performance analysis for data association, in a
target tracking environment. Effects of misassociation are considered in a
simple (linear) multiscan framework so as to provide closed-form expressions of
the probability of correct association. In this paper, we focus on the
development of explicit approximations of this probability. Via rigorous
calculations the effect of dimensioning parameters (number of scans, false
measurement positions or densities) is analyzed, for various modelings of the
false measurements. Remarkably, it is possible to derive very simple
expressions of the probability of correct association which are independent of
the scenario kinematic parameters.
