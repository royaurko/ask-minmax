We extend two well-known results in additive number theory, S\'ark\"ozy's
theorem on square differences in dense sets and a theorem of Green on long
arithmetic progressions in sumsets, to subsets of random sets of asymptotic
density 0. Our proofs rely on a restriction-type Fourier analytic argument of
Green and Green-Tao.
