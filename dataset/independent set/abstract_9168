We present an on-shell scheme to renormalize the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
(CKM) matrix. It is based on a novel procedure to separate the external-leg
mixing corrections into gauge-independent self-mass and gauge-dependent
wave-function renormalization contributions, and to implement the on-shell
renormalization of the former with non-diagonal mass counterterm matrices.
Diagonalization of the complete mass matrix leads to an explicit CKM
counterterm matrix, which automatically satisfies all the following important
properties: it is gauge independent, preserves unitarity, and leads to
renormalized amplitudes that are non-singular in the limit in which any two
fermions become mass degenerate.
