In this paper we study lepton flavor violating semileptonic decays of heavy
baryons in a framework of a model with large extra dimensions and a single
generation . Resulting branching ratios for these decays mediated by
Kaluza-Klein modes of photon and Z-boson are presented in a model-independent
form.
