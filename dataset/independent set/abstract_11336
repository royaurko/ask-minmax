We take a unified approach to central limit theorems for a class of
irreducible urn models with constant replacement matrix. Depending on the
eigenvalue, we consider appropriate linear combinations of the number of balls
of different colors. Then under appropriate norming the multivariate
distribution of the weak limits of these linear combinations is obtained and
independence and dependence issues are investigated.
