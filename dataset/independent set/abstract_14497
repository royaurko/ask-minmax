This paper deals with nonlinear parabolic equation for which a local solution
in time exists and then blows up in a finite time. We consider the
Chipot-Weissler equation. We study the numerical approximation, we show that
the numerical solution converges to the continuous one under some restriction
on the initial data and the parameters of the non linearity. Moreover, we study
the numerical blow up sets and we show that although the convergence of the
numerical solution is guaranteed, the numerical blow up sets are sometimes
different from that of the PDE
