We give a lower bound on Walsh figure of merit (WAFOM), which is a parameter
to estimate the integration error for quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration by a
point set called a digital net. This lower bound is optimal because the
existence of point sets attaining the order was proved in [K. Suzuki, An
explicit construction of point sets with large minimum Dick weight, Journal of
Complexity 30, (2014), 347-354].
