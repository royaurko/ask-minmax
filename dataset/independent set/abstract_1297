We are proposing a simple, but efficient basic approach for a number of
multilingual and cross-lingual language technology applications that are not
limited to the usual two or three languages, but that can be applied with
relatively little effort to larger sets of languages. The approach consists of
using existing multilingual linguistic resources such as thesauri,
nomenclatures and gazetteers, as well as exploiting the existence of additional
more or less language-independent text items such as dates, currency
expressions, numbers, names and cognates. Mapping texts onto the multilingual
resources and identifying word token links between texts in different languages
are basic ingredients for applications such as cross-lingual document
similarity calculation, multilingual clustering and categorisation,
cross-lingual document retrieval, and tools to provide cross-lingual
information access.
