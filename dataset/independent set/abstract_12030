Our previously developed Constrained-Pairing Mean-Field Theory (CPMFT) is
shown to map onto an Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) type method if one imposes
a corresponding pair constraint to the correlation problem that forces
occupation numbers to occur in pairs adding to 1. In this new version, CPMFT
has all the advantages of standard independent particle models (orbitals and
orbital energies, to mention a few), yet unlike UHF, it can dissociate
polyatomic molecules to the correct ground-state restricted open-shell
Hartree-Fock atoms or fragments.
