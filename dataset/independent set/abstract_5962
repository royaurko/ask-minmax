In this paper we consider FRW cosmology in $F(R,\phi)$ gravity. It is shown
that in particular cases the bouncing behavior may appears in the model whereas
the equation of state (EoS) parameter may crosses the phantom divider. For the
dynamical universe, quantitatively we also find parameters in the model which
satisfies two independent tests:the model independent Cosmological Redshift
Drift (CRD) test and the type Ia supernova luminosity distances.
