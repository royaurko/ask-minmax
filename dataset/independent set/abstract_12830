Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the buckling of
single-layer MoS2 under uniaxial compression. The strain rate is found to play
an important role on the critical buckling strain, where higher strain rate
leads to larger critical strain. The critical strain is almost
temperature-independent for T<50 K, and it increases with increasing
temperature for T>50 K owning to the thermal vibration assisted healing
mechanism on the buckling deformation. The length-dependence of the critical
strain from our simulations is in good agreement with the prediction of the
Euler buckling theory.
