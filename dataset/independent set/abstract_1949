We prove the asymptotic independence of the empirical process $\alpha_n =
\sqrt{n}( F_n - F)$ and the rescaled empirical distribution function $\beta_n =
n (F_n(\tau+\frac{\cdot}{n})-F_n(\tau))$, where $F$ is an arbitrary cdf,
differentiable at some point $\tau$, and $F_n$ the corresponding empricial cdf.
This seems rather counterintuitive, since, for every $n \in N$, there is a
deterministic correspondence between $\alpha_n$ and $\beta_n$. Precisely, we
show that the pair $(\alpha_n,\beta_n)$ converges in law to a limit having
independent components, namely a time-transformed Brownian bridge and a
two-sided Poisson process. Since these processes have jumps, in particular if
$F$ itself has jumps, the Skorokhod product space $D(R) \times D(R)$ is the
adequate choice for modeling this convergence in. We develop a short
convergence theory for $D(R) \times D(R)$ by establishing the classical
principle, devised by Yu. V. Prokhorov, that finite-dimensional convergence and
tightness imply weak convergence. Several tightness criteria are given.
Finally, the convergence of the pair $(\alpha_n,\beta_n)$ implies convergence
of each of its components, thus, in passing, we provide a thorough proof of
these known convergence results in a very general setting. In fact, the
condition on $F$ to be differentiable in at least one point is only required
for $\beta_n$ to converge and can be further weakened.
