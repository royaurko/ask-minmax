It is fairly easy to show that every regular set is an almost-confluent
congruential language (ACCL), and it is known that every regular set is a
Church-Rosser congruential language (CRCL). Whether there exists an ACCL, which
is not a CRCL, seems to remain an open question. In this note we present one
such ACCL.
