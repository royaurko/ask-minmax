A \Riesz-basis sequence for $L_2[-\pi,\pi]$ is a strictly increasing sequence
$X:=(x_j)_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that the set of functions
$\left(e^{-ix_j(\cdot)}\right)_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}$ is a Riesz basis for
$L_2[-\pi,\pi]$. Given such a sequence and a parameter $0<h\leq1$, we consider
interpolation of functions $g\in W_2^k(\mathbb{R})$ at the set
$(hx_j)_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}$ via translates of the Gaussian kernel. Existence is
shown of an interpolant of the form
$$I^{hX}(g)(x):=\underset{j\in\mathbb{Z}}{\sum}a_je^{-(x-hx_j)^2},\quad
x\in\mathbb{R},$$ which is continuous and square-integrable on $\mathbb{R}$,
and satisfies the interpolatory condition
$I^{hX}(g)(hx_j)=g(hx_j),j\in\mathbb{Z}$. Moreover, use of the parameter $h$
gives approximation rates of order $h^k$. Namely, there is a constant
independent of $g$ such that $\|I^{hX}(g)-g\|_{L_2(\mathbb{R})}\leq
Ch^k|g|_{W_2^k(\mathbb{R})}$. Interpolation using translates of certain
functions other than the Gaussian, so-called regular interpolators, is also
considered and shown to exhibit the same approximation rates.
