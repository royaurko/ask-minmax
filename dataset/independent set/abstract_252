The derivation of Bell inequalities requires an assumption of measurement
independence, related to the amount of free will experimenters have in choosing
measurement settings. Violation of these inequalities by singlet state
correlations, as has been experimentally observed, brings this assumption into
question. A simple measure of the degree of measurement independence is defined
for correlation models, and it is shown that all spin correlations of a singlet
state can be modeled via giving up a fraction of just 14% of measurement
independence. The underlying model is deterministic and no-signalling. It may
thus be favourably compared with other underlying models of the singlet state,
which require maximum indeterminism or maximum signalling. A local
deterministic model is also given that achieves the maximum possible violation
of the well known Bell-CHSH inequality, at a cost of only 1/3 of measurement
independence.
