We report charge density measurements, using NMR, in the superconducting
compound (Ca_{x}La_{1-x})(Ba_{1.75-x}La_{0.25+x})Cu_3O_{y}, which has two
independent variables x (family) and y (oxygen). For underdoped samples we find
the rate at which holes are introduced into the plane upon oxygenation to be
family-independent. In contrast, not all carriers contribute to either
antiferromagnetic or superconducting order parameters. This result is
consistent with a two fluid phenomenology or intrinsic mesoscopic
inhomogeneities in the bulk. We also discuss the impact of
weak-chemical-disorder on T_{c}.
