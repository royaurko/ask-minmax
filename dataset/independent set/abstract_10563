The frequency and shear dependent critical viscosity at a correlation length
$\xi=\kappa^{-1}$, has the form
$\eta=\eta_{0}\kappa^{-x_{\eta}}G(z_{1},z_{2})$, where $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are
the independent dimensionless numbers in the problem defined as
$z_{1}=\frac{-i\omega}{2\Gamma_{0}\kappa^{3}}$ and
$z_{2}=\frac{-i\omega}{2\Gamma_{0}\kappa_{c}^{3}}$. The decay rate of critical
fluctuations of correlation length $\kappa^{-1}$ is $\Gamma_{0}\kappa^{3}$ and
$k_{c}$ is the effective wave number for which $\Gamma_{0}k_{c}^{3}=S$, the
shear rate. The function $G(z_{1},z_{2})$ is calculated in a one loop
self-consistent theory.
