We show that an 'ergodic' time scale can be extracted from the aging
experiments on spin-glasses. This is the time for which a significant fraction
of the metastable states have been visited. Experiments suggest that the number
of metastable states per independent subsystem is $\simeq 10^{12}-10^{14}$. For
our insulating spin-glass $({\rm CdCr}_{1.7} {\rm In}_{0.3} {\rm S}_4)$ this
number doubles when the temperature is lowered by 1K, but is roughly constant
for the metallic sample (Ag:Mn 2.6%).
