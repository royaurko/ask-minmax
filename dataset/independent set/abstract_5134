Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) based set bounds propagation is a powerful
approach to solving set-constraint satisfaction problems. However, prior BDD
based techniques in- cur the significant overhead of constructing and
manipulating graphs during search. We present a set-constraint solver which
combines BDD-based set-bounds propagators with the learning abilities of a
modern SAT solver. Together with a number of improvements beyond the basic
algorithm, this solver is highly competitive with existing propagation based
set constraint solvers.
