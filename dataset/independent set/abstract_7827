The main aim of this paper is to generalize the concept of vector space by
the hyperstructure. We generalize some definitions such as hypersubspaces,
linear combination, Hamel basis, linearly dependence and linearly independence.
A few important results like deletion theorem, extension theorem, dimension
theorem have been established in this hypervector space.
