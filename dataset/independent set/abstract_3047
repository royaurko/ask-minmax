In models with extra dimensions, vectorlike Dirac masses for fermion fields
are generically allowed. These masses are independent of electroweak symmetry
breaking and do not contribute to the known masses for the quarks and leptons.
They control the profile of the bulk wave functions, the mass spectra of
Kaluza-Klein modes, and interactions that could be tested in experiments. In
this article, we study the effects of bulk masses in electroweak precision
measurements and in dark matter and collider searches, to set bounds on the
bulk mass parameters in models with a flat universal extra dimension, namely,
Split-UED. We find the current bound on the universal bulk-mass to be smaller
than (0.2-0.3)/R, where R is the radius of the extra dimension. Similar but
slightly relaxed bounds are obtained in the non-universal bulk mass case. The
LHC is expected to play an important role in constraining the remaining
parameter space.
