The purpose of this note is to correct an error in an earlier paper by the
contributor about the level sets of the Takagi function [Monatsh. Math. 167 (2012),
311-331 and arXiv:1102.1616], and to prove a stronger form of one of the main
results of that paper about the propensity of level sets containing uncountably
many local level sets.
