We show that the maximum independent set problem (MIS) on an $n$-vertex graph
can be solved in $1.1996^nn^{O(1)}$ time and polynomial space, which even is
faster than Robson's $1.2109^{n}n^{O(1)}$-time exponential-space algorithm
published in 1986. We also obtain improved algorithms for MIS in graphs with
maximum degree 6 and 7, which run in time of $1.1893^nn^{O(1)}$ and
$1.1970^nn^{O(1)}$, respectively. Our algorithms are obtained by using fast
algorithms for MIS in low-degree graphs in a hierarchical way and making a
careful analyses on the structure of bounded-degree graphs.
