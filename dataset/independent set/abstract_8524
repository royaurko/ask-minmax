An $L$-spherical code is a set of Euclidean unit vectors whose pairwise inner
products belong to the set $L$. We show, for a fixed $\alpha,\beta>0$, that the
size of any $[-1,-\beta]\cup\{\alpha\}$-spherical code is at most linear in the
dimension.
  In particular, this bound applies to sets of lines such that every two are at
a fixed angle to each another.
