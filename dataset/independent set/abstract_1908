The focus of this article is on entropy and Markov processes. We study the
properties of functionals which are invariant with respect to monotonic
transformations and analyze two invariant "additivity" properties: (i)
existence of a monotonic transformation which makes the functional additive
with respect to the joining of independent systems and (ii) existence of a
monotonic transformation which makes the functional additive with respect to
the partitioning of the space of states. All Lyapunov functionals for Markov
chains which have properties (i) and (ii) are derived. We describe the most
general ordering of the distribution space, with respect to which all
continuous-time Markov processes are monotonic (the {\em Markov order}). The
solution differs significantly from the ordering given by the inequality of
entropy growth. For inference, this approach results in a convex compact set of
conditionally "most random" distributions.
