I discuss the evolution of the magnetic field of an accreting white dwarf. I
show that the ohmic decay time is 7-12 billion years for the lowest order decay
mode, almost independent of core temperature or mass. I then show that the
magnetic field structure is substantially altered by accretion if the white
dwarf mass increases at a rate more than 1-5 x 10^(-10) solar masses per year.
I discuss the implications of this result for observed systems, including the
possible evolutionary link between AM Hers and intermediate polars.
