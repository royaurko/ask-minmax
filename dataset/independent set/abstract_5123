Let $B$ be a set of natural numbers of size $n$. We prove that the length of
the longest arithmetic progression contained in the product set $B.B = \{bb'|
\, b, b' \in B\}$ cannot be greater than $O(\frac{n\log^2 n}{\log \log n})$ and
present an example of a product set containing an arithmetic progression of
length $\Omega(n \log n)$. For sets of complex numbers we obtain the upper
bound $O(n^{3/2})$.
