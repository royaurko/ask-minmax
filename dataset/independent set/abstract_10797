Oblique contributions from vector particles that are strongly coupled to the
known gauge bosons are calculated for the case of various observables at a 1
TeV $e^+e^-$ collider. Constraints provided by LEP 1 results are taken into
account in a model-independent way through a dispersion relation technique.
Depending on the assumed theoretical properties, mass limits of several TeV
should be observable.
