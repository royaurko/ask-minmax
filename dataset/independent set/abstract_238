We extend the use of random evolving sets to time-varying conductance models
and utilize it to provide tight heat kernel upper bounds. It yields the
transience of any uniformly lazy random walk, on Z^d, d>=3, equipped with
uniformly bounded above and below, independently time-varying edge
conductances, having non-decreasing in time vertex conductances (i.e. reversing
measure), thereby affirming part of [ABGK, Conj. 7.1].
