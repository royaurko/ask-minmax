We consider the case in which a strong dynamics is responsible for
Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB) and both a scalar $h$ and a vector $V$,
respectively a singlet and a triplet under a custodial $SU\left(2\right)$, are
relevant and have a mass below the cut-off $\Lambda\approx 4\pi v$. In this
framework we study the total cross sections for the associated $Vh$ production
at the LHC at 14 TeV as functions of two independent free parameters.
