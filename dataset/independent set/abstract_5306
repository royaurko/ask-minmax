Wyner's wiretap channel is extended to parallel broadcast channels and fading
channels with multiple receivers. In the first part of the paper, we consider
the setup of parallel broadcast channels with one sender, multiple intended
receivers, and one eavesdropper. We study the situations where the sender
broadcasts either a common message or independent messages to the intended
receivers. We derive upper and lower bounds on the common-message-secrecy
capacity, which coincide when the users are reversely degraded. For the case of
independent messages we establish the secrecy sum-capacity when the users are
reversely degraded.
  In the second part of the paper we apply our results to fading channels:
perfect channel state information of all intended receivers is known globally,
whereas the eavesdropper channel is known only to her. For the common message
case, a somewhat surprising result is proven: a positive rate can be achieved
independently of the number of intended receivers. For independent messages, an
opportunistic transmission scheme is presented that achieves the secrecy
sum-capacity in the limit of large number of receivers. Our results are stated
for a fast fading channel model. Extensions to the block fading model are also
discussed.
