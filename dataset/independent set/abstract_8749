In several scale free graph models the asymptotic degree distribution and the
characteristic exponent change when only a smaller set of vertices is
considered. Looking at the common properties of these models, we present
sufficient conditions for the almost sure existence of asymptotic degree
distribution constrained on the set of selected vertices, and identify the
characteristic exponent belonging to it.
