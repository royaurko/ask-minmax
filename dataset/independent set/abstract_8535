We solve the problem of giving sharp asymptotic bounds on the Hausdorff
dimensions of certain sets of badly approximable matrices, thus improving
results of Broderick and Kleinbock (preprint 2013) as well as Weil (preprint
2013), and generalizing to higher dimensions those of Kurzweil ('51) and
Hensley ('92). In addition we use our technique to compute the Hausdorff
$f$-measure of the set of matrices which are not $\psi$-approximable, given a
dimension function $f$ and a function $\psi:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$. This
complements earlier work by Dickinson and Velani ('97) who found the Hausdorff
$f$-measure of the set of matrices which are $\psi$-approximable.
