In this paper, we reassess the issue of working out the propagators and
identifying the spectrum of excitations associated to the vielbein and spin
connection of (1+2)-D gravity in the presence of torsion by adopting the
first-order formulation. A number of peculiarities is pointed out whenever the
Chern-Simons term is taken into account along with the possible bilinear terms
in the torsion tensor. We present a procedure to derive the full set of
propagators, based on a set of spin-type operators, and we discuss under which
conditions the pole of these tree-level 2-point functions correspond to
physical excitations.
