The general production {\it and} decay mechanism of $\ttbar$ in future
high-energy $\epem$ colliders has been investigated in a model-independent way,
focusing on an observation of possible CP violation. Angular asymmetries
sensitive to CP violation either in the production {\it or} in the subsequent
decays have been found. General considerations are illustrated through 1-loop
effects induced by gluino exchange in the supersymmetric version of the
Standard Model.
