In a recent paper, Rol and colleagues present evidence for a variable
polarization in the optical afterglow following the gamma-ray burst GRB 990712.
The variation is highly significant, but the position angle appears time
independent. Contrary to their conclusion, we point out that this can in fact
be explained with existing afterglow models, namely that of a laterally
expanding jet.
