We describe the design, construction and operation of the Askaryan Radio
Array (ARA) Autonomous Renewable Power Stations, initially installed at the
South Pole in December, 2010 with the goal of providing an independently
operating 100 W power source capable of year-round operation in extreme
environments. In addition to particle astrophysics applications at the South
Pole, such a station can easily be, and has since been, extended to operation
elsewhere, as described herein.
