The potential between a heavy quark and an anti-quark inside the quark-gluon
plasma (QGP) is studied on the basis of the gauge/gravity duality. A real-time
complex potential V_{Q\bar{Q}}(t,r) is derived from the Wilson loop with the
Euclidean five-dimensional anti-de-Sitter black hole metric. To make the
analytic continuation from the imaginary time to the real time, specific
variational configurations of the string world sheet in the Euclidean metric
are introduced. Rapid approach of V_{Q\bar{Q}}(t,r) to its stationary value is
found at the time scale t=1/\pi T independent of the 't Hooft coupling \lambda.
Also, the imaginary part of V_{Q\bar{Q}}(\infty,r) is found to be significant
above the length scale r=1.72/\pi T independent of \lambda. Implications of
these results to the properties of heavy quarkonia in QGP are briefly
discussed.
