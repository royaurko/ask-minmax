By using the two 4-dimensional potential formulation of electromagnetic (EM)
field theory introduced in [1], we found that the SO(2) duality symmetric EM
field theory can be reduced to the magnetic source free case by a special
choice of SO(2) parameter,this special case we called nature picture of the EM
field theory, the reduction condition led to a result, i.e. the electric charge
and magnetic charge are no more independent. Some comments to paper [SD] are
also mentioned.
