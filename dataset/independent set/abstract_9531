We study non-axisymmetric oscillations of a straight magnetic tube with an
elliptic cross-section and density varying along the tube. The governing
equations for kink and fluting modes in the thin tube approximation are
derived. We found that there are two kink modes, polarised along the large and
small axes of the elliptic cross-section. We have shown that the ratio of
frequencies of the first overtone and fundamental harmonic is the same for both
kink modes and independent of the ratio of the ellipse axes. On the basis of
this result we concluded that the estimates of the atmospheric scale height
obtained using simultaneous observations of the fundamental harmonic and first
overtone of the coronal loop kink oscillations are independent of the
ellipticity of the loop cross-section.
