We study the addditon problem for strongly matricially free random variables
which generalize free random variables. Using operators of Toeplitz type, we
derive a linearization formula for the `matricial R-transform' related to the
associated convolution. It is a linear combination of Voiculescu's R-transforms
in free probability with coefficients given by internal units of the considered
array of subalgebras. This allows us to view this formula as the `matricial
linearization property' of the R-transform. Since strong matricial freeness
unifies the main types of noncommutative independence, the matricial
R-transform plays the role of a unified noncommutative analog of the logarithm
of the Fourier transform for free, boolean, monotone, orthogonal, s-free and
c-free independence.
