We consider a hypothetical observatory of ultra-high energy cosmic rays
consisting of two surface detector arrays that measure independently
electromagnetic and muon signals induced by air showers. Using the constant
intensity cut method, sets of events ordered according to each of both signal
sizes are compared giving the number of matched events. Based on its dependence
on the zenith angle, a parameter sensitive to the dispersion of the
distribution of the logarithmic mass of cosmic rays is introduced. The results
obtained using two post-LHC models of hadronic interactions are very similar
and indicate a weak dependence on details of these interactions.
