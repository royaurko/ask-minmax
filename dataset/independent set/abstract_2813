We consider a two-user state-dependent multiaccess channel in which only one
of the encoders is informed, non-causally, of the channel states. Two
independent messages are transmitted: a common message transmitted by both the
informed and uninformed encoders, and an individual message transmitted by only
the uninformed encoder. We derive inner and outer bounds on the capacity region
of this model in the discrete memoryless case as well as the Gaussian case.
Further, we show that the bounds for the Gaussian case are tight in some
special cases.
