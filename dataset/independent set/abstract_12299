Five-dimensional generalization of (A)dS(5)-Kerr black hole is shown to be
generated in a coordinate free way by a single AdS(5) global symmetry
parameter. Its mass and angular momenta are associated to Casimir invariants of
the background space-time symmetry parameter leading to the black hole
classification scheme similar to that of relativistic fields resulting apart
from ordinary black hole to "tachyonic" and "light-like" ones.
