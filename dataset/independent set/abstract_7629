Using some theory of (rational) elliptic surfaces plus elementary properties
of a Mordell-Weil group regarded as module over the endomorphism ring of a (CM)
elliptic curve, we present examples of such surfaces with j-invariant zero. In
particular, a K3 example is given with the maximal possible rank 18, plus that
many explicit independent sections on it. Several other high rank cases are
discussed; for instance Shioda's example with rank 68.
