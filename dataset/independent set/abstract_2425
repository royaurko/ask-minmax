In fermion mixing phenomenology, the matrix of moduli squared, P=(|U|^2), is
well-known to carry essentially the same information as the complex mixing
matrix U itself, but with the advantage of being phase-convention independent.
The matrix K (analogous to the Jarlskog CP-invariant J) formed from the real
parts of the mixing matrix "plaquette" products is similarly invariant. In this
paper, the P and K matrices are shown to be entirely equivalent, both being
directly related (in the leptonic case) to the observable, locally L/E-averaged
transition probabilities in neutrino oscillations. We study an (over-)complete
set of flavour-symmetric Jarlskog-invariant functions of mass-matrix
commutators, rewriting them simply as moment-transforms of such (real)
invariant matrices.
