We consider a multiple hypothesis testing setting where the hypotheses are
ordered and one is only permitted to reject an initial contiguous block,
H_1,\dots,H_k, of hypotheses. A rejection rule in this setting amounts to a
procedure for choosing the stopping point k. This setting is inspired by the
sequential nature of many model selection problems, where choosing a stopping
point or a model is equivalent to rejecting all hypotheses up to that point and
none thereafter. We propose two new testing procedures, and prove that they
control the false discovery rate in the ordered testing setting. We also show
how the methods can be applied to model selection using recent results on
p-values in sequential model selection settings.
