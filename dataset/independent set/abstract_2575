Ultracold collisions of polar OH molecules are considered in the presence of
an electrostatic field. The field exerts a strong influence on both elastic and
state-changing inelastic collision rate constants, leading to clear
experimental signatures that should help disentangle the theory of cold
molecule collisions. Based on the collision rates we discuss the prospects for
evaporative cooling of electrostatically trapped OH. We also find that the
scattering properties at ultralow temperatures prove to be remarkably
independent of the details of the short-range interaction, owing to avoided
crossings in the long-range adiabatic potential curves. The behavior of the
scattering rate constants is qualitatively understood in terms of a novel set
of long-range states of the [OH]$_2$ dimer.
