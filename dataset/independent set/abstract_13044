We use the method of evaluating the decay rate in terms of the imaginary part
of a probe brane action to study the holographic Schwinger effect. In the
confining D3-branes case, we find that the Schwinger effect occurs at energy
scales higher than the Kaluza-Klein mass, indicating the absence of such effect
when the dual gauge field theory can be regarded as an 2+1 dimensional theory.
This property is independent of the configuration of the probe brane. In the
case of D3-branes with a B field dual to a noncommutative super Yang-Mills
theory, we study how the decay rate is affected by the noncommutative effect.
