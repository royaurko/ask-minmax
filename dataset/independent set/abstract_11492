We describe the construction of the genus-zero parts of conformal field
theories in the sense of G. Segal from representations of vertex operator
algebras satisfying certain conditions. The construction is divided into four
steps and each step gives a mathematical structure of independent interest.
These mathematical structures are intertwining operator algebras, genus-zero
modular functors, genus-zero holomorphic weakly conformal field theories, and
genus-zero conformal field theories.
