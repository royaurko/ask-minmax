We construct exact ring soliton-like solutions of the cylindrically symmetric
(i.e., radial) Gross- Pitaevskii equation with a potential, using the
similarity transformation method. Depending on the choice of the allowed free
functions, the solutions can take the form of stationary dark or bright rings
whose time dependence is in the phase dynamics only, or oscillating and
bouncing solutions, related to the second Painlev\'e transcendent. In each case
the potential can be chosen to be time-independent.
