We investigate electronic transport in dual-gated twisted bilayer graphene.
Despite the sub-nanometer proximity between the layers, we identify independent
contributions to the magnetoresistance from the graphene Landau level spectrum
of each layer. We demonstrate that the filling factor of each layer can be
independently controlled via the dual gates, which we use to induce Landau
level crossings between the layers. By analyzing the gate dependence of the
Landau level crossings, we characterize the finite inter-layer screening and
extract the capacitance between the atomically-spaced layers. At zero filling
factor, we observe magnetic and displacement field dependent insulating states,
which indicate the presence of counter-propagating edge states with inter-layer
coupling.
