We present an analysis of the non-Gaussianity in the distribution of
Ly$\alpha$ forest lines in the QSO absorption spectra. Statistical tests
performed on this data indicate that there may be large scale structure even
though the power spectrum of the Ly$\alpha$ line distribution on large scales
is found to be flat. It is apparent that higher (than two) order statistics are
crucial in quantifying the clustering behavior of Ly$\alpha$ clouds. Using the
discrete wavelet on three independent data sets of Ly$\alpha$ forests, we find
that the distribution of Ly$\alpha$ forests does show non-Gaussian behavior on
scales from 5 to 10 h$^{-1}$ Mpc with confidence level larger than 95%. Two
data sets available on large scales are found to be non-Gaussian on even larger
scales. These techniques are effective in discriminating among models of the
Ly$\alpha$ forest formation, which are degenerate at second and lower order
statistics (abridged).
