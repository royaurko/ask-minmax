Neutrino telescopes are looking to detect neutrinos produced by the
annihilation of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter in the
sun. The event rate depends on the dark matter density in the sun, which in
turn is dictated by the cross section of WIMPs with nucleons. This however is
bounded by direct detection experiments. We use the constraints from these
experiments to place model-independent upper bounds on the event rates in
neutrino telescopes that apply to any elastic dark matter model. Since the
spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section is much more tightly constrained
than the corresponding spin-dependent cross section, the bounds are much
stronger in the former case and are competitive with the current limits from
IceCube. If the number of events observed in neutrino telescopes exceeds the
upper bound corresponding to spin-independent interactions, the implication is
that the cross section of dark matter with nucleons is dominated by
spin-dependent interactions. In such a scenario the natural dark matter
candidates are Majorana fermions and real vector bosons, so that dark matter
particles are their own anti-particles. We show that any such theory that leads
to observable event rates at current generation neutrino telescopes will in
general contain new particles charged under the Standard Model gauge groups
that naturally lie in a mass range that is kinematically accessible to the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
