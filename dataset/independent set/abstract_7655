The very well--poised elliptic Macdonald functions W_lambda in n independent
variables are defined and their properties are investigated. The W_lambda are
generalized by introducing an extra parameter to the elliptic Jackson
coefficients omega_lambda and their properties are studied. BC_n multivariable
Jackson sums in terms of both W_lambda and omega_lambda functions are proved.
