We extend the theory of d-separation to cases in which data instances are not
independent and identically distributed. We show that applying the rules of
d-separation directly to the structure of probabilistic models of relational
data inaccurately infers conditional independence. We introduce relational
d-separation, a theory for deriving conditional independence facts from
relational models. We provide a new representation, the abstract ground graph,
that enables a sound, complete, and computationally efficient method for
answering d-separation queries about relational models, and we present
empirical results that demonstrate effectiveness.
