We propose a one-dimensional electron model with parameters modulated
adiabatically in closed cycles, which can continuously pump spin to leads. By
defining the spin-polarized Wannier functions, we show that the spin pump is
protected by the spin Chern numbers, so that it is stable to perturbations
violating the time-reversal symmetry and spin conservation. Our work
demonstrates the possibility and principle to realize topological spin pumps
independent of any symmetries, and also suggests a possible way to
experimentally observe the bulk topological invariants.
