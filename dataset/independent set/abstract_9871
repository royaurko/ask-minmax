We consider repulsive potential energies $\E_q(\Sigma)$, whose integrand
measures tangent-point interactions, on a large class of non-smooth
$m$-dimensional sets $\Sigma$ in $\R^n.$ Finiteness of the energy
$\E_q(\Sigma)$ has three sorts of effects for the set $\Sigma$: topological
effects excluding all kinds of (a priori admissible) self-intersections,
geometric and measure-theoretic effects, providing large projections of
$\Sigma$ onto suitable $m$-planes and therefore large $m$-dimensional Hausdorff
measure of $\Sigma$ within small balls up to a uniformly controlled scale, and
finally, regularizing effects culminating in a geometric variant of the
Morrey-Sobolev embedding theorem: Any admissible set $\Sigma$ with finite
$\E_q$-energy, for any exponent $q>2m$, is, in fact, a $C^1$-manifold whose
tangent planes vary in a H\"older continuous manner with the optimal H\"older
exponent $\mu=1-(2m)/q$. Moreover, the patch size of the local
$C^{1,\mu}$-graph representations is uniformly controlled from below only in
terms of the energy value $\E_q(\Sigma)$.
