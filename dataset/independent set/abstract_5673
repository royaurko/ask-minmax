A symmetric dissipative two-state system is asymptotically completely
delocalized independent of the initial state. We show that driving-induced
localization at long times can take place when both the bias and tunneling
coupling energy are harmonically modulated. Dynamical symmetry breaking on
average occurs when the driving frequencies are odd multiples of some reference
frequency. This effect is universal, as it is independent of the dissipative
mechanism. Possible candidates for an experimental observation are flux
tunneling in the variable barrier rf SQUID and magnetization tunneling in
magnetic molecular clusters.
