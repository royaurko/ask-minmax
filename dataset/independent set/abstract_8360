We present a method developed by the NNPDF Collaboration that allows the
inclusion of new experimental data into an existing set of parton distribution
functions without the need for a complete refit. A Monte Carlo ensemble of PDFs
may be updated by assigning each member of the ensemble a unique weight
determined by Bayesian inference. The reweighted ensemble therefore represents
the probability density of PDFs conditional on both the old and new data. This
method is applied to the inclusion of W-lepton asymmetry data into the NNPDF2.1
fit producing a new PDF set, NNPDF2.2.
