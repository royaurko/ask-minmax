We develop and study the evolution of a model of radiation induced apoptosis
in cells using stochastic simulations, and identified key protein targets for
effective mitigation of radiation damage. We identified several key proteins
associated with cellular apoptosis using an extensive literature survey. In
particular, we focus on the p53 transcription dependent and p53 transcription
independent pathways for mitochondrial apoptosis. Our model reproduces known
p53 oscillations following radiation damage. The key, experimentally testable
hypotheses that we generate are - inhibition of PUMA is an effective strategy
for mitigation of radiation damage if the treatment is administered
immediately, at later stages following radiation damage, inhibition of tBid is
more effective.
