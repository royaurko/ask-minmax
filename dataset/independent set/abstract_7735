We show that the consequences of an introduction of a manifest
time-dependence in a pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian H=H(t) are by far less
drastic than suggested by A. Mostafazadeh in Phys. Lett. B 650 (2007) 208
(arXiv:0706.1872v2 [quant-ph]). In particular, the unitarity of the evolution
does not necessitate the time-independence of the metric $\eta_+=\eta_+(t)$.
