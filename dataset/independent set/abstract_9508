Recent studies have reported an interesting class of semiconductor materials
that bridge the gap between semiconductors and halfmetallic ferromagnets. These
materials, called spin gapless semiconductors, exhibit a bandgap in one of the
spin channels and a zero bandgap in the other and thus allow for tunable spin
transport. Here, a theoretical and experimental study of the spin gapless
Heusler compound Mn2CoAl is presented. It turns out that Mn2CoAl is a very
peculiar ferrimagnetic semiconductor with a magnetic moment of 2 {\mu}B and a
high Curie temperature of 720 K. Below 300 K, the compound exhibits nearly
temperature-independent conductivity, very low, temperature-independent carrier
concentration, and a vanishing Seebeck coefficient. The magnetoresistance
changes sign with temperature. In high fields, it is positive and
non-saturating at low temperatures, but negative and saturating at high
temperatures. The anomalous Hall effect is comparatively low, which is
explained by the close antisymmetry of the Berry curvature for kz of opposite
sign.
