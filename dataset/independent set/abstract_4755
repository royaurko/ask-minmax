We investigate the set of biaccessible points for connected polynomial Julia
sets of arbitrary degrees $d\geq 2$. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of
the set of external angles corresponding to biaccessible points is less than 1,
unless the Julia set is an interval. This strengthens theorems of Stanislav
Smirnov and Anna Zdunik: they proved that the same set of external angles has
zero 1-dimensional measure.
