Recognise that people have many, possibly conflicting, aspects to their
personality. We hypothesise that each separate characteristic of a personality
may be treated as an independent player in a non-zero sum many player game.
This idea is applied to the two person Prisoners' Dilemma as an introductory
example. We assume each prisoner has a ``mercenary'' characteristic as well as
an ``altruistic'' characteristic, and find that all Nash equilibria of the
Prisoners' Dilemma has each prisoner in an internal conflict between their two
characteristics. The hypothesis that people are composed of more than one
``player'' may explain some of the anomalies that occur in human experiments
exploring game theory.
