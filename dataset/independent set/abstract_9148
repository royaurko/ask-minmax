We discuss model independent methods to measure the $P$-parity of the
$\Theta^+$-pentaquark, in the simplest processes of photoproduction,
$\gamma+N\to \bar{K}+\Theta^+$, using definite relations between T-even
polarization observables, which depend on the $P$-parity of the $\Theta^+$
baryon (with respect to the $NK$ system). One method, which holds for any
photon energy and any $K$ meson production angle, is based on the relation
between the $\Sigma_B$ asymmetry (induced by a linearly polarized photon beam,
with unpolarized target) and the $D_{nn}$ component of the depolarization
tensor (for unpolarized photon beam). Another method, which applies in
collinear kinematics (or in threshold conditions), is related to the sign of
the $D_{nn}$ component, with linearly polarized photon beam.
