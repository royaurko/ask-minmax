We provide a formula for the number of edges of the Hasse diagram of the
independent subsets of the h-th power of a path ordered by inclusion. For h=1
such a value is the number of edges of a Fibonacci cube. We show that, in
general, the number of edges of the diagram is obtained by convolution of a
Fibonacci-like sequence with itself.
