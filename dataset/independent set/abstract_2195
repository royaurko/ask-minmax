We report on work done by the Virgo consortium, an international
collaboration set up in order to study the formation and evolution of Large
Scale Structure using N-body simulations on the latest generation of parallel
supercomputers. We show results of 256^3 particle simulations of the formation
of clusters in four Dark Matter models with different cosmological parameters.
Normalizing the models such that one obtains the correct abundance of rich
clusters yields an interesting result: The peculiar velocities of the clusters
are almost independent of \Omega, and depend only weakly on \Gamma, the shape
parameter of the power spectrum. Thus, it is nearly impossible to distinguish
between high and low \Omega models on the basis of the peculiar velocities.
