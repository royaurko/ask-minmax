We give the first examples of flows which exhibit robust singular attractors
containing a wild hyperbolic set (in the sense of Newhouse). A hyperbolic set
is said to be wild, if it has tangencies between its stable and unstable
manifolds, in a robust way. The only restriction on the ambient manifold is
that its dimension should be at least 5.
