Many relations of scientific interest are nonlinear, and even in linear
systems distributions are often non-Gaussian, for example in fMRI BOLD data. A
class of search procedures for causal relations in high dimensional data relies
on sample derived conditional independence decisions. The most common
applications rely on Gaussian tests that can be systematically erroneous in
nonlinear non-Gaussian cases. Recent work (Gretton et al. (2009), Tillman et
al. (2009), Zhang et al. (2011)) has proposed conditional independence tests
using Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Among these, perhaps the most
efficient has been KCI (Kernel Conditional Independence, Zhang et al. (2011)),
with computational requirements that grow effectively at least as O(N3),
placing it out of range of large sample size analysis, and restricting its
applicability to high dimensional data sets. We propose a class of O(N2) tests
using conditional correlation independence (CCI) that require a few seconds on
a standard workstation for tests that require tens of minutes to hours for the
KCI method, depending on degree of parallelization, with similar accuracy. For
accuracy on difficult nonlinear, non-Gaussian data sets, we also compare a
recent test due to Harris & Drton (2012), applicable to nonlinear, non-Gaussian
distributions in the Gaussian copula, as well as to partial correlation, a
linear Gaussian test.
