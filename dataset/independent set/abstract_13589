In a previous paper we have suggested a number of ideas to attack circuit
size complexity with cohomology. As a simple example, we take circuits that can
only compute the AND of two inputs, which essentially reduces to SET COVER. We
show a very special case of the cohomological approach (one particular free
category, using injective and superskyscraper sheaves) gives the linear
programming bound coming from the relaxation of the standard integer
programming reformulation of SET COVER.
