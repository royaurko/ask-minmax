Although the sufficient condition for a blindly interference-aligned (BIA)
2-user 2x1 broadcast channel (BC) in homogeneous fading to achieve its maximal
4/3 DoF is well understood, its counterpart for the general K-user 2x1 MISO BC
in homogeneous block fading to achieve the corresponding 2k/(2+K-1) (DoF)
remains unsolved and is, thus, the focus of this paper. An interference channel
is said BIA-feasible if it achieves its maximal DoF only via BIA. In this
paper, we cast this general feasibility problem in the framework of finding
integer solutions for a system of linear Diophantine equations. By assuming
independent user links each of the same coherence time and by studying the
solvability of the Diophantine system, we derive the sufficient and necessary
conditions on the K users' fading block offsets to ensure the BIA feasibility
of the K-user BC. If the K offsets are independent and uniformly distributed
over a coherence block, we can further prove that 11 users are enough for one
to find, with certainty of 95%, 3 users among them to form a BIA-feasible
3-user 2x1 BC.
