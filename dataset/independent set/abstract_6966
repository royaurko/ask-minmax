Given a graph $G$, the $k$-dominating graph of $G$, $D_k(G)$, is defined to
be the graph whose vertices correspond to the dominating sets of $G$ that have
cardinality at most $k$. Two vertices in $D_k(G)$ are adjacent if and only if
the corresponding dominating sets of $G$ differ by either adding or deleting a
single vertex. The graph $D_k(G)$ aids in studying the reconfiguration problem
for dominating sets. In particular, one dominating set can be reconfigured to
another by a sequence of single vertex additions and deletions, such that the
intermediate set of vertices at each step is a dominating set if and only if
they are in the same connected component of $D_k(G)$. In this paper we give
conditions that ensure $D_k(G)$ is connected.
