It was proved independently by Foschi and Hundertmark, Zharnitsky that
Gaussians extremize the adjoint Fourier restriction inequality for L^2
functions on the paraboloid in the two lowest-dimesional cases. Here we prove
that Gaussians are critical points for the L^p to L^q adjoint Fourier
restriction inequalities if and only if p=2. Also, Gaussians are critial points
for the L^2 to L^r_t L^q_x Strichartz inequalities for all admissible pairs
(r,q) in (1,infinity)^2.
