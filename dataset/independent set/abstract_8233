We prove that a homeomorphism of the torus homotopic to the identity whose
rotation set is reduced to a single totally irrational vector is
chain-recurrent. In fact, we show that pseudo-orbits can be chosen with a small
number of jumps, in particular, that the nonwandering set is weakly transitive.
We give an example showing that the nonwandering set of such a homeomorphism
may not be transitive.
