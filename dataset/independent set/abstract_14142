We characterize equicontinuous Delone dynamical systems as those coming from
Delone sets with strongly almost periodic Dirac combs. Within the class of
systems with nite local complexity the only equicontinuous systems are then
shown to be the crystalline ones. On the other hand, within the class without
nite local complexity, we exhibit examples of equicontinuous minimal Delone
dynamical systems which are not crystalline. Our results solve the problem
posed by Lagarias whether a Delone set whose Dirac comb is strongly almost
periodic must be crystalline.
