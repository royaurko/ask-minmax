We investigate certain envelopes of open sets in dual Banach spaces which are
related to extending holomorphic functions. We give a variety of examples of
absolutely convex sets showing that the extension is in many cases not
possible. We also establish connections to the study of iterated weak*
sequential closures of convex sets in the dual of separable spaces.
