Spin dependent fragmentation functions for heavy flavor quarks to fragment
into heavy baryons are calculated in a quark-diquark model. The production of
intermediate spin 1/2 and 3/2 excited states is explicity included. The
resulting $\Lambda_b$ production rate and polarization at LEP energies are in
agreement with experiment. The $\Lambda_c$ and $\Xi_c$ functions are also
obtained. The spin independent $f_1(z)$ is compared to data. The integrated
values for production rates agree with the data.
