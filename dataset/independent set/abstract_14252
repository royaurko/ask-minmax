After giving an introduction to the procedure dubbed slow polynomial mating
and stating a conjecture relating this to other notions of polynomial mating,
we show conformally correct pictures of the slow mating of two degree 3 post
critically finite polynomials introduced by Shishikura and Tan Lei as an
example of a non matable pair of polynomials without a Levy cycle. The pictures
show a limit for the Julia sets, which seems to be related to the Julia set of
a degree 6 rational map. We give a conjectural interpretation of this in terms
of pinched spheres and show further conformal representations.
