A Wilsonian renormalization group approach is applied, in order to include
effects of the higher Landau levels for quarks into a set of renormalized
parameters for the lowest Landau level (LLL), plus a set of operators made of
the LLL fields. Most of the calculations can be done in a model-independent way
with perturbation theory for hard gluons, thanks to form factors of quark-gluon
vertices that arise from the Ritus bases for quark fields. As a part of such
renormalization program, we compute the renormalized quark self-energy at
1-loop, including effects from all higher orbital levels. The result indicates
that the higher orbital levels cease to strongly affect the LLL at a rather
small magnetic field of (0.1 - 0.3) GeV^2.
