Universal Lax pairs of the root type with spectral parameter and independent
coupling constants for twisted non-simply laced Calogero-Moser models are
constructed. Together with the Lax pairs for the simply laced models and
untwisted non-simply laced models presented in two previous papers, this
completes the derivation of universal Lax pairs for all of the Calogero-Moser
models based on root systems. As for the twisted models based on B_n, C_n and
BC_nroot systems, a new type of potential term with independent coupling
constants can be added without destroying integrability. They are called
extended twisted models. All of the Lax pairs for the twisted models presented
here are new, except for the one for the F_4 model based on the short roots.
The Lax pairs for the twisted G_2 model have some novel features. Derivation of
various functions, twisted and untwisted, appearing in the Lax pairs for
elliptic potentials with the spectral parameter is provided. The origin of the
spectral parameter is also naturally explained. The Lax pairs with spectral
parameter, twisted and untwisted, for the hyperbolic, the trigonometric and the
rational potential models are obtained as degenerate limits of those for the
elliptic potential models.
