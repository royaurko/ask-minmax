Several general properties, concerning reduction algebras - rings of
definition and algorithmic efficiency of the set of ordering relations - are
discussed. For the reduction algebras, related to the diagonal embedding of the
Lie algebra $gl_n$ into $gl_n \oplus gl_n$, we establish a stabilization
phenomenon and list the complete sets of defining relations.
