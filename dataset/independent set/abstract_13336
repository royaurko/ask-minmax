We present time series Doppler data from Lick Observatory that reveal the
presence of long-period planetary companions orbiting nearby stars. The typical
eccentricity of these massive planets are greater than the mean eccentricity of
known exoplanets. HD30562b has Msini = 1.29 Mjup, with semi-major axis of 2.3
AU and eccentricity 0.76. The host star has a spectral type F8V and is metal
rich. HD86264b has Msini = 7.0 Mjup, arel = 2.86 AU, an eccentricity, e = 0.7
and orbits a metal-rich, F7V star. HD87883b has Msini = 1.78 Mjup, arel = 3.6
AU, e = 0.53 and orbits a metal-rich K0V star. HD89307b has Msini = 1.78 Mjup,
arel = 3.3 AU, e = 0.24 and orbits a G0V star with slightly subsolar
metallicity. HD148427b has Msini = 0.96 Mjup, arel = 0.93 AU, eccentricity of
0.16 and orbits a metal rich K0 subgiant. We also present velocities for a
planet orbiting the F8V metal-rich binary star, HD196885A. The planet has Msini
= 2.58 Mjup, arel = 2.37 AU, and orbital eccentricity of 0.48, in agreement
with the independent discovery by Correia et al. 2008.
