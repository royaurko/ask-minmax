Competition between independently arising beneficial mutations is enhanced in
spatial populations due to the linear rather than exponential growth of clones.
Recent theoretical studies have pointed out that the resulting fitness dynamics
is analogous to a surface growth process, where new layers nucleate and spread
stochastically, leading to the build up of scale-invariant roughness. This
scenario differs qualitatively from the standard view of adaptation in that the
speed of adaptation becomes independent of population size while the fitness
variance does not. Here we exploit recent progress in the understanding of
surface growth processes to obtain precise predictions for the universal,
non-Gaussian shape of the fitness distribution for one-dimensional habitats,
which are verified by simulations. When the mutations are deleterious rather
than beneficial the problem becomes a spatial version of Muller's ratchet. In
contrast to the case of well-mixed populations, the rate of fitness decline
remains finite even in the limit of an infinite habitat, provided the ratio
$U_d/s^2$ between the deleterious mutation rate and the square of the
(negative) selection coefficient is sufficiently large. Using again an analogy
to surface growth models we show that the transition between the stationary and
the moving state of the ratchet is governed by directed percolation.
