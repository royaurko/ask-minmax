We study the generating function of recurrent configurations of abelian
sandpile model on a directed graph $G$ called Biggs-Merino polynomial, named
after Norman Biggs, who was the first to study this polynomial, and Criel
Merino L\'opez, who proved that for an undirected graph the polynomial is equal
to the Tutte polynomial of the graph evaluated at x=1. Implicit in the sandpile
model is the choice of a vertex of $G$ as a sink vertex, and it was conjectured
by Perrot and Pham that Biggs-Merino polynomial is an invariant that is
independent of the choice of the sink vertex. In this paper, we give a proof of
the conjecture of Perrot and Pham by interpreting the Biggs-Merino polynomial
as a product of two functions that does not depend on the sink. We also observe
that Merino's theorem can be generalized to the setting of Eulerian digraph,
where the Biggs Merino polynomial is equal to a single variable generalization
of Tutte polynomial called the greedoid Tutte polynomial. The proof of
generalized Merino's theorem uses the digraph version of Cori-Le Borgne
algorithm to construct a bijection between arborescences of the digraph $G$ and
$G^r$-parking functions that preserves arborescence activities.
