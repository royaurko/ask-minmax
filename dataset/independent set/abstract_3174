Starting from an independent-particle model with a finite and arbitrary set
of single-particle energies, we develop an analytical approximation to the
many-body level density $\rho_A(E)$ and to particle-hole densities. We use
exact expressions for the low-order moments and cumulants to derive approximate
expressions for the coefficients of an expansion of these densities in terms of
orthogonal polynomials. The approach is asymptotically (mass number $A \gg 1$)
convergent and, for large $A$, covers about 20 orders of magnitude near the
maximum of $\rho_A(E)$ (i.e., about half the spectrum). Densities of accessible
states are calculated using the Fermi-gas model.
