The linear dispersion relation in graphene[1,2] gives rise to a surprising
prediction: the resistivity due to isotropic scatterers (e.g. white-noise
disorder[3] or phonons[4-8]) is independent of carrier density n. Here we show
that acoustic phonon scattering[4-6] is indeed independent of n, and places an
intrinsic limit on the resistivity in graphene of only 30 Ohm at room
temperature (RT). At a technologically-relevant carrier density of 10^12 cm^-2,
the mean free path for electron-acoustic phonon scattering is >2 microns, and
the intrinsic mobility limit is 2x10^5 cm^2/Vs, exceeding the highest known
inorganic semiconductor (InSb, ~7.7x10^4 cm^2/Vs[9]) and semiconducting carbon
nanotubes (~1x10^5 cm^2/Vs[10]). We also show that extrinsic scattering by
surface phonons of the SiO2 substrate[11,12] adds a strong temperature
dependent resistivity above ~200 K[8], limiting the RT mobility to ~4x10^4
cm^2/Vs, pointing out the importance of substrate choice for graphene
devices[13].
