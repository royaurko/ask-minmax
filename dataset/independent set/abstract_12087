$\gamma_{v}NN^*$ transition helicity amplitudes (electrocouplings) of several
prominent excited proton states are determined for the first time in
independent analyses of $\pi^+n$, $\pi^0p$, and $\pi^+\pi^-p$ electroproduction
off protons. Analysis of $\pi^+\pi^-p$ electroproduction has extended
considerably information on electrocouplings of high lying N* states, which
decay preferentially to the $N\pi\pi$ final states.
