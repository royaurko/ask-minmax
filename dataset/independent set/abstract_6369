Spin-dependent WIMP searches have traditionally presented results within an
odd group approximation and by suppressing one of the spin-dependent
interaction cross sections. We here elaborate on a model-independent analysis
in which spin-dependent interactions with both protons and neutrons are
simultaneously considered. Within this approach, equivalent current limits on
the WIMP-nucleon interaction at WIMP mass of 50 GeV/c$^{2}$ are either
$\sigma_{p}\leq0.7$ pb, $\sigma_{n}\leq0.2$ pb or $|a_{p}|\leq0.4$,
$|a_{n}|\leq0.7$ depending on the choice of cross section or coupling strength
representation. These limits become less restrictive for either larger or
smaller masses; they are less restrictive than those from the traditional odd
group approximation regardless of WIMP mass. Combination of experimental
results are seen to produce significantly more restrictive limits than those
obtained from any single experiment. Experiments traditionally considered
spin-independent are moreover found to severely limit the spin-dependent phase
space. The extension of this analysis to the case of positive signal
experiments is explored.
