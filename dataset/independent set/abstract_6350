Analyzing the dilepton production from out of equilibrium quark-gluon plasma,
Le Bellac and Mabilat have recently pointed out that, in the reaction rate, the
cancellation of mass (collinear) singularities takes place only in physical
gauges, and not in covariant gauges. They then have estimated the contribution
involving pinching singularities. After giving a general argument for the gauge
independence of the production rate, we explicitly confirm the gauge
independence of the mass-singular part. The contribution involving pinching
singularities develops mass singularities, which is also gauge dependent. This
`` additional'' contribution to the singular part is responsible for the gauge
independence of the `` total'' singular part. We give a sufficient condition,
under which cancellation of mass singularities takes place.
