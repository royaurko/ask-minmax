Invenio is a comprehensive web-based free digital library software suite
originally developed at CERN. In order to improve its information retrieval and
word similarity ranking capabilities, the goal of this thesis is to enhance
Invenio by bridging it with modern external information retrieval systems. In
the first part a comparison of various information retrieval systems such as
Solr and Xapian is made. In the second part a system-independent bridge for
word similarity ranking is designed and implemented. Subsequently, Solr and
Xapian are integrated in Invenio via adapters to the bridge. In the third part
scalability tests are performed. Finally, a future outlook is briefly
discussed.
