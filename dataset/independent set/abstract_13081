We study the limits of the empirical distributions of the eigenvalues of two
$n$ by $n$ matrices as $n$ goes to infinity. The first one is the product of
$m$ i.i.d. (complex) Ginibre ensembles, and the second one is that of
truncations of $m$ independent Haar unitary matrices with sizes $n_j\times n_j$
for $1\leq j \leq m$. Assuming $m$ depends on $n$, by using the special
structures of the eigenvalues of the two matrices we developed, explicit limits
of spectral distributions are obtained regardless of the speed of $m$ compared
to $n$. In particular, we show a rich feature of the limits for the second
matrix as $n_j/n$'s vary. Some general results on arbitrary rotation-invariant
determinantal point processes are also derived.
