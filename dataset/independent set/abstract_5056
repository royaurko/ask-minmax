We investigate when the independence complex of $G[H]$, the lexicographical
product of two graphs $G$ and $H$, is either vertex decomposable or shellable.
As an application, we construct an infinite family of graphs with the property
that every graph in this family has the property that the independence complex
of each graph is shellable, but not vertex decomposable.
