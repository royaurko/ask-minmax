We introduce the concept of inverse powerset by adding three axioms to the
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. This extends the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with
a new type of set which is motivated by an intuitive meaning and interesting
applications. We present different ways to extend the definition of cardinality
and show that one implies the continuum hypothesis while another implies the
negation of the continuum hypothesis. We will also explore the idea of empty
sets of different cardinalities which could be seen as the empty counterpart of
Cantor's theorem for infinite sets.
