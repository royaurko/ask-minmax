We study the spectrum of a periodic self-adjoint operator on the axis
perturbed by a small localized nonself-adjoint operator. It is shown that the
continuous spectrum is independent of the perturbation, the residual spectrum
is empty, and the point spectrum has no finite accumulation points. We address
the existence of the embedded eigenvalues. We establish the necessary and
sufficient conditions of the existence of the eigenvalues and construct their
asymptotics expansions. The asymptotics expansions for the associated
eigenfunctions are also obtained. The examples are given.
