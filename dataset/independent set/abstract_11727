The most general combination of couplings of fermions with external
potentials in 1+1 dimensions, must include vector, scalar and pseudoscalar
potentials. We consider such a mixing of potentials in a PT-symmetric
time-independent Dirac equation. The Dirac equation is mapped into an effective
PT-symmetric Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Despite the non-hermiticity of the
effective potential, we find real energies for the fermion.
