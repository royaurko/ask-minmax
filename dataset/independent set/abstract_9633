Elkies and McMullen [Duke Math.J.~123 (2004) 95--139] have shown that the
gaps between the fractional parts of \sqrt n for n=1,\ldots,N, have a limit
distribution as N tends to infinity. The limit distribution is non-standard and
differs distinctly from the exponential distribution expected for independent,
uniformly distributed random variables on the unit interval. We complement this
result by proving that the two-point correlation function of the above sequence
converges to a limit, which in fact coincides with the answer for independent
random variables. We also establish the convergence of moments for the
probability of finding r points in a randomly shifted interval of size 1/N. The
key ingredient in the proofs is a non-divergence estimate for translates of
certain non-linear horocycles.
