We study the statistical properties of wave scattering in a disordered
waveguide. The statistical properties of a "building block" of length (delta)L
are derived from a potential model and used to find the evolution with length
of the expectation value of physical quantities. In the potential model the
scattering units consist of thin potential slices, idealized as delta slices,
perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the waveguide; the variation of
the potential in the transverse direction may be arbitrary. The sets of
parameters defining a given slice are taken to be statistically independent
from those of any other slice and identically distributed. In the
dense-weak-scattering limit, in which the potential slices are very weak and
their linear density is very large, so that the resulting mean free paths are
fixed, the corresponding statistical properties of the full waveguide depend
only on the mean free paths and on no other property of the slice distribution.
The universality that arises demonstrates the existence of a generalized
central-limit theorem.
  Our final result is a diffusion equation in the space of transfer matrices of
our system, which describes the evolution with the length L of the disordered
waveguide of the transport properties of interest. In contrast to earlier
publications, in the present analysis the energy of the incident particle is
fully taken into account.
