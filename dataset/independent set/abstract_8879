In this paper I consider three families of orders on the set of r-
multipartitions of n, depending on r rational parameters. The one we are
interested in is a geometric order on the set of fixed points for a torus
action on the Gieseker variety. The other two serve as bounds for the geometric
one, providing an almost accurate description.
