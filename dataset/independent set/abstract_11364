We prove a new class of relations among multiple zeta values (MZV's) which
contains Ohno's relation. We also give the formula for the maximal number of
independent MZV's of fixed weight, under our new relations. To derive our
formula for MZV's we consider the Newton series whose values at non-negative
integers are finite multiple harmonic sums.
