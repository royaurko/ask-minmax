We study tangent sets of a general class of self-affine sets. If a set in
this class satisfies the strong separation condition and projects to a line
segment for sufficiently many directions, then for each generic point there
exists a rotation $\mathcal O$ such that all tangent sets at that point are
either of the form $\mathcal O((\mathbb R \times C) \cap B(0,1))$, where $C$ is
a closed nowhere dense set, or of the form $\mathcal O((\ell \times \{ 0 \})
\cap B(0,1))$, where $\ell$ is an interval.
