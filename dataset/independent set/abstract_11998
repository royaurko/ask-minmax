SciBooNE is a neutrino and anti-neutrino cross-section experiment at
Fermilab, USA. The SciBooNE experiment is summarised and two independent CCQE
analyses are described. For one of the analyses, an absolute muon-neutrino CCQE
cross-section in the neutrino energy region (0.6-1.6) GeV is shown and the
technique developed for such a purpose is also explained. The total
cross-section measured over this energy range agrees well with expectations,
based on the NEUT event generator and using a value of 1.21 GeV for the CCQE
axial mass.
