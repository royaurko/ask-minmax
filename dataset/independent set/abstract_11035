We present a method of obtaining the entire unitarity triangle from
measurements of B -> pi K decay rates alone. Electroweak penguin amplitudes are
included, and are related to tree operators. Discrete ambiguities are removed
by comparing solutions with independent experimental data. The theoretical
uncertainty in this method is rather small, in the range 5--10%.
