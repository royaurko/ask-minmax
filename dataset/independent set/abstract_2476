A gauge invariant action principle, based on the idea of transgression forms,
is proposed. The action extends the Chern-Simons form by the addition of a
boundary term that makes the action gauge invariant (and not just
quasi-invariant). Interpreting the spacetime manifold as cobordant to another
one, the duplication of gauge fields in spacetime is avoided. The advantages of
this approach are particularly noticeable for the gravitation theory described
by a Chern-Simons lagrangian for the AdS group, in which case the action is
regularized and finite for black hole geometries in diverse situations. Black
hole thermodynamics is correctly reproduced using either a background field
approach or a background-independent setting, even in cases with asymptotically
nontrivial topologies. It is shown that the energy found from the thermodynamic
analysis agrees with the surface integral obtained by direct application of
Noether's theorem.
