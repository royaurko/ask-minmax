We measure the polarization of W bosons from top-quark (t) decays into final
states with a charged lepton and jets, tt --> WbWb --> lvbqqb, using the full
Run II data set collected by the CDF II detector. A model-independent method
simultaneously determines the fraction of longitudinal (f_0) and right-handed
(f_+) W bosons to yield f_0 = 0.726 +/- 0.066 (stat) +/- 0.067 (syst) and f_+ =
-0.045 +/- 0.044 (stat) +/- 0.058 (syst) with a correlation coefficient of
-0.69. Additional results are presented under various standard model
assumptions. No significant discrepencies with the standard model are observed.
