Based on the largest homogeneously reduced set of Type Ia supernova
luminosity data currently available -- the Union2 sample -- we reconstruct the
expansion history of the Universe in a model-independent approach. Our method
tests the geometry of the Universe directly without reverting to any
assumptions made on its energy content. This allows us to constrain Dark Energy
models and non-standard cosmologies in a straightforward way. The applicability
of the presented method is not restricted to testing cosmological models. It
can be a valuable tool for pointing out systematic errors hidden in the
supernova data and planning future Type Ia supernova cosmology campaigns.
