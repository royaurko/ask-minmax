We investigate the ability of a local bi-orthogonal decomposition to build
texture segmentation of images. Using the structures associated to the local
decomposition of the image independent row and columns we perform a
segmentation, where the regions are defined by the property of having a smooth
variation of the corresponding entropy. Examples are choosen in texture made
and also in real life images. The size of the local analysis is also determined
by the properties of the (global) bi-orthogonal decomposition.
