This note introduces and studies an open set of PSL(2,C) characters of a
nonabelian free group, on which the action of the outer automorphism group is
properly discontinuous, and which is strictly larger than the set of discrete,
faithful convex-cocompact (i.e. Schottky) characters. This implies, in
particular, that the outer automorphism group does not act ergodically on the
set of characters with dense image. Hence there is a difference between the
geometric (discrete vs. dense) decomposition of the characters, and a natural
dynamical decomposition.
