The Tully-Fisher and Fundamental Plane relations are used to obtain two
independent estimates of the relative distance between the clusters A2634 and
Coma. Previously published studies of A2634 showed a large discrepancy between
the distance estimates obtained with the TF and the Dn-sigma relations,
questioning the reliability of redshift-independent distances obtained using
these relations. Because of the importance of this issue, we have obtained new
distance estimates for A2634, based on much larger samples than previously
used, and selected according to rigorous membership criteria. New I band CCD
photometry for 175 galaxies, new 21 cm observations of 11 galaxies, and new
velocity dispersion measurements for 62 galaxies are used together with
previously published data in building these samples. After the appropriate
corrections for sample incompleteness have been taken into account, we find the
TF and FP distance estimates to be in good agreement, both indicating that
A2634 has a negligibly small peculiar velocity with respect to the Cosmic
Microwave Background reference frame. Because of the high accuracy with which
the two distance estimates have been obtained, their agreement strongly
supports the universality of the TF and FP relations, and therefore their
reliability for the estimate of redshift-independent distances.
