In this work we study boundedness of Littlewood-Paley-Stein square func-
tions associated to multilinear operators. We prove weighted Lebesgue space
bounds for square functions under relaxed regularity and cancellation
conditions that are independent of weights, which is a new result even in the
linear case. For a class of multilinear convolu- tion operators, we prove
necessary and sufficient conditions for weighted Lebesgue space bounds. Using
extrapolation theory, we extend weighted bounds in the multilinear setting for
Lebesgue spaces with index smaller than one.
