Leggett-Garg inequalities (LGI) are constrains on certain combinations of
temporal correlations obtained by measuring one and the same system at two
different instants of time. The usual derivations of LGI assume \emph
{macroscopic realism per se } and \emph {noninvasive measurability}. We derive
these inequalities under a different set of assumptions, namely the assumptions
of \emph{predictability} and \emph{no signaling in time}. As a novel
implication of this derivation, we show that LGI can be used to certify
randomness in a device independent way.
