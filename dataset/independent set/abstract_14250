A number of recent papers treated the representation theory of partially
ordered sets in unitary spaces with the so called orthoscalar relation. Such
theory generalizes the classical theory which studies the representations of
partially ordered sets in linear spaces. It happens that the results in the
unitary case are well-correlated with those in the linear case. The purpose of
this article is to shed light on this phenomena.
