We analyse the Witten-Woronowicz's type deformations of the Lie superalgebra
osp(2,2) and obtain a deformation parametrized by three independent parameters.
For some of these algebras, finite dimensional representations are formulated
in terms of a finite difference operator, providing operators that are relevant
for the classification of quasi exactly solvable, finite difference equations.
Similar representations are also pointed out for the Lie superalgebra osp(1,2).
