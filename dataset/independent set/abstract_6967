This paper presents a technique for approximating, up to any precision, the
set of subgame-perfect equilibria (SPE) in discounted repeated games. The
process starts with a single hypercube approximation of the set of SPE. Then
the initial hypercube is gradually partitioned on to a set of smaller adjacent
hypercubes, while those hypercubes that cannot contain any point belonging to
the set of SPE are simultaneously withdrawn.
  Whether a given hypercube can contain an equilibrium point is verified by an
appropriate mathematical program. Three different formulations of the algorithm
for both approximately computing the set of SPE payoffs and extracting players'
strategies are then proposed: the first two that do not assume the presence of
an external coordination between players, and the third one that assumes a
certain level of coordination during game play for convexifying the set of
continuation payoffs after any repeated game history.
  A special attention is paid to the question of extracting players' strategies
and their representability in form of finite automata, an important feature for
artificial agent systems.
