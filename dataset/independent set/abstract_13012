We investigate sound propagation in a moving fluid confined in a randomly
corrugated tube. For weak randomness and small fluid velocities $v^{(0)}$, the
localization length $\xi$ shows extreme sensitivity to the variation of
$v^{(0)}$. In the opposite limit of large fluid velocities, $\xi$ acquires a
constant value which is independent of the frequency of the incident sound
wave, the degree of randomness and $v^{(0)}$ itself. Finally, we find that the
standard deviation $\sigma_{\ln T}$ of the logarithm of transmittance $\ln(T)$
is a universal function of the ensemble average $\langle \ln T\rangle $, which
is not affected by the fluid velocity.
