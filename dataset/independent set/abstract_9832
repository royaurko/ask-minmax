We consider the problem of classification of an object given multiple
observations that possibly include different transformations. The possible
transformations of the object generally span a low-dimensional manifold in the
original signal space. We propose to take advantage of this manifold structure
for the effective classification of the object represented by the observation
set. In particular, we design a low complexity solution that is able to exploit
the properties of the data manifolds with a graph-based algorithm. Hence, we
formulate the computation of the unknown label matrix as a smoothing process on
the manifold under the constraint that all observations represent an object of
one single class. It results into a discrete optimization problem, which can be
solved by an efficient and low complexity algorithm. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed graph-based algorithm in the classification of sets
of multiple images. Moreover, we show its high potential in video-based face
recognition, where it outperforms state-of-the-art solutions that fall short of
exploiting the manifold structure of the face image data sets.
