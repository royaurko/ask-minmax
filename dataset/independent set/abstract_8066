In this paper we produce infinitely many examples of set-theoretic complete
intersection monomial curves in $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$, starting with a
set-theoretic complete intersection monomial curve in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ . In
most of the cases our results cannot be obtained through semigroup gluing
technique and we can tell apart explicitly which cases are new.
