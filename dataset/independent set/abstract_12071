We provide partial results towards a conjectural generalization of a theorem
of Lubotzky-Mozes-Raghunathan for arithmetic groups (over number fields or
function fields) that implies, in low dimensions, both polynomial isoperimetric
inequalities and finiteness properties. As a tool in our proof, we establish
polynomial isoperimetric inequalities and finiteness properties for certain
solvable groups that appear as subgroups of parabolic groups in semisimple
groups, thus generalizing a theorem of Bux. We also develop a precise version
of reduction theory for arithmetic groups whose proof is, for the most part,
independent of whether the underlying global field is a number field or a
function field.
