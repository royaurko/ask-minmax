The concept of cross density of states characterizes the intrinsic spatial
coherence of complex photonic or plasmonic systems, independently on the
illumination conditions. Using this tool and the associated intrinsic coherence
length, we demonstrate unambiguously the spatial squeezing of eigenmodes on
disordered fractal metallic films, thus clarifying a basic issue in plasmonics.
