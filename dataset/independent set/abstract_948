A search for day-night variations in the solar neutrino flux resulting from
neutrino oscillations has been carried out using the 504 day sample of solar
neutrino data obtained at Super-Kamiokande. The absence of a significant
day-night variation has set an absolute flux independent exclusion region in
the two neutrino oscillation parameter space.
