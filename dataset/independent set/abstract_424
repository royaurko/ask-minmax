We consider the fundamental problem of inferring the distribution $F^*_X$ of
a real-valued random variable $X$ and a population parameter $q^*=q[F^*_X]$
from a set of independent observations $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$. Inferences about
possible generating distributions $F_X$ and values of the population parameter
$q[F_X]$ are made without any assumptions other than the bounding interval $I
\in \mathbb{R}$. The resulting nonparametric Bayesian method results in a
probability distribution on the space of imprecise distribution functions on
$I$. The resulting method has a natural interpretation in terms of the
intervals between ordered observations, where the probabiliy mass associated
with each interval is uniformly distributed on the space of possible values,
but there are no restrictions on the distribution of probability mass within
each interval. This formulation gives rise to a straightforward resampling
method: Bayesian interval sampling. This robust method is applied to a sample
data set, and examples of resulting estimators for various population
parameters are given. The method is compared to common alternatives and is
shown to satisfy strict error bounds even for small data sets and ill-behaved
distributions.
