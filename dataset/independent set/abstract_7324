Given a set $S$ of $n$ points in the plane, a \emph{radial ordering} of $S$
with respect to a point $p$ (not in $S$) is a clockwise circular ordering of
the elements in $S$ by angle around $p$. If $S$ is two-colored, a \emph{colored
radial ordering} is a radial ordering of $S$ in which only the colors of the
points are considered. In this paper, we obtain bounds on the number of
distinct non-colored and colored radial orderings of $S$. We assume a strong
general position on $S$, not three points are collinear and not three
lines---each passing through a pair of points in $S$---intersect in a point of
$\R^2\setminus S$. In the colored case, $S$ is a set of $2n$ points partitioned
into $n$ red and $n$ blue points, and $n$ is even. We prove that: the number of
distinct radial orderings of $S$ is at most $O(n^4)$ and at least
$\Omega(n^3)$; the number of colored radial orderings of $S$ is at most
$O(n^4)$ and at least $\Omega(n)$; there exist sets of points with
$\Theta(n^4)$ colored radial orderings and sets of points with only $O(n^2)$
colored radial orderings.
