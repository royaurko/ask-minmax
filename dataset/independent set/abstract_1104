We study the Generalized Chaplygin gas model (GCGM) using Gamma-ray bursts as
cosmological probes. In order to avoid the so-called circularity problem we use
cosmology-independent data set and Bayesian statistics to impose constraints on
the model parameters. We observe that a negative value for the parameter
$\alpha$ is favoured if we adopt a flat Universe and the estimated value of the
parameter $H_{0}$ is lower than that found in literature.
