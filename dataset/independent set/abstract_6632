We will present a relation between real equiangular frames and certain
special sets in groups which we call signature sets and show that many
equiangular frames arise in this manner. Then we will define quasi-signature
sets and will examine equiangular frames associated to these subsets of groups.
We will extend these results to complex equiangular frames where the inner
product between any pair of vectors is a common multiple of a cube root of
unity and exhibit equiangular frames that arise from groups in this manner.
