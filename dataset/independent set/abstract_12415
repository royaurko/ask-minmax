Consider a system of independent random walks in the discrete torus with
creation-annihilation of particles and possible explosion of the total number
of particles in finite time. Rescaling space and rates for
diffusion/creation/annihilation of particles, we obtain a stong law of large
numbers for the density of particles in the supremum norm. The limiting object
is a classical solution to the semilinear heat equation u_t =u_{xx} + f(u). If
f(u)=u^p, 1<p \le 3, we also obtain a law of large numbers for the explosion
time.
