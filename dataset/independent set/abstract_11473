We present a simple and low-cost implementation of a fast electronic
coincidence detector based on PECL logic with a TTL-compatible interface. The
detector has negligible dead time and the coincidence window is adjustable with
a minimum width of 1 ns. Coincidence measurements of two independent sources of
Bose-Einstein distributed photocounts are presented using different coincidence
window widths.
