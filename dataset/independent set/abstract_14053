We are interested in existence results for second order differential
inclusions, involving finite number of unilateral constraints in an abstract
framework. These constraints are described by a set-valued operator, more
precisely a proximal normal cone to a time-dependent set. Moreover we extend a
numerical scheme, introduced in [8] and proved a convergence result. We propose
applications in modelling inelastic collisions between rigid particles too.
