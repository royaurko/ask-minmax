This paper presents a non-interleaving denotational semantics for the
?-calculus. The basic idea is to define a notion of test where the outcome is
not only whether a given process passes a given test, but also in how many
different ways it can pass it. More abstractly, the set of possible outcomes
for tests forms a semiring, and the set of process interpretations appears as a
module over this semiring, in which basic syntactic constructs are affine
operators. This notion of test leads to a trace semantics in which traces are
partial orders, in the style of Mazurkiewicz traces, extended with readiness
information. Our construction has standard may- and must-testing as special
cases.
