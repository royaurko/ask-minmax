We give the cumulative distribution functions, the expected values, and the
moments of weighted lattice polynomials when regarded as real functions of
independent random variables. Since weighted lattice polynomial functions
include ordinary lattice polynomial functions and, particularly, order
statistics, our results encompass the corresponding formulas for these
particular functions. We also provide an application to the reliability
analysis of coherent systems.
