In this paper, we provide some results related to the $\Delta_2$-condition of
Musielak-Orlicz functions and $\varphi$-families of probability distributions,
which are modeled on Musielak-Orlicz spaces. We show that if two
$\varphi$-families are modeled on Musielak-Orlicz spaces generated by
Musielak-Orlicz functions satisfying the $\Delta_{2}$-condition, then these
$\varphi$-families are equal as sets. We also investigate the behavior of the
normalizing function near the boundary of the set on which a $\varphi$-family
is defined.
