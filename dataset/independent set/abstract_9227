Transverse mass and rapidity distributions for charged pions, charged kaons,
protons and antiprotons are reported for sqrt{s_NN}=200 GeV pp and Au+Au
collisions at RHIC. The transverse mass distributions are rapidity independent
within |y|<0.5, consistent with a boost-invariant system in this rapidity
interval. Spectral shapes and relative particle yields are similar in pp and
peripheral Au+Au collisions and change smoothly to central Au+Au collisions. No
centrality dependence was observed in the kaon and antiproton production rates
relative to the pion production rate from medium-central to central collisions.
Chemical and kinetic equilibrium model fits to our data reveal strong radial
flow and relatively long duration from chemical to kinetic freeze-out in
central Au+Au collisions. The chemical freeze-out temperature appears to be
independent of initial conditions at RHIC energies.
