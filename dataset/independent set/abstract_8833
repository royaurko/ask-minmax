We introduce the package Posets for Macaulay2. This package provides a data
structure and the necessary methods for working with partially ordered sets,
also called posets. In particular, the package implements methods to enumerate
many commonly studied classes of posets, perform operations on posets, and
calculate various invariants associated to posets.
