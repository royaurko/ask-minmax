Adiabatic radio frequency (RF) potentials are powerful tools for creating
advanced trapping geometries for ultra-cold atoms. While the basic theory of RF
trapping is well understood, studies of more complicated setups involving
multiple resonant frequencies in the limit where their effects cannot be
treated independently are rare. Here we present an approach based on Floquet
theory and show that it offers significant corrections to existing models when
two RF frequencies are near degenerate. Furthermore it has no restrictions on
the dimension, the number of frequencies or the orientation of the RF fields.
We show that the added degrees of freedom can, for example, be used to create a
potential that allows for easy creation of ring vortex solitons.
