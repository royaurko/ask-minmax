In this work, we first define intuitionistic fuzzy parametrized soft sets
(intuitionistic FP-soft sets) and study some of their properties. We then
introduce an adjustable approaches to intuitionistic FP-soft sets based
decision making. We also give an example which shows that they can be
successfully applied to problems that contain uncertainties.
