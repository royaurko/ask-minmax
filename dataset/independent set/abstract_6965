A set P of points in R^2 is n-universal, if every planar graph on n vertices
admits a plane straight-line embedding on P. Answering a question by Kobourov,
we show that there is no n-universal point set of size n, for any n>=15.
Conversely, we use a computer program to show that there exist universal point
sets for all n<=10 and to enumerate all corresponding order types. Finally, we
describe a collection G of 7'393 planar graphs on 35 vertices that do not admit
a simultaneous geometric embedding without mapping, that is, no set of 35
points in the plane supports a plane straight-line embedding of all graphs in
G.
