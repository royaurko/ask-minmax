In this note we study the endomorphisms of certain Banach algebras of
infinitely differentiable functions on compact plane sets, associated with
weight sequences M. These algebras were originally studied by Dales, Davie and
McClure.
  In a previous paper this problem was solved in the case of the unit interval
for many weights M. Here we investigate the extent to which the methods used
previously apply to general compact plane sets, and introduce some new methods.
In particular, we obtain many results for the case of the closed unit disc.
