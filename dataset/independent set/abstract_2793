Loop Quantum Gravity is a background independent, nonperturbative approach to
the quantization of General Relativity. Its application to models of interest
in cosmology and astrophysics, known as Loop Quantum Cosmology, has led to new
and exciting views of the gravitational phenomena that took place in the early
universe, or that occur in spacetime regions where Einstein's theory predicts
singularities. We provide a brief introduction to the bases of Loop Quantum
Cosmology and summarize the most important results obtained in homogeneous
scenarios. These results include a mechanism to avoid the cosmological Big Bang
singularity and replace it with a Big Bounce, as well as the existence of
processes which favor inflation. We also discuss the extension of the frame of
Loop Quantum Cosmology to inhomogeneous settings.
