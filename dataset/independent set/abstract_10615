Spin-orbit coupled systems generally break the spin rotation symmetry.
However, for a model with equal Rashba and Dresselhauss coupling constant (the
ReD model), and for the $[110]$ Dresselhauss model, a new type of SU(2) spin
rotation symmetry is discovered. This symmetry is robust against
spin-independent disorder and interactions, and is generated by operators whose
wavevector depends on the coupling strength. It renders the spin lifetime
infinite at this wavevector, giving rise to a Persistent Spin Helix (PSH). We
obtain the spin fluctuation dynamics at, and away, from the symmetry point, and
suggest experiments to observe the PSH.
