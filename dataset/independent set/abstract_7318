In the Engel group with its Carnot group structure we study subsets of
locally finite subRiemannian perimeter and possessing constant subRiemannian
normal.
  We prove the rectifiability of such sets: more precisely we show that, in
some specific coordinates, they are upper-graphs of entire Lipschitz functions
(with respect to the Euclidean distance). However we find that, when they are
written as intrinsic upper-graphs with respect to the direction of the normal,
then the function defining the set might even fail to be continuous.
Nevertheless, we can prove that one can always find other horizontal directions
for which the set is the upper-graph of a function that is Lipschitz-continuous
with respect to the intrinsic distance (and in particular H\"older-continuous
for the Euclidean distance).
  We further discuss a PDE characterization of the class of all sets with
constant horizontal normal.
  Finally, we show that our rectifiability argument extends to the case of
filiform groups of the first kind.
