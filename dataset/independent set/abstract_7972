We have performed a search for muon neutrinos from dark matter annihilation
in the center of the Sun with the 79-string configuration of the IceCube
neutrino telescope. For the first time, the DeepCore sub-array is included in
the analysis, lowering the energy threshold and extending the search to the
austral summer. The 317 days of data collected between June 2010 and May 2011
are consistent with the expected background from atmospheric muons and
neutrinos. Upper limits are therefore set on the dark matter annihilation rate,
with conversions to limits on spin-dependent and spin-independent WIMP-proton
cross-sections for WIMP masses in the range 20 - 5000 GeV. These are the most
stringent spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross-sections limits to date above 35
GeV.
