A trivariate Weibull survival model using competing risks concept is applied
on studying recidivism of committing 3 types of crimes - sex, violent and
others. The assumption of independence of time to commit each type of crimes is
relaxed so that the association of the time to recidivism between any two types
of crimes can be evaluated. We found that the correlation of time to recidivism
between sex crimes and violent crimes are more correlated than other pairs.
Probability of experiencing a charged arrest of other crimes is greater than a
charged arrest of violent crimes followed by a charged arrest of sex crimes for
an individual after release.
