For spacetimes with timelike Killing fields, we introduce a
"Fermi-Walker-Killing" coordinate system and use it to prove a Liouville
Theorem for an appropriate volume element of phase space for a statistical
mechanical system of particles. We derive an exact relativistic formula for the
Helmholtz free energy of an ideal gas and compare it, for a class of
spacetimes, to its Newtonian analog, derived both independently and as the
Newtonian limit of our formula. We also find the relativistic thermodynamic
equation of state. Specific examples are given in Kerr spacetime.
