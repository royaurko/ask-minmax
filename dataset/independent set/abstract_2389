The problem of hadronic cluster production in quark-hadron phase transition
in heavy-ion collisions is studied by cellular automata. Previous result on the
scaling behavior is extended to include variation in the drift speed. It is
also shown that coalescence is more important than growth in generating
scaling. A new set of rules is adopted to free the clusters from being rigid.
It is found that the scaling exponent is independent of not only the shapes of
the clusters, but also the probability of breakup of the clusters. The
universality of the scaling behavior is now extended to a wide range of
physical properties characterizing the geometry and dynamics of the phase
transition process.
