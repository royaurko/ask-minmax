A model-independent treatment of dark-matter particle elastic scattering has
been developed, yielding the most general interaction for WIMP-nucleon
low-energy scattering, and the resulting amplitude has been embedded in the
nucleus, taking into account the selection rules imposed by parity and
time-reversal. One finds that, in contrast to the usual
spin-independent/spin-dependent (SI/SD) formulation, the resulting cross
section contains six independent nuclear response functions, three of which are
associated with possible velocity-dependent interactions. We find that current
experiments are four orders of magnitude more sensitive to derivative couplings
than is apparent in the standard SI/SD treatment, which necessarily associates
such interactions with cross sections proportional to the square of the WIMP
velocity relative to the nuclear center of mass.
