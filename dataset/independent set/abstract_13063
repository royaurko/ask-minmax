Let A be a commutative unital algebra over an algebraically closed field k of
characteristic not equal to 2, whose generators form a finite-dimensional
subspace V, with no nontrivial homogeneous quadratic relations. Let Q be a Hopf
algebra that coacts on A inner-faithfully, while leaving V invariant. We prove
that Q must be commutative when either: (i) the coaction preserves a
non-degenerate bilinear form on V; or (ii) Q is co-semisimple,
finite-dimensional, and char(k)=0.
