We propose a new one-sample test for normality in a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). Namely, we test the null-hypothesis of belonging to a
given family of Gaussian distributions. Hence our procedure may be applied
either to test data for normality or to test parameters (mean and covariance)
if data are assumed Gaussian. Our test is based on the same principle as the
MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy) which is usually used for two-sample tests such
as homogeneity or independence testing. Our method makes use of a special kind
of parametric bootstrap (typical of goodness-of-fit tests) which is
computationally more efficient than standard parametric bootstrap. Moreover, an
upper bound for the Type-II error highlights the dependence on influential
quantities. Experiments illustrate the practical improvement allowed by our
test in high-dimensional settings where common normality tests are known to
fail. We also consider an application to covariance rank selection through a
sequential procedure.
