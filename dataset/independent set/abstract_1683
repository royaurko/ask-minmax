A subset A of {0,1,...,n} is said to be a 2-additive basis for {1,2,...,n} if
each j in {1,2,...,n} can be written as j=x+y, x,y in A, x<=y. If we pick each
integer in {0,1,...,n} independently with probability p=p_n tending to 0, thus
getting a random set A, what is the probability that we have obtained a
2-additive basis? We address this question when the target sum-set is
[(1-alpha)n,(1+alpha)n] (or equivalently [alpha n, (2-alpha) n]) for some
0<alpha<1. Under either model, the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation
is used, in conjunction with Janson's inequalities, to tease out a very sharp
threshold for the emergence of a 2-additive basis. Generalizations to
k-additive bases are then given.
