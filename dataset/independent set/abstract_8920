We will construct an algebraic weak factorisation system on 01-substitution
sets such that the R-algebras are precisely the Kan fibrations together with a
choice of Kan filling operation. The proof is based on Garner's small object
argument for algebraic weak factorization systems. In order to ensure the proof
is valid constructively, rather than applying the general small object
argument, we give a direct proof based on the same ideas.
