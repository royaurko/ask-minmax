We consider a communication network consisting of nodes and directed edges
that connect the nodes. Each edge receives a symbol from a node and outputs a
symbol to a node in each time slot. An edge (l,i) terminating at node i is said
to incur zero delay on an edge (i,j) originating from node i if the following
holds in each time slot: Node i receives the symbol output from (l,i) before
encoding the symbol to be transmitted on (i,j). Otherwise, (l,i) is said to
incur a delay on (i,j). In the classical model, every edge incurs a unit delay
on every other edge and the cut-set bound is a well-known outer bound on the
capacity region. In this paper, we investigate the multimessage multicast
network (MMN) consisting of independent channels under an edge-delay model
where an edge may incur zero delay on some other edges. Our result reveals that
the capacity region of the MMN with independent channels and zero-delay edges
lies within the classical cut-set bound despite a violation of the unit-delay
assumption. In addition, we fully characterize under our edge-delay model the
capacity regions of the MMN with independent DMCs and the MMN with independent
AWGNs.
