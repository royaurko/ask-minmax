This paper presents and discusses the application of blind source separation
to astrophysical data obtained with the WMAP satellite. Blind separation
permits to identify and isolate a component compatible with CMB emission, and
to measure both its spatial power spectrum and its emission law. Both are found
to be compatible with the present concordance cosmological model. This
application demonstrates the usefulness of blind ICA for cosmological
applications.
