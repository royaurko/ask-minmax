Impact of chosen behavioural factors on imprecision of present value is
discussed here. The formal model of behavioural present value is offered as a
result of this discussion. Behavioural present value is described here by fuzzy
set. These considerations were illustrated by means of extensive numerical case
study. Finally there are shown that in proposed model the return rate is given,
as a fuzzy probabilistic set.
