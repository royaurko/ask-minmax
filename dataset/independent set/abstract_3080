In this paper, we propose a sparse recovery algorithm called
detection-directed (DD) sparse estimation using Bayesian hypothesis test (BHT)
and belief propagation (BP). In this framework, we consider the use of
sparse-binary sensing matrices which has the tree-like property and the
sampled-message approach for the implementation of BP.
  The key idea behind the proposed algorithm is that the recovery takes
DD-estimation structure consisting of two parts: support detection and signal
value estimation. BP and BHT perform the support detection, and an MMSE
estimator finds the signal values using the detected support set. The proposed
algorithm provides noise-robustness against measurement noise beyond the
conventional MAP approach, as well as a solution to remove quantization effect
by the sampled-message based BP independently of memory size for the message
sampling.
  We explain how the proposed algorithm can have the aforementioned
characteristics via exemplary discussion. In addition, our experiments validate
such superiority of the proposed algorithm, compared to recent algorithms under
noisy setup. Interestingly the experimental results show that performance of
the proposed algorithm approaches that of the oracle estimator as SNR becomes
higher.
