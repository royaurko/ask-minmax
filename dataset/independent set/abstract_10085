It is well known that if a function from set A to set B has a right inverse
then the function is a surjection and the right inverse is an injection. For
finite sets, the number of functions, injections, and surjections can also be
counted. Relations generalize functions: do similar results exist for
relations? This paper proves several new results concerning binary relations.
For finite sets, we derive formulas for the number of right total, right
unique, left total, and left unique relations. We also provide formulas that
count the number of relations that are both right unique and left unique; right
unique and right total; and left unique and left total. We conclude by
discussing the probability that a relation selected at random is right unique
or right total.
