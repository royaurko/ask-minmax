It is shown that the density of the values set {Tau(n): n <= x} of the nth
coefficients Tau(n) of the discriminant function Delta(z), a cusp form of level
N = 1 and weight k = 12, has the lower bound #{Tau(n): n <= x} >> x/log x. The
currently known density is #{Tau(n) : n <= x} >> x^(1/2+o(1)), and the expected
density is #{Tau(n) : n <= x} ~ x. The solutions set of the equation Tau(p) = 0
for all primes p => 2, which arises as a singular case of this analysis, is
discussed within.
