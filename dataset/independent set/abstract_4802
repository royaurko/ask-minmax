An r.e. set $A$ is speedable if for every recursive function, there exists a
program enumerating membership in $A$ faster, by the desired recursive factor,
on infinitely many integers. We construct a speedable set that cannot be split
into speedable sets. This solves a question of B\"{a}uerle and Remmel.
