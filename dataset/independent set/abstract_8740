In this paper we provide examples of topological dynamical systems having
either finite or countable scrambled sets. In particular we study conditions
for the existence of Li-Yorke, asymptotic and distal pairs in constant--length
substitution dynamical systems. Starting from a circle rotation we also
construct a dynamical system having Li--Yorke pairs, none of which is
recurrent.
