The canonical quantization is performed at a light-front surface for the
SU(N) Yang-Mills theory. The Weyl gauge is imposed as a gauge condition. The
suitable parameterization is chosen for the transverse gauge field components
in order to have Dirac brackets independent of interactions. The generating
functional is defined for the perturbation theory and it is shown to coincide
with its equal-time counterpart.
