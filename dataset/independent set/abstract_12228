We consider a general class of super-additive scores measuring the similarity
of two independent sequences of $n$ i.i.d. letters from a finite alphabet. Our
object of interest is the mean score by letter $l_n$. By the subadditivity
$l_n$ is nondecreasing and converges to a limit $l$. We give a simple method of
bounding the difference $l-l_n$ and obtaining the rate of convergence. Our
result generalizes a previous result of Alexander, where only the special case
of the longest common subsequence is considered.
