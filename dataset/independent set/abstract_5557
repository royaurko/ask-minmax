Local scaling of a set means that in a neighborhood of a point the structure
of the set can be mapped into a finer scale structure of the set. These
scaling transformations are compact sets of locally affine (that is: with
uniformly $\alpha$-H\"older continuous derivatives) contractions. In this
setting, without any assumption on the spacing of these contractions such as
the open set condition, we show that the measure of the set is an upper
semi-continuous of the scaling transformation in the $C^0$-topology. With a
restriction on the 'non-conformality' (see below) the Hausdorff dimension is
lower semi-continous function in the $C^{1}$-topology. We include some
examples to show that neither of these notions is continuous.
