Despite the common usage of a canonical, data-independent, hemodynamic
response function (HRF), it is known that the shape of the HRF varies across
brain regions and subjects. This suggests that a data-driven estimation of this
function could lead to more statistical power when modeling BOLD fMRI data.
However, unconstrained estimation of the HRF can yield highly unstable results
when the number of free parameters is large. We develop a method for the joint
estimation of activation and HRF using a rank constraint causing the estimated
HRF to be equal across events/conditions, yet permitting it to be different
across voxels. Model estimation leads to an optimization problem that we
propose to solve with an efficient quasi-Newton method exploiting fast gradient
computations. This model, called GLM with Rank-1 constraint (R1-GLM), can be
extended to the setting of GLM with separate designs which has been shown to
improve decoding accuracy in brain activity decoding experiments. We compare 10
different HRF modeling methods in terms of encoding and decoding score in two
different datasets. Our results show that the R1-GLM model significantly
outperforms competing methods in both encoding and decoding settings,
positioning it as an attractive method both from the points of view of accuracy
and computational efficiency.
