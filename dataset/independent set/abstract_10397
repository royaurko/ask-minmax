The thermal conductivity of YBa_2Cu_3O_6.9 was measured at low temperatures
in untwinned single crystals with concentrations of Zn impurities from 0 to 3%
of Cu. A linear term kappa_0/T = 0.19 mW/K^2.cm is clearly resolved as T -> 0,
and found to be virtually independent of Zn concentration. The existence of
this residual normal fluid strongly validates the basic theory of transport in
unconventional superconductors. Moreover, the observed universal behavior is in
quantitative agreement with calculations for a gap function of d-wave symmetry.
