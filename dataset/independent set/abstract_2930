Using the extended Poincar\'{e}-Lighthill-Kuo (PLK) reductive perturbation
method, which incorporates the phase-shift variations, it is shown that common
features on propagation and head-on collisions of ion-acoustic waves exist for
a magnetized plasmas of different inertial-less particle distributions. For
instance it is remarked that, the soliton amplitude is always independent of
magnetic field strength while strictly depends on its angle regarding the
propagation direction. Both types of solitons (compressive or rarefactive) are
shown to exist which are defined through the critical angle $\gamma=\pi/2$ or
other critical values depending on plasma fractional parameters. These critical
plasma parameter values also define the sign of head-on collision phase shift.
Furthermore, it is proved that for a given set of plasma parameters there is
always a relative angle of propagation regarding to that of the magnetic-field
for which the soliton width is maximum. Current findings applies to a wide
range of magnetized plasmas including those containing background dust
ingredients or two-temperature inertial-less particles and may be used to study
laboratory or astrophysical magnetoplasmas.
