Noam Elkies and Everett Howe independently noticed a certain elegant product
formula for the multiple integral \int_R \prod_{1 \le i < j \le k} (x_j-x_i)
dx_1 \cdots dx_k, where the region $R$ is the set of $k$-tuples satisfying $0 <
x_1 < \cdots < x_k < 1$. Later this formula turned out to be a special case of
a formula of Selberg.
  We prove an apparently different generalization
  \int_R \det\left(x_i^{a_j-1}\right)dx_1 \cdots dx_k =
  {\prod_{1 \le i<j \le k}(a_j-a_i)\over
  \prod_{1 \le i \le k} a_i \prod_{1 \le i<j \le k} (a_j+a_i)}.
  The key tool is a limiting form of a remarkable identity of Okada for summing
the k by k minors of an n by k matrix.
