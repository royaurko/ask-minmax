Evenly convex sets in a topological vector space are defined as the
intersection of a family of open half spaces. We introduce a generalization of
this concept in the conditional framework and provide a generalized version of
the bipolar theorem. This notion is then applied to obtain the dual
representation of conditionally evenly quasi-convex maps.
