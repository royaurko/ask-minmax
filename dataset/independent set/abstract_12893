We consider the Modified Craig-Sneyd (MCS) scheme which forms a prominent
time stepping method of the Alternating Direction Implicit type for
multidimensional time-dependent convection-diffusion equations with mixed
spatial derivative terms. Such equations arise often, notably, in the field of
financial mathematics. In this paper a first convergence theorem for the MCS
scheme is proved where the obtained bound on the global temporal discretization
errors has the essential property that it is independent of the (arbitrarily
small) spatial mesh width from the semidiscretization. The obtained theorem is
directly pertinent to two-dimensional convection-diffusion equations with mixed
derivative term. Numerical experiments are provided that illustrate our result.
