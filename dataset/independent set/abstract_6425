Abelian mechanism of non-Abelian color confinement is observed in a
gauge-independent way by high precision lattice Monte Carlo simulations in
gluodynamics. An Abelian gauge field is extracted with no gauge-fixing. A
static quark-antiquark potential derived from Abelian Polyakov loop correlators
gives us the same string tension as the non-Abelian one. The Hodge
decomposition of the Abelian Polyakov loop correlator to the regular photon and
the singular monopole parts also reveals that only the monopole part is
responsible for the string tension. The investigation of the flux-tube profile
then shows that Abelian electric fields defined in an arbitrary color direction
are squeezed by monopole supercurrents with the same color direction, and the
quantitative features of flux squeezing are consistent with those observed
previously after Abelian projections with gauge fixing. Gauge independence of
Abelian and monopole dominance strongly supports that the mechanism of
non-Abelian color confinement is due to the Abelian dual Meissner effect.
