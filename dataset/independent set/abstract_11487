We investigate the dynamical properties of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals
of human in sleep. By using a modified random walk method, We demonstrate that
the scale-invariance is embedded in EEG signals after a detrending procedure.
Further more, we study the dynamical evolution of probability density function
(PDF) of the detrended EEG signals by nonextensive statistical modeling. It
displays scale-independent property, which is markedly different from the
turbulent-like scale-dependent PDF evolution.
