We discuss the higher superspin superfield formalism of Kuzenko et al from
the basis of a unified treatment of an unconstrained spinorial superfield
prepotential, its action and a restricted set of gauge transformations. We
recover previous results as distinct limits of this unified treatment and give
the first derivations of the complete set of Bianchi identities associated with
these equations.
