The next to leading order (NLO) contribution of the generalized finite size
mass shift formula for an interacting two stable particle system in a periodic
$L^{3}$ box is discriminated with maintaining its model independent structure
and validity to all orders in perturbation theory. The influence of the NLO
contribution is examined for the nucleon mass shift in the realistic
nucleon-pion system.
