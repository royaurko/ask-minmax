A generalization of the term "generalized Clifford algebras" (as appears in
papers on advances in applied Clifford algebras) is introduced. This algebra is
studied by means of structure theory of central simple algebras. A graph
theoretical approach is proposed for studying the generating set of this
algebra in case where the prime number under discussion is three. Finally, it
is shown how to obtain solutions in to the equation $\alpha Y^3=\alpha
X_1^3+\beta X_2^3+\alpha^2 \beta^2 X_3^3$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\rho]$ where $\rho$ is
the primitive third root of unity.
