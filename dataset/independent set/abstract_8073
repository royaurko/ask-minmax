We investigate the horofunction boundary of the Hilbert geometry defined on
an arbitrary finite-dimensional bounded convex domain D. We determine its set
of Busemann points, which are those points that are the limits of
`almost-geodesics'. In addition, we show that any sequence of points converging
to a point in the horofunction boundary also converges in the usual sense to a
point in the Euclidean boundary of D. We prove that all horofunctions are
Busemann points if and only if the set of extreme sets of the polar of D is
closed in the Painleve-Kuratowski topology.
