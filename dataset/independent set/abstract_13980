Recently, Li. \emph{et. al.} [Int. J. Theor. Phys., 48, 2777 (2009)] derived
a necessary and sufficient condition for LOCC cloning of a set of bipartite
orthogonal partially but equally entangled state. We demonstrates that, the
result is based on a wrong observation regarding a set of non-maximally
entangled states with equal entanglement. We also provide a simple example in
favor of our comment.
