Osculating spaces of decomposable scrolls (of any genus and not necessarily
normal)are studied and their inflectional loci are related to those of their
generating curves by using systematically an idea introduced by Piene and
Sacchiero in the setting of rational normal scrolls. In this broader setting
the extra components of the second discriminant locus - deriving from flexes -
are investigated and a new class of uninflected surface scrolls is presented
and characterized. Further properties related to osculation are discussed for
(not necessarily decomposable) scrolls.
