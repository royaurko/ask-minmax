In the random case setting, scrambled polynomial lattice rules as discussed
in \cite{BD10} enjoy more favourable strong tractablility properties than
scrambled digital nets. This short note discusses the application of scrambled
polynomial lattice rules to infinite-dimensional integration. In
\cite{HMGNR10}, infinite-dimensional integration in the random case setting was
examined in detail, and results based on scrambled digital nets were presented.
Exploiting these improved strong tractability properties of scrambled
polynomial lattice rules and making use of the analysis presented in
\cite{HMGNR10}, we improve on the results that were achieved using scrambled
digital nets.
