We prove that the category of faded cosheaves in Set over a sober topological
space $(B,\Omega)$ is equivalent to a category Sett$(B,\Omega)$ having the same
class of objects as Set$ / B$ has, but generally a wider class of morphisms. We
also prove the converse: if each cosheaf over $T_0$-space $(B,\Omega)$ is
isomorphic to the cosheaf of tubes of an appropriate map ranging in
$(B,\Omega)$, then $(B,\Omega)$ is sober.
