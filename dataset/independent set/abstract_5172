A dictionary is a set of finite words over some finite alphabet X. The
omega-power of a dictionary V is the set of infinite words obtained by infinite
concatenation of words in V. Lecomte studied in [Omega-powers and descriptive
set theory, JSL 2005] the complexity of the set of dictionaries whose
associated omega-powers have a given complexity. In particular, he considered
the sets $W({\bf\Si}^0_{k})$ (respectively, $W({\bf\Pi}^0_{k})$,
$W({\bf\Delta}_1^1)$) of dictionaries $V \subseteq 2^\star$ whose omega-powers
are ${\bf\Si}^0_{k}$-sets (respectively, ${\bf\Pi}^0_{k}$-sets, Borel sets). In
this paper we first establish a new relation between the sets
$W({\bf\Sigma}^0_{2})$ and $W({\bf\Delta}_1^1)$, showing that the set
$W({\bf\Delta}_1^1)$ is "more complex" than the set $W({\bf\Sigma}^0_{2})$. As
an application we improve the lower bound on the complexity of
$W({\bf\Delta}_1^1)$ given by Lecomte. Then we prove that, for every integer
$k\geq 2$, (respectively, $k\geq 3$) the set of dictionaries
$W({\bf\Pi}^0_{k+1})$ (respectively, $W({\bf\Si}^0_{k+1})$) is "more complex"
than the set of dictionaries $W({\bf\Pi}^0_{k})$ (respectively,
$W({\bf\Si}^0_{k})$) .
