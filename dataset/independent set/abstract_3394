Building on classical work of Deshouillers and Iwaniec and recent work of
Blomer and Mili\'cevi\'c, we prove a bound for quintilinear sums of Kloosterman
sums, with congruence conditions on the "smooth" summation variables. We employ
this estimate to obtain power-saving in the dispersion method, in the setting
of Bombieri, Fouvry, Friedlander and Iwaniec.
  As a consequence, assuming the Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet
$L$-functions, we prove a power-saving error term in the Titchmarsh divisor
problem of estimating $\sum_{p\leq x}\tau(p-1)$. Unconditionally, we isolate
the possible contribution of Siegel zeroes, showing it is always negative.
Extending work of Fouvry and Tenenbaum, we obtain power-saving in the
asymptotic formula for $\sum_{n\leq x}\tau_k(n)\tau(n+1)$, reproving a result
announced by Bykovski\u{i} and Vinogradov by a different method. The gain in
the exponent is shown to be independent of $k$ if a generalized Lindel\"of
hypothesis is assumed.
