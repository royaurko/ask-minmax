A Gaussian correlation inequality is proven which generalises results of
Schechtman, Schlumprecht & Zinn, Li and Shao. Letting $\gamma$ be the standard
Gaussian measure on $R^n$, concrete implications of this inequality are that
the inequality $\gamma(A) \gamma(B) \le (4/3)^{n/2} \gamma(A \cap B)$ holds for
all symmetric convex sets $A, B$, and that $\gamma(A) \gamma(B) \le \gamma(A
\cap B)$ holds for all symmetric convex subsets $A, B$ of the Euclidean unit
ball of radius $0.374 \sqrt{n}$.
