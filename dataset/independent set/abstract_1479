Kernel random matrices have attracted a lot of interest in recent years, from
both practical and theoretical standpoints. Most of the theoretical work so far
has focused on the case were the data is sampled from a low-dimensional
structure. Very recently, the first results concerning kernel random matrices
with high-dimensional input data were obtained, in a setting where the data was
sampled from a genuinely high-dimensional structure---similar to standard
assumptions in random matrix theory. In this paper, we consider the case where
the data is of the type "information${}+{}$noise." In other words, each
observation is the sum of two independent elements: one sampled from a
"low-dimensional" structure, the signal part of the data, the other being
high-dimensional noise, normalized to not overwhelm but still affect the
signal. We consider two types of noise, spherical and elliptical. In the
spherical setting, we show that the spectral properties of kernel random
matrices can be understood from a new kernel matrix, computed only from the
signal part of the data, but using (in general) a slightly different kernel.
The Gaussian kernel has some special properties in this setting. The elliptical
setting, which is important from a robustness standpoint, is less prone to easy
interpretation.
