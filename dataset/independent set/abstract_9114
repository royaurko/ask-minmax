We use the chiral quark-soliton model to identify all symmetry breaking terms
linear in $m_{s}$ and investigate the strange magnetic moment in a
``model-independent'' way. Assuming hedgehog symmetry and employing the
collective quantization, we obtain the most general expression for the
flavor-singlet and flavor-octet magnetic moments in terms of seven independent
parameters. Having fitted these parameters to the experimental magnetic moments
of the octet baryons, we show that the strange magnetic moment turns out to be
positive. The best fit obtained by minimizing $\chi^2$ assuming 15% theoretical
accuracy yields: $\mu^{({\rm s})}_{N} = (0.41 \pm 0.18) \mu_{N}$.
