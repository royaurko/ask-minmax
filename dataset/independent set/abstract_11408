We describe a new test for determining whether a given deterministic
dynamical system is chaotic or nonchaotic. (This is an alternative to the usual
approach of computing the largest Lyapunov exponent.) Our method is a 0-1 test
for chaos (the output is a 0 signifying nonchaotic or a 1 signifying chaotic)
and is independent of the dimension of the dynamical system. Moreover, the
underlying equations need not be known. The test works equally well for
continuous and discrete time. We give examples for an ordinary differential
equation, a partial differential equation and for a map.
