We derive an asymptotic expansion for the subgroup of arbitrary Fuchsian
groups and some other classes of large groups. Moreover, the main conjecture
for Random Walks on symmetric groups is established in full generality. Both
problems require subtle estimates of character values and root number
multiplicities for symmetric groups, which are also of independent interest.
