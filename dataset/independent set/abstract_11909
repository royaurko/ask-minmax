An extension to higher dimensions of the Bel-Debever characterization of the
Weyl tensor is considered. This provides algebraic conditions that uniquely
determine the multiplicity of a Weyl aligned null direction (WAND), and thus
the principal Weyl type, in a frame independent way. The specification of
several "subtypes" is also encompassed by the criteria. We further comment on a
Cartan-like geometrical interpretation of WANDs in terms of their invariance
properties under parallel transport around infinitesimal loops. As a result,
restrictions on the algebraic types permitted in spacetimes that admit a
recurrent/covariantly constant vector field are outlined.
