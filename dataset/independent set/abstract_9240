The relation among the volume coefficient $K$(=incompressibility of the
nuclear matter), the Coulomb coefficient $K_c$, and the volume-symmetry
coefficient $K_{vs}$ of the nucleus incompressibility are studied in the
framework of the relativistic mean field theory with the excluded volume
effects of the nucleons, under the assumption of the scaling model. It is found
that $K= 300\pm 50$MeV is necessary to account for the empirical values of $K$,
$K_c$, and $K_{vs}$, simultaneously, as is in the case of the point-like
nucleons. The result is independent on the detail descriptions of the potential
of the $\sigma$-meson self-interaction and is almost independent on the
excluded volume of the nucleons.
