We point out the simple reversibility between the fundamental neutrino mixing
parameters in vacuum and their effective counterparts in matter. The former can
therefore be expressed in terms of the latter, allowing more straightforward
extraction of the genuine lepton mixing quantities from a variety of
long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. In addition to the
parametrization-independent results, we present the formulas based on the
standard parametrization of the lepton flavor mixing matrix and give a typical
numerical illustration.
