We show that for critical site percolation on the triangular lattice two new
observables have conformally invariant scaling limits. In particular the
expected number of clusters separating two pairs of points converges to an
explicit conformal invariant. Our proof is independent of earlier results and
$SLE$ techniques, and in principle should provide a new approach to
establishing conformal invariance of percolation.
