The bootstrap variance estimate is widely used in semiparametric inferences.
However, its theoretical validity is a well known open problem. In this paper,
we provide a {\em first} theoretical study on the bootstrap moment estimates in
semiparametric models. Specifically, we establish the bootstrap moment
consistency of the Euclidean parameter which immediately implies the
consistency of $t$-type bootstrap confidence set. It is worth pointing out that
the only additional cost to achieve the bootstrap moment consistency in
contrast with the distribution consistency is to simply strengthen the $L_1$
maximal inequality condition required in the latter to the $L_p$ maximal
inequality condition for $p\geq 1$. The general $L_p$ multiplier inequality
developed in this paper is also of independent interest. These general
conclusions hold for the bootstrap methods with exchangeable bootstrap weights,
e.g., nonparametric bootstrap and Bayesian bootstrap. Our general theory is
illustrated in the celebrated Cox regression model.
