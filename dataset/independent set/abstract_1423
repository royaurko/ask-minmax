We study the quadratic invariants of the elasticity tensor in the framework
of its unique irreducible decomposition. The key point is that this
decomposition generates the direct sum reduction of the elasticity tensor
space. The corresponding subspaces are completely independent and even
orthogonal relative to the Euclidean (Frobenius) scalar product. We construct a
basis set of seven quadratic invariants that emerge in a natural and systematic
way. Moreover, the completeness of this basis and the independence of the basis
tensors follow immediately from the direct sum representation of the elasticity
tensor space. We define the Cauchy factor of an anisotropic material as a
dimensionless measure of a closeness to a pure Cauchy material and a similar
isotropic factor is as a measure for a closeness of an anisotropic material to
its isotropic prototype. For cubic crystals, these factors are explicitly
displayed and cubic crystal average of an arbitrary elastic material is
derived.
