In this paper, firstly we show that the entropy constants of the number of
independent sets on certain plane lattices are the same as the entropy
constants of the corresponding cylindrical and toroidal lattices. Secondly, we
consider three more complex lattices which can not be handled by a single
transfer matrix as in the plane quadratic lattice case. By introducing the
concept of transfer multiplicity, we obtain the lower and upper bounds of the
entropy constants of crossed quadratic lattice, generalized aztec diamond
lattice and 8-8-4 lattice.
