We count 1/8-BPS states in type IIB string theory on AdS_5 x S^5 background
which carry three independent angular momenta on S^5. These states can be
counted by considering configurations of multiple dual-giant gravitons up to N
in number which share at least four supersymmetries. We map this counting
problem to that of counting the energy eigen states of a system of N bosons in
a 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator. We also count 1/8-BPS states with two
independent non-zero spins in AdS_5 and one non-zero angular momentum on S^5 by
considering configurations of arbitrary number of giant gravitons that share at
least four supersymmetries.
