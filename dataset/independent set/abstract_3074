This paper presents a new approach to the analysis of mixed processes $$ X_t
= B_t + G_t, \quad t\in [0,T], $$ where $B_t$ is a Brownian motion and $G_t$ is
an independent centered Gaussian process. We obtain a new canonical innovation
representation of $X$, using linear filtering theory. When the kernel $$ K(s,t)
= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial s\partial t} E G_t G_s,\quad s\ne t $$ has a weak
singularity on the diagonal, our results generalize the classical innovation
formulas beyond the square integrable setting. For kernels with stronger
singularity, our approach is applicable to processes with additional
"fractional" structure, including the mixed fractional Brownian motion from
mathematical finance. We show how previously known measure equivalence
relations and semimartingale properties follow from our canonical
representation in a unified way, and complement them with new formulas for
Radon-Nikodym densities.
