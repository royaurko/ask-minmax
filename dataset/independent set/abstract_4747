Model independent expressions for all polarization observables in $\mu+p\to
\mu+p$ elastic scattering are obtained, taking into account the lepton mass and
including the two-photon exchange contribution. The spin structure of the
matrix element is parametrized in terms of six independent complex amplitudes,
functions of two independent kinematical variables. General statements about
the influence of the two--photon--exchange terms on the differential cross
section and on polarization observables are given. Polarization effects have
been investigated for the case of a longitudinally polarized lepton beam and
polarized nucleon in the final state.
