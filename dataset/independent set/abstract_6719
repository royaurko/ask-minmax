An open convex set in real projective space is called divisible if there
exists a discrete group of projective automorphisms which acts co-compactly.
There are many examples of such sets and a theorem of Benoist implies that many
of these examples are strictly convex, have $C^1$ boundary, and have word
hyperbolic dividing group. In this paper we study a notion of convexity in
complex projective space and show that the only divisible complex convex sets
with $C^1$ boundary are the projective balls.
