We demonstrate that even under positive partial transpose preserving
operations in an asymptotic setting GHZ and W states are not reversibly
interconvertible. We investigate the structure of minimal reversible
entanglement generating set (MREGS) for tri-partite states under positive
partial transpose (ppt) preserving operations. We demonstrate that the set
consisting of W and EPR states alone cannot be an MREGS. In this context we
prove the surprising result that the relative entropy of entanglement can be
strictly sub-additive for certain pure tri-partite states which is crucial to
keep open the possibility that the set of GHZ-state and EPR states together
constitute an MREGS under ppt-preserving operations.
