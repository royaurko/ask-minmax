We will provide detailed arguments showing that the set of Maxwell equations,
and the corresponding wave equations, do not properly describe the evolution of
electromagnetic wave-fronts. We propose a nonlinear corrected version that is
proven to be far more appropriate for the modellization of electromagnetic
phenomena. The suitability of this approach will soon be evident to the reader,
through a sequence of astonishing congruences, making the model as elegant as
Maxwell's, but with increased chances of development. Actually, the new set of
equations will allow us to explain many open questions, and find links between
electromagnetism and other theories that have been searched for a long time, or
not even imagined.
