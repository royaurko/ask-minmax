The energy of atmospheric neutrinos detected by MACRO was estimated using
multiple coulomb scattering of upward throughgoing muons. This analysis allows
a test of atmospheric neutrino oscillations, relying on the distortion of the
muon energy distribution. These results have been combined with those coming
from the upward throughgoing muon angular distribution only. Both analyses are
independent of the neutrino flux normalization and provide strong evidence,
above the 4 sigma level, in favour of neutrino oscillations.
