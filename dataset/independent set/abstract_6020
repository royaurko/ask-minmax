Applying the concept of matricial freeness which generalizes freeness in free
probability, we have recently studied asymptotic joint distributions of
symmetric blocks of Gaussian random matrices (Gaussian Symmetric Block
Ensemble). This approach gives a block refinement of the fundamental result of
Voiculescu on asymptotic freeness of independent Gaussian random matrices. In
this paper, we show that this framework is natural for constructing a random
matrix model for free Meixner laws. We also demonstrate that the ensemble of
independent matrices of this type is asymptotically conditionally free with
respect to the pair of partial traces.
