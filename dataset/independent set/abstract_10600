We introduce a model for temporally disordered directed percolation in which
the probability of spreading from a vertex $(t,x)$, where $t$ is the time and
$x$ is the spatial coordinate, is independent of $x$ but depends on $t$. Using
a very efficient algorithm we calculate low-density series for bond percolation
on the directed square lattice. Analysis of the series yields estimates for the
critical point $p_c$ and various critical exponents which are consistent with a
continuous change of the critical parameters as the strength of the disorder is
increased.
