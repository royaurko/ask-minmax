For $S$ a subordinator and $\Pi_n$ an independent Poisson process of
intensity $ne^{-x}, x>0,$ we are interested in the number $K_n$ of gaps in the
range of $S$ that are hit by at least one point of $\Pi_n$. Extending previous
studies in \cite{Bernoulli, GPYI, GPYII} we focus on the case when the tail of
the L{\'e}vy measure of $S$ is slowly varying. We view $K_n$ as the terminal
value of a random process ${\cal K}_n$, and provide an asymptotic analysis of
the fluctuations of ${\cal K}_n$, as $n\to\infty$, for a wide spectrum of
situations.
