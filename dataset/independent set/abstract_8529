We study filling sets of simple closed curves on punctured surfaces. In
particular we study lower bounds on the cardinality of sets of curves that fill
and that pairwise intersect at most k times on surfaces with given genus and
number of punctures. We are able to establish orders of growth for even k and
show that for odd k the orders of growth behave differently. We also study the
corresponding questions when one requires that the curves be represented as
systoles on hyperbolic complete finite area surfaces.
