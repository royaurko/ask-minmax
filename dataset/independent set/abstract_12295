We develop new polynomial methods for studying systems of word equations. We
use them to improve some earlier results and to analyze how sizes of systems of
word equations satisfying certain independence properties depend on the lengths
of the equations. These methods give the first nontrivial upper bounds for the
sizes of the systems.
