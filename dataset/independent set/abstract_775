We describe an application of the MultiNest algorithm to gravitational wave
data analysis. MultiNest is a multimodal nested sampling algorithm designed to
efficiently evaluate the Bayesian evidence and return posterior probability
densities for likelihood surfaces containing multiple secondary modes. The
algorithm employs a set of live points which are updated by partitioning the
set into multiple overlapping ellipsoids and sampling uniformly from within
them. This set of live points climbs up the likelihood surface through nested
iso-likelihood contours and the evidence and posterior distributions can be
recovered from the point set evolution. The algorithm is model-independent in
the sense that the specific problem being tackled enters only through the
likelihood computation, and does not change how the live point set is updated.
In this paper, we consider the use of the algorithm for gravitational wave data
analysis by searching a simulated LISA data set containing two non-spinning
supermassive black hole binary signals. The algorithm is able to rapidly
identify all the modes of the solution and recover the true parameters of the
sources to high precision.
