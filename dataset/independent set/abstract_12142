We analyze the blowup (finite-time singularity) in inviscid shell models of
convective turbulence. We show that the blowup exists and its internal
structure undergoes a series of bifurcations under a change of shell model
parameter. Various blowup structures are observed and explained, which vary
from self-similar to periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic regimes. Though the
blowup takes sophisticated forms, its asymptotic small-scale structure is
independent of initial conditions, i.e., universal. Finally, we discuss
implications of the obtained results for the open problems of blowup in
inviscid flows and for the theory of turbulence.
