We show that considering time measured by an observer to be a function of a
cyclical field (an abstract version of a clock) is consistent with Hamilton's
and Lagrange's equations of motion for a one dimensional space manifold. The
derivation may provide a simple understanding of the conventions that are used
in defining the relationship between independent and dependent variables in the
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms. These derivations of the underlying
principles of classical mechanics are steps on the way to discussions of
physical laws and interactions in ZM theory.
