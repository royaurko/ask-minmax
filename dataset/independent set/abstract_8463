In this paper we study the set of Li-Yorke $d$-tuples and its $d$-dimensional
Lebesgue measure for interval maps $T\colon [0,1] \to [0,1]$. If a
topologically mixing $T$ preserves an absolutely continuous probability measure
9with respect to Lebesgue), then the $d$-tuples have Lebesgue full measure, but
if $T$ preserves an infinite absolutely continuous measure, the situation
becomes more interesting. Taking the family of Manneville-Pomeau maps as
example, we show that for any $d \ge 2$, it is possible that the set of
Li-Yorke $d$-tuples has full Lebesgue measure, but the set of Li-Yorke
$d+1$-tuples has zero Lebesgue measure.
