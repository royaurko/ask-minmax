In this paper we first calculate the post-Newtonian gravitoelectric secular
rate of the mean anomaly of a test particle freely orbiting a spherically
symmetric central mass. Then, we propose a novel approach to suitably combine
the presently available planetary ranging data to Mercury, Venus and Mars in
order to determine, simultaneously and independently of each other, the Sun's
quadrupole mass moment J_2 and the secular advances of the perihelion and the
mean anomaly. This would also allow to obtain the PPN parameters gamma and beta
independently. We propose to analyze the time series of three linear
combinations of the experimental residuals of the rates of the nodes, the
longitudes of perihelia and mean anomalies of Mercury, Venus and Mars built up
in order to absorb the secular precessions induced by the solar oblateness and
the post-Newtonian gravitoelectric forces. The values of the three investigated
parameters can be obtained by fitting the expected linear trends with straight
lines, determining their slopes in arcseconds per century and suitably
normalizing them. According to the present-day EPM2000 ephemerides accuracy,
the obtainable precision would be of the order of 10^-4-10^-5 for the PPN
parameters and, more interestingly, of 10^-9 for J_2. The future BepiColombo
mission should improve the Mercury's orbit by one order of magnitude.
