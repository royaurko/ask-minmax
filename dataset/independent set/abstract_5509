Study of soft sets was first proposed by Molodtsov in 1999 to deal with
uncertainty in a non-parametric manner. The researchers did not pay attention
to soft set theory at that time but now the soft set theory has been developed
in many areas of mathematics. Algebraic structures using soft set theory are
very rapidly developed. In this book we developed soft neutrosophic algebraic
structures by using soft sets and neutrosophic algebraic structures. In this
book we study soft neutrosophic groups, soft neutrosophic semigroups, soft
neutrosophic loops, soft neutrosophic LA-semigroups, and their generalizations
respectively.
