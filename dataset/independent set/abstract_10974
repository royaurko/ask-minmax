We investigate the possibility to constrain the pion distribution amplitude
from the gamma* gamma* -> pi transition. For a surprisingly large range in the
two photon virtualities we find that the transition form factor is essentially
independent of the distribution amplitude. This in turn entails a
parameter-free prediction of QCD. The gamma* gamma* -> eta, eta' form factors
are also briefly discussed. We estimate that experimental studies might be
feasible at the existing e+ e- experiments BaBar, Belle, and CLEO.
