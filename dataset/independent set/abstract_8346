A new numerical characterization of symbolic sequences is proposed. The
partition of sequence based on Ke and Tong algorithm is a starting point.
Algorithm decomposes original sequence into set of distinct subsequences - a
patterns. The set of subsequences common for two symbolic sequences (their
intersection) is proposed as a measure of similarity between them. The new
similarity measure works well for short (of tens letters) sequences and the
very long (of hundred thousand letters) as well. When applied to nucleotide or
protein sequences may help to trace possible evolutionary of species. As an
illustration, similarity of several sets of nucleotide and amino acid sequences
is examined.
