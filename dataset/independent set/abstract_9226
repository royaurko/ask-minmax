A recently published experimental dependence of the J/psi to Drell-Yan ratio
on the measured, by a zero degree calorimeter, forward energy E_ZDC in Pb+Pb
collisions at the CERN SPS is analyzed. Using a model-independent approach it
is shown that the data are at variance with an earlier published experimental
dependence of the same quantity on the transverse energy of neutral hadrons
E_T. The discrepancy is related to a moderate centrality region: 100 < N_p <
200 (N_p is the number of participant nucleons) and is peculiar only to the
data obtained within the `minimum bias' analysis (using the `theoretical
Drell-Yan'). This could result from systematic experimental errors in the
minimum bias sample. A possible source of the errors is discussed.
