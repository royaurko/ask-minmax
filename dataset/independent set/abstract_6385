If a state is passive for uniformly accelerated observers in n-dimensional
anti-de Sitter space-time (i.e. cannot be used by them to operate a perpetuum
mobile), they will (a) register a universal value of the Unruh temperature, (b)
discover a PCT symmetry, and (c) find that observables in complementary
wedge-shaped regions necessarily commute with each other in this state. The
stability properties of such a passive state induce a "geodesic causal
structure" on AdS and concommitant locality relations. It is shown that
observables in these complementary wedge-shaped regions fulfill strong
additional independence conditions. In two-dimensional AdS these even suffice
to enable the derivation of a nontrivial, local, covariant net indexed by
bounded spacetime regions. All these results are model-independent and hold in
any theory which is compatible with a weak notion of space-time localization.
Examples are provided of models satisfying the hypotheses of these theorems.
