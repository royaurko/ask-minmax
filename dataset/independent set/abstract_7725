A new spectral parameter independent R-matrix (that depends on all of the
dynamical variables) is proposed for the elliptic Calogero-Moser models.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for this R-matrix to exist reduce to an
equality between determinants of matrices involving elliptic functions. The
needed identity appears new and is still unproven in full generality: we
present it as a conjecture.
