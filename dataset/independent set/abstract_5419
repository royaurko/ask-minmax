We show how definite extended logic programs can be used for defining and
reasoning with rough sets. Moreover, a rough-set-specific query language is
presented and an answering algorithm is outlined. Thus, we not only show a
possible application of a paraconsistent logic to the field of rough sets as we
also establish a link between rough set theory and logic programming, making
possible transfer of expertise between both fields.
