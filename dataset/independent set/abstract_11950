We present the solution to the recently derived Wilsonian renormalization
group (RG) equation for nuclear current operators. In order to eliminate the
present ambiguity in the RG equation itself, we introduce a new condition
specifying the cutoff independence of the five point Green function
corresponding to the two-body propagator with current operator insertion. The
resulting effective current operator is then shown to obey a modified
Ward-Takahashi identity which differs from the usual one, but that nevertheless
leads to current conservation.
