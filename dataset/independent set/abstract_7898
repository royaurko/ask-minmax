We consider a mixed stochastic differential equation
$d{X_t}=a(t,X_t)d{t}+b(t,X_t) d{W_t}+c(t,X_t)d{B^H_t}$ driven by independent
multidimensional Wiener process and fractional Brownian motion. Under Hormander
type conditions we show that the distribution of $X_t$ possesses a density with
respect to the Lebesgue measure.
