In model independent way we consider the possibility of the existence of
fermion-antifermion, fermion-fermion bound states which appear due to $\gamma,
Z^0(W^{\pm}$-bosons and scalar, pseudoscalars exchanges including radiative
corrections. Our consideration includes the case where at least one particle in
the bound state is Majorana fermion or scalar.This paper considers various
types of bound states of particles contained in various extensions of the
Glashow-Weinberg -Salam model. We calculate long-range forces induced by
photonic, gluonic and fermionic loop corrections in scalar (pseudoscalar)
exchange.
