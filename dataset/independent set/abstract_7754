Deficiencies in Kauffman's proposal regarding a new way for building
scientific theories are pointed out. A suggestion to overcome them, and in
fact, independently construct mathematical theories which are beyond the reach
of Goedel's incompleteness theorem is presented. This suggestion is based on
bringing together recent developments in literature regarding inconsistent
mathematics and self-referential mathematics.
