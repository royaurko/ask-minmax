We present the first set of results for Charmonium Spectroscopy using
Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD). For the NRQCD action the leading order
spin-dependent and next to leading order spin-independent interactions have
been included. Clear signals for the s and p hyperfine splittings have been
observed as well as various orbital states.
