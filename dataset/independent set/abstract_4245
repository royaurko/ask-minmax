The study of degrees of freedom (DoF) of multiuser channels has led to the
development of important interference managing schemes, such as interference
alignment (IA) and interference neutralization. However, while the integer DoF
have been widely studied in literatures, non-integer DoF are much less
addressed, especially for channels with less variety. In this paper, we study
the non-integer DoF of the time-invariant multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
interfering multiple access channel (IMAC) in the simple setting of two cells,
$K$ users per cell, and $M$ antennas at all nodes. We provide the exact
characterization of the maximum achievable sum DoF under the constraint of
using linear interference alignment (IA) scheme with symbol extension. Our
results indicate that the integer sum DoF characterization $2MK/(K+1)$ achieved
by the Suh-Ho-Tse scheme can be extended to the non-integer case only when $K
\leq M^2$ for the circularly-symmetric-signaling systems and $K \leq 2M^2$ for
the asymmetric-complex-signaling systems. These results are further extended to
the time-invariant parallel MIMO IMAC with independent subchannels.
