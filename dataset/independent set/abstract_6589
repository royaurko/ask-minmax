A new approach to finite basis sets for the Dirac equation is developed. It
solves the problem of spurious states and, as a result, improves the
convergence properties of basis set calculations. The efficiency of the method
is demonstrated for finite basis sets constructed from B splines by calculating
the one-loop self-energy correction for a hydrogenlike ion.
