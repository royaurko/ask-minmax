We show that the large sequential decay corrections obtained by Ono {\it et
al} [nucl-ex/0507018], is in contradiction with both the other dynamical and
statistical model calculations carried out for the same systems and energy. On
the other hand, the conclusion of Shetty {\it {et al.}} $[$Phys. Rev. C 70,
011601R (2004)$]$, that the experimental data favors Gogny$-$AS interaction
(obtained assuming a significantly smaller sequential decay effects), is
consistent with several other independent studies.
