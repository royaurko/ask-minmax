In this article we have reproduced the tight binding $\pi$ band dispersion of
graphene including upto third nearest neighbours and also calculated the
partial density of states (due to $\pi$ band only) within the same model. The
aim was to find out a set of parameters descending in order as distance towards
third nearest neighbour increases compared to that of first and second nearest
neighbours with respect to an atom at the origin. Here we have talked about two
such sets of parameters by comparing the results with first principle band
structure calculation.
