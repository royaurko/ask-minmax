A small set of final prototypes of the ATLAS Inner Detector silicon tracker
(Pixel and SCT) were used to take data during the 2004 Combined Test Beam. Data
were collected from runs with beams of different flavour (electrons, pions,
muons and photons) with a momentum range of 2 to 180 GeV/c. Four independent
methods were used to align the silicon modules. The corrections obtained were
validated using the known momenta of the beam particles and were shown to yield
consistent results among the different alignment approaches. From the residual
distributions, it is concluded that the precision attained in the alignment of
the silicon modules is of the order of 5 micrometers in their most precise
coordinate.
