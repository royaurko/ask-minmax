We report the first high-field magneto-optical study on the exciton-phonon
sideband of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) consisting only of (6,5)
species. Both energy and intensity of the observed phonon sideband were found
to be independent of the external magnetic field. Comparing with theoretical
calculations, we confirmed that these sidebands originate from the optically
forbidden K-momentum singlet excitons. Energy of these K-momentum dark excitons
was extracted to be ~ 21.5 meV above the bright zero-momentum singlet excitons,
in close agreement with recent theoretical predictions and experimentally
determined values.
