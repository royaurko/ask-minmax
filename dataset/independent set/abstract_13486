The exoplanet KOI-142b (Kepler-88b) shows transit timing variations (TTVs)
with a semi-amplitude of $\sim 12\,$ hours, earning the nickname of "king of
transit variations". Only the transit of the planet b was detected in the
Kepler data with an orbital period of $\sim 10.92\,$ days and a radius of $\sim
0.36$ R$_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. The TTVs together with the transit duration
variations (TDVs) of KOI-142b were analysed by Nesvorny et al. (2013) who found
a unique solution for a companion perturbing planet. The contributors predicted an
outer non-transiting companion, KOI-142c, with a mass of $0.626\pm 0.03$
M$_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ and a period of $22.3397^{+0.0021}_{-0.0018}\,$days, and
hence close to the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the inner transiting planet.
We report independent confirmation of KOI-142c using radial velocity
observations with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de
Haute-Provence. We derive an orbital period of $22.10 \pm 0.25\,$days and a
minimum planetary mass of $0.76^{+0.32}_{0.16}\,$ M$_{\mathrm{Jup}}$, both in
good agreement with the predictions by previous transit timing analysis.
Therefore, this is the first radial velocity confirmation of a non-transiting
planet discovered with transit timing variations, providing an independent
validation of the TTVs technique.
