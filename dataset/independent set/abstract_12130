We present a simple method to decompose the Green forms corresponding to a
large class of interesting symmetric Dirichlet forms into integrals over
symmetric positive semi-definite and finite range (properly supported) forms
that are smoother than the original Green form. This result gives rise to
multiscale decompositions of the associated Gaussian free fields into sums of
independent smoother Gaussian fields with spatially localized correlations. Our
method makes use of the finite propagation speed of the wave equation and
Chebyshev polynomials. It improves several existing results and also gives
simpler proofs.
