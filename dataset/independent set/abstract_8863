In this article, we prove infinitary version of one to one correspondence
theorem between clones and relational clones on a fixed possibly infinite set.
We also characterize the relational clone corresponding to the clone of all
finitary operations. By this characterization, we obtain correspondence between
finitary clones on a fixed infinite set and relational clones satisfying some
condition.
