We classify SIC-POVMs of rank one in CP^2, or equivalently sets of nine
equally-spaced points in CP^2, without the assumption of group covariance. If
two points are fixed, the remaining seven must lie on a pinched torus that a
standard moment mapping projects to a circle in R^3. We use this approach to
prove that any SIC set in CP^2 is isometric to a known solution, given by nine
points lying in triples on the equators of the three 2-spheres each defined by
the vanishing of one homogeneous coordinate. We set up a system of equations to
describe hexagons in CP^2 with the property that any two vertices are related
by a cross ratio (transition probability) of 1/4. We then symmetrize the
equations, factor out by the known solutions, and compute a Groebner basis to
show that no SIC sets remain. We do find new configurations of nine points in
which 27 of the 36 pairs of vertices of the configuration are equally spaced.
