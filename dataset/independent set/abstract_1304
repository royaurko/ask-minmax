A generic, model-independent method for the analysis of the two-particle
short-range correlations is presented, that can be utilized to describe e.g.
Bose-Einstein (HBT or GGLP), statistical, dynamical or other short-range
correlation functions. The method is based on a data-motivated choice for the
zero-th order approximation for the shape of the correlation function, and on a
systematic determination of the correction terms with the help of complete
orthonormal set of functions. The Edgeworth expansion is obtained for
approximately Gaussian, the Laguerre expansion for approximately exponential
correlation functions. Multi-dimensional expansions are also introduced and
discussed.
