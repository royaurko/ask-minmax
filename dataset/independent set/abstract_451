A double perturbation idea is presented in framework of the quark-gluon
plasma kinetic theory. A solvable set of equations from the 'double
perturbation' is derived and the equations are showed to be gauge-independent.
The formalism of Landau damping rate for the plasmon at zero momentum is given
and discussed.
