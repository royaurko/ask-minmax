In this paper we study the convergence to fractional Brownian motion for long
memory time series having independent innovations with in?nite second moment.
For the sake of applications we derive the self-normalized version of this
theorem. The study is motivated by models arising in economical applications
where often the linear processes have long memory, and the innovations have
heavy tails.
