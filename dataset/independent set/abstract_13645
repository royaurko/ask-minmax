This is a revision (and partial retraction) of my previous abstarct. Let
$\lambda(X)$ denote Lebesgue measure. If $X\subseteq [0,1]$ and $r \in (0,1)$
then the $r$-Hausdorff capacity of $X$ is denoted by $H^r(X)$ and is defined to
be the infimum of all $\sum_{i=0}^\infty \lambda(I_i)^r$ where
$\{I_i\}_{i\in\omega}$ is a cover of $X$ by intervals. The $r$ Hausdorff
capacity has the same null sets as the $r$-Hausdorff measure which is familiar
from the theory of fractal dimension. It is shown that, given $r < 1$, it is
possible to enlarge a model of set theory, $V$, by a generic extension $V[G]$
so that the reals of $V$ have Lebesgue measure zero but still have positive
$r$-Hausdorff capacity.
