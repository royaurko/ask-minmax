In 1960, Klee showed that a subset of a Euclidean space must be a singleton
provided that each point in the space has a unique farthest point in the set.
This classical result has received much attention; in fact, the Hilbert space
version is a famous open problem. In this paper, we consider Klee sets from a
new perspective. Rather than measuring distance induced by a norm, we focus on
the case when distance is meant in the sense of Bregman, i.e., induced by a
convex function. When the convex function has sufficiently nice properties,
then - analogously to the Euclidean distance case - every Klee set must be a
singleton. We provide two proofs of this result, based on Monotone Operator
Theory and on Nonsmooth Analysis. The latter approach leads to results that
complement work by Hiriart-Urruty on the Euclidean case.
