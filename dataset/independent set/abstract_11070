The masses of the S-wave mesons consisting of the light (u,d,s) quarks are
calculated within the constituent quark model. The relativistic
Schroedinger-like equation with a confining potential is numerically solved for
the complete relativistic q bar q potential including both spin-independent and
spin-dependent terms. The obtained masses of the ground-state pi, rho, K, K*
and phi mesons and their first radial excitations are in reasonably good
overall agreement with experimental data.
