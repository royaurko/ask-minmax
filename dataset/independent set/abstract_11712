We demonstrate that the low-frequency resistance fluctuations, or noise, in
bilayer graphene is strongly connected to its band structure, and displays a
minimum when the gap between the conduction and valence band is zero. Using
double-gated bilayer graphene devices we have tuned the zero gap and charge
neutrality points independently, which offers a versatile mechanism to
investigate the low-energy band structure, charge localization and screening
properties of bilayer graphene.
