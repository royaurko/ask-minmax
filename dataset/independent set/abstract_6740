This paper investigates the problem of estimating the support of structured
signals via adaptive compressive sensing. We examine several classes of
structured support sets, and characterize the fundamental limits of accurately
estimating such sets through compressive measurements, while simultaneously
providing adaptive support recovery protocols that perform near optimally for
these classes. We show that by adaptively designing the sensing matrix we can
attain significant performance gains over non-adaptive protocols. These gains
arise from the fact that adaptive sensing can: (i) better mitigate the effects
of noise, and (ii) better capitalize on the structure of the support sets.
