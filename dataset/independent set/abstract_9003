We present preliminary results from a wide field near-IR imaging survey that
uses the Cambridge InfraRed Survey Instrument (CIRSI) on the 2.5m Isaac Newton
Telescope (INT). CIRSI is a JH-band mosaic imager that contains 4 Rockwell
1024$^{2}$ HgCdTe detectors (the largest IR camera in existence), allowing us
to survey approximately 4 deg^2 per night to H ~ 19. Combining CIRSI
observations with the deep optical imaging from the INT Wide Field Survey, we
demonstrate a reddening independent quasar selection technique based on the (g
- z) / (z - H) color diagram.
