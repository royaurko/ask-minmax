We have studied spin carrier dynamics under full spin-orbit coupling. The
anisotropy of dispersions for independent circular spinor polarizations is
explored as a possible vertical multichannel voltage controlled spin-filter.
Small voltage variations are found to select the current polarizations in a
resonant tunneling geometry.
