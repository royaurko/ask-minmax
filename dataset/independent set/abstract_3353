Nos\'e and Hoover's 1984 work showed that although Nos\'e and Nos\'e-Hoover
dynamics were both consistent with Gibbs' canonical distribution neither
dynamics, when applied to the harmonic oscillator, provided Gibbs' Gaussian
distribution. Further investigations indicated that two independent thermostat
variables are necessary, and often sufficient, to generate Gibbs' canonical
distribution for an oscillator. Three successful time-reversible and
deterministic sets of two-thermostat motion equations were developed in the
1990s. We analyze one of them here. It was developed by Martyna, Klein, and
Tuckerman in 1992. Its ergodicity was called into question by Patra and
Bhattacharya in 2014. This question became the subject of the 2014 Snook Prize.
Here we summarize the previous work on this problem and elucidate new details
of the chaotic dynamics in the neighborhood of the two fixed points. We apply
six separate tests for ergodicity and conclude that the MKT equations are fully
compatible with all of them, in consonance with our recent work with Clint
Sprott and Puneet Patra.
