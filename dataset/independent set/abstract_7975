We consider the population dynamics of a set of species whose network of
catalytic interactions is described by a directed graph. The relationship
between the attractors of this dynamics and the underlying graph theoretic
structures like cycles and autocatalytic sets is discussed. It is shown that
when the population dynamics is suitably coupled to a slow dynamics of the
graph itself, the network evolves towards increasing complexity driven by
autocatalytic sets. Some quantitative measures of network complexity are
described.
