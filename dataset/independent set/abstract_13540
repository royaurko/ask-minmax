Doppler-based planet surveys have shown that, besides metallicity, the planet
occurrence is also correlated with stellar mass, increasing from M to F-A
spectral types. However, it has recently been argued that the subgiants (which
represent A stars after they evolve off the main sequence) may not be as
massive as suggested initially, which would significantly change the
correlation found. To start investigating this claim, we have studied the
subgiant star HD 185351, which has precisely measured physical properties based
on asteroseismology and interferometry. An independent spectroscopic
differential analysis based on excitation and ionization balance of iron lines
yielded the atmospheric parameters $T_{\rm eff}$ = 5035 $\pm$ 29 K, $\log$ g =
3.30 $\pm$ 0.08 and [Fe/H] = 0.10 $\pm$ 0.04. These were used in conjunction
with the PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks to infer a mass M = 1.77 $\pm$ 0.04
M$_{\odot}$, which agrees well with the previous estimates. Lithium abundance
was also estimated from spectral synthesis (A(Li) = 0.77 $\pm$ 0.07) and,
together with $T_{\rm eff}$ and [Fe/H], allowed to determine a mass M = 1.64
$\pm$ 0.06 M$_{\odot}$, which is independent of the star's parallax and surface
gravity. Our new measurements of the stellar mass support the notion that
HD185351 is a Retired A Star with a mass in excess of 1.6 M$_{\odot}$.
