In the commented paper [PRD 78, 034032 (2008); arXiv:0803.2956] Deandrea et
al. claim that they provide a model-independent determination of the quantity
$B_0(m_d-m_u)$ based on the analysis of the decay of eta to three neutral pions
that takes the strong-interaction correction as an unknown parameter. In the
following we show that the two constraints presented there as independent
equations are in fact two approximations of a single constraint connecting
together $B_0(m_d-m_u)$ with the strong-interaction correction to the
$\eta\to3\pi^0$ decay amplitude. Thus, without some additional information on
the latter (such as its correct value at least at one kinematic point) it does
not lead to any determination of $B_0(m_d-m_u)$ and the numerical values
presented there should not be taken seriously. We have also found that the
numerical result for the studied quantity obtained in the commented paper is
just an accidental number stemming from some numerical errors that had occurred
in the computations presented there.
