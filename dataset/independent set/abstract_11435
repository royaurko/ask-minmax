We show that quasi-elastic inclusive scattering data on light nuclei for
medium Q^2 furnish information on $G_M^n$, whereas the deep-inelastic region
for large $Q^2$ provides the Structure Function $F_2^n(x,Q^2)$. Common to the
two extractions is the possibility to de-convolute medium effects, which is
most accurately done for light targets. Results are independent of the target.
