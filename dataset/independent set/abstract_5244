We have described here the design and operation of an automated ac
susceptibility set up using a closed cycle helium refrigerator. This set up is
useful for measuring linear and nonlinear magnetic susceptibilities of various
magnetic materials. The working temperature range is 2 K to 300 K. The overall
sensitivity of the set up is found to be 10-3 emu.
