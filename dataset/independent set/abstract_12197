The electromagnetic form factors of spin-1/2 particles are known, but due to
historical reasons only half of them are found in many textbooks. Given the
importance of the general result, its model independence, its connection to
discrete symmetries and their violations we made an effort to derive and
present the general result based only on the knowledge of Dirac equation. We
discuss the phenomenology connected directly with the form factors, and spin
precession in external fields including time reversal violating terms. We apply
the formalism to spin-flip synchrotron radiation and suggest pedagogical
projects.
