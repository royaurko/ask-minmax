This is an introduction to the set-theoretic method of forcing, including its
application in proving the independence of the Continuum Hypothesis from the
Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory. I presuppose no particular mathematical
background beyond some familiarity with set theory and mathematical logic - in
particular, no algebra is presupposed, though it can be useful. The goal is to
have a document that makes this material accessible to mathematics graduate
students in all fields, and to philosophers with an interest in set theory and
mathematical logic but no other mathematical background.
