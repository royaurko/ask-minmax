Let H be a non semi-simple Ariki-Koike algebra. According to [18] and [14],
there is a generalisation of Lusztig's a-function which induces a natural order
(parametrised by a tuple m) on Specht modules. In some cases, Geck and Jacon
have proved that this order makes unitriangular the decomposition matrix of H.
The algebra H is then said to admit a "canonical basic set". We fully classify
which values of m afford a canonical basic set for H and which do not. When
this is the case, we describe these sets in terms of "twisted Uglov" or
"twisted Kleshchev" multipartitions.
