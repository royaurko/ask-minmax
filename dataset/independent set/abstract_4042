There are many variations on partition functions for graph homomorphisms or
colorings. The case considered here is a counting or hard constraint problem in
which the range or color graph carries a free and vertex transitive Abelian
group action so that the colors are identified with the elements of this group.
A Fourier transform is used to obtain an expansion for the numbers of colorings
with terms indexed by isthmus free subgraphs of the domain. The terms are
products of a polynomial in the edge density a of the color graph and the
number of colorings of the indexing subgraph of the domain into the
complementary color graph. The polynomial in a is independent of the color
group and the term has order (1-a) to the r where r is the number of vertices
minus the number of components in the indexing subgraph. Thus if (1-a) is small
there is a main term indexed by the empty subgraph which is a polynomial in a
and the first dependence on the coloring group occurs in the lowest order
corrections which are indexed by the shortest cycles in the graph and are of
order (1-a) to the g-1 where g is the length of these shortest cycles. The main
theorem is stated as a reciprocity law. Examples are given in which the
coloring groups are long cycles and products of short cycles and adjacent
vertices are required to have distant rather than distinct colors. The
chromatic polynomial of a graph corresponds to using any group and taking the
allowed set to be the complement of the identity.
