Extending results of Suss and Hadwiger (proved by them for the case of convex
bodies and positive ratios), we show that compact (respectively, closed) convex
sets in the Euclidean space of dimension n are homothetic provided for any
given integer m between 2 and n - 1 (respectively, between 3 and n - 1), the
orthogonal projections of the sets on every m-dimensional plane are homothetic,
where homothety ratio and its sign may depend on the projection plane. The
proof uses a refined version of Straszewicz's theorem on exposed points of
compact convex sets.
