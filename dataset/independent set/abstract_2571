The vortex-like solutions are studied in the framework of the gauge model of
disclinations in elastic continuum. A complete set of model equations with
disclination driven dislocations taken into account is considered. Within the
linear approximation an exact solution for a low-angle wedge disclination is
found to be independent from the coupling constants of the theory. As a result,
no additional dimensional characteristics (like the core radius of the defect)
are involved. The situation changes drastically for 2\pi vortices where two
characteristic lengths, l_\phi and l_W, become of importance. The asymptotical
behaviour of the solutions for both singular and nonsingular 2\pi vortices is
studied. Forces between pairs of vortices are calculated.
