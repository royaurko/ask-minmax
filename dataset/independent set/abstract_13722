We give two sufficient conditions for the lattice Co(R^n,X) of relatively
convex sets of n-dimensional real space R^n to be join-semidistributive, where
X is a finite union of segments. We also prove that every finite lower bounded
lattice can be embedded into Co(R^n,X), for a suitable finite subset X of R^n.
