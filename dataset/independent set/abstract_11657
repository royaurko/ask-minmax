We characterize the non-uniqueness in the inverse problem for the stationary
transport model, in which the absorption "a" and the scattering coefficient "k"
are to be recovered from the albedo operator. We show that "gauge equivalent"
pairs (a,k) yield the same albedo operator, and that we can recover uniquely
the class of gauge equivalent pairs. We apply this result to show unique
determination of the media when the absorption "a" depends on the line of
travel through each point while scattering "k" obeys a symmetry property.
Previously known results concerned directional independent absorption.
