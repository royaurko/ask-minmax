Predictions for the hyperfine splitting of 2S bottomonia are compared with
the two recent experimental candidates for the \eta_b(2S). The smaller
splitting of the Belle state is consistent with unquenched lattice QCD
computations, many potential models, and a model-independent relation which
works well for charmonia. The larger splitting for the state extracted from
CLEO data is inconsistent with most predictions.
