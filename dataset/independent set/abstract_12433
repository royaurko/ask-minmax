High-resolution DC magnetization and AC-specific heat data of the cubic
helimagnet FeGe have been measured as function of temperature and magnetic
field. The magnetization data as well as the isothermal susceptibility data
confirm the complexity of the magnetic phase diagram in the vicinity of the
onset of long-rang magnetic order (Tc = 278.5 K) and the existence of a
segmented A-phase region. Moreover, these data revealed independent and clear
indications of phase boundaries and crossovers within the A-phase region.
Together with the anomalies in the specific-heat data around Tc and at small
magnetic fields (H < 600 Oe) a complex magnetic phase diagram of FeGe is
obtained.
