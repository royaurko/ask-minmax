We continue the work on the relations between independence logic and the
model-theoretic analysis of independence, generalizing the results of [15] and
[16] to the framework of abstract independence relations for an arbitrary AEC.
We give a model-theoretic interpretation of the independence atom and
characterize under which conditions we can prove a completeness result with
respect to the deductive system that axiomatizes independence in team semantics
and statistics.
