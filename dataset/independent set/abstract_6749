Reducing the conditions under which a given set satisfies the stipulations of
the subset sum proposition to a set of linear relationships, the question of
whether a set satisfies subset sum may be answered in a polynomial number of
steps by forming, solving, and constraining a series of linear systems whose
dimensions and number are both polynomial with respect to the length of the
set. Given its demonstrated 100% accuracy rate and its demonstrable
justification, this algorithm may provide basis to reconsider the validity of
SSP-based and NP-hard-reliant cryptosystems.
