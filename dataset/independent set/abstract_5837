We present extended multi block approach in the LIPI Public Cluster. The
multi block approach enables a cluster to be divided into several independent
blocks which run jobs owned by different users simultaneously. Previously, we
have maintained the blocks using single master node for all blocks due to
efficiency and resource limitations. Following recent advancements and
expansion of node\'s number, we have modified the multi block approach with
multiple master nodes, each of them is responsible for a single block. We argue
that this approach improves the overall performance significantly, for
especially data intensive computational works.
