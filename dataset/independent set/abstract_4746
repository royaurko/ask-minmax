In recent work, semantic games of independence-friendly logic were studied in
strategic form in terms of (mixed strategy) Nash equilibria. The class of
strategic games of independence-friendly logic is contained in the class of
win-loss, zero-sum two-player games. In this note we draw on the theory of
linear programming to develop tools to analyze the value of such games. We give
two applications of these tools to independence-friendly logic under the
so-called equilibrium semantics.
