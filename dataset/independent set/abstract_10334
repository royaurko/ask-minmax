Two independent indirect manifestations of Galactic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
are considered, whose importance for gamma-ray astronomy will depend on a still
poorly known -- though astrophysically important -- parameter, namely the GRB
repetition timescale in a Galaxy like ours. Both phenomena are expected to lead
to observational constrains about this timescale. The first one relates to the
Compton scattering of the GRB gamma-rays in the disk of the Galaxy, and the
second one to the long-term annihilation pattern of positrons produced just
ahead of the ultra-relativistic plasma, by photo-pair production.
