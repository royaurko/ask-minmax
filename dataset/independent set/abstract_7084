Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), galaxy clustering, and cosmic microwave background
anisotropy (CMB) data provide complementary constraints on the nature of the
dark energy in the universe. We find that the three-year Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observations give a CMB shift parameter of R =
(\Omega_m H_0^2)^{1/2} \int_0^{z_{CMB}} dz'/H(z')= 1.70 \pm 0.03. Using this
new measured value of the CMB shift parameter, together with the baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS), and SN Ia data from the HST/GOODS program and the first year Supernova
Legacy Survey, we derive model-independent constraints on the dark energy
density rho_X(z) and the cosmic expansion rate H(z). We also derive constraints
on the dark energy equation of state w_X(z)=w_0+w'z (with cutoff at z=2) and
w_X(a)=w_0+(1-a)w_a.
  We find that current data provide slightly tighter constraints on rho_X(z)
and H(z) as free functions in redshift, and roughly a factor of two improvement
in constraining w_X(z). A cosmological constant remains consistent with data,
however, uncertainties remain large for model-independent constraints of dark
energy. Significant increase in the number of observed SNe Ia between redshifts
of 1 and 2, complemented by improved BAO and weak lensing cosmography
measurements (as expected from the JEDI mission concept for the Joint Dark
Energy Mission), will be required to dramatically tighten model-independent
dark energy constraints.
