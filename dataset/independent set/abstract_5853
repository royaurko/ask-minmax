We report and discuss case study simulations of the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability in the Boussinesq, incompressible regime developed to turbulence.
Our main focus is on a statistical analysis of density and velocity
fluctuations inside of the already developed and growing in size mixing zone.
Novel observations reported in the manuscript concern self-similarity of the
velocity and density fluctuations spectra inside of the mixing zone snapshot,
independence of the spectra of the horizontal slice level, and universality
showing itself in a virtual independence of the internal structure of the
mixing zone, measured in the re-scaled spatial units, of the initial interface
perturbations.
