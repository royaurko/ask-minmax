The actions of the ``$R=T$'' and string-inspired theories of gravity in (1+1)
dimensions are generalized into one single action which is characterized by two
functions. We discuss differing interpretations of the matter stress-energy
tensor, and show how two such different interpretations can yield two different
sets of field equations from this action. The weak-field approximation,
post-Newtonian expansion, hydrostatic equilibrium state of star and
two-dimensional cosmology are studied separately by using the two sets of field
equations. Some properties in the ``$R=T$'' and string-inspired theories are
shown to be generic in the theory induced by the generalized action.
