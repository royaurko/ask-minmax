Consider a finite weighted oriented graph. We study a probability measure on
the set of spanning rooted oriented forests on the graph. We prove that the set
of roots sampled from this measure is a determinantal process, characterized by
a possibly non-symmetric kernel with complex eigenvalues. We then derive
several results relating this measure to the Markov process associated with the
starting graph, to the spectrum of its generator and to hitting times of
subsets of the graph. In particular, the mean hitting time of the set of roots
turns out to be independent of the starting point, conditioning or not to a
given number of roots. Wilson's algorithm provides a way to sample this measure
and, in absence of complex eigenvalues of the generator, we explain how to get
samples with a number of roots approximating a prescribed integer. We also
exploit the properties of this measure to give some probabilistic insight into
the proof of an algebraic result due to Micchelli and Willoughby. Further, we
present two different related coalescence and fragmentation processes.
