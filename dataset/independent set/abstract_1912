We consider nucleon-nucleon interactions from chiral effective field theory
applying the N/D method. The case of coupled partial waves is now treated,
extending Ref. [1] where the uncoupled case was studied. As a result three N/D
elastic-like equations have to be solved for every set of three independent
partial waves coupled. As in the previous reference the input for this method
is the discontinuity along the left-hand cut of the nucleon-nucleon partial
wave amplitudes. It can be calculated perturbatively in chiral perturbation
theory because it involves only irreducible two-nucleon intermediate states. We
apply here our method to the leading order result consisting of one-pion
exchange as the source for the discontinuity along the left-hand cut. The
linear integral equations for the N/D method must be solved in the presence of
L - 1 constraints, with L the orbital angular momentum, in order to satisfy the
proper threshold behavior for L>= 2. We dedicate special attention to satisfy
the requirements of unitarity in coupled channels. We also focus on the
specific issue of the deuteron pole position in the 3S1-3D1 scattering. Our
final amplitudes are based on dispersion relations and chiral effective field
theory, being independent of any explicit regulator. They are amenable to a
systematic improvement order by order in the chiral expansion.
