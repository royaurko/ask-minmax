We determine the expected curvature polynomial of random real projective
varieties given as the zero set of independent random polynomials with Gaussian
distribution, whose distribution is invariant under the action of the
orthogonal group. In particular, the expected Euler characteristic of such
random real projective varieties is found. This considerably extends previously
known results on the number of roots, the volume, and the Euler characteristic
of the solution set of random polynomial equations
