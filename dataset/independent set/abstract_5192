We continue the description of Mandelbrot and Multibrot sets and of Julia
sets in terms of fibers which was begun in IMS preprints 1998/12 and 1998/13a.
The question of local connectivity of these sets is discussed in terms of
fibers and becomes the question of triviality of fibers. In this paper, the
focus is on the behavior of fibers under renormalization and other surgery
procedures. We show that triviality of fibers of Mandelbrot and Multibrot sets
is preserved under tuning maps and other (partial) homeomorphisms. Similarly,
we show for unicritical polynomials that triviality of fibers of Julia sets is
preserved under renormalization and other surgery procedures, such as the
Branner-Douady homeomorphisms. We conclude with various applications about
quadratic polynomials and its parameter space: we identify embedded paths
within the Mandelbrot set, and we show that Petersen's theorem about quadratic
Julia sets with Siegel disks of bounded type generalizes from period one to
arbitrary periods so that they all have trivial fibers and are thus locally
connected.
