Among the many families of nonperiodic tilings known so far, SCD tilings are
still a bit mysterious. Here, we determine the diffraction spectra of point
sets derived from SCD tilings and show that they have no absolutely continuous
part, that they have a uniformly discrete pure point part on the z-axis, and
that they are otherwise supported on a set of concentric cylinder surfaces
around this axis. For SCD tilings with additional properties, more detailed
results are given.
