Recent studies by a number of independent collaborations, have correlated the
CMB temperatures measured by the WMAP satellite with different galaxy surveys
that trace the matter distribution with light from the whole range of the
electromagnetic spectrum: radio, far-infrared, optical and X-ray surveys. The
new data systematically finds positive correlations, indicating a rapid slow
down in the growth of structure in the universe. Individual cross-correlation
measurements are of low significance, but we show that combining data at
different redshifts introduces important new constraints. Contrary to what
happens at low redshifts, for a fixed $\Omm$, the higher the dark energy
contend, $\Ol$, the lower the ISW cross-correlation amplitude. At 68%
confidence level, the data finds new independent evidence of dark energy: $\Ol
=0.42-1.22$ . It also confirms, to higher significance, the presence of a large
dark matter component: $\Omm =0.18-0.34$, exceeding the density of baryonic
matter, but far from the critical value. Combining these new constraints with
the prior of a flat universe, or the prior of an accelerating universe provides
strong new evidence for a dark cosmos. Combination with supernova data yields
$\Ol = 0.71 \pm 0.13$, $\Omm = 0.29 \pm 0.04$. If we also assume a flat
universe, we find $\Ol = 0.70 \pm 0.05$ and $w = -1.02 \pm 0.17$ for a constant
dark energy equation of state.
