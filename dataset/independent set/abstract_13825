We investigate certain spectral properties of the Bernoulli convolution
measures on attractor sets arising from iterated function systems on the real
line. In particular, we examine collections of orthogonal exponential functions
in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on the attractor. We
carefully examine a test case where the parameter lambda is equal to 3/4 and
therefore the IFS has overlap. We also determine rational values of lambda for
which infinite sets of orthogonal exponentials exist.
