Given a set of aligned sequences of independent noisy observations, we are
concerned with detecting intervals where the mean values of the observations
change simultaneously in a subset of the sequences. The intervals of changed
means are typically short relative to the length of the sequences, the subset
where the change occurs, the "carriers," can be relatively small, and the sizes
of the changes can vary from one sequence to another. This problem is motivated
by the scientific problem of detecting inherited copy number variants in
aligned DNA samples. We suggest a statistic based on the assumption that for
any given interval of changed means there is a given fraction of samples that
carry the change. We derive an analytic approximation for the false positive
error probability of a scan, which is shown by simulations to be reasonably
accurate. We show that the new method usually improves on methods that analyze
a single sample at a time and on our earlier multi-sample method, which is most
efficient when the carriers form a large fraction of the set of sequences. The
proposed procedure is also shown to be robust with respect to the assumed
fraction of carriers of the changes.
