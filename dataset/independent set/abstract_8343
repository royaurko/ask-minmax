An approach due to Wojtkovski [9], based on the Jacobi fields, is applied to
study sets of 3-period orbits in billiards on hyperbolic plane and on
two-dimensional sphere. It is found that the set of 3-period orbits in
billiards on hyperbolic plane, as in the planar case, has zero measure. For the
sphere, a new proof of Baryshnikov's theorem is obtained which states that
3-period orbits can form a set of positive measure provided a natural condition
on the orbit length is satisfied.
