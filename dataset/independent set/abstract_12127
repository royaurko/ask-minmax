The status of possible new-physics signals in B_s,d-meson mixing and decay is
reviewed. In particular, it is emphasized that the recent LHCb results, that
find no evidence for a non-standard phase in B_s-barB_s mixing, make a
consistent explanation of the D0 data on the like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry
notoriously difficult. In order to clarify the inconclusive experimental
situation, independent measurements of the semileptonic asymmetries are needed.
