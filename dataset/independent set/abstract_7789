We show that $\ell_p$ norms are characterized as the unique norms which are
both invariant under coordinate permutation and multiplicative with respect to
tensor products. Similarly, the $L_p$ norms are the unique
rearrangement-invariant norms on a probability space such that $\|X
Y\|=\|X\|\cdot\|Y\|$ for every pair $X,Y$ of independent random variables. Our
proof relies on Cram\'er's large deviation theorem.
