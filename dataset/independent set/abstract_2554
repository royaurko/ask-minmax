The strange magnetic form factor of proton is calculated in a model
independent way to confirm the recent experimental result of the SAMPLE
Collaboration. We consider a set of six inertia parameters to realize the
magnetic moments of the baryon octet. We show that the strange form factor of
proton is a positive quantity, i.e. +0.37 n.m.. Its positiveness is analyzed in
terms of the vacuum fluctuation coupled to the vector current along the
strangeness direction.
