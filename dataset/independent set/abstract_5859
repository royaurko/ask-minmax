We introduce a new test procedure of independence in the framework of
parametric copulas with unknown marginals. The method is based essentially on
the dual representation of $\chi^2$-divergence on signed finite measures. The
asymptotic properties of the proposed estimate and the test statistic are
studied under the null and alternative hypotheses, with simple and standard
limit distributions both when the parameter is an interior point or not.
