We study lower and upper bounds of the Hausdorff dimension for sets which are
wiggly at scales of positive density. The main technical ingredient is a
construction, for every continuum K, of a Borel probabilistic measure \mu with
the property that on every ball B(x,r), with x in K, the measure is bounded by
a universal constant multiple of r\exp(-g(x,r)), where g(x,r) > 0 is an
explicit function. The continuum K is mean wiggly at exactly those points x in
K where g(x, r) has a logarithmic growth to infinity as r goes to 0. The theory
of mean wiggly continua leads, via the product formula for dimensions, to new
estimates of the Hausdorff dimension for Cantor sets. We prove also that
asymptotically flat sets are of Hausdorff dimension 1 and that asymptotically
non-porous continua are of the maximal dimension. Another application of the
theory is geometric Bowen's dichotomy for Topological Collet-Eckmann maps in
rational dynamics. In particular, mean wiggly continua are dynamically natural
as they occur as Julia sets of quadratic polynomials for parameters from a
generic set on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.
