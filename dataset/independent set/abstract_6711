Consider a 2-player normal-form game repeated over time. We introduce an
adaptive learning procedure, where the players only observe their own realized
payoff at each stage. We assume that agents do not know their own payoff
function, and have no information on the other player. Furthermore, we assume
that they have restrictions on their own action set such that, at each stage,
their choice is limited to a subset of their action set. We prove that the
empirical distributions of play converge to the set of Nash equilibria for
zero-sum and potential games, and games where one player has two actions.
