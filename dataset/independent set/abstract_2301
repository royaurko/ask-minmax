We calculate the survival probability of a diffusing test particle in an
environment of diffusing particles that undergo coagulation at rate lambda_c
and annihilation at rate lambda_a. The test particle dies at rate lambda' on
coming into contact with the other particles. The survival probability decays
algebraically with time as t^{-theta}. The exponent theta in d<2 is calculated
using the perturbative renormalization group formalism as an expansion in
epsilon=2-d. It is shown to be universal, independent of lambda', and to depend
only on delta, the ratio of the diffusion constant of test particles to that of
the other particles, and on the ratio lambda_a/lambda_c. In two dimensions we
calculate the logarithmic corrections to the power law decay of the survival
probability. Surprisingly, the log corrections are non-universal. The one loop
answer for theta in one dimension obtained by setting epsilon=1 is compared
with existing exact solutions for special values of delta and
lambda_a/lambda_c. The analytical results for the logarithmic corrections are
verified by Monte Carlo simulations.
