We show that the combined data from solar, long-baseline and reactor neutrino
experiments can exclude the generalized bicycle model of Lorentz noninvariant
direction-dependent and/or direction-independent oscillations of massless
neutrinos. This model has five parameters, which is more than is needed in
standard oscillation phenomenology with neutrino masses. Solar data alone are
sufficient to exclude the pure direction-dependent case. The combination of
solar and long-baseline data rules out the pure direction-independent case.
With the addition of KamLAND data, a mixture of direction-dependent and
direction-independent terms in the effective Hamiltonian is also excluded.
