Inclusion of redundant fundamental quantities in SI system has resulted in
lot of ambiguities and confusion in modern theories. The incompatibilities
between the existing theories can possibly be due to incorrect assumption of
fundamental quantities and existence of newer fundamental quantities. This
paper is an attempt to eliminate the redundancy in the SI system using random
mathematical mappings done through a computer program on SI system to New
System. Each mathematical mapping is studied manually. Out of 1000 random
mathematical mappings generated using a Computer Program, a mapping with three
fundamental quantities is found to describe a non-redundant and intuitive set
of Fundamental quantities. This paper also proposes the possible existence of a
new fundamental quantity. A significant attempt is made to understand the
advantages of new system over SI system. The relations between the set {Mass,
length, time, current, and temperature} and new set of three fundamental
quantities are calculated. The paper also describes the intuitive reasons
favoring the new fundamental set of quantities.
