The energy and the angular dependence of the associative vector charmed
${D^*}$-meson photoproduction, $\gamma+N\to {\cal B}_c+ \overline{D^*}$, with
${\cal B}_c=\Lambda_c$ or $\Sigma_c$, has been predicted in framework of
pseudoscalar D-meson exchange model. The behavior of the cross section is
driven by phenomenological form factors, which can be parametrized in terms of
two independent parameters. The predicted values of the cross section are
sizeable enough to be measured in the near threshold region.
