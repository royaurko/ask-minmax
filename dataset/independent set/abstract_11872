The results obtained in Mainz in 1982 year were check up. The analysis of
data from this work was made at momentum transfer range $q = 0.25 \div 0.75
fm^{-1}$ using the model independent form factor (the expansion of form factor
in a power series of $q^2$) and the form factor corresponding to the
distribution of charge density in the shell model framework. We found a 3%
systematical overestimation in Mainz data.
