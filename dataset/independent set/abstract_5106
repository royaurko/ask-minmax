We look at generalisations of sets of vectors proving the Kochen-Specker
theorem in 3 and 4 dimensions. It has been shown that two such sets, although
unitarily inequivalent, are part of a larger 3-parameter family of vectors that
share the same orthogonality graph. We find that these sets are unusual, in
that the vectors in all other Kochen-Specker sets investigated here are fully
determined by orthogonality conditions and thus admit no free parameters.
