We present some elementary ideas to prove the following Sylvester-Gallai type
theorems involving incidences between points and lines in the planes over the
complex numbers and quaternions.
  (1) Let A and B be finite sets of at least two complex numbers each. Then
there exists a line l in the complex affine plane such that l intersects AxB in
exactly two points.
  (2) Let S be a finite noncollinear set of points in the complex affine plane.
Then there exists a line l intersecting S in 2, 3, 4 or 5 points.
  (3) Let A and B be finite sets of at least two quaternions each. Then there
exists a line l in the quaternionic affine plane such that l intersects AxB in
2, 3, 4 or 5 points.
  (4) Let S be a finite noncollinear set of points in the quaternionic affine
plane. Then there exists a line l intersecting S in at least 2 and at most 24
points.
