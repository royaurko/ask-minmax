This paper considers a class of coalgebras over the Barratt-Eccles operad and
shows that they classify Z-completions of pointed, reduced simplicial sets. As
a consequence, they encapsulate the homotopy types of nilpotent simplicial
sets. This result is a direct generalization of Quillen's result characterizing
rational homotopy types via cocommutative coalgebras.
