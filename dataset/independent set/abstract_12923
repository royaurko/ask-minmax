Motivated by the papers of Piterbarg (2004) and H\"{u}sler (2004), in this
paper the asymptotic relation between the maximum of a continuous dependent
homogeneous Gaussian random field and the maximum of this field sampled at
discrete time points is studied. It is shown that, for the weakly dependent
case, these two maxima are asymptotically independent, dependent and coincide
when the grid of the discrete time points is a sparse grid, Pickands grid and
dense grid, respectively, while for the strongly dependent case, these two
maxima are asymptotically totally dependent if the grid of the discrete time
points is sufficiently dense, and asymptotically dependent if the the grid
points are sparse or Pickands grids.
