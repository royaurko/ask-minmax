We analyze the photometric short-cadence data obtained with the Kepler
Mission during the first eight months of observations of two solar-type stars
of spectral types G and F: KIC 11395018 and KIC 11234888 respectively, the
latter having a lower signal-to-noise ratio compared to the former. We estimate
global parameters of the acoustic (p) modes such as the average large and small
frequency separations, the frequency of the maximum of the p-mode envelope and
the average linewidth of the acoustic modes. We were able to identify and to
measure 22 p-mode frequencies for the first star and 16 for the second one even
though the signal-to-noise ratios of these stars are rather low. We also derive
some information about the stellar rotation periods from the analyses of the
low-frequency parts of the power spectral densities. A model-independent
estimation of the mean density, mass and radius are obtained using the scaling
laws. We emphasize the importance of continued observations for the stars with
low signal-to-noise ratio for an improved characterization of the oscillation
modes. Our results offer a preview of what will be possible for many stars with
the long data sets obtained during the remainder of the mission.
