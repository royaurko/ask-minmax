We consider the Assouad dimensions of orthogonal projections of planar sets
onto lines. Our investigation covers both general and self-similar sets.
  For general sets, the main result is the following: if a set in the plane has
Assouad dimension $s \in [0,2]$, then the projections have Assouad dimension at
least $\min\{1,s\}$ almost surely. Compared to the famous analogue for
Hausdorff dimension -- namely \emph{Marstrand's Projection Theorem} -- a
striking difference is that the words `at least' cannot be dispensed with: in
fact, for many planar self-similar sets of dimension $s < 1$, we prove that the
Assouad dimension of projections can attain both values $s$ and $1$ for a set
of directions of positive measure.
  For self-similar sets, our investigation splits naturally into two cases:
when the group of rotations is discrete, and when it is dense. In the `discrete
rotations' case we prove the following dichotomy for any given projection:
either the Hausdorff measure is positive in the Hausdorff dimension, in which
case the Hausdorff and Assouad dimensions coincide; or the Hausdorff measure is
zero in the Hausdorff dimension, in which case the Assouad dimension is equal
to 1. In the `dense rotations' case we prove that every projection has Assouad
dimension equal to one, assuming that the planar set is not a singleton.
  As another application of our results, we show that there is no
\emph{Falconer's Theorem} for Assouad dimension. More precisely, the Assouad
dimension of a self-similar (or self-affine) set is not in general almost
surely constant when one randomises the translation vectors.
