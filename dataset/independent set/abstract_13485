Home-work commuting has always attracted significant research attention
because of its impact on human mobility. One of the key assumptions in this
domain of study is the universal uniformity of commute times. However, a true
comparison of commute patterns has often been hindered by the intrinsic
differences in data collection methods, which make observation from different
countries potentially biased and unreliable. In the present work, we approach
this problem through the use of mobile phone call detail records (CDRs), which
offers a consistent method for investigating mobility patterns in wholly
different parts of the world. We apply our analysis to a broad range of
datasets, at both the country and city scale. Additionally, we compare these
results with those obtained from vehicle GPS traces in Milan. While different
regions have some unique commute time characteristics, we show that the
home-work time distributions and average values within a single region are
indeed largely independent of commute distance or country (Portugal, Ivory
Coast, and Boston)--despite substantial spatial and infrastructural
differences. Furthermore, a comparative analysis demonstrates that such
distance-independence holds true only if we consider multimodal commute
behaviors--as consistent with previous studies. In car-only (Milan GPS traces)
and car-heavy (Saudi Arabia) commute datasets, we see that commute time is
indeed influenced by commute distance.
