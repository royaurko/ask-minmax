We describe a natural isomorphism between the set of equivalence classes of
pseudocycles and the integral homology groups of a smooth manifold. Our
arguments generalize to settings well-suited for applications in enumerative
algebraic geometry and for construction of the virtual fundamental class in the
Gromov-Witten theory.
