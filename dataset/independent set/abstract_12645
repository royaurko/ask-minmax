In this paper, we use the appropriate boundary action for the vector fields
near the horizon of near extremal Kerr black hole to calculate the two-point
function for the vector fields in Kerr/CFT correspondence. We show the
gauge-independent part of the two-point function is in agreement with what is
expected from CFT.
