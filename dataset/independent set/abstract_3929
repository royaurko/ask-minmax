We present [OIII]{\lambda}5007 fluxes and angular diameters for 435 Planetary
Nebulae (PN) in the central 10' x 10' region towards the Galactic bulge. Our
sample is taken from the new discoveries of the MASH PN surveys as well as
previously known PN. This sample accounts for 80% of known PN in this region.
Fluxes and diameters are measured from narrow-band imaging with the MOSAIC-II
camera on the 4-m Blanco telescope at the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American
Observatory. This is the largest (~60 square degrees), uniform
[OIII]{\lambda}5007 survey of the inner Galactic bulge ever undertaken. 104 of
the objects have measured [OIII]{\lambda}5007, [OIII]{\lambda}4959, H{\alpha}
or H{\beta} fluxes from the literature, which we use to undertake a detailed
comparison to demonstrate the integrity of our new fluxes. Our independent
measurements are in excellent agreement with the very best literature sources
over two orders of magnitude, while maintaining good consistency over five
orders of magnitude. The excellent resolution and sensitivity of our data
allows not only for a robust set of homogenous PN fluxes, but provides greater
detail into their intricate, otherwise undetermined [OIII]{\lambda}5007
morphologies. These new, extensive measurements significantly increase the
sample of reliable [OIII]{\lambda}5007 fluxes for Galactic bulge PN making it a
valuable resource and a prelude to the construction of our new Galactic bulge
Planetary Nebula luminosity function (Paper II).
