We investigate how the QCD equation of state can be reconstructed by a
continous mass distribution of non-interacting ideal components. We find that
adjusting the mass scale as a function of the temperature leads to results
which are conform to the quasiparticle model, but a temperature independent
distribution also may fit lattice results. The fitted mass distribution tends
to show a mass gap, supporting the physical picture of the quark coalescence in
hadronization.
