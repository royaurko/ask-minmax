Let $S$ be a set of transpositions that generates the symmetric group $S_n$,
where $n \ge 3$. The transposition graph $T(S)$ is defined to be the graph with
vertex set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and with vertices $i$ and $j$ being adjacent in
$T(S)$ whenever $(i,j) \in S$. We prove that if the girth of the transposition
graph $T(S)$ is at least 5, then the automorphism group of the Cayley graph
$\Cay(S_n,S)$ is the semidirect product $R(S_n) \rtimes \Aut(S_n,S)$, where
$\Aut(S_n,S)$ is the set of automorphisms of $S_n$ that fixes $S$. This
strengthens a result of Feng on transposition graphs that are trees. We also
prove that if the transposition graph $T(S)$ is a 4-cycle, then the set of
automorphisms of the Cayley graph $\Cay(S_4,S)$ that fixes a vertex and each of
its neighbors is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group and hence is nontrivial. We
thus identify the existence of 4-cycles in the transposition graph as being an
important factor in causing a potentially larger automorphism group of the
Cayley graph.
