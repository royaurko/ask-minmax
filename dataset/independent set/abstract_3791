In this paper we study some properties of degenerations of surfaces whose
general fibre is a smooth projective surface and whose central fibre is a
reduced, connected surface $X \subset IP^r$, $r \geq 3$, which is assumed to be
a union of smooth projective surfaces, in particular of planes. Our original
motivation has been a series of papers of G. Zappa which appeared in the
1940-50's regarding degenerations of scrolls to unions of planes.
  Here, we present a first set of results on the subject; other aspects are
still work in progress and will appear later.
  We first study the geometry and the combinatorics of a surface like $X$,
considered as a reduced, connected surface on its own; then we focus on the
case in which X is the central fibre of a degeneration of relative dimension
two over the complex unit disk. In this case, we deduce some of the intrinsic
and extrinsic invariants of the general fibre from the ones of its central
fibre.
  In the particular case of $X$ a central fibre of a semistable degeneration,
i.e. $X$ has only global normal crossing singularities and the total space of
the degeneration is smooth, some of the above invariants can be also computed
by topological methods (i.e., the Clemens-Schmid exact sequence). Our results
are more general, not only because the computations are independent on the fact
that $X$ is the central fibre of a degeneration, but also because the
degeneration is not semistable in general.
