In this paper, we discuss the dissociative electron attachment process in
Formic Acid and Propyl Amine. These are molecules containing more than one
functional group and have low symmetry (Cs group). We measured the kinetic
energy and angular distributions of fragment H^{-} ions from the resonances
observed in these molecules and compared with that in the precursor molecules,
namely - Water, Ammonia and Methane. Measurements suggest that the dissociation
dynamics in bigger molecules are independent of overall symmetry of the
molecule, rather depend only on the local symmetry of functional group and bond
orientation factors.
