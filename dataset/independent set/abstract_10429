The nature of the critical point of the Anderson transition in high magnetic
fields is discussed with an emphasis on scale invariance and universality of
the critical exponent. Special attention is paid to the distribution function
of the conductance which becomes size and model independent at the critical
point. The fractal properties of the wave function which are related to scale
invariance are also discussed.
