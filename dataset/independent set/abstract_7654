We consider the distribution of the value of the optimal k-assignment in an m
x n-matrix, where the entries are independent exponential random variables with
arbitrary rates.
  We give closed formulas for both the Laplace transform of this random
variable and for its expected value under the condition that there is a
zero-cost k-1-assignment.
