General model-independent expressions are developed for the polarized and
unpolarized cross-sections for $e^+e^-\to f\bar f$ near the $Z^0$ resonance.
The expressions assume only the analyticity of S-matrix elements. Angular
dependence is included by means of a partial wave expansion. The resulting
simple forms are suitable for use in fitting data or in Monte Carlo event
generators. A distinction is made between model-independent and model-dependent
QED corrections and a simple closed expression is given for the effect of
initial-final state bremsstrahlung and virtual QED corrections.
