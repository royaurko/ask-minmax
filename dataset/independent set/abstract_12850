We compute a closed-form expression for the moment generating function
$\hat{f}(x;\lambda,\alpha)=\frac{1}{\lambda}\mathbb{E}_x(e^{\alpha L_{\tau}})$,
where $L_t$ is the local time at zero for standard Brownian motion with
reflecting barriers at $0$ and $b$, and $\tau \sim \mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)$ is
independent of $W$. By analyzing how and where $\hat{f}(x;\cdot,\alpha)$ blows
up in $\lambda$, a large-time large deviation principle (LDP) for $L_t/t$ is
established using a Tauberian result and the G\"{a}rtner-Ellis Theorem.
