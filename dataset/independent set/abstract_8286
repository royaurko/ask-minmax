For given convex set $K$ in the plane (not necessarily bounded), we can
construct the curve $C$ for which the visibility (aperture) angle of this set
has the same, prescribed value. We give the implicit formula for $C$, discuss
some issues concerning practical computations of $C$ and bring several simple
examples, when the equal visibility angle curves can be effectively computed
explicitly. We conclude with some remarks about possible directions for further
research in this area. Extensive use of Open Source software (Sage, Pylab,
IPython,...) is a key feature of this article.
