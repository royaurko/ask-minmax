We suggest and explore a matroidal version of the Brualdi - Ryser conjecture
about Latin squares. We prove that any $n\times n$ matrix, whose rows and
columns are bases of a matroid, has an independent partial transversal of
length $\lceil2n/3\rceil$. We show that for any $n$, there exists such a matrix
with a maximal independent partial transversal of length at most $n-1$.
