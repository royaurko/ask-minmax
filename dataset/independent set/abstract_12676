We introduce a class of unidirectional lasing modes associated with the
frozen mode regime of non-reciprocal slow-wave structures. Such asymmetric
modes can only exist in cavities with broken time-reversal and space inversion
symmetries. Their lasing frequency coincides with a spectral stationary
inflection point of the underlying passive structure and is virtually
independent of its size. These unidirectional lasers can be indispensable
components of photonic integrated circuitry.
