We consider general settings of Bell inequality experiments with many
parties, where each party chooses from a finite number of measurement settings
each with a finite number of outcomes. We investigate the constraints that Bell
inequalities place upon the correlations possible in a local hidden variable
theories using a geometrical picture of correlations. We show that local hidden
variable theories can be characterized in terms of limited computational
expressiveness, which allows us to characterize families of Bell inequalities.
The limited computational expressiveness for many settings (each with many
outcomes) generalizes previous results about the many-party situation each with
a choice of two possible measurements (each with two outcomes). Using this
computational picture we present generalizations of the Popescu-Rohrlich
non-local box for many parties and non-binary inputs and outputs at each site.
Finally, we comment on the effect of pre-processing on measurement data in our
generalized setting and show that it becomes problematic outside of the binary
setting, in that it allows local hidden variable theories to simulate maximally
non-local correlations such as those of these generalised Popescu-Rohrlich
non-local boxes.
