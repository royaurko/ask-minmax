We show generally that in thermal gravity, the one-particle irreducible
2-point function depends on the choice of the basic graviton fields. We derive
the relevant properties of a physical graviton self-energy, which is
independent of the parametrization of the graviton field. An explicit
expression for the graviton self-energy at high-temperature is given to
one-loop order.
