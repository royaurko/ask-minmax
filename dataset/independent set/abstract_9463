We implemented a fortran code that determine fundamental parameters of solar
type stars from a list of Fe line equivalent widths. The solution should verify
3 conditions in the standard method: ionization equilibrium, excitation
equilibrium and independence between metallicity and equivalent widths. We
added the condition that the input metallicity of the model atmosphere should
be similar to the output metallicity derived with equivalent widths.
Solar-scaled Kurucz model atmospheres with NEWODF opacities are calculated with
an independent program. Parameter files control different details, such as the
mixing-length parameter, the overshooting, the damping of the lines and the
weight factors in the definition of the chi2 function. FUNDPAR derive the
uncertainties following 2 methods: the criteria of Gonzalez & Vanture (1998)
and the dispersion using the chi2 function. The code use the 2009 version of
the MOOG program. The results derived with FUNDPAR are in agreement with
previous determinations in the literature. In particular we obtained the
fundamental parameters of 58 exoplanet host stars. The program is freely
available from the web (http://icate-conicet.gob.ar/saffe/fundpar/).
