We propose two independent methods to determine the CKM phase $\gamma$ and
the tree and penguin amplitudes using neutral $B$ decays, assuming that the
phase $\beta$ is known. Based on flavor SU(3) symmetry and SU(3) breaking
effect, one method uses the decay processes $B^0(t) \rightarrow \pi^0 K_S$,
$B^0 \rightarrow \eta K^0 \; (K_S \rightarrow \pi \pi)$ and their
charge-conjugate processes, and the other uses the processes $B^0(t)
\rightarrow \pi^0 K_S$, $B^0 \rightarrow \pi^0 \pi^0$ and their
charge-conjugate processes. From SU(3) breaking consideration, the latter
method would be more useful.
