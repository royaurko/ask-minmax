In the framework of the Electroweak Theory we discuss a class of gauge fixing
choices suitable for the calculation of electromagnetic processes. We show in
particular that, with our choices, beyond the basic Slavnov-Taylor identities
guaranteeing the independence of the physical results of the particular gauge
fixing, one also has the standard QED Ward identities which play a well known
crucial role in the calculation of electromagnetic processes and, in
particular, in the analysis of the electromagnetic radiative corrections.
