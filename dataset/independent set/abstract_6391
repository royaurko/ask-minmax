Motivated by a recent experiment [Chikkatur, et al. Science, 296, 2193
(2002)] on the merging of atomic condensates, we investigate how two
independent condensates with random initial phases can develop a unique
relative phase when we move them together. In the adiabatic limit, the uniting
of independent condensates can be understood from the eigenstate evolution of
the governing Hamiltonian, which maps degenerate states (corresponding to
fragmented condensates) to a single state (corresponding to a united
condensate) . In the non-adiabatic limit corresponding to the practical
experimental configurations, we give an explanation on why we can still get a
large condensate fraction with a unique relative phase. Detailed numerical
simulations are then performed for the non-adiabatic merging of the
condensates, which confirm our explanation and qualitative estimation. The
results may have interesting implications for realizing a continuous atom laser
based on merging of condensates.
