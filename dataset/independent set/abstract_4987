Given a renormalization scheme of QCD, one can define a mass scale
$\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ in terms of the beta function. Under a change of the
renormalization scheme, however, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ changes by a
multiplicative constant. We introduce a scheme independent $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$
using a connection on the space of the coupling constant.
