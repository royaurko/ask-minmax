A set-labeling of a graph $G$ is an injective function $f:V(G)\to
\mathcal{P}(X)$, where $X$ is a finite set of non-negative integers and a
set-indexer of $G$ is a set-labeling such that the induced function
$f^{\oplus}:E(G)\rightarrow \mathcal{P}(X)-\{\emptyset\}$ defined by
$f^{\oplus}(uv) = f(u){\oplus}f(v)$ for every $uv{\in} E(G)$ is also injective.
A set-indexer $f:V(G)\to \mathcal{P}(X)$ is called a set-sequential labeling of
$G$ if $f^{\oplus}(V(G)\cup E(G))=\mathcal{P}(X)-\{\emptyset\}$. A graph $G$
which admits a set-sequential labeling is called a set-sequential graph. An
integer additive set-labeling is an injective function $f:V(G)\rightarrow
\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}_0)$, $\mathbb{N}_0$ is the set of all non-negative
integers and an integer additive set-indexer is an integer additive
set-labeling such that the induced function $f^+:E(G) \rightarrow
\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}_0)$ defined by $f^+ (uv) = f(u)+ f(v)$ is also
injective. In this paper, we extend the concepts of set-sequential labeling to
integer additive set-labelings of graphs and provide some results on them.
