We obtain the solution for non-extremal charged rotating black holes in
seven-dimensional gauged supergravity, in the case where the three rotation
parameters are set equal. There are two independent charges, corresponding to
gauge fields in the U(1)xU(1) abelian subgroup of the SO(5) gauge group. A new
feature in these solutions, not seen previously in lower-dimensional examples,
is that the first-order "odd-dimensional self-duality" equation for the 4-form
field strength plays a non-trivial role. We also study the BPS limit of our
solutions where the black holes become supersymmetric. Our results are of
significance for the AdS_7/CFT_6 correspondence in M-theory.
