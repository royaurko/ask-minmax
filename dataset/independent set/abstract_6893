"Control" studies attempts to set the outcome of elections through the
addition, deletion, or partition of voters or candidates. The set of benchmark
control types was largely set in the seminal 1992 paper by Bartholdi, Tovey,
and Trick that introduced control, and there now is a large literature studying
how many of the benchmark types various election systems are vulnerable to,
i.e., have polynomial-time attack algorithms for.
  However, although the longstanding benchmark models of addition and deletion
model relatively well the real-world settings that inspire them, the
longstanding benchmark models of partition model settings that are arguably
quite distant from those they seek to capture.
  In this paper, we introduce--and for some important cases analyze the
complexity of--new partition models that seek to better capture many real-world
partition settings. In particular, in many partition settings one wants the two
parts of the partition to be of (almost) equal size, or is partitioning into
more than two parts, or has groups of actors who must be placed in the same
part of the partition. Our hope is that having these new partition types will
allow studies of control attacks to include such models that more realistically
capture many settings.
