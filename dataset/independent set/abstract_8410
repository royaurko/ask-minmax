For any directed graph G with vertex set V, the graph G^(d) is said to be a
subset power of G and is defined to have vertex set equal to the set of
d-element subsets of V; in G^(d), there is an edge from A to B if and only if
we can label the elements of A and B such that there is an edge in G between
each pair of corresponding elements. We determine the complete cycle structure
of C^(d), where C is a directed cycle of length l.
