We have probed the current-phase relation of an atomic contact placed with a
tunnel junction in a small superconducting loop. The measurements are in
quantitative agreement with the predictions of a resistively shunted SQUID
model in which the Josephson coupling of the contact is calculated using the
independently determined transmissions of its conduction channels.
