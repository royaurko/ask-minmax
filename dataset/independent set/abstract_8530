We call a badly approximable number $decaying$ if, roughly, the Lagrange
constants of integer multiples of that number decay as fast as possible. In
this terminology, a question of Y. Bugeaud ('15) asks to find the Hausdorff
dimension of the set of decaying badly approximable numbers, and also of the
set of badly approximable numbers which are not decaying. We answer both
questions, showing that the Hausdorff dimensions of both sets are equal to one.
Part of our proof utilizes a game which combines the Banach--Mazur game and
Schmidt's game, first introduced in Fishman, Reams, and Simmons (preprint '15).
