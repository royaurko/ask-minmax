Based on the recently considered classical string configurations, in the
framework of the semi-classical limit of the string/gauge theory
correspondence, we describe a procedure for obtaining exact classical string
solutions in general string theory backgrounds, when the string embedding
coordinates depend non-linearly on the worldsheet spatial parameter. The
tensionless limit, corresponding to small t'Hooft coupling on the field theory
side, is also considered. Applying the developed approach, we first reproduce
some known results. Then, we find new string solutions - with two spins in
AdS_5 black hole background and in AdS_5 x S^5 with two spins and up to nine
independent conserved R-charges.
