Motivated by the effective bounds of ordinary differential equations, we
prove an effective version of uniform bounding for partial differential fields
with commuting derivations. More precisely, we provide an upper bound for the
size of finite solution sets of partial differential polynomial equations in
terms of data explicitly given in the equations and independent of parameters.
Our methods also produce an upper bound for the degree of the Zariski closure
of solution sets, whether they are finite or not.
