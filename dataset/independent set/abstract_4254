We calculate an $s$-wave amplitude matrix for all the possible 2--to--2 body
scalar boson elastic scatterings in models with three scalar doublets,
including contributions from the longitudinal component of weak gauge bosons
via the Equivalence Theorem Approximation. Specifically, we concentrate on the
two cases with two[one] active plus one[two] inert doublet fields, referred to
as I(1+2)HDM[I(2+1)HDM], under CP conservation. We obtain three analytically
irreducible sub-matrices with the $3\times 3$ form and eighteen eigenvalues for
the amplitude matrix as an independent set, where the same formula can be
applied to both models. By requiring a perturbative unitarity condition, we can
constrain the magnitude of quartic coupling constants in the Higgs potential.
This constraint, in particular in the I(1+2)HDM, can be translated into a bound
on masses of extra active scalar bosons. Furthermore, when Standard Model-like
Higgs boson couplings with weak gauge bosons are deviated from the Standard
Model predictions, the unitarity condition provides an upper limit on the
masses. We find that stronger upper bounds on the masses of the active CP-even
and CP-odd Higgs bosons are obtained under the constraints from the unitarity
and vacuum stability conditions, as well as the electroweak $S$, $T$ and $U$
parameters, as compared to those in 2-Higgs Doublet Models with a softly-broken
$Z_2$ symmetry.
