Maximum entropy models are the least structured probability distributions
that exactly reproduce a chosen set of statistics measured in an interacting
network. Here we use this principle to construct probabilistic models which
describe the correlated spiking activity of populations of up to 120 neurons in
the salamander retina as it responds to natural movies. Already in groups as
small as 10 neurons, interactions between spikes can no longer be regarded as
small perturbations in an otherwise independent system; for 40 or more neurons
pairwise interactions need to be supplemented by a global interaction that
controls the distribution of synchrony in the population. Here we show that
such "K-pairwise" models--being systematic extensions of the previously used
pairwise Ising models--provide an excellent account of the data. We explore the
properties of the neural vocabulary by: 1) estimating its entropy, which
constrains the population's capacity to represent visual information; 2)
classifying activity patterns into a small set of metastable collective modes;
3) showing that the neural codeword ensembles are extremely inhomogenous; 4)
demonstrating that the state of individual neurons is highly predictable from
the rest of the population, allowing the capacity for error correction.
