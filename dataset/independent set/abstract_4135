We consider the problem of recovering block-sparse signals whose structures
are unknown \emph{a priori}. Block-sparse signals with nonzero coefficients
occurring in clusters arise naturally in many practical scenarios. However, the
knowledge of the block structure is usually unavailable in practice. In this
paper, we develop a new sparse Bayesian learning method for recovery of
block-sparse signals with unknown cluster patterns. Specifically, a
pattern-coupled hierarchical Gaussian prior model is introduced to characterize
the statistical dependencies among coefficients, in which a set of
hyperparameters are employed to control the sparsity of signal coefficients.
Unlike the conventional sparse Bayesian learning framework in which each
individual hyperparameter is associated independently with each coefficient, in
this paper, the prior for each coefficient not only involves its own
hyperparameter, but also the hyperparameters of its immediate neighbors. In
doing this way, the sparsity patterns of neighboring coefficients are related
to each other and the hierarchical model has the potential to encourage
structured-sparse solutions. The hyperparameters, along with the sparse signal,
are learned by maximizing their posterior probability via an
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Numerical results show that the
proposed algorithm presents uniform superiority over other existing methods in
a series of experiments.
