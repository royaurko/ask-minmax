In this paper, we prove that the singular set of a harmonic map from a smooth
Riemannian domain to the Weil-Petersson completion of Teichmuller space has
Hausdorff codimension at at least 2, and moreover, it has certain decay near
the singular set. Combined with the earlier work of Schumacher and Jost-Yau,
this implies the holomorphic rigidity of Teichmuller space. In addition, our
results provide a harmonic maps proof of both the high rank and the rank one
superrigidity of the mapping class group proved via other methods by Farb-Masur
and Yeung.
