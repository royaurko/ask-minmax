We present a TeV scale model for leptogenesis where the origin of neutrino
masses are independent of the scale of leptogenesis. As a result, the model
could be extended to explain {\it dark matter, neutrino masses and leptogenesis
at the TeV scale}. The most attractive feature of this model is that it
predicts a few hundred GeV triplet Higgs scalar that can be tested at LHC or
ILC.
