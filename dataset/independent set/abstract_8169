In this paper we prove that if f is a planar K-quasiconformal map and 0<t<2,
t' = 2t/(2K-Kt+t), then f transforms sets of finite (t')-Hausdorff measure into
sets of finite t-Hausdorff measure. We also prove the following more
quantitative statement: If E is a planar set, then H^t(E) \leq C(K)
H^{t'}(f(E))^{t/(t'K)}, where H^s stands for the s-Hausdorff measure.
