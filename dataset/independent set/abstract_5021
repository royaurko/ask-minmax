We show that one single experiment can test simultaneously and independently
both the nonclassicality of states and measurements by the violation or
fulfillment of classical bounds on the statistics. Nonideal measurements
affected by imperfections can be characterized by two bounds depending on
whether we test the ideal measurement or the real one.
