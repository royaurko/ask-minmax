In this paper we study a new class of statistical models for contingency
tables. We define this class of models through a subset of the binomial
equations of the classical independence model. We use some notions from
Algebraic Statistics to compute their sufficient statistic, and to prove that
they are log-linear. Moreover, we show how to compute maximum likelihood
estimates and to perform exact inference through the Diaconis-Sturmfels
algorithm. Examples show that these models can be useful in a wide range of
applications.
