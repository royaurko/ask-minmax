Fractionally charged quasiparticles in edge states, are expected to condense
to a chiral Luttinger liquid (CLL). We studied their condensation by measuring
the conductance and shot noise due to an artificial backscatterer embedded in
their path. At sufficiently low temperatures backscattering events were found
to be strongly correlated, producing a highly non-linear current-voltage
characteristic and a non-classical shot noise - both are expected in a CLL.
When, however, the impinging beam of quasiparticles was made dilute, either
artificially via an additional weak backscatterer or by increasing the
temperature, the resultant outgoing noise was classical, indicating the
scattering of independent quasiparticles. Here, we study in some detail this
surprising crossover from correlated particle behavior to an independent
behavior, as function of beam dilution.
