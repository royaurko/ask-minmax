IFG logic is a variant of the independence-friendly logic of Hintikka and
Sandu. We answer the question: ``Which IFG-formulas are equivalent to ordinary
first-order formulas?'' We use the answer to show that the ordinary cylindric
set algebra over a structure can be embedded into a reduct of the IFG-cylindric
set algebra over the structure.
