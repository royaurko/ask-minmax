A submonoid A of N^d has a natural order defined by a <= a + b for elements a
and b of A. The Frobenius complex is the order complex of an open interval of A
with respect to this order. In this paper, the homotopy type of the Frobenius
complex of A is determined when A is the submonoid of N generated by two
relatively prime integers, or the submonoid of N^2 generated by three elements
of which any two are linearly independent. As an application, the multigraded
Poincare series of the quotient algebra K[x, y, z] / (x^p y^q - z^r) over a
field K is determined and proved to be rational.
