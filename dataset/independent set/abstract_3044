Recently, we have experimentally demonstrated a continuous loading mechanism
for an optical dipole trap from a guided atomic beam [1]. The observed
evolution of the number of atoms and temperature in the trap are consequences
of the unusual trap geometry. In the present paper, we develop a model based on
a set of rate equations to describe the loading dynamics of such a mechanism.
We consider the collision statistics in the non-uniform trap potential that
leads to twodimensional evaporation. The comparison between the resulting
computations and experimental data allows to identify the dominant loss process
and suggests ways to enhance the achievable steady-state atom number.
Concerning subsequent evaporative cooling, we ?nd that the possibility of
controlling axial and radial confinement independently allows faster
evaporation ramps compared to single beam optical dipole traps.
