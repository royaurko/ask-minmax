We study convergence of return- and hitting-time distributions of small sets
in recurrent dynamical systems preserving an infinite measure $\mu$. In the
presence of a Darling-Kac set with regularly varying wandering rate there is a
scaling function suitable for all its subsets. In this case, we show that
return distributions for a sequence $(E_{k})$ of sets with
$\mu(E_{k})\rightarrow 0$ converge iff the corresponding hitting time
distributions do, and we derive an explicit relation between the two limit
laws. Some consequences of this result are discussed.
