A new achievable rate for bit-metric decoding (BMD) is derived using random
coding arguments. The rate expression can be evaluated for any input
distribution, and in particular the bit-levels of binary input labels can be
stochastically dependent. Probabilistic shaping with dependent bit-levels
(shaped BMD), shaping of independent bit-levels (bit-shaped BMD) and uniformly
distributed independent bit-levels (uniform BMD) are evaluated on the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with bipolar amplitude shift keying (ASK).
For 32-ASK at a rate of 3.8 bits/channel use, the gap to 32-ASK capacity is
0.008 dB for shaped BMD, 0.46 dB for bit-shaped BMD, and 1.42 dB for uniform
BMD. These numerical results illustrate that dependence between the bit-levels
is beneficial on the AWGN channel. The relation to the generalized mutual
information (GMI) is discussed.
