The southern site of the Pierre Auger Observatory is under the construction
near Malargue in Argentina and now more than 60% of the detectors are
completed. The observatory has been collecting data for over 1 year and the
cumulative exposure is already similar to that of the largest forerunner
experiments. The hybrid technique provides model-independent energy
measurements from the Fluorescence Detector to calibrate the Surface Detector.
Based on this technique, the first estimation of the energy spectrum above 3
EeV has been presented and is discussed in this paper.
