A simple three rules supplemented by five steps scheme is proposed to produce
Kochen-Specker (KS) sets with 30 rank-2 projectors that occur twice each. The
KS sets provide state-independent proof of KS theorem based on a system of
three qubits. A small adjustment of the scheme enables us to manually generate
a large number of KS sets with a mixture of rank-1 and rank-2 projectors.
