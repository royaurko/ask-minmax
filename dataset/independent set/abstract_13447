We study the thermal phase transition in colour SU(3) Quantum Chromodynamics
(QCD) with a variable number of fermions in the fundamental representation by
using lattice Monte-Carlo simulations. We collect the (pseudo) critical
couplings for N_f=(0, 4, 6,8), and we investigate the pre-conformal dynamics
associated with the infra-red fixed point in terms of the N_f dependence of the
transition temperature. We propose three independent estimates of the number of
flavour N_f^* where the conformal phase would emerge, which give consistent
results within the largish errors. We consider lines of fixed N_t in the space
of (N_f, bare lattice coupling), and locate the vanishing of the step scaling
function for N_f^*\sim 11.1\pm 1.6. We define a typical interaction strength
(g_TC) at the scale of critical temperature T_c, and we find that g_TC meets
the zero temperature critical couplings estimated by the two-loop Schwinger
Dyson equation or the IRFP coupling in the four-loop beta-function at N_f^*\sim
12.5\pm 0.7. Further, we study the N_f dependences of T_c/M where M is a UV N_f
independent reference scale determined by utilising the coupling at the scale
of the lattice spacing. Then, T_c/M turns out to be a decreasing function of
N_f, and the vanishing T_c/M indicates the emergence of the conformal window at
N_f^* \sim 10.4 \pm 1.2.
