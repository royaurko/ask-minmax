A long, relativistic charged particle beam propagating in a plasma is subject
to the self-modulation instability. This instability is analyzed and the growth
rate is calculated, including the phase relation. The phase velocity of the
accelerating field is shown to be significantly less than the drive beam
velocity. These results indicate that the energy gain of a plasma accelerator
driven by a self-modulated beam will be severely limited by dephasing. In the
long-beam, strongly-coupled regime, dephasing is reached in less than four
e-foldings, independent of beam-plasma parameters.
