A crucial ingredient in the recent discovery by Ablowitz, Halburd, Herbst and
Korhonen \cite{AHH}, \cite {HK-2} that a connection exists between discrete
Painlev\'e equations and (finite order) Nevanlinna theory is an estimate of the
integrated average of $\log^+|f(z+1)/f(z)|$ on $|z|=r$. We obtained essentially
the same estimate in our previous paper \cite{CF} independent of Halburd et al
\cite{HK-1}. We continue our study in this paper by establishing complete
asymptotic relations amongst the logarithmic differences, difference quotients
and logarithmic derivatives for finite order meromorphic functions. In addition
to the potential applications of our new estimates in integrable systems, they
are also of independent interest. In particular, our findings show that there
are marked differences between the growth of meromorphic functions with
Nevanlinna order smaller and greater than one. We have established a
"difference" analogue of the classical Wiman-Valiron type estimates for
meromorphic functions with order less than one, which allow us to prove all
entire solutions of linear difference equations (with polynomial coefficients)
of order less than one must have positive rational order of growth. We have
also established that any entire solution to a first order algebraic difference
equation (with polynomial coefficients) must have a positive order of growth,
which is a "difference" analogue of a classical result of P\'olya.
