The confusion and ambiguity encountered by students, in understanding virtual
displacement and virtual work, is discussed in this article. A definition of
virtual displacement is presented that allows one to express them explicitly
for holonomic (velocity independent), non-holonomic (velocity dependent),
scleronomous (time independent) and rheonomous (time dependent) constraints. It
is observed that for holonomic, scleronomous constraints, the virtual
displacements are the displacements allowed by the constraints. However, this
is not so for a general class of constraints. For simple physical systems, it
is shown that, the work done by the constraint forces on virtual displacements
is zero. This motivates Lagrange's extension of d'Alembert's principle to
system of particles in constrained motion. However a similar zero work
principle does not hold for the allowed displacements. It is also demonstrated
that d'Alembert's principle of zero virtual work is necessary for the
solvability of a constrained mechanical problem. We identify this special class
of constraints, physically realized and solvable, as {\it the ideal
constraints}. The concept of virtual displacement and the principle of zero
virtual work by constraint forces are central to both Lagrange's method of
undetermined multipliers, and Lagrange's equations in generalized coordinates.
