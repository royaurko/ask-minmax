Sets with many additive quadruples are guaranteed to have many additive
octuples, by H\"{o}lder's inequality. Sets with not many more than this are
said to be additively nonsmoothing. We give a new proof of a structural theorem
for nonsmoothing sets that originally appeared in work of the contributors
(\cite{BK}) on the size of cap sets in $F_3 ^N$.
