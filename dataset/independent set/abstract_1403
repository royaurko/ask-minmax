We further investigate slowing down of acceleration of the universe scenario
for five parametrizations of the equation of state of dark energy using four
sets of supernovae data. In a maximal probability analysis we also use the
baryon acoustic oscillation and cosmic microwave background observations. We
found the low redshift transition of the deceleration parameter appears,
independently of the parametrization, using supernovae data alone except for
the Union 2.1 sample. This feature disappears once we combine the supernova
data with high redshift data. We conclude that the rapid variation of the
deceleration parameter is independent of the parametrization. We also found
more evidence for a tension among the supernovae samples, as well as for the
low and high redshift data.
