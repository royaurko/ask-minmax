We employ the familiar canonical quantization procedure in a given
cosmological setting to argue that it is equivalent to and results in the same
physical picture if one considers the deformation of the phase-space instead.
To show this we use a Probabilistic Evolutionary Process (PEP) to make the
solutions of these different approaches comparable. Specific model theories are
used to show that the independent solutions of the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt
equation are equivalent to solutions of the deformation method with different
signs for the deformation parameter. We also argued that since the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation is a direct consequence of diffeomorphism invariance,
this equivalence is only true provided that the deformation of phase-space does
not break such an invariance.
