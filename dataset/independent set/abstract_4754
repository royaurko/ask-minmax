In the causal set approach, spacetime is a continuous approximation of a
faithful embedded causal set. But the faithful embedded causal set describes
the empty spacetime and cannot describe matter. Only faithful embedding of
coarse grained causal set is necessary for the emergence of spacetime. The
initial causal set can be unfaithfully embedded. The following properties of
the universe can be the consequences of the unfaithful embedding:
antiparticles, fields of interactions, the inhomogeneous distribution of the
matter.
