We investigate the interplay between chiral symmetry restoration and
deconfinement both in two color QCD and adjoint QCD. In ordinary QCD we show
how the behavior of the Polyakov loop near chiral phase transition is induced
by the chiral order parameter, while in adjoint two color QCD one has two truly
independent phase transitions. Introducing a finite baryochemical potential we
find that adjoint QCD exhibits tetracritical behavior.
