The central engine of the the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies is being probed.
We use the ASCA and RXTE data to model the X-ray primary continuum as well as
the reflected component and iron $K\alpha$ line. Since these are strongly
coupled, we obtain independent measurements of the disc ionization level and
the orientation dependent reflection amplitude. Using the available Optical/UV
data we also estimate the black hole masses and the $L/L_{Edd}$ ratios, which
are probably related to Boroson & Green eigenvector~1.
