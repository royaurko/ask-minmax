We consider continuous-time random interlacements on Z^d, d greater or equal
to 3, and investigate the percolation model where a site x of Z^d is occupied
if the total amount of time spent at x by all the trajectories of the
interlacement at level u > 0 exceeds some given non-negative parameter, and
empty otherwise. Thus, the set of occupied sites forms a subset of the
interlacement at level u. We also investigate percolation properties of empty
sites. A recent isomorphism theorem arXiv:1111.4818 of Sznitman enables us to
"translate" some of the relevant questions into the language of level-set
percolation for the Gaussian free field on Z^d, d greater or equal to 3, for
which useful tools have been developed in arXiv:1202.5172. We also gain new
insights of independent interest concerning "two-sided" level-set percolation,
where a site x of Z^d is occupied if and only if the absolute value of the
field variable at that site exceeds a given non-negative level.
