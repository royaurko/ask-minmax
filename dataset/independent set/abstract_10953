Starting from the bi-local Klein-Gordon Equation with spin-independent
squared-mass operator, we give a covariant quark representation of general
composite meson systems with definite Lorentz transformation properties. For
benefit of this representation we are able to deduce automatically the
transformation rules of composite mesons for general symmetry operations from
those of constituent (exciton) quarks. Applying this we investigate especially
physical implication of chiral symmetry for the meson systems, and present a
covariant level-classification scheme, leading to a possible existence of new
meson multiplets of "chiralons."
