The expected supremum of a Gaussian process indexed by the image of an index
set under a function class is bounded in terms of separate properties of the
index set and the function class. The bound is relevant to the estimation of
nonlinear transformations or the analysis of learning algorithms whenever
hypotheses are chosen from composite classes, as is the case for multi-layer
models.
