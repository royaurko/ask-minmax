The PHOBOS experiment at RHIC has measured the total multiplicity of primary
charged particles as a function of collision centrality in Au+Au collisions at
sqrt(s_NN) = 19.6, 130 and 200 GeV. Above sqrt(s_NN) ~ 20 GeV, the total
multiplicity per participating nucleon pair (<N_ch>/<N_part/2>) in central
events scales with sqrt(s) in the same way as <N_ch> in e+e- data. This is
suggestive of a universal mechanism of particle production in
strongly-interacting systems, controlled mainly by the amount of energy
available for particle production (per participant pair for heavy ion
collisions). The same effect has been observed in pp/pbar-p data after
correcting for the energy taken away by leading particles. An approximate
independence of <N_ch>/<N_part/2> on the number of participating nucleons is
also observed, reminiscent of ``wounded nucleon'' scaling (<N_ch> proportional
to <N_part>), but with the constant of proportionality set by the multiplicity
measured in e+e- data rather than by pp/pbar-p data.
