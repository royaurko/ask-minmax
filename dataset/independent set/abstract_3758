The strange-anticharmed Pentaquark is a uud(cbar)s or udd(cbar)s five-quark
baryon that is expected to be either a narrow resonance, or possibly even
stable against strong decay. We describe this hyperon here; its structure,
binding energy and lifetime, resonance width, production mechanisms and decay
modes. We estimate production cross sections, techniques to reduce backgrounds
in search experiments, and how to optimize experiments to observe it.
Possibilities for enhancing the signal over background in Pentaquark searches
are investigated by examining predictions for detailed momentum and angular
distributions in multiparticle final states. General model-independent
predictions are presented as well as those from two models: a loosely bound
Ds-N "deuteron" and a strongly-bound five-quark model. Fermilab E791 data,
currently being analysed, may be marginal for showing definitive signals.
Future experiments with more than 10^5 reconstructed charmed baryon events
should have sensitivity to determine whether or not the Pentaquark exists.
