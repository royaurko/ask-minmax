We propose a robust classification algorithm for curves in 2D and 3D, under
the special and full groups of affine transformations. To each plane or spatial
curve we assign a plane signature curve. Curves, equivalent under an affine
transformation, have the same signature. The signatures introduced in this
paper are based on integral invariants, which behave much better on noisy
images than classically known differential invariants. The comparison with
other types of invariants is given in the introduction. Though the integral
invariants for planar curves were known before, the affine integral invariants
for spatial curves are proposed here for the first time. Using the inductive
variation of the moving frame method we compute affine invariants in terms of
Euclidean invariants. We present two types of signatures, the global signature
and the local signature. Both signatures are independent of parameterization
(curve sampling). The global signature depends on the choice of the initial
point and does not allow us to compare fragments of curves, and is therefore
sensitive to occlusions. The local signature, although is slightly more
sensitive to noise, is independent of the choice of the initial point and is
not sensitive to occlusions in an image. It helps establish local equivalence
of curves. The robustness of these invariants and signatures in their
application to the problem of classification of noisy spatial curves extracted
from a 3D object is analyzed.
