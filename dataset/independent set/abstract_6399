This report shows the latest results on the study of the method to determine
the angle phi_3 of the unitarity triangle using Dalitz plot analysis of $D^0$
decay from B->DK process in a model-independent way. We concentrate on the case
with a limited charm data sample, which will be available from the CLEO-c
collaboration in the nearest future, with the main goal to find the optimal
strategy for phi_3 extraction. We find that the analysis using decays of D_CP
only cannot provide a completely model-independent measurement in the case of
limited data sample. The procedure involving binned analysis of B->DK and
psi(3770)->(K^0_S pi^+ pi^-)_D(K^0_S pi^+ pi^-)_D decays is proposed, that
allows to obtain the phi_3 precision comparable to unbinned model-dependent
fit.
