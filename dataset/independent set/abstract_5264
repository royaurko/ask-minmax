We show that every finite-dimensional Euclidean space contains compact
universal differentiability sets of upper Minkowski dimension one. In other
words, there are compact sets $S$ of upper Minkowski dimension one such that
every Lipschitz function defined on the whole space is differentiable inside
$S$. Such sets are constructed explicitly.
