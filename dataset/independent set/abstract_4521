We present initial results on some of the properties of open clusters NGC
6791 and NGC 6819 derived from asteroseismic data obtained by NASA's Kepler
mission. In addition to estimating the mass, radius and log g of stars on the
red-giant branch of these clusters, we estimate the distance to the clusters
and their ages. Our model-independent estimate of the distance modulus of NGC
6791 is (m-M)_0= 13.11\pm 0.06. We find (m-M)_0= 11.85\pm 0.05 for NGC 6819.
The average mass of stars on the red-giant branch of NGC 6791 is 1.20 \pm 0.01
M_sun, while that of NGC 6819 is 1.68\pm 0.03M_sun. It should be noted that we
do not have data that cover the entire red-giant branch and the actual mass
will be somewhat lower. We have determined model-dependent estimates of ages of
these clusters. We find ages between 6.8 and 8.6 Gyr for NGC 6791, however,
most sets of models give ages around 7Gyr. We obtain ages between 2 and 2.4 Gyr
for NGC 6819.
