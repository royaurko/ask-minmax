Let $SP$ be the set of upper strongly porous at $0$ subsets of $\mathbb
R^{+}$ and let $\hat I(SP)$ be the intersection of maximal ideals $I \subseteq
SP$. Some characteristic properties of sets $E\in\hat I(SP)$ are obtained. It
is shown that the ideal generated by the so-called completely strongly porous
at $0$ subsets of $\mathbb R^{+}$ is a proper subideal of $\hat I(SP).$
