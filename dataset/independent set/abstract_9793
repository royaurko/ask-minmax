This article gives a ``fundamental solution'' based energy-norm harmonic
interpolation approach for two half-space settings of interest: the upper-half
$\mathbb{R}^n$ plane, where fundamental solutions satisfy Laplace's equation,
and the upper-half complex plane, where simple poles are of interest. This
approach can handle higher-order pole fits, as well as logarithmic source fits,
in the complex setting and it can handle higher-order multipole fits in the
general real $\mathbb{R}^n$ setting. Higher-order multipoles in the real
$\mathbb{R}^n$ half-space setting are of particular interest since fits based
on a commonly used type of radial-basis function (inverse multiquadrics) can be
reinterpreted as multipole based interpolations that minimize energy forms.
