Here, we report the experimental realization of simultaneous and independent
manipulation of thermal and electric fields with bifunctional metamaterials. A
composite with independently controllable thermal and electric conductivity was
introduced and exploited to achieve independent manipulation of thermal and
electric fields. A bifunctional device capable of shielding thermal flux and
concentrating electric current simultaneously was designed, fabricated and
characterized. This work provides a novel way towards independently tailoring
material properties, which would pave a broad platform for manipulation of
multi-physics field.
