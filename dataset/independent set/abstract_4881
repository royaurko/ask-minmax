The global data on solar neutrino rates and spectrum, including the SNO
charged current rate, can be explained by LMA, LOW or the energy independent
solution -- corresponding to near-maximal mixing. All the three favour a mild
upward renormalisation of the Cl rate. A mild downward shift of the $B$
neutrino flux is favoured by the energy independent and to a lesser extent the
LOW solution, but not by LMA. Comparison with the ratio of SK elastic and SNO
charged current scattering rates favours the LMA over the other two solutions,
but by no more than $1.5\sigma$.
