We continue recent work and formulate the gravitational vacuum Einstein
equations over a locally finite spacetime by using the basic axiomatics,
techniques, ideas and working philosophy of Abstract Differential Geometry. The
whole construction is `fully covariant', `inherently quantum' (both expressions
are analytically explained in the paper) and genuinely smooth background
spacetime independent.
