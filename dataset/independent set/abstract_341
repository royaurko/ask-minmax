In this paper, an analogue of matrix models from free probability is
developed in the bi-free setting. A bi-matrix model is not simply a pair of
matrix models, but a pair of matrix models where one element in the pair acts
by left-multiplication on matrices and the other element acts via a
`twisted'-right action. The asymptotic distributions of bi-matrix models of
Gaussian random variables tend to bi-free central limit distributions with
certain covariance matrices. Furthermore, many classical random matrix results
immediately generalize to the bi-free setting. For example, bi-matrix models of
left and right creation and annihilation operators on a Fock space have joint
distributions equal to left and right creation and annihilation operators on a
Fock space and are bi-freely independent from the left and right action of
scalar matrices. Similar results hold for bi-matrix models of $q$-deformed left
and right creation and annihilation operators provided asymptotic limits are
considered. Finally bi-matrix models with asymptotic limits equal to Boolean
independent central limit distributions and monotonically independent central
limit distributions are constructed.
