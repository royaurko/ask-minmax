We compute the entanglement entropy, in real space, of the ground state of
the integer Quantum Hall states for three different domains embedded in the
torus, the disk and the sphere. We establish the validity of the area law with
a vanishing value of the topological entanglement entropy. The entropy per unit
length of the perimeter depends on the filling fraction, but it is independent
of the geometry.
