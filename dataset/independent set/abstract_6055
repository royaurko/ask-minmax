We give a sufficient condition for an algebraic structure to have a
computable presentation with a computable basis and a computable presentation
with no computable basis. We apply the condition to differentially closed, real
closed, and difference closed fields with the relevant notions of independence.
To cover these classes of structures we introduce a new technique of safe
extensions that was not necessary for the previously known results of this
kind. We will then apply our techniques to derive new corollaries on the number
of computable presentations of these structures. The condition also implies
classical and new results on vector spaces, algebraically closed fields,
torsion-free abelian groups and Archimedean ordered abelian groups.
