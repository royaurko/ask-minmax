In this work I look at the distribution of primes by calculation of an
infinite number of intersections. For this I use the set of all numbers which
are not elements of a certain times table in each case. I am able to show that
it exists a recursive relationship between primes of different ranges and so to
describe some inner structure of this special set of numbers.
