We explore the phenomenological implications on charged lepton flavor
violating (LFV) processes from slepton flavor mixing within the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. We work under the model-independent hypothesis
of general flavor mixing in the slepton sector, being parametrized by a
complete set of dimensionless delta^AB_ij (A,B = L,R; i,j = 1, 2, 3)
parameters. The present upper bounds on the most relevant LFV processes,
together with the requirement of compatibility in the choice of the MSSM
parameters with the recent LHC and (g-2) data, lead to updated constraints on
all slepton flavor mixing parameters. A comparative discussion of the most
effective LFV processes to constrain the various generation mixings is
included.
