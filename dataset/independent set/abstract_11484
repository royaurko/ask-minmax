Stemming from simple postulates of nondecelerative nature of the universe
expansion and Vaidya metric application, the paper offers some dependences and
relations between the gravity and weak interactions. It presents a mode of
independent determination of the mass of vector bosons Z and W, and it derives
the time of separation of electromagnetic and weak interactions. Comparisons of
theoretically derived and experimentally obtained data indicate the relevancy
of the used mode and provide a hint for further investigation.
