We propose a new technique which enables an event-by-event selection of
neutrino-hydrogen interactions in multi-nuclear targets and thereby allows
application of hydrogen as targets in experiments with neutrino beams without
involving cryogenics or high pressure hydrogen gas. This technique could
significantly improve the reconstruction of the neutrino energy spectra. Since
it allows a separation between hydrogen and the accompanying nuclei, this
technique also enables us to measure nuclear effects in neutrino interactions
directly.
