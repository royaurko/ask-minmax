In the present work we show that the local generalized monotonicity of a
lower semicontinuous set-valued operator on some certain type of dense sets
ensures the global generalized monotonicity of that operator. We achieve this
goal gradually by showing at first that the lower semicontinuous set-valued
functions of one real variable, which are locally generalized monotone on a
dense subsets of their domain are globally generalized monotone. Then, these
results are extended to the case of set-valued operators on arbitrary Banach
spaces. We close this work with a section on the global generalized convexity
of a real valued function, which is obtained out of its local counterpart on
some dense sets.
