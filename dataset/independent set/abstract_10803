These are remarks (mainly on the solar neutrinos) written in anticipation of
1996 - the year which can be crucial for the neutrino physics. Recent results
on solar neutrinos are discussed. The topics include: (solar) model independent
approach to the solar neutrino problem, status of different solutions of the
problem, standard and non-standard scenarios of the lepton mixing, light
singlet fermions and the neutrino phenomenology.
