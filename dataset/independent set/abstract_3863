We perform euclidean strong coupling expansions for Yang Mills theory on the
lattice at finite temperature. After setting up the formalism for general
SU(N), we compute the first few terms of the series for the free energy density
and the lowest screening mass in the case of SU(2). To next-to-leading order
the free energy series agrees with that of an ideal gas of glueballs. This
demonstrates that in the confined phase the quasi-particles indeed correspond
to the T=0 hadron excitations, as commonly assumed in hadron resonance gas
models. Our result also fixes the lower integration constant for Monte Carlo
calculations of the thermodynamic pressure via the integral method. In accord
with Monte Carlo results, we find screening masses to be nearly temperature
independent in the confined phase. This and the exponential smallness of the
pressure can be understood as genuine strong coupling effects. Finally, we
analyse Pade approximants to estimate the critical couplings of the phase
transition, which for our short series are only ~25% accurate. However, up to
these couplings the equation of state agrees quantitatively with numerical
results on N_t=1-4 lattices.
