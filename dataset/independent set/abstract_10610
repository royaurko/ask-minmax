We calculate the explicit probability distribution function for the flux
between sites in a simple discrete time diffusive system composed of
independent random walkers. We highlight some of the features of the
distribution and we discuss its relation to the local instantaneous entropy
production in the system. Our results are applicable both to equilibrium and
non-equilibrium steady states as well as for certain time dependent situations.
