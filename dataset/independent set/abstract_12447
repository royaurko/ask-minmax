In this paper we introduce a new sequence of quantities for random polytopes.
Let $K_N=\conv\{X_1,...,X_N\}$ be a random polytope generated by independent
random vectors uniformly distributed in an isotropic convex body $K$ of $\R^n$.
We prove that the so-called $k$-th mean outer radius $\widetilde R_k(K_N)$ has
order $\max\{\sqrt{k},\sqrt{\log N}\}L_K$ with high probability if $n^2\leq
N\leq e^{\sqrt{n}}$. We also show that this is also the right order of the
expected value of $\widetilde R_k(K_N)$ in the full range $n\leq N\leq
e^{\sqrt{n}}$.
