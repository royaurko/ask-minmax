Ray stability is investigated in environments consisting of a
range-independent background sound-speed profile on which a range-dependent
perturbation, such as that produced by internal waves in deep ocean
environments, is superimposed. Numerical results show that ray stability is
strongly influenced by the background sound speed profile. Ray instability is
shown to increase with increasing magnitude of alpha := I omega^{prime} /
omega, where 2 pi / omega(I) is the range of a ray double loop and I is the ray
action variable. The mechanism, shear-induced instability enhancement, by which
alpha controls ray instability is described.
