To a set $\mathcal{B}$ of 4-subsets of a set $\Omega$ of size $n$ we
introduce an invariant called the `puzzle group' which generalises a
construction of Conway, Elkies and Martin of the Mathieu group $M_{12}$ based
on Loyd's "15 puzzle". It is shown that puzzle groups may be regarded as
objects inside an objective partial group (in the sense of Chermak). We
classify pairs $(\Omega,\mathcal{B})$ with a trivial puzzle group, and
determine all puzzle groups associated to $2$-$(n,4,\lambda)$ designs with
$\lambda \leq 2$.
