Fractal sets, by definition, are non-differentiable, however their dimension
can be continuous, differentiable, and arithmetically manipulable as function
of their construction parameters. A new arithmetic for fractal dimension of
polyadic Cantor sets is introduced by means of properly defining operators for
the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The new operators have
the usual properties of the corresponding operations with real numbers. The
combination of an infinitesimal change of fractal dimension with these
arithmetic operators allows the manipulation of fractal dimension with the
tools of calculus.
