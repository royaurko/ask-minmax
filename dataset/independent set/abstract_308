Recently Schrijver's open problem, whether the Chv\'atal--Gomory closure of
an irrational polytope is polyhedral was answered independently in the
affirmative by Dadush, Dey, and Vielma (even for arbitrarily compact convex
set) as well as by Dunkel and Schulz. We present a very short, easily accesible
proof that the Chv\'atal--Gomory closure of a compact convex set is a polytope.
