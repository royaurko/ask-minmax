We present the results of our investigation of the composition of the diffuse
soft X-ray background emission (SXRB). Combining data of the Leiden/Dwingeloo
HI Survey and the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), we set up a radiation transport
equation in order to model the SXRB. Two different techniques lead to the model
parameters: An image oriented approach which compares observed and modeled maps
of the 1/4 and 3/4 keV X-ray energy regime and a more analytic approach using
scatter diagrams. The analysis shows that only three independent components of
the emitting plasma (local, halo and extragalactic) are needed to explain the
SXRB. The results for the temperatures and X-ray intensities, which
characterize the three components, are given and compared to an alternative
model.
