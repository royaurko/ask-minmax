In order to estimate the specific intrinsic volumes of a planar Boolean model
from a binary image, we consider local digital algorithms based on weighted
sums of $2\times 2$ configuration counts. For Boolean models with balls as
grains, explicit formulas for the bias of such algorithms are derived,
resulting in a set of linear equations that the weights must satisfy in order
to minimize the bias in high resolution. These results generalize to larger
classes of random sets, as well as to the design based situation, where a fixed
set is observed on a stationary isotropic lattice. Finally, the formulas for
the bias obtained for Boolean models are applied to existing algorithms in
order to compare their accuracy.
