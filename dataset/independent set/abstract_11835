We study a transmission coefficient of graphene nanoribbons with a top gate
which acts as an oblique barrier. Using a Green function method based on the
Dirac-like equation, scattering among transverse modes due to the oblique
barrier is taken into account numerically. In contrast to the 2-dimensional
graphene sheet, we find that the pattern of transmission in graphene ribbons
depends strongly on the electronic structure in the region of the barrier.
Consequently, irregular structures in the transmission coefficient are
predicted while perfect transmission is still calculated in the case of
metallic graphene independently of angle and length of the oblique barrier.
