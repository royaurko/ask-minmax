We will prove certain general relations in Matrix Product Ansatz for one
dimensional stochastic systems, which are true in both random and sequential
updates. We will derive general MPA expressions for the currents and current
correlators and find the conditions in the MPA formalism, under which the
correlators are site-independent or completely vanishing.
