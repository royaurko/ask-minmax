We consider an $n$-tuple of independent ergodic Markov processes, each of
which converges (in the sense of separation distance) at an exponential rate,
and obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the $n$-tuple to exhibit a
separation cutoff. We also provide general bounds on the (asymmetric) window
size of the cutoff, and indicate links to classical extreme value theory.
