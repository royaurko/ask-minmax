Probing the properties of the discovered Higgs boson may tell us whether or
not it is the particle predicted by the Standard Model. We review a
model-independent approach to parametrize deviations from the Standard Model in
an effective theory framework. We start with a general dimension-6 effective
Lagrangian including both CP-even and CP-odd operators. Requiring that the
operators do not introduce power divergences in the oblique parameters, we
reduce the number of independent couplings of the theory. We then use this
framework to put updated constraints on the effective couplings of the Higgs to
matter, using up-to-date Higgs rates data from ATLAS and CMS and electroweak
precision data from LEP, SLC and Tevatron. We show that the current data is
able to significantly constrain CP-even and some CP-odd operators of the
effective Lagrangian.
