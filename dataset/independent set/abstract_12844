An integral equation method for solving the Yukawa-Beltrami equation on a
multiply-connected sub-manifold of the unit sphere is presented. A fundamental
solution for the Yukawa-Beltrami operator is constructed. This fundamental
solution can be represented by conical functions. Using a suitable
representation formula, a Fredholm equation of the second kind with a compact
integral operator needs to be solved. The discretization of this integral
equation leads to a linear system whose condition number is bounded independent
of the size of the system. Several numerical examples exploring the properties
of this integral equation are presented.
