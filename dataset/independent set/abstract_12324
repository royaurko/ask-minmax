A c.m. energy scan below the J/Psi peak foreseen in the next future at BESIII
can probe the existence in all the exclusive possible final states of an
interference pattern between the resonant e+e- => J/Psi => hadrons and
non-resonant e+e+ => hadrons amplitudes. The relative phase of the strong J/Psi
decay amplitude with respect to the electromagnetic one can hence be accessed
for the first time in a model independent way.
