This paper reviews the history of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly. The
historical record does not support more recent claims that the anomaly
constitutes evidence for a neutrino mass. Most experiments have reported an
apparent muon deficiency which is independent of energy and distance. Time
dependent variations in the Super Kamioka results are noted.
