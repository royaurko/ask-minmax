A system of interacting particles described by stochastic differential
equations is considered. Opposite to the usual scheme, where the noise
perturbations acting on different particles are independent, here the particles
are subject to the same space-dependent noise, similarly to the
(non-interacting) particles of the theory of diffusion of passive scalars. We
prove a result of propagation of chaos and show that the limit PDE is
stochastic and of inviscid type, opposite to the case when independent noises
drive the different particles.
