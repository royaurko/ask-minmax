This paper is a self contained review of the Loop Variable approach to string
theory. The Exact Renormalization Group is applied to a world sheet theory
describing string propagation in a general background involving both massless
and massive modes. This gives interacting equations of motion for the modes of
the string. Loop variable techniques are used to obtain gauge invariant
equations. Since this method is not tied to flat space time or any particular
background metric, it is manifestly background independent. The technique can
be applied to both open and closed strings. Thus gauge invariant and generally
covariant interacting equations of motion can be written for massive higher
spin fields in arbitrary backgrounds. Some explicit examples are given.
