The classical turbulence theory by Kolmogorov is reconsidered using
Navier-Stokes' equation generalized to 6D physical-plus-eddy space. Strong
pseudo-singularity is shown to reveal itself along the boundary `ridge' line
separating the dissipation and inertial sub-ranges surrounding the origin of
the eddy space. A speculation is made that this singularity is generated by two
dipoles of opposite sign aligned on the common axis. It is supported by the
observation that the universal power spectrum calculated rediscovers the
Kolmogorov's -5/3 power law as independent of the dimensional approach.
