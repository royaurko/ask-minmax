We set up an experiment with two independent laser beams that cross at a
small angle, spatially separate, and end at detectors in front of each beam.
The setup allows us to obtain maximum path or which-way information, K=1.
However, when we scan a thin wire across the beam intersection the which-way
information drops to K=0.985. The thin wire serves to verify the presence of an
interference pattern with visibility, V=0.833, at the beam intersection. Our
results appear to be in conflict with the complementarity inequality, V^2+K^2
smaller or equal to 1. We introduce a model that describes a virtual
interference pattern. We resolve our paradoxical findings by proposing that the
complementarity inequality does not apply to virtual interference patterns but
only to physically real ones. We find that the interference pattern in our
setup is virtual.
