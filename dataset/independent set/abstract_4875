A framework named Copula Component Analysis (CCA) for blind source separation
is proposed as a generalization of Independent Component Analysis (ICA). It
differs from ICA which assumes independence of sources that the underlying
components may be dependent with certain structure which is represented by
Copula. By incorporating dependency structure, much accurate estimation can be
made in principle in the case that the assumption of independence is
invalidated. A two phrase inference method is introduced for CCA which is based
on the notion of multidimensional ICA.
