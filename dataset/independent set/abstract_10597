We investigate the origin of the Stokes-Einstein relation in liquids. The
hard-sphere dynamics is analyzed using a new measure of structural relaxation -
the minimum Euclidean distance between configurations of particles. It is shown
that the universal relation between the structural relaxation and diffusion in
liquids is caused by the existence of one dominating length scale imposed by
the structural correlations and associated with de Gennes narrowing. We
demonstrate that this relation can be described by a model of independent
random walkers under the single-occupancy constraint.
