Rough set theory is an important mathematical tool for dealing with uncertain
or vague information. This paper studies some new topologies induced by a
binary relation on universe with respect to neighborhood opera- tors. Moreover,
the relations among them are studied. In additionally, lower and upper
approximations of rough sets using the binary relation with respect to
neighborhood operators are studied and examples are given.
