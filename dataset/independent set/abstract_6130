We show that there exist arbitrarily large sets $S$ of $s$ prime numbers such
that the equation $a+b=c$ has more than $\exp(s^{2-\sqrt{2}-\epsilon})$
solutions in coprime integers $a$, $b$, $c$ all of whose prime factors lie in
the set $S$. We also show that there exist sets $S$ for which the equation
$a+1=c$ has more than $\exp(s^{\frac 1{16}})$ solutions with all prime factors
of $a$ and $c$ lying in $S$.
