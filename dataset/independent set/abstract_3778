Recently, a number of intriguing results have been obtained for strongly
coupled ${\cal N}=4$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in vacuum and matter,
using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In this work, we provide a physical picture
supporting and explaining most of these results within the gauge theory. The
modified Coulomb's law at strong coupling forces static charges to communicate
via the high frequency modes of the gauge/scalar fields. Therefore, the
interaction between even relativistically moving charges can be approximated by
a potential. At strong coupling, WKB arguments yield a series of deeply bound
states, whereby the large Coulomb attraction is balanced by centrifugation. The
result is a constant density of light bound states at {\bf any} value of the
strong coupling, explaining why the thermodynamics and kinetics are coupling
constant independent. In essence, at strong coupling the matter is not made of
the original quasiparticles but of much lighter (binary) composites. A
transition from weak to strong coupling is reminiscent to a transition from
high to low $T$ in QCD. We establish novel results for screening in vacuum and
matter through a dominant set of diagrams some of which are in qualitative
agreement with known strong coupling results.
