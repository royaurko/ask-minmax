The new idea of flip invariance of action functionals in multidimensional
lattices was recently highlighted as a key feature of discrete integrable
systems. Flip invariance was proved for several particular cases of integrable
quad-equations by Bazhanov, Mangazeev and Sergeev and by Lobb and Nijhoff. We
provide a simple and case-independent proof for all integrable quad-equations.
Moreover, we find a new relation for Lagrangians within one elementary
quadrilateral which seems to be a fundamental building block of the various
versions of flip invariance.
