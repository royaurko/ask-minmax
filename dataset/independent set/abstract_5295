It it known that the set of L-space surgeries on a nontrivial L-space knot is
always bounded from below. However, already for two-component torus links the
set of L-space surgeries is unbounded from below. We provide a sufficient
condition for boundedness in terms of the Alexander polynomial. Using it, we
prove that the set of L-space surgeries is bounded from below for most
algebraic links.
