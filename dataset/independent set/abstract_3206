A search for three-jet hadronic resonance production in pp collisions at a
centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV has been conducted by the CMS Collaboration at
the LHC with a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.4
inverse femtobarns. The search method is model independent, and events are
selected that have high jet multiplicity and large values of jet transverse
momenta. The signal models explored assume R-parity-violating supersymmetric
gluino pair production and have final states with either only light-flavour
jets or both light- and heavy-flavour jets. No significant deviation is found
between the selected events and the expected standard model multijet and t
t-bar quark background. For a gluino decaying into light-flavour jets, a lower
limit of 650 GeV on the gluino mass is set at a 95% confidence level, and for a
gluino decaying into one heavy- and two light-flavour jets, gluino masses
between 200 and 835 GeV are, for the first time, likewise excluded.
