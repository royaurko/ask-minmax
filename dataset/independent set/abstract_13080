We obtain a Lundberg-type inequality in the case of an inhomogeneous renewal
risk model. We consider the model with independent, but not necessarily
identically distributed, claim sizes and the interoccurrence times. In order to
prove the main theorem, we first formulate and prove an auxiliary lemma on
large values of a sum of random variables asymptotically drifted in the
negative direction.
