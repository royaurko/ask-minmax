A variationally improved Sturmian approximation for solving time-independent
Schr\"odinger equation is developed. This approximation is used to obtain the
energy levels of a quartic anharmonic oscillator, a quartic potential, and a
Gaussian potential. The results are compared with those of the perturbation
theory, the WKB approximation, and the accurate numerical values.
