We present an algorithm for determining the Lie point symmetries of
differential equations on fixed non transforming lattices, i.e. equations
involving both continuous and discrete independent variables. The symmetries of
a specific integrable discretization of the Krichever-Novikov equation, the
Toda lattice and Toda field theory are presented as examples of the general
method.
