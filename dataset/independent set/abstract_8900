Let f_0 be a plane curve singularity. We study the Minor numbers of
singularities in deformations of f_0. We completely describe the set of these
Milnor numbers for homogeneous singularities f_0 in the case of non-degenerate
deformations and obtain some partial results on this set in the general case.
