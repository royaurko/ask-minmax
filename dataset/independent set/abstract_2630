We investigate a shadowing property which appears naturally in the study of
piecewise monotonic maps of the interval. It turns out to be a weak form of the
rank one property, a well-known notion in abstract ergodic theory. We show that
this new property is implied by finite or even local rank, but that it is
logically independent of loose Bernoulliness. We give (counter)examples,
including L.B. systems with arbitrarily high-order polynomial complexity. The
shadowing property defines a small subset of all zero-entropy systems, in the
sense that it defines a closed set with empty interior with respect to the
$\db$-metric, induced by the Hamming distance. We also make some remarks on the
link between the shadowed system and the sequence assumed by the shadowing
property.
