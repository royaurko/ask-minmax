The first CCD photometric investigation of the open cluster NGC 7296 up to
now was performed within the narrow band Delta a photometric system, which
enables us to detect peculiar objects. A deeper investigation of that cluster
followed, using the standard BVR-Bessel filter set. The age and E(B-V) was
determined independently to log t= 8.0 and 0.15 respectively by using Delta a
and broadband photometry. In total five Be/Ae objects and two metal-weak stars
showing significant negative Delta a-values as well as one classical chemically
peculiar star could be identified within that intermediate age open cluster.
