We study the max-algebraic analogue of equations involving Z-matrices and
M-matrices, with an outlook to a more general algebraic setting. We show that
these equations can be solved using the Frobenius trace down method in a way
similar to that in non-negative linear algebra, characterizing the solvability
in terms of supports and access relations. We give a description of the
solution set as combination of the least solution and the eigenspace of the
matrix, and provide a general algebraic setting in which this result holds.
