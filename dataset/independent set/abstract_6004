Fixed-to-variable length (f2v) matchers are used to reversibly transform an
input sequence of independent and uniformly distributed bits into an output
sequence of bits that are (approximately) independent and distributed according
to a target distribution. The degree of approximation is measured by the
informational divergence between the output distribution and the target
distribution. An algorithm is developed that efficiently finds optimal f2v
codes. It is shown that by encoding the input bits blockwise, the informational
divergence per bit approaches zero as the block length approaches infinity. A
relation to data compression by Tunstall coding is established.
