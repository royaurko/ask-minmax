Kaastra et al. (1999) have used the BeppoSAX LECS instrument to search for
excess EUV emission in Abell 2199. They claim that the results obtained confirm
an independent report of an excess EUV emission in this cluster (Lieu et al.
1999). Using an inflight derived procedure that is better suited to the
analysis of extended sources and which avoids uncertainties related to
ground-based calibrations for the overall detector sensitivity profile, we find
no excess EUV emission in Abell 2199. We also used these procedures to search
for an EUV excess in Abell 1795, but no excess was found.
