We give an equivalent, but simpler formulation of the axiom SEP introduced by
Juhasz and Kunen. Our formulation shows that many of the consequences of the
weak Freese-Nation Property of $\mathcal P(\omega)$ already follow from SEP. We
show that it is consistent that SEP holds while $\mathcal P(\omega)$ fails to
have the $(\aleph_1,\aleph_0)$-ideal property, which has been introduced by
Hart and Dow . This answers a question addressed independently by Fuchino and
by Kunen.
  We also consider some natural variants of SEP and show that certain changes
in the definition of SEP do not lead to a different principle. This answers a
question addressed by Blass.
