This article is devoted to the study of the historic set, which was
introduced by Ruelle, of Birkhoff averges in some nonuniformly hyperbolic
systems via Pesin theory. Particularly, we give a conditional variational
principle for historic sets. Our results can be applied (i) to the
diffeomorphisms on surfaces, (ii) to the nonuniformly hyperbolic
diffeomorphisms described by Katok and several other classes of diffeomorphisms
derived from Anosov systems.
