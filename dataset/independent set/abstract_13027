In this paper, we study modularity of several functions which naturally arose
in a recent paper of Lau and Zhou on open Gromov-Witten potentials of elliptic
orbifolds. They derived a number of examples of indefinite theta functions, and
we provide modular completions for several such functions which involve more
complicated objects than ordinary modular forms. In particular, we give new
closed formulas for special indefinite theta functions of type $(1,2)$ in terms
of products of mock modular forms. This formula is also of independent
interest.
