The Nekrasov conjecture predicts a relation between the partition function
for N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and the Seiberg-Witten prepotential.
For instantons on R^4, the conjecture was proved, independently and using
different methods, by Nekrasov-Okounkov, Nakajima-Yoshioka, and
Braverman-Etingof. We prove a generalized version of the conjecture for
instantons on noncompact toric surfaces.
