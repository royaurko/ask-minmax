This paper establishes small ball probabilities for a class of time-changed
processes $X\circ E$, where $X$ is a self-similar process and $E$ is an
independent continuous process, each with a certain small ball probability. In
particular, examples of the outer process $X$ and the time change $E$ include
an iterated fractional Brownian motion and the inverse of a general
subordinator with infinite L\'evy measure, respectively. The small ball
probabilities of such time-changed processes show power law decay, and the rate
of decay does not depend on the small deviation order of the outer process $X$,
but on the self-similarity index of $X$.
