In this work we study the dynamics of the maximum extractable entanglement
for a system composed of two qubits interacting either with two independent
thermal baths, a common thermal bath or a common squeezed bath. The states with
maximum entanglement are found applying filtering operations which transform
each state to a state in Bell diagonal form. We observe a revival of the
maximum extractable entanglement for common baths. It is also shown that for
some particular states in two independent baths at zero temperature, one can
partially recover the initial entanglement at any time.
