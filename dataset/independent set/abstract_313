We use recent results on the Fourier analysis of the zero sets of Brownian
motion to explore the diophantine properties of an algorithmically random
Brownian motion (also known as a complex oscillation). We discuss the
construction and definability of perfect sets which are linearly independent
over the rationals directly from Martin-L\"of random reals. Finally we explore
the recent work of Tsirelson on countable dense sets to study the diophantine
properties of local minimisers of Brownian motion.
