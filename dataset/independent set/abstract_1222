A new method for finding first integrals of discrete equations is presented.
It can be used for discrete equations which do not possess a variational
(Lagrangian or Hamiltonian) formulation. The method is based on a newly
established identity which links symmetries of the underlying discrete
equations, solutions of the discrete adjoint equations and first integrals. The
method is applied to invariant mappings and discretizations of a second order
and a third order ODEs. In examples the set of independent first integrals
makes it possible to find the general solution of the discrete equations. The
method is compared to a direct method of constructing first integrals.
