The (projective) convergence set of a divergent formal power series
$f(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ is defined to be the image in $\PP^{n-1}$ of the set of
all $x\in \mathbb{C}^{n}$ such that $f(x_{1}t,...,x_{n}t)$, as a series in $t$,
converges absolutely near $t=0$. We prove that every countable union of closed
complete pluripolar sets in $\PP^{n-1}$ is the convergence set of some
divergent series $f$. The (affine) convergence sets of formal power series with
polynomial coefficients are also studied. The higher-dimensional results of A.
Sathaye, P. Lelong, N. Levenberg and R.E. Molzon, and of J. Rib\'{o}n are thus
generalized.
