Linear optimization problems are investigated whose parameters are uncertain.
We apply coherent distortion risk measures to capture the possible violation of
a restriction. Each risk constraint induces an uncertainty set of coefficients,
which is shown to be a weighted-mean trimmed region. Given an external sample
of the coefficients, an uncertainty set is a convex polytope that can be
exactly calculated. We construct an efficient geometrical algorithm to solve
stochastic linear programs that have a single distortion risk constraint. The
algorithm is available as an R-package. Also the algorithm's asymptotic
behavior is investigated, when the sample is i.i.d. from a general probability
distribution. Finally, we present some computational experience.
