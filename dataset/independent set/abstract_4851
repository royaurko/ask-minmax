The cumulative hierarchy conception of set, which is based on the conception
that sets are inductively generated from "former" sets, is generally considered
a good way to create a set conception that seems safe from contradictions. This
imposes two restrictions on sets. One is a "limitation of size," and the other
is the rejection of non-well-founded sets. Quine's NF system of axioms, does
not have any of the two restrictions, but it has a formal restriction on
allowed formulas in its comprehension axiom schema, which reflects a similar
notion of elements being prior to sets. Here we suggest that a possible reason
for set antinomies is the tension between our perception of sets as entities
formed from elements by an imaginary aggregation operator, and our wish to
regard sets as existing "at once." A new approach to sets as totalities is
presented based on a notion of "concurrent aggregation," which instead of
avoiding "viscous circles," acknowledges the inherent circularities of some
predicates, and provides a way to characterize and investigate these
circularities.
