We extend the study of the de Rham operator with ideal boundary conditions
from the case of isolated conic singularities, as analyzed by Cheeger, to the
case of arbitrary stratified pseudomanifolds. We introduce a class of ideal
boundary operators and the notion of mezzoperversity, which intermediates
between the standard lower and upper middle perversities in intersection
theory, as interpreted in this de Rham setting, and show that the de Rham
operator with these boundary conditions is Fredholm and has compact resolvent.
We also prove an isomorphism between the resulting Hodge and L2 de Rham
cohomology groups, and that these are independent of the choice of iterated
edge metric. On spaces which admit ideal boundary conditions of this type which
are also self-dual, which we call `Cheeger spaces', we show that these Hodge/de
Rham cohomology groups satisfy Poincare Duality.
