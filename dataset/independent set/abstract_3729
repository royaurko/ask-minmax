We report on room temperature ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) studies of [$t$
Co$|2t$ Ni]$\times$N sputtered films, where $0.1 \leq t \leq 0.6$ nm. Two
series of films were investigated: films with same number of Co$|$Ni bilayer
repeats (N=12), and samples in which the overall magnetic layer thickness is
kept constant at 3.6 nm (N=1.2/$t$). The FMR measurements were conducted with a
high frequency broadband coplanar waveguide up to 50 GHz using a flip-chip
method. The resonance field and the full width at half maximum were measured as
a function of frequency for the field in-plane and field normal to the plane,
and as a function of angle to the plane for several frequencies. For both sets
of films, we find evidence for the presence of first and second order
anisotropy constants, $K_1$ and $K_2$. The anisotropy constants are strongly
dependent on the thickness $t$, and to a lesser extent on the total thickness
of the magnetic multilayer. The Land\'e g-factor increases with decreasing $t$
and is practically independent of the multilayer thickness. The magnetic
damping parameter $\alpha$, estimated from the linear dependence of the
linewidth, $\triangle H$, on frequency, in the field in-plane geometry,
increases with decreasing $t$. This behaviour is attributed to an enhancement
of spin-orbit interactions with $t$ decreasing and in thinner films, to a
spin-pumping contribution to the damping.
