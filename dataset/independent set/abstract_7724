We present two independent approaches for computing the thermodynamics for
classical particles interacting via the Moser--Calogero potential. Combining
the results we propose the form of equation of state or, what is equivalent,
the asymptotics of the Jacobian between volume elements corresponding two
symplectic structures on the phase space.
