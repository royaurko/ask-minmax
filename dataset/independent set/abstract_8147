Number Decision Diagrams (NDD) provide a natural finite symbolic
representation for regular set of integer vectors encoded as strings of digit
vectors (least or most significant digit first). The convex hull of the set of
vectors represented by a NDD is proved to be an effectively computable convex
polyhedron.
