In spite of the breakthrough in non-perturbative chiral gauge theories during
the last decade, the present formulation has stubborn artefacts. Independently
of the fermion representation one is confronted with unwanted CP violation and
infinitely many undetermined weight factors. Renormalization group identifies
the culprit. We demonstrate the procedure on Weyl fermions in a real
representation.
