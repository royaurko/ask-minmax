In this paper we show that the chase technique is powerful enough to capture
the bag-set semantics of conjunctive queries over IDBs and IDs and TGDs. In
addition, we argue that in such cases it provides efficient (LogSpace) query
evaluation algorithms and that, moreover, it can serve as a basis for
evaluating some restricted classes of aggregate queries under incomplete
information.
