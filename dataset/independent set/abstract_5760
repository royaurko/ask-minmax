I evaluate the current results of spin-dependent weakly interacting massive
particle (WIMP) searches within a model-independent framework, showing the most
restrictive limits to date derive from the combination of xenon and sodium
iodide experiments. The extension of this analysis to the case of positive
signal experiments is elaborated.
