The approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) is an important analytic tool at
the base of numerous independent component analysis (ICA) and other blind
source separation (BSS) methods, thus finding more and more applications in
medical imaging analysis. In this work we present a new AJD algorithm named
SDIAG (Spheric Diagonalization). It imposes no constraint either on the input
matrices or on the joint diagonalizer to be estimated, thus it is very general.
Whereas it is well grounded on the classical leastsquares criterion, a new
normalization reveals a very simple form of the solution matrix. Numerical
simulations shown that the algorithm, named SDIAG (spheric diagonalization),
behaves well as compared to state-of-the art AJD algorithms.
