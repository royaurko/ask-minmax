The model-independent solution of the s-channel unitarity condition for the
imaginary part of the hadronic elastic scattering amplitude outside the
diffraction peak allows to make conclusions about its real part at nonzero
transferred momenta. The asymptotical properties of the ratio of the real to
imaginary part of the amplitude are discussed. In particular, it is explicitly
shown that the ratio changes its sign at a defnite value of the transferred
momentum. Some comments concerning the present day experimental results about
the behavior of the differential cross-section of elastic scattering outside
the diffraction cone are given.
