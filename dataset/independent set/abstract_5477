In a polyomino set (1,2)-achievement game the maker and the breaker
alternately mark one and two previously unmarked cells respectively. The
maker's goal is to mark a set of cells congruent to one of a given set of
polyominoes. The breaker tries to prevent the maker from achieving his goal.
The teams of polyominoes for which the maker has a winning strategy is
determined up to size 4. In set achievement games, it is natural to study
infinitely large polyominoes. This enables the construction of super winners
that characterize all winning teams up to a certain size.
