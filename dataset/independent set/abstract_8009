We introduce an equivalence relation, called stable equivalence, on knot
diagrams and closed curves on surfaces. We give bijections between the set of
abstract knots, the set of virtual knots, and the set of the stable equivalence
classes of knot diagrams on surfaces. Using these bijections, we define
concordance and link homology for virtual links. As an application, it is shown
that Kauffman's example of a virtual knot diagram is not equivalent to a
classical knot diagram.
