Monge-Ampere gravitation is a nonlinear modification of classical Newtonian
gravitation, when the Monge-Ampere equation substitutes for the Poisson
equation. We establish, through two applications of the large deviation
principle, that the MA gravitation for a finite number of particles can be
reduced, through a double application of the large deviation principle, to the
simplest possible stochastic model: a collection of independent Brownian
motions with vanishing noise.
