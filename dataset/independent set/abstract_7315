The paper concerns primal and dual representations as well as time
consistency of set-valued dynamic risk measures. Set-valued risk measures
appear naturally when markets with transaction costs are considered and capital
requirements can be made in a basket of currencies or assets. Time consistency
of scalar risk measures can be generalized to set-valued risk measures in
different ways. The most intuitive generalization is called time consistency.
We will show that the equivalence between a recursive form of the risk measure
and time consistency, which is a central result in the scalar case, does not
hold in the set-valued framework. Instead, we propose an alternative
generalization, which we will call multi-portfolio time consistency and show in
the main result of the paper that this property is indeed equivalent to the
recursive form as well as to an additive property for the acceptance sets.
Multi-portfolio time consistency is a stronger property than time consistency.
In the scalar case, both notions coincide.
