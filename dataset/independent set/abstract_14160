Among the lattice loop models defined by Pearce, Rasmussen and Zuber (2006),
the model corresponding to critical dense polymers ($\beta = 0$) is the only
one for which an inversion relation for the transfer matrix $D_N(u)$ was found
by Pearce and Rasmussen (2007). From this result, they identified the set of
possible eigenvalues for $D_N(u)$ and gave a conjecture for the degeneracies of
its relevant eigenvalues in the link representation, in the sector with $d$
defects. In this paper, we set out to prove this conjecture, using the
homomorphism of the $TL_N (\beta)$ algebra between the loop model link
representation and that of the XXZ model for $\beta = -(q+q^{-1})$.
