Let K be the closure of a bounded open set with smooth boundary in C^n. A
Fekete configuration of order p for K is a finite subset of K maximizing the
Vandermonde determinant associated with polynomials of degree at most p. A
recent theorem by Berman, Boucksom and Witt Nystr\"om implies that Fekete
configurations for K are asymptotically equidistributed with respect to a
canonical equilibrium measure, as p tends to infinite. We give here an explicit
estimate for the speed of convergence. The result also holds in a general
setting of Fekete points associated with an ample line bundle over a projective
manifold. Our approach requires a new estimate on Bergman kernels for line
bundles and quantitative results in pluripotential theory which are of
independent interest.
