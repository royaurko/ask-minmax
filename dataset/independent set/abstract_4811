In \cite{SchmidtGames}, W. Schmidt proved that the set of non-normal numbers
in base $b$ is a {\it winning set}. We generalize this result by proving that
many sets of non-normal numbers with respect to the Cantor series expansion are
winning sets. As an immediate consequence, these sets will be shown to have
full Hausdorff dimension.
