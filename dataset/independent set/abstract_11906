Over the past two decades, electron scattering experiments have clearly
exposed the limits of the independent particle model description of atomic
nuclei. I will briefly outline the dynamics leading to the appearance of strong
correlation effects, and their impact on the electroweak nuclear cross sections
in the impulse approximation regime.
