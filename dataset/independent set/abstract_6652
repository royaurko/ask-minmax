In this paper we study the geometric discrepancy of explicit constructions of
uniformly distributed points on the two-dimensional unit sphere. We show that
the spherical cap discrepancy of random point sets, of spherical digital nets
and of spherical Fibonacci lattices converges with order $N^{-1/2}$. Such point
sets are therefore useful for numerical integration and other computational
simulations. The proof uses an area-preserving Lambert map. A detailed analysis
of the level curves and sets of the pre-images of spherical caps under this map
is given.
