If the Einstein field equations are employed at the tree level, then the
decay of the standard model Higgs particle into two gravitons is shown to be
independent of the gravitational coupling strength G. The result follows from
the physical equivalence between the Higgs induced ``inertial mass'' and the
``gravitational mass'' of general relativity. If the Higgs mass lies well
between the mass of a bottom quark anti-quark pair and the mass of a top quark
anti-quark pair, then the Higgs decay into two gravitons will dominate both the
QED induced two photon decay and the QCD induced two jet decays.
