For testing the independence of two vectors with respective dimensions $p_1$
and $p_2$, the existing literature in high-dimensional statistics all assume
that both dimensions $p_1$ and $p_2$ grow to infinity with the sample size.
However, as evidenced in the RNA-sequencing data analysis discussed in the
paper, it happens frequently that one of the dimension is quite small and the
other quite large compared to the sample size. In this paper, we address this
new asymptotic framework for the independence test. A new test procedure is
introduced and its asymptotic normality is established when the vectors are
normal distributed. A Mote-Carlo study demonstrates the consistency of the
procedure and exhibits its superiority over some existing high-dimensional
procedures. Applied to the RNA-sequencing data mentioned above, we obtain very
convincing results on pairwise independence/dependence of gene isoform
expressions as attested by prior knowledge established in that field. Lastly,
Monte-Carlo experiments show that the procedure is robust against the normality
assumption on the population vectors.
