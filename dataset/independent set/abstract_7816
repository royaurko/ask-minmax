In this paper, motivated by the notion of independent identically distributed
(IID) random variables under sub-linear expectations initiated by Peng, we
investigate a law of the iterated logarithm for capacities. It turns out that
our theorem is a natural extension of the Kolmogorov and the Hartman-Wintner
laws of the iterated logarithm.
