We generalize the notion of complete binary relation on complete lattice to
residuated lattice valued ordered sets and show its properties. Then we focus
on complete fuzzy tolerances on fuzzy complete lattices and prove they are in
one-to-one correspondence with extensive isotone Galois connections. Finally,
we prove that fuzzy complete lattice, factorized by a complete fuzzy tolerance,
is again a fuzzy complete lattice.
