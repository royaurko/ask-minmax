We show that separating metallic from semiconducting carbon nanotubes by
dielectrophoresis is developing towards a bulk separation method, which allows
for the first time to produce thin films of only metallic single-walled carbon
nanotubes and to measure their optical absorption spectra. The data proofs that
the selectivity of the separation scheme is independent from the nanotube
diameter.
