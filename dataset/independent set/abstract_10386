Recently there has been much interest in gauge theories applied to condensed
matter physics. I show that for a system of nonrelativistic electrons coupled
to a U(1) gauge field in the presence of a Fermi surface, the beta-function to
one-loop order is, for a particular family of gauge-choices, independent of the
gauge-choice.
