The study of Borel equivalence relations under Borel reducibility has
developed into an important area of descriptive set theory. The dichotomies of
Silver and Harrington-Kechris-Louveau show that with respect to Borel
reducibility, any Borel equivalence relation strictly above equality on
$\omega$ is above equality on ${\cal P}(\omega)$, the power set of $\omega$,
and any Borel equivalence relation strictly above equality on the reals is
above equality modulo finite on ${\cal P}(\omega)$. In this article we examine
the effective content of these and related results by studying effectively
Borel equivalence relations under effectively Borel reducibility. The resulting
structure is complex, even for equivalence relations with finitely many
equivalence classes. However use of Kleene's $O$ as a parameter is sufficient
to restore the picture from the noneffective setting. A key lemma is the
existence of two effectively Borel sets of reals, neither of which contains the
range of the other under any effectively Borel function; the proof of this
result applies Barwise compactness to a deep theorem of Harrington establishing
for any recursive ordinal $\alpha$ the existence of $\Pi^0_1$ singletons whose
$\alpha$-jumps are Turing incomparable.
