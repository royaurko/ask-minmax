We introduce tessellation of the filled Julia sets for hyperbolic and
parabolic quadratic maps. Then the dynamics inside their Julia sets are
organized by tiles which work like external rays outside. We also construct
continuous families of pinching semiconjugacies associated with
hyperblic-to-parabolic degenerations without using quasiconformal deformation.
Instead we use tessellation and investigation on the hyperbolic-to-parabolic
degeneration of linearizing coordinates inside the Julia set.
