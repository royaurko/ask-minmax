We make frequentist analyses of the CMSSM, NUHM1, VCMSSM and mSUGRA parameter
spaces taking into account all the public results of searches for supersymmetry
using data from the 2010 LHC run and the Xenon100 direct search for dark matter
scattering. The LHC data set includes ATLAS and CMS searches for jets + ETslash
events (with or without leptons) and for the heavier MSSM Higgs bosons, and the
upper limit on bs to mu mu including data from LHCb as well as CDF and D0. The
absences of signals in the LHC data favour somewhat heavier mass spectra than
in our previous analyses of the CMSSM, NUHM1 and VCMSSM, and somewhat smaller
dark matter scattering cross sections, all close to or within the pre-LHC 68%
CL ranges, but do not impact significantly the favoured regions of the mSUGRA
parameter space. We also discuss the impact of the Xenon100 constraint on
spin-independent dark matter scattering, stressing the importance of taking
into account the uncertainty in the pi-nucleon sigma term, that affects the
spin-independent scattering matrix element, and we make predictions for
spin-dependent dark matter scattering. Finally, we discuss briefly the
potential impact of the updated predictions for sparticle masses in the CMSSM,
NUHM1, VCMSSM and mSUGRA on future e+ e- colliders.
