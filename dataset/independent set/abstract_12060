We use a "monodromy" argument to derive new expressions for the ${\bm Z}_2$
invariants of topological insulators with time-reversal symmetry in 2 and 3
dimensions. The derivations and the final expressions do not require any gauge
choice and the calculation of the invariants is based entirely on the
projectors onto the occupied states. Explicit numerical tests for tight-binding
models with strongly broken inversion symmetry are presented in 2 and
3-dimensions.
