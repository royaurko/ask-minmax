Propagation of the heavy quark in the field of a static antiquark source is
studied in the framework of effective Dirac equation. The model of QCD vacuum
is described by bilocal gluonic correlators. In the heavy quark limit the
effective interaction is reduced to the potential one with 5/6 Lorentz scalar
and 1/6 Lorentz vector linear confinement, while spin-orbit term is in
agreement with Eichten-Feinberg-Gromes results. New spin-independent
corrections to the leading confining regime are identified, which arise due to
the nonlocality of the interaction in time direction and quark Zitterbewegung.
