A central limit theorem is proved for some strictly stationary sequences of
random variables that satisfy certain mixing conditions and are subjected to
the "shrinking operators" $U_r(x):=[\max\{|x|-r,0\}]\cdot x/|x|,\ r \ge 0$. For
independent, identically distributed random variables, this result was proved
earlier by Housworth and Shao.
