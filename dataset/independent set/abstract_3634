The evolution of quasar clustering is investigated with a new sample of 388
quasars with 0.3<z<=2.2, B<=20.5 and Mb<-23, selected over an area of 24.6 sq.
deg. in the South Galactic Pole. Assuming a two-point correlation function of
the form xi(r) = (r/r_o)^-1.8, we detect clustering with r_0=6.2 +/- 1.6 h^-1
comoving Mpc at an average redshift of z=1.3. We find a 2 sigma significant
increase of the quasar clustering between z=0.95 and z=1.8, independent of the
quasar absolute magnitude and inconsistent with recent evidence on the
evolution of galaxy clustering. If other quasar samples are added (resulting in
a total data-set of 737 quasars) the increase of the quasar clustering is still
favoured although it becomes less significant. We find epsilon=-2.5.
Evolutionary parameters epsilon>0.0 are excluded at a 0.3% probability level,
to be compared with epsilon=0.8 found for galaxies. The observed clustering
properties appear qualitatively consistent with a scenario of Omega=1 CDM in
which a) the difference between the quasar and the galaxy clustering can be
explained as a difference in the effective bias and redshift distributions, and
b) the quasars, with a lifetime of t~10^8 yr, sparsely sample halos of mass
greater than M_min~10^12-10^13 h^-1 M_sun. We discuss also the possibility that
the observed change in the quasar clustering is due to an increase in the
fraction of early-type galaxies as quasar hosts at high z.
