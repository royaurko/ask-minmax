Meyer sets have a relatively dense set of Bragg peaks and for this reason
they may be considered as basic mathematical examples of (aperiodic) crystals.
In this paper we investigate the pure point part of the diffraction of Meyer
sets in more detail. The results are of two kinds. First we show that given a
Meyer set and any intensity a less than the maximum intensity of its Bragg
peaks, the set of Bragg peaks whose intensity exceeds a is itself a Meyer set
(in the Fourier space). Second we show that if a Meyer set is modified by
addition and removal of points in such a way that its density is not altered
too much (the allowable amount being given explicitly as a proportion of the
original density) then the newly obtained set still has a relatively dense set
of Bragg peaks.
