The examples are considered of integrable hyperbolic equations of third order
with two independent variables. In particular, an equation is found which
admits as evolutionary symmetries the Krichever--Novikov equation and the
modified Landau--Lifshitz system. The problem of choice of dynamical variables
for the hyperbolic equations is discussed.
