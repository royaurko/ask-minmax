The Minimal Resolution Conjecture (MRC) for points on a projective variety X
predicts that the Betti numbers of general sets of points in X are as small as
the geometry (Hilbert function) of X allows. To a large extent, we settle this
conjecture for a curve C with general moduli. We show that, independently of
the genus, MRC holds for a general linear system of degree d and dimension r on
C if and only if d>2r-1. We then proceed to find a full solution to the Ideal
Generation Conjecture for curves with general moduli. In a different direction,
we prove that K3 surfaces admit Ulrich bundles of every rank. We apply this to
describe a pfaffian equation for the Chow form of a K3 surface.
