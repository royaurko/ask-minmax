We obtain, for a subclass of structure functions characterizing a first class
Hamiltonian system, recursive relations from which the general form of the
local symmetry transformations can be constructed in terms of the independent
gauge parameters. We apply this to a non-trivial Hamiltonian system involving
two primary constraints, as well as two secondary constraints of the Nambu-Goto
type.
