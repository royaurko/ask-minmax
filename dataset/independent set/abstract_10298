Cuspy triaxial potentials admit a large number of chaotic orbits, which
moreover exhibit extreme "stickiness" that makes the process of chaotic mixing
surprisingly inefficient. Environmental effects, modeled as noise and/or
periodic driving, help accelerate phase space transport but probably not as
much as in simpler potentials. This could mean that cuspy triaxial ellipticals
cannot exist as time-independent systems.
