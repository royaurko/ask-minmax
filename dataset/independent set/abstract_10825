The NC and CC scattering of neutrino(antineutrino) on protons and nuclei with
isotopic spin equal to zero is considered. It is shown that the measurement of
the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry in these processes could allow to obtain
model-independent information about the contribution of the axial strange
current to the cross sections of the NC processes.
