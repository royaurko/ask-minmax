It is important to have experimental methods to estimate the maximum beam
intensity for the Fermilab Booster as objective input into long term program
commitments. An important existing limit is set by the available rf power. This
limit is difficult to set a priori because the real longitudinal impedance is
not well known. The synchrotron phase at transition crossing was measured using
both the mountain range plot and the direct phase measurement of the RF
accelerating voltage relative to the beam, and results were consistent. They
were applied to predict 6E12 maximum Booster beam intensity with present
running conditions.
