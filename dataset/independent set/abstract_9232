Analyzing powers and cross sections for the elastic scattering of polarized
7Li by targets of 6Li, 7Li and 12C are shown to depend only on the properties
of the projectile for momentum transfers of less than 1.0 fm-1. The result of a
detailed analysis of the experimental data within the framework of the coupled
channels model with ground state reorientation and transitions to the excited
states of the projectile and targets included in the coupling schemes are
presented. This work suggests that nuclear properties of weakly-bound nuclei
can be tested by elastic scattering experiments, independent of the target
used, if data are acquired for momentum transfers less than ~1.0 fm-1.
