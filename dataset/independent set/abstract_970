We discuss electroweak constraints on TeV scale extensions of the standard
model. To obtain model-independent results, effective theory approach is
adopted. Constraints are given on arbitrary linear combinations of a set of
dimension-6 operators that respect the SM gauge symmetry, as well as CP, lepton
and baryon number conservation. Applications of the results are also discussed.
