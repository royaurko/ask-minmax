We study definable sets in power series fields with perfect residue fields.
We show that certain `one-dimensional' definable sets are in fact existentially
definable. This allows us to apply results from previous work about
existentially definable sets to one-dimensional definable sets.
  More precisely, let $F$ be a perfect field and let a be a tuple from $F((t))$
of transcendence degree 1 over $F$. Using the description of $F$-automorphisms
of $F((t))$ given by Schilling, we show that the orbit of a under
$F$-automorphisms is existentially definable in the ring language with
parameters from $F(t)$.
  We deduce the following corollary. Let $X$ be an $F$-definable subset of
$F((t))$ which is not contained in $F$, then the subfield generated by $X$ is
equal to $F((t^{p^n}))$, for some $n<\omega$.
