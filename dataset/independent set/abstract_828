The random interlacements (at level u) is a one parameter family of random
subsets of Z^d introduced by Sznitman in arXiv:0704.2560. The vacant set at
level u is the complement of the random interlacement at level u. In this
paper, we study the effect of small quenched noise on connectivity properties
of the random interlacement and the vacant set. While the random interlacement
induces a connected subgraph of Z^d for all levels u, the vacant set has a
non-trivial phase transition in u, as shown in arXiv:0704.2560 and
arXiv:0808.3344.
  For a positive epsilon, we allow each vertex of the random interlacement
(referred to as occupied) to become vacant, and each vertex of the vacant set
to become occupied with probability epsilon, independently of the randomness of
the interlacement, and independently for different vertices. We prove that for
any d>=3 and u>0, almost surely, the perturbed random interlacement percolates
for small enough noise parameter epsilon. In fact, we prove the stronger
statement that Bernoulli percolation on the random interlacement graph has a
non-trivial phase transition in wide enough slabs. As a byproduct, we show that
any electric network with i.i.d. positive resistances on the interlacement
graph is transient, which strengthens our result in arXiv:1102.4758. As for the
vacant set, we show that for any d>=3, there is still a non-trivial phase
transition in u when the noise parameter epsilon is small enough, and we give
explicit upper and lower bounds on the value of the critical threshold, when
epsilon tends to 0.
