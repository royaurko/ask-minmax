In this paper we study Triebel-Lizorkin-type spaces with variable smoothness
and integrability. We show that our space is well-defined, i.e., independent of
the choice of basis functions and we obtain their atomic characterization.
Moreover the Sobolev embeddings for these function spaces are obtained.
