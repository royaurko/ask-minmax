It has for ages been a rather constant feature of thinking in science to take
it for granted that the respective thinking happens in realms which are totally
outside and independent of all the other phenomena that constitute the objects
of such thinking. The imposition of this divide on two levels may conflict with
basic assumptions of Newtonian and Einsteinian mechanics, as well as with those
in Quantum Mechanics. It also raises the question whether the realms in which
thinking happens have no any other connection with the realms science deals
with, except to host and allow scientific thinking.
