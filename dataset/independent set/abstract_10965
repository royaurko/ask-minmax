We discuss a novel approach to renormalize the Electroweak Sector of the
Standard Model, in which \sin^2\theta_{eff}, measured at the Z^0 peak, is
identified with the basic renormalized electroweak mixing parameter. This
approach shares the desirable convergence properties of the MS scheme and
provides a framework for calculations that are strictly independent of the
electroweak scale in finite orders of perturbation theory. We illustrate the
method with updated precise calculations of \sin^2\theta_{eff} and M_W, as
functions of M_H, and comment on the implications of these calculations for the
Higgs boson search and the theoretical prediction of M_W.
