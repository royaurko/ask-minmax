Via computer simulations, we provide evidence that the shear rate induced red
blood cell tumbling-to-tank-treading transition also occurs at quite high
volume fractions, where collective effects are important. The transition takes
place as the ratio of suspension stress to the characteristic cell membrane
stress exceeds a certain value, independent of volume fraction and cell
deformability. This value coincides with that for a transition from an
orientationally less ordered to a highly ordered phase. The average cell
deformation does not show any signature of the transition, but rather follows a
simple scaling law independent of volume fraction.
