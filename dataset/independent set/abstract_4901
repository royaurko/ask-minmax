In this paper, we prove that for every connected graph G, there exists a
split graph H with the same independence number and the same order. Then we
propose a first algorithm for finding this graph, given the degree sequence of
the input graph G. Further, we propose a second algorithm for finding the
independence number of G, given the adjacency matrix of G.
