This report summarizes the final results from the OPAL collaboration on
searches for neutral Higgs bosons predicted by the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM). CP-conserving and for the first time at LEP CP-violating
scenarios are studied. New scenarios are also included, which aim to set the
stage for Higgs searches at future colliders. The results are based on the data
collected with the OPAL detector at e+e- centre-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV.
The data are consistent with the prediction of the Standard Model with no Higgs
boson produced. Model-independent limits are derived for the cross-section of a
number of events topologies motivated by prediction of the MSSM. Limits on
Higgs boson masses and other MSSM parameters are obtained for a number of
representative MSSM benchmark scenarios. For example, in the CP-conserving
scenario mh-max where the MSSM parameters are adjusted to predict the largest
range of values for mh at each tan beta, and for a top quark mass of 174.3 GeV,
the domain 0.7<tan beta<1.9 is excluded at the 95% confidence level and Higgs
boson mass limits of mh>84.5 GeV and ma>85.0 GeV are obtained. For the
CP-violating benchmark scenario CPX which, by construction, enhances the
CP-violating effects in the Higgs sector, the domain tan beta<2.8 is excluded
but no universal limit can be set on the Higgs boson masses.
