We consider a phenomenological continuum model for an active nematic fluid
and show a universal, model independent, instability which renders the
homogeneous nematic state unstable to order fluctuations. Using numerical and
analytic tools we show that, for low energy excitations in the vicinity of a
critical point, this instability leads to a phase separation in which the
ordered regions form bands with the direction of nematic order being
perpendicular to the direction of density gradient. We argue that this
mechanism of phase separation, which we term self-regulation, is a universal
feature of active fluids.
