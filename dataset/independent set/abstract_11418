We demonstrate the control of solitary wave dynamics of modified Kortweg-de
Vries (MKdV) equation through the temporal variations of the distributed
coefficients. This is explicated through exact cnoidal wave and localized
soliton solutions of the MKdV equation with variable coefficients. The solitons
can be accelerated and their propagation can be manipulated by suitable
variations of the above parameters. In sharp contrast with nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the soliton amplitude and widths are time
independent.
