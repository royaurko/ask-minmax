The model of random interlacements on Z^d, d bigger or equal to 3, was
recently introduced in arXiv:0704.2560. A non-negative parameter u parametrizes
the density of random interlacements on Z^d. In the present note we investigate
the connectivity properties of the vacant set left by random interlacements at
level u, in the non-percolative regime, where u is bigger than the
non-degenerate critical parameter for percolation of the vacant set, see
arXiv:0704.2560, arXiv:0808.3344. We prove a stretched exponential decay of the
connectivity function for the vacant set at level u, when u is bigger than an
other critical parameter. It is presently an open problem whether these two
critical parameters actually coincide.
