Given a subset $S\subseteq\mathbb{P}$, let $\Pa(S;n)$ be the number of
permutations in the symmetric group of ${1,2,...,n}$ that have peak set $S$. We
prove a recent conjecture due to Billey, Burdzy and Sagan, which determines the
sets that maximize $\Pa(S;n)$, where $S$ ranges over all subsets of
${1,2,...,n}$.
