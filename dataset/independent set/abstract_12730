We discuss conditions for unique ergodicity of a collective random walk on a
continuous circle. Individual particles in this collective motion perform
independent (and different in general) random walks conditioned by the
assumption that the particles cannot overrun each other. Additionally to
sufficient conditions for the unique ergodicity we discover a new and
unexpected way for its violation due to excessively large local jumps.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for the unique ergodicity of the
deterministic version of this system are obtained as well. Technically our
approach is based on the interlacing property of the spin function which
describes states of pairs of particles in coupled processes under study.
