We present an axiomatic frame (in Prt I of this book) in which many results
of the K-theory for C*-algebras are proved. Then we construct an example for
this axiomatic theory (in Part II), which generalizes the classical theory for
C*-algebras. This last theory starts by associating to each C*-algebra F the
C*-algebras of square matrices with entries in F. Every such C*-algebra of
square matrices can be obtained as the projective representation of a certain
group with respect to a complex valued Schur function (also called normalized
factor set or multiplier or two-co-cocycle in the mathematical literature) for
this group. The above mentioned generalization consist in replacing this Schur
function by an arbitrary Schur function which satisfies some axiomatic
conditions. Moreover this Schur function can take its values in a commutative
unital C*-algebra E. In this case this K-theory deos not apply to the category
of C*-algebras but to the category of E-C*-algebras, which are C*-algebras
endowed with a supplementary structure obtained by an exterior multiplication
with elements of E (every C*-algebra can be endowed with such a supplementary
structure). Up to some definitions and notation Part II is independent of Part
I.
