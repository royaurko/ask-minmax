Let $G = (G,+)$ be an additive group. The sumset theory of Pl\"unnecke and
Ruzsa gives several relations between the size of sumsets $A+B$ of finite sets
$A, B$, and related objects such as iterated sumsets $kA$ and difference sets
$A-B$, while the inverse sumset theory of Freiman, Ruzsa, and others
characterises those finite sets $A$ for which $A+A$ is small. In this paper we
establish analogous results in which the finite set $A \subset G$ is replaced
by a discrete random variable $X$ taking values in $G$, and the cardinality
$|A|$ is replaced by the Shannon entropy $\Ent(X)$. In particular, we classify
the random variable $X$ which have small doubling in the sense that
$\Ent(X_1+X_2) = \Ent(X)+O(1)$ when $X_1,X_2$ are independent copies of $X$, by
showing that they factorise as $X = U+Z$ where $U$ is uniformly distributed on
a coset progression of bounded rank, and $\Ent(Z) = O(1)$.
  When $G$ is torsion-free, we also establish the sharp lower bound $\Ent(X+X)
\geq \Ent(X) + {1/2} \log 2 - o(1)$, where $o(1)$ goes to zero as $\Ent(X) \to
\infty$.
