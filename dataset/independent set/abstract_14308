Data processing lower bounds on the expected distortion are derived in the
finite-alphabet semi-deterministic setting, where the source produces a
deterministic, individual sequence, but the channel model is probabilistic, and
the decoder is subjected to various kinds of limitations, e.g., decoders
implementable by finite-state machines, with or without counters, and with or
without a restriction of common reconstruction with high probability. Some of
our bounds are given in terms of the Lempel-Ziv complexity of the source
sequence or the reproduction sequence. We also demonstrate how some analogous
results can be obtained for classes of linear encoders and linear decoders in
the continuous alphabet case.
