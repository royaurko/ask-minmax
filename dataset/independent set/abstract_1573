The Dirac equation is solved in the rotating Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. The
set of equations representing the Dirac equation in the Newman-Penrose
formalism is decoupled into an axial and angular part. The axial equation,
which is independent of mass, is solved exactly in terms of hypergeometric
functions. The angular equation is considered both for massless (neutrino) and
massive spin-(1/2) particles. For the neutrinos, it is shown that the angular
equation admits an exact solution in terms of the confluent Heun equation. In
the existence of mass, the angular equation does not allow an analytical
solution, however, it is expressible as a set of first order differential
equations apt for numerical study.
