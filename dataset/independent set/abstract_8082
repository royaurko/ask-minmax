A simple model to explain numerically observed behaviour of chaotically
varying stripes and square patterns in zero Prandtl number convection in
Boussinesq fluid is presented. The nonlinear interaction of mutually
perpendicular sets of wavy rolls, via higher mode, may lead to a competition
between the two sets of wavy rolls. The appearance of square patterns is due to
the secondary forward Hopf bifurcation of a set of wavy rolls.
