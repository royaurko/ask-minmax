Type 1a supernova magnitudes conventionally include an additive parameter
called the extinction coefficient. We find that the extinction coefficients of
a popular ``gold'' set are well correlated with the deviation of magnitudes
from Hubble diagrams. If the effect is due to bias, extinctions have been
overestimated, which makes supernovas appear more dim. The statistical
significance of the extinction-acceleration correlation has a random chance
probability of less than one in a million. The hypothesis that extinction
coefficients should be corrected empirically provides greatly improved fits to
both accelerating and non-accelerating models, with the independent feature of
eliminating any significant correlation of residuals.
