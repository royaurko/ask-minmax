We propose a model independent approach for the analysis of interference
effects in the process of QCD pair production of new heavy quarks of different
species that decay into Standard Model particles, including decays via flavour
changing neutral currents. By adopting as ansatz a simple analytical formula we
show that one can accurately describe the interference between two different
such particles pairs leading to the same final state using information about
masses, total widths and couplings. A study of the effects on differential
distributions is also performed showing that, when interference plays a
relevant role, the distributions of the full process can be obtained by a
simple rescaling of the distributions of either quark contributing to the
interference term. We also present the range of validity of the analytical
expression that we have found.
