We generalize the level set approach to model epitaxial growth to include
thermal detachment of atoms from island edges. This means that islands do not
always grow and island dissociation can occur. We make no assumptions about a
critical nucleus. Excellent quantitative agreement is obtained with kinetic
Monte Carlo simulations for island densities and island size distributions in
the submonolayer regime.
