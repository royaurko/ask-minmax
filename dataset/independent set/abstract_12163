A special normalization is proposed for strongly intensive quantities used in
the study of event-by-event fluctuations in high energy collisions. It ensures
that these measures are dimensionless and yields a common scale required for a
quantitative comparison of fluctuations of different, in general dimensional,
extensive quantities. Namely, the properly normalized strongly intensive
quantities assume the value one for fluctuations given by the model of
independent particle production and zero in the absence of event-by-event
fluctuations.
