Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we probe the scale-dependence of
thermalization in strongly coupled field theories following a quench via
saddlepoint calculations of 2-point functions, Wilson loops and entanglement
entropy in $d=2,3,4$. For homogeneous initial conditions, the entanglement
entropy thermalizes slowest, and sets a timescale for equilibration that
saturates a causality bound. The growth rate of entanglement entropy density is
nearly volume-independent for small volumes, but slows for larger volumes. In
this strongly coupled setting, the UV thermalizes first.
