We calculate the one-loop correction to the soft-gluon current with massive
fermions. This current is process independent and controls the singular
behavior of one-loop massive QCD amplitudes in the limit when one external
gluon becomes soft. The result derived in this work is the last missing
process-independent ingredient needed for numerical evaluation of observables
with massive fermions at hadron colliders at the next-to-next-to-leading order.
