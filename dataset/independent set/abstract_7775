Impulse methods are generalized to a family of integrators for Langevin
systems with quadratic stiff potentials and arbitrary soft potentials. Uniform
error bounds (independent from stiff parameters) are obtained on integrated
positions allowing for coarse integration steps. The resulting integrators are
explicit and structure preserving (quasi-symplectic for Langevin systems).
