It is a challenge to specify unambiguous distance (UD) in a phase-based
ranging system with hopping frequencies (PRSHF). In this letter, we propose to
characterize the UD in a PRSHF by the probability that it takes on its maximum
value. We obtain a very simple and elegant expression of the probability with
growth estimation techniques from analytic number theory. It is revealed that
the UD in a PRSHF usually takes on the maximum value with as few as 10
frequencies in measurement, almost independent of the specific distribution of
available bandwidth.
