We obtain and study the equations describing the parallel transport of
orthonormal frames along geodesics in a spacetime admitting a non-degenerate
principal conformal Killing-Yano tensor h. We demonstrate that the operator F,
obtained by a projection of h to a subspace orthogonal to the velocity, has in
a generic case eigenspaces of dimension not greater than 2. Each of these
eigenspaces are independently parallel-propagated. This allows one to reduce
the parallel transport equations to a set of the first order ordinary
differential equations for the angles of rotation in the 2D eigenspaces.
General analysis is illustrated by studying the equations of the parallel
transport in the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics. Examples of three, four, and five
dimensional Kerr-NUT-(A)dS are considered and it is shown that the obtained
first order equations can be solved by a separation of variables.
