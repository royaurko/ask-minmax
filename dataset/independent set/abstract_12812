Based on the framework of the directional distance function, we conduct a
systematic analysis on the measurement of super-efficiency in order to achieve
two main objectives. Our primary purpose is developing two generalized
directional measures of super-efficiency that completely resolve the crucial
infeasibility issue, commonly arisen in the traditional super-efficiency
measures. The secondary goal is to demonstrate that our directional
super-efficiency models encompass the conventional ones as special cases. The
proposed measures are advantageous because they circumvent biases in
super-efficiency estimation due to input and output slacks. They are general,
and satisfy several desirable properties, such as always feasibility,
monotonicity, unit independence, and translation invariance.
