We construct a cohomology theory using quasi-smooth derived schemes as
generators and an analogue of the bordism relation using derived fibre products
as relations. This theory has pull-backs along all morphisms between smooth
schemes independent of any characteristic assumptions. We prove that in
characteristic zero, the resulting theory agrees with algebraic cobordism as
defined by Levine and Morel. We thus obtain a new set of generators and
relations for algebraic cobordism.
