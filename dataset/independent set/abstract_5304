Independent regulatory commissions such as the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) must produce policies that reflect technical expertise, legal
precedent, and stakeholder input. Given these situational imperatives, how does
the FCC implement independence in its decision-making? This research explicates
some of the underlying rules, resources, and relationships within the
environment in which the agency is embedded that influence agency work
practices to operationalize independence. Research such as this may be helpful
in the creation of new, or for assessment of existing, regulatory commissions,
but only if great attention is paid not only to institutional structure, but
also to the practice of staff in the agency.
