We demonstrate that an Erler-Schnabl type solution in cubic string field
theory can be naturally interpreted as a gauge invariant regularization of an
identity based solution. We consider a solution which interpolates between an
identity based solution and ordinary Erler-Schnabl one. Two gauge invariant
quantities, the classical action and the closed string tadpole, are evaluated
for finite value of the gauge parameter. It is explicitly checked that both of
them are independent of the gauge parameter.
