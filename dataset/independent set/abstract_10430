We calculate the one-particle spectral functions above the superconducting
transition temperature $T_{C}$, in the framework of a functional integral
approach. The coupling of the electronic self-energy to pair fluctuations,
which are treated by means of a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, yields
a double-peak structure, around the Fermi wavenumber. The peak separation is
essentially temperature-independent, but the structure sharpens when $T_{C}$ is
approached.
