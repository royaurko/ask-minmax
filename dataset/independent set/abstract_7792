We determine the asymptotic speed of the first-passage percolation process on
some ladder-like graphs (or width-2 stretches) when the times associated with
different edges are independent and exponentially distributed but not
necessarily all with the same mean. The method uses a particular Markov chain
associated with the first-passage percolation process and properties of its
stationary distribution.
