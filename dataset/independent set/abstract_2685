We consider a (supersymmetric) bosonization of general commuting matter
$\beta\gamma$ CFT. Unlike the conventional ghost $\beta\gamma$ CFT
bosonization, which is typically described in terms of one scalar and one set
of $\xi\eta$ CFT, the matter $\beta\gamma$ CFT is naturally bosonized to two
scalar CFTs. Surprisingly, there exists an independent subsector, which
satisfies a constraint necessary for consistent bosonization, while the usual
sector has a description in terms of two compact coordinates. The subsector
itself is a complete system which is equivalent to the original $\beta\gamma$
CFT. Furthermore, a non-compact coordinate naturally emerges in this
"non-compact subsector". As an immediate application, we consider the
bosonization of matter $\beta\gamma$ CFT in the context of full string theory
and find the connection to noncritical string theories in the light-cone gauge.
