In this paper we find a formula for the length of a finitely supported
complete ideal in terms of the order of the strict transform of the ideal. This
formula was known for complete ideals of height two in a two dimensional
regular local ring and was proved independently by Hoskin and Deligne. Several
consequences are deduced from this formula.
