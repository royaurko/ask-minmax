We consider a broad subclass of the \it{randomly fluctuating
hyperrectangles}, a new class of spatial growth models described in a general
setting which incorporates various special cases as follows. Hyperrectangles
evolve, \it{ad infinitum} or up until absorption to the empty set, simply
according to \it{contractions}, comprising of sampling a sub-hyperrectangle by
a specified random rule, independently alternating with \it{expansions},
comprising of shifting every face vertically in increasing direction by an
independent random value and extending appropriately to form the associated
sup-hyperrectangle. Furthermore, we consider the class of attractive
one-dimensional spin systems processes. We show respective extensions of the
following basic property. The probability that any site is included in the
process decreases monotonically with respect to its distance in the underlying
space from the starting site of the process.
