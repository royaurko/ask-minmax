Reported are spectroscopic observations of 15 candidates for Kepler primary
asteroseismic targets and 14 other stars in the Kepler field, carried out at
three observatories (see the footnote). For all these stars, the radial
velocities, effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and the
projected rotational velocity are derived from two separate sets of data by
means of two independent methods. In addition, MK type is estimated from one of
these sets of data.
  Three stars, HIP 94335, HIP 94734, and HIP 94743, are found to have variable
radial-velocity. For HIP 94335 = FL Lyr, a well-known Algol-type eclipsing
variable and a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the orbital elements computed
from our data agree closely with those of Popper et al. For HIP 94734 and HIP
94743 = V2077 Cyg, which we discover to be single-lined systems, orbital
elements are derived. In addition, from our value of the orbital period and the
Hipparcos epoch photometry, HIP 94743 is demonstrated to be a detached
eclipsing binary.
