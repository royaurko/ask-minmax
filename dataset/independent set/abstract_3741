We propose a practical scheme for calculating the local gravitational
self-force experienced by a test mass particle moving in a black hole
spacetime. The method---equally effective for either weak or strong field
orbits---employs the {\em mode-sum regularization scheme} previously developed
for a scalar toy model. The starting point for the calculation, in this
approach, is the formal expression for the regularized self-force derived by
Mino et al. (and, independently, by Quinn and Wald), which involves a worldline
integral over the tail part of the retarded Green's function. This force is
decomposed into multipole (tensor harmonic) modes, whose sum is subjected to a
carefully designed regularization procedure. This procedure involves an
analytic derivation of certain ``regularization parameters'' by means of a
local analysis of the Green's function. This manuscript contains the following
main parts: (1) Introduction of the mode sum scheme as applied to the
gravitational case. (2) Two simple cases studied: the test case of a static
particle in flat spacetime, and the case of a particle at a turning point of a
radial geodesic in Schwarzschild spacetime. In both cases we derive all
necessary regularization parameters. (3) An Analytic foundation is set for
applying the scheme in more general cases. (In this paper, the mode sum scheme
is formulated within the harmonic gauge. The implementation of the scheme in
other gauges shall be discussed in a separate, forthcoming paper.)
