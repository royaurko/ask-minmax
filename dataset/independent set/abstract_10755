Data on muon pair production obtained by the OPAL collaboration at centre of
mass energies near the Z peak are analysed. Small angular mismatches between
the directions of the two muons are used to assess the effects of initial state
photon radiation and initial-final-state radiation interference on the
forward-backward asymmetry of muon pairs. The dependence of the asymmetry on
the invariant mass of the pair is measured in a model-independent way.
Effective vector and axial-vector couplings of the Z boson are determined and
compared to the Standard Model expectations.
