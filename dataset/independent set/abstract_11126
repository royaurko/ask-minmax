The QED effective action at finite temperature and density is calculated to
all orders in an external homogeneous and time-independent magnetic field in
the weak coupling limit. The free energy, obtained explicitly, exhibit the
expected de\ Haas -- van\ Alphen oscillations. An effective coupling at finite
temperature and density is derived in a closed form and is compared with
renormalization group results.
