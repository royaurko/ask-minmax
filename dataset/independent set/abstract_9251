The liquid-gas phase transition in hot neutron-rich nuclear matter is
investigated within a self-consistent thermal model using an isospin and
momentum dependent interaction (MDI) constrained by the isospin diffusion data
in heavy-ion collisions, a momentum-independent interaction (MID), and an
isoscalar momentum-dependent interaction (eMDYI). The boundary of the
phase-coexistence region is shown to be sensitive to the density dependence of
the nuclear symmetry energy with a softer symmetry energy giving a higher
critical pressure and a larger area of phase-coexistence region. Compared with
the momentum-independent MID interaction, the isospin and momentum-dependent
MDI interaction is found to increase the critical pressure and enlarge the area
of phase-coexistence region. For the isoscalar momentum-dependent eMDYI
interaction, a limiting pressure above which the liquid-gas phase transition
cannot take place has been found and it is shown to be sensitive to the
stiffness of the symmetry energy.
