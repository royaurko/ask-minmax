While the electrodynamic treatment of a superconducting thin film by Yeh et
al. [Phys. Rev. B 48, 9861 (1993)] ostensibly has application for the
"thin-film limit," their work is shown to employ bulk-like instead of thin-film
electrodynamics, and as such obtains an ostensible violation of the first law
of thermodynamics and a surface resistance independent of the resistivity.
Other theoretical and experimental difficulties are briefly noted.
