The aim of the present paper is to investigate the half-spaces in the
convexity structure of all quasiorders on a given set and to use them in an
alternative approach to classical order dimension. The main result states that
linear orders can almost always be replaced by half-space quasiorders in the
definition of the dimension of a partially ordered set.
