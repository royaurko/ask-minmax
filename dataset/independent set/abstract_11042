The techniques leading to the resummation of threshold logarithms in the
Drell-Yan cross section and other processes can be used to show that also terms
independent on the Mellin variable N exponentiate. Comparison with explicit
two-loop calculations shows that within this class of terms the exponentiation
of the one-loop result together with the running of the coupling is the
dominant effect at two loops.
