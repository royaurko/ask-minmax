An explicit, detailed evaluation of the classical continuum limit of the
axial anomaly/index density of the overlap Dirac operator is carried out in the
infinite volume setting, and in a certain finite volume setting where the
continuum limit involves an infinite volume limit. Our approach is based on a
novel power series expansion of the overlap Dirac operator. The correct
continuum expression is reproduced when the parameter $m_0$ is in the physical
region $0<m_0<2$. This is established for a broad range of continuum gauge
fields. An analogous result for the fermionic topological charge, given by the
index of the overlap Dirac operator, is then established for a class of
topologically non-trivial fields in the aforementioned finite volume setting.
Problematic issues concerning the index in the infinite volume setting are also
discussed.
