The 5.4 kton MINOS far detector has been taking charge-separated cosmic ray
muon data since the beginning of August, 2003 at a depth of 2070
meters-water-equivalent in the Soudan Underground Laboratory, Minnesota, USA.
The data with both forward and reversed magnetic field running configurations
were combined to minimize systematic errors in the determination of the
underground muon charge ratio. When averaged, two independent analyses find the
charge ratio underground to be 1.374 +/- 0.004 (stat.) +0.012 -0.010(sys.).
Using the map of the Soudan rock overburden, the muon momenta as measured
underground were projected to the corresponding values at the surface in the
energy range 1-7 TeV. Within this range of energies at the surface, the MINOS
data are consistent with the charge ratio being energy independent at the two
standard deviation level. When the MINOS results are compared with measurements
at lower energies, a clear rise in the charge ratio in the energy range 0.3 --
1.0 TeV is apparent. A qualitative model shows that the rise is consistent with
an increasing contribution of kaon decays to the muon charge ratio.
