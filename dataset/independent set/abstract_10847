We have completed theoretical predictions for positronium energy levels
through order alpha^6 m by the calculation of the spin independent, radiative
recoil correction. This contribution is significant and amounts to 10.64 MHz
for the 1S state. We further perform detailed comparison of theoretical
predictions to experimental results for 1S-2S and 2S-2P transitions.
