We consider a class of supersymmetric SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1) multihiggs
models in which R-parity is violated through bilinear Higgs-lepton
interactions. The required, due to R-parity violation, higgs-lepton rotations
introduce an alternative way to generate the phenomenologically desirable
fermion mass matrix structures independently of the equality of Yukawas,
possibly imposed by superstring or other unification.
