Combining known spectral sequences with a new spectral sequence relating
reduced and unreduced sl(N)-homology yields a relationship between the
Homflypt-homology of a knot and its sl(N)-concordance invariants. As an
application, some of the sl(N)-concordance invariants are shown to be linearly
independent.
