We characterize the conditions for the conservation of the energy and of the
components of the momentum maps of lifted actions, and of their `gauge-like'
generalizations, in time-independent nonholonomic mechanical systems with
affine constraints. These conditions involve geometrical and mechanical
properties of the system, and are codified in the so-called
reaction-annihilator distribution.
