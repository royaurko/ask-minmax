We report on the statistics of bubble size, topology, and shape and on their
role in the coarsening dynamics for foams consisting of bubbles compressed
between two parallel plates. The design of the sample cell permits control of
the liquid content, through a constant pressure condition set by the height of
the foam above a liquid reservoir. We find that in the scaling state, all
bubble distributions are independent not only of time but also of liquid
content. For coarsening, the average rate decreases with liquid content due to
the blocking of gas diffusion by Plateau borders inflated with liquid. By
observing the growth rate of individual bubbles, we find that von Neumann's law
becomes progressively violated with increasing wetness and with decreasing
bubble size. We successfully model this behavior by explicitly incorporating
the border blocking effect into the von Neumann argument. Two dimensionless
bubble shape parameters naturally arise, one of which is primarily responsible
for the violation of von Neumann's law for foams that are not perfectly dry.
