We consider the random Schr\"odinger operator
$-\epsilon^{-2}\Delta^{(\text{d})}+\xi^{(\epsilon)}(x)$, with
$\Delta^{(\text{d})}$ the discrete Laplacian on $\mathbb Z^d$ and
$\xi^{(\epsilon)}(x)$ are bounded and independent random variables, on sets of
the form $D_\epsilon:=\{x\in\mathbb Z^d\colon x\epsilon\in D\}$ for $D$
bounded, open and with a smooth boundary, and study the statistics of the
Dirichlet eigenvalues in the limit $\epsilon\downarrow0$. Assuming $\mathbb
E\xi^{(\epsilon)}(x)=U(x\epsilon)$ holds for some bounded and continuous
function $U\colon D\to\mathbb R$, the $k$-th eigenvalue converges to the $k$-th
Dirichlet eigenvalue of the homogenized operator $-\Delta+U(x)$, where $\Delta$
is the continuum Laplacian on $D$. Moreover, assuming that
$\text{Var}(\xi^{(\epsilon)}(x))=V(x\epsilon)$ for some positive and continuous
$V\colon D\to\mathbb R$, we establish a multivariate central limit theorem for
simple eigenvalues centered by their expectation and scaled by
$\epsilon^{-d/2}$. The limiting covariance is expressed as integral of $V$
against the product of squares of two eigenfunctions of $-\Delta+U(x)$.
