In this work, the Flux-Coordinate Independent (FCI) approach to plasma
turbulence simulations is formulated for the case of generic, static magnetic
fields, including those possessing stochastic field lines. It is then
demonstrated that FCI is applicable to nonlinear turbulent problems with and
without X-point geometry. In particular, by means of simulations with the
FENICIA code, it is shown that the standard features of ITG modes are recovered
with reduced toroidal resolution. Finally, ITG turbulence under the influence
of a static island is studied on the transport timescale with ITER-like
parameters, showing the wide range of applicability of the method.
