We propose an extension of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) that allows
the joint shape and appearance of foreground objects in cluttered images to be
modeled independently of the background. We present a learning scheme that
learns this representation directly from cluttered images with only very weak
supervision. The model generates plausible samples and performs
foreground-background segmentation. We demonstrate that representing foreground
objects independently of the background can be beneficial in recognition tasks.
