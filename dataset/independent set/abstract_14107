Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA), as the extension of Pawlak's Rough
Set theory, is effective and fundamentally important in Multiple Criteria
Decision Analysis (MCDA). In previous DRSA models, the definitions of the upper
and lower approximations are preserving the class unions rather than the
singleton class. In this paper, we propose a new Class-based Rough
Approximation with respect to a series of previous DRSA models, including
Classical DRSA model, VC-DRSA model and VP-DRSA model. In addition, the new
class-based reducts are investigated.
