At the ILC, one has the possibility to search for SUSY in an
model-independent way: The corner-stone of SUSY is that sparticles couple as
particles. This is independent of the mechanism responsible for SUSY breaking.
Any model will have one Lightest SUSY Particle (LSP), and one Next to Lightest
SUSY Particle (NLSP). In models with conserved R-parity, the NLSP must decay
solely to the LSP and the SM partner of the NLSP. Therefore, studying NLSP
production and decay can be regarded as a "simplified model without
simplification": Any SUSY model will have such a process.
  The NLSP could be any sparticle: a slepton, an electroweak-ino, or even a
squark. However, since there are only a finite number of sparticles, one can
systematically search for signals of all possible NLSP:s. This way, the entire
space of models that have a kinematicall y reachable NLSP can be covered. For
any NLSP, the "worst case" can be determined, since the SUSY principle allows
to calculate the cross-section once the NLSP nature and mass are given. The
region in the LSP-NLSP mass-plane where the "worst case" could be discovered or
excluded experimentally can be found by estimating background and efficiency at
each point in the plane. From experience at LEP, it is expected that the lower
signal-to background ratio will indeed be found for models with conserved
R-parity.
  In this document, we show that at the ILC, such a program is possible, as it
was at LEP. No loop-holes are left, even for difficult or non-standard cases:
whatever the NLSP is it will be detectable.
