In a celebrated construction, Chen and Skriganov gave explicit examples of
point sets achieving the best possible $L_2$-norm of the discrepancy function.
We consider the discrepancy function of the Chen-Skriganov point sets in Besov
spaces with dominating mixed smoothness and show that they also achieve the
best possible rate in this setting. The proof uses a $b$-adic generalization of
the Haar system and corresponding characterizations of the Besov space norm.
Results for further function spaces and integration errors are concluded.
