The three dimensional superintegrable systems with quadratic integrals of
motion have five functionally independent integrals, one among them is the
Hamiltonian. Kalnins, Kress and Miller have proved that in the case of non
degenerate potentials there is a sixth quadratic integral, which is linearly
independent of the other integrals. The existence of this sixth integral imply
that the integrals of motion form a ternary {parafermionic-like} quadratic
Poisson algebra with five generators. We show that in all the non degenerate
cases (with one exception) there are at least two subalgebras of three
integrals having a Poisson quadratic algebra structure, which is similar to the
two dimensional case.
