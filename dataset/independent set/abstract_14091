The quadratic Mandelbrot set has been referred to as the most complex and
beautiful object in mathematics and the Riemann Zeta function takes the prize
for the most complicated and enigmatic function. Here we elucidate the spectrum
of Mandelbrot and Julia sets of Zeta, to unearth the geography of its chaotic
and fractal diversities, combining these two extremes into one intrepid journey
into the deepest abyss of complex function space.
