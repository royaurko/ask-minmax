Let $\alpha(G)$ and $\beta(G)$, denote the size of a largest independent set
and the clique cover number of an undirected graph $G$. Let $H$ be an interval
graph with $V(G)=V(H)$ and $E(G)\subseteq E(H)$, and let $\phi(G,H)$ denote the
maximum of ${\beta(G[W])\over \alpha(G[W])}$ overall induced subgraphs $G[W]$
of $G$ that are cliques in $H$. The main result of this paper is to prove that
for any graph $G$ $${\beta(G)}\le 2 \alpha(H)\phi(G,H)(\log \alpha(H)+1),$$
where, $\alpha(H)$ is the size of a largest independent set in $H$. We further
provide a generalization that significantly unifies or improves some past
algorithmic and structural results concerning the clique cover number for some
well known intersection graphs.
