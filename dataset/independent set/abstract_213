This paper address the problem of identifying pairs of interacting sites from
a finite sample of independent realizations of the Ising model. We consider
Ising models in a infinite countable set of sites under Dobrushin uniqueness
condition. The observed sample contains only the values assigned by the Ising
model to a finite set of sites. Our main result is an upperbound for the
probability of misidentification of the pairs of interacting sites in this
finite set.
