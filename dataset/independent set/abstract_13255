Analyzing the $\ell +n$-$jets+ \met$ (where $n \ge 2 $), data from Run-I of
the Tevatron using the Bayesian technique, we obtain model independent limits
on the product $\br(\lstop\ra be^{+}\nu_e \lspone) \times \br(\lstop^{*}\ra
\bar{b}q\bar{q^{\prime}}\lspone)$ for different values of the lighter top
squark($\lstop$) mass and the lightest supersymmetric particle($\lspone$) mass.
The SUSY signals have been simulated by interfacing the 4-body decay of
$\lstop$ at the parton level with the event generator PYTHIA. These limits have
been translated into exclusion plots in the $\mlstop$-$\mlspone$ plane, which
also turn out to be fairly model independent for fixed values of the BR of the
competing loop decay mode $\lstop\ra c \lspone$. Assuming the loop decay BR to
be negligible and using the leading order cross section for $\lstoplstop$ pair
production, we obtain conservatively $\mlstop \ge $77.0 (74.5) GeV for
$\mlspone$=5(15) GeV, while for $\br(\lstop\ra c \lspone)$=20%, the
corresponding limits are $\mlstop \ge $68.0 (65.0) GeV. Using the larger next
to leading order cross-section stronger limits are obtained. For example, if
$\br(\lstop\ra c \lspone)$=20%, $\mlstop \ge $73.0 (72.7) GeV for
$\mlspone$=5(15) GeV. Our limits nicely complement the ALEPH bounds which get
weaker for low $\mlspone$.
