Effects of orbital degeneracy on magnetic susceptibility in paramagnetic
phases are investigated within a mean-field theory. Under certain crystalline
electric fields, the magnetic moment consists of two independent moments, e.g.,
spin and orbital moments. In such a case, the magnetic susceptibility is given
by the sum of two different Curie-Weiss relations, leading to deviation from
the Curie-Weiss law. Such behavior may be observed in d- and f-electron systems
with t_{2g} and Gamma_8 ground states, respectively. As a potential application
of our theory, we attempt to explain the difference in the temperature
dependence of magnetic susceptibilities of UO_2 and NpO_2.
