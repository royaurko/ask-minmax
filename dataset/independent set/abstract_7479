We study the velocity distribution function for inelastic Maxwell models,
characterized by a Boltzmann equation with constant collision rate, independent
of the energy of the colliding particles. By means of a nonlinear analysis of
the Boltzmann equation, we find that the velocity distribution function decays
algebraically for large velocities, with exponents that are analytically
calculated.
