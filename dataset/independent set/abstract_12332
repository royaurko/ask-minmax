Gravitational waves detected from well-localized inspiraling binaries would
allow to determine, directly and independently, both binary luminosity and
redshift. In this case, such systems could behave as "standard candles"
providing an excellent probe of cosmic distances up to z < 0.1 and thus
complementing other indicators of cosmological distance ladder.
