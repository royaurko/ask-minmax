The V777 Her pulsator KIC 8626021 has been observed continuously by the
Kepler space telescope for nine months. Two new independent pulsation modes are
detected in the extended dataset, which both match the predicted sequence of
\ell = 2 modes. We demonstrate the photometric stability of the main pulsation
modes and discuss the prospect of measuring period changes within the context
of the extended Kepler mission.
