I have recently shown that it is possible to formulate the Relativity
postulates in a way that does not lead to inconsistencies in the case of
space-times whose structure is governed by observer-independent scales of both
velocity and length. Here I give an update on the status of this proposal,
including a brief review of some very recent developments. I also emphasize the
role that one of the kappa-Poincare' Hopf algebras could play in the
realization of a particular example of the new type of postulates. I show that
the new ideas on Relativity require us to extend the set of tools provided by
kappa-Poincare' and to revise our understanding of certain already available
tools, such as the energy-momentum coproduct.
