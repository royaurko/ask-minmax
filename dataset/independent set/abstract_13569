We report the results of a search for point-like deviations from isotropy in
the arrival directions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the northern
hemisphere. In the monocular data set collected by the High-Resolution Fly's
Eye, consisting of 1,525 events with energy exceeding 10^18.5 eV, we find no
evidence for point-like excesses. We place 90% c.l. upper limits less than or
equal to 0.8 cosmic rays/km^2yr on the flux from such sources as a function of
position in the sky.
