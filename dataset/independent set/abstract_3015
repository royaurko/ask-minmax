We consider the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and the repulsive Hubbard model
on two $N$-site one-dimensional lattices, which support dispersionless
one-particle states corresponding to localized states on triangular trapping
cells. We calculate the degeneracy of the ground states in the subspaces with
$n\le n_{\max}$, $n_{\max}\propto N$ magnons or electrons as well as the
contribution of these states (independent localized states) to thermodynamic
quantities. Moreover, we discuss another class of low-lying eigenstates
(so-called interacting localized states) and calculate their contribution to
the partition function. We also discuss the effect of extra interactions, which
lift the degeneracy present due to the chirality of the localized states on
triangles. The localized states set an extra low-energy scale in the system and
lead to a nonzero residual ground-state entropy and to one (or more) additional
low-temperature peak(s) in the specific heat. Low-energy degrees of freedom in
the presence of perturbations removing degeneracy owing to the chirality can be
described in terms of an effective (pseudo)spin-1/2 transverse $XX$ chain.
