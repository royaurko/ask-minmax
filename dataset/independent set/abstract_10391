We investigate the dephasing dynamics of Bloch oscillations in semiconductor
superlattices by means of a very simple model including disorder and applied
electric fields. A thorough numerical study of our model allows us to claim
that small, unintentional well width fluctuations can be responsible for fast
dephasing of Bloch oscillations at low temperatures. We show that the lifetime
of Bloch oscillations is controlled by a characteristic time which depends on
the degree of disorder and is independent of the electric field. This result is
further supported by the excellent agreement between our model calculations and
several recent experiments, and leads to specific new predictions.
