We show that the validity of the non-commutative Khintchine inequality for
some $q$ with $1<q<2$ implies its validity (with another constant) for all
$1\le p<q$. We prove this for the inequality involving the Rademacher
functions, but also for more general "lacunary" sequences, or even
non-commutative analogues of the Rademacher functions. For instance, we may
apply it to the "Z(2)-sequences" previously considered by Harcharras. The
result appears to be new in that case. It implies that the space $\ell^n_1$
contains (as an operator space) a large subspace uniformly isomorphic (as an
operator space) to $R_k+C_k$ with $k\sim n^{\frac12}$. This naturally raises
several interesting questions concerning the best possible such $k$.
Unfortunately we cannot settle the validity of the non-commutative Khintchine
inequality for $0<p<1$ but we can prove several would be corollaries. For
instance, given an infinite scalar matrix $[x_{ij}]$, we give a necessary and
sufficient condition for $[\pm x_{ij}]$ to be in the Schatten class $S_p$ for
almost all (independent) choices of signs $\pm 1$. We also characterize the
bounded Schur multipliers from $S_2$ to $S_p$. The latter two characterizations
extend to $0<p<1$ results already known for $1\le p\le2$. In addition, we
observe that the hypercontractive inequalities, proved by Carlen and Lieb for
the Fermionic case, remain valid for operator space valued functions, and hence
the Kahane inequalities are valid in this setting.
