For a certain class of two-dimensional lattices, lattice-dual pairs are shown
to have the same bond percolation critical exponents. A computational proof is
given for the martini lattice and its dual to illustrate the method. The result
is generalized to a class of lattices that allows the equality of bond
percolation critical exponents for lattice-dual pairs to be concluded without
performing the computations. The proof uses the substitution method, which
involves stochastic ordering of probability measures on partially ordered sets.
As a consequence, there is an infinite collection of infinite sets of
two-dimensional lattices, such that all lattices in a set have the same
critical exponents.
