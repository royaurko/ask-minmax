In this paper we consider the product of two positive independent risks $Y_1$
and $Y_2$. If $Y_1$ is bounded and $Y_2$ has distribution in the Gumbel
max-domain of attraction with some auxiliary function which is regularly
varying at infinity, then we show that $Y_1Y_2$ has also distribution in the
Gumbel max-domain of attraction. Additionally, if both $Y_1,Y_2$ have
log-Weibullian or Weibullian tail behavior, we show that $Y_1Y_2$ has
log-Weibullian or Weibullian asymptotic tail behavior, respectively. We present
two applications of our results.
