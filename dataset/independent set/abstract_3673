Star cluster formation is a major mode of star formation in the extreme
conditions of interacting galaxies and violent starbursts. Young clusters are
observed to form in a variety of such galaxies, a substantial number resembling
the progenitors of globular clusters in mass and size, but with significantly
enhanced metallicity. From studies of the metal-poor and metal-rich star
cluster populations of galaxies, we can therefore learn about the violent star
formation history of these galaxies, and eventually about galaxy formation and
evolution. We present a new set of evolutionary synthesis models of our GALEV
code, with special emphasis on the gaseous emission of presently forming star
clusters, and a new tool to compare extensive model grids with multi-color
broad-band observations to determine individual cluster masses, metallicities,
ages and extinction values independently. First results for young star clusters
in the dwarf starburst galaxy NGC 1569 are presented. The mass distributions
determined for the young clusters give valuable input to dynamical star cluster
system evolution models, regarding survival and destruction of clusters. We
plan to investigate an age sequence of galaxy mergers to see dynamical
destruction effects in process.
