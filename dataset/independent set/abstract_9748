The generic crease set of an event horizon possesses anisotropic structure
though most of black holes are dynamically stable. This fact suggests that a
generic almost spherical black hole has a very crumpled crease set in a
microscopic scale though the crease set is similar to a point-wise crease set
in a macroscopic scale. In the present article, we count the number of such
micro-states of an almost spherical black hole by analogy with an elastic chain
polymer. This estimation of black hole entropy reproduces the well-known
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole.
