When testing for the mean vector in a high dimensional setting, it is
generally assumed that the observations are independently and identically
distributed. However if the data are dependent, the existing test procedures
fail to preserve type I error at a given nominal significance level. We propose
a new test for the mean vector when the dimension increases linearly with
sample size and the data is a realization of an M -dependent stationary
process. The order M is also allowed to increase with the sample size.
Asymptotic normality of the test statistic is derived by extending the central
limit theorem result for M -dependent processes using two dimensional
triangular arrays. Finite sample simulation results indicate the cost of
ignoring dependence amongst observations.
