We study the low-lying eigenvalues of the semiclassical Robin Laplacian in a
smooth planar and non concave domain symmetric with respect to an axis. In the
case when the curvature of the boundary of the domain attains its maximum at
exactly two points away from the axis of symmetry, we establish an explicit
asymptotic formula for the splitting of the first two eigenvalues. This is a
rigorous derivation of the semiclassical tunneling effect induced by the
domain's geometry. Our approach is close to the Born-Oppenheimer one and
yields, as a byproduct, a Weyl formula of independent interest.
