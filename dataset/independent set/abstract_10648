Small objects can swim by generating around them fields or gradients which in
turn induce fluid motion past their surface by phoretic surface effects. We
quantify for arbitrary swimmer shapes and surface patterns, how efficient
swimming requires both surface ``activity'' to generate the fields, and surface
``phoretic mobility.'' We show in particular that (i) swimming requires
symmetry breaking in either or both of the patterns of "activity" and
``mobility,'' and (ii) for a given geometrical shape and surface pattern, the
swimming velocity is size-independent. In addition, for given available surface
properties, our calculation framework provides a guide for optimizing the
design of swimmers.
