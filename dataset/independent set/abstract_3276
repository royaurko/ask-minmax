A multi-antenna transmitter that conveys independent sets of common data to
distinct groups of users is considered. This model is known as physical layer
multicasting to multiple co-channel groups. In this context, the practical
constraint of a maximum permitted power level radiated by each antenna is
addressed. The per-antenna power constrained system is optimized in a maximum
fairness sense with respect to predetermined quality of service weights. In
other words, the worst scaled user is boosted by maximizing its weighted
signal-to-interference plus noise ratio. A detailed solution to tackle the
weighted max-min fair multigroup multicast problem under per-antenna power
constraints is therefore derived. The implications of the novel constraints are
investigated via prominent applications and paradigms. What is more, robust
per-antenna constrained multigroup multicast beamforming solutions are
proposed. Finally, an extensive performance evaluation quantifies the gains of
the proposed algorithm over existing solutions and exhibits its accuracy over
per-antenna power constrained systems.
