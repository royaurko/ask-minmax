We study the rotational behaviour on minimal sets of torus homeomorphisms and
show that the associated rotation sets can be any type of line segments as well
as non-convex and even plane-separating continua. This shows that restrictions
holding for rotation sets on the whole torus are not valid on minimal sets. The
proof uses a construction of rotational horseshoes by Kwapisz to transfer the
problem to a symbolic level, where the desired rotational behaviour is
implemented by means of suitable irregular Toeplitz sequences.
