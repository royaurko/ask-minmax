We study the geodesic growth series of the braid group on three strands, B_3
:= <a,b|aba = bab>. We show that the set of geodesics of B_3 with respect to
the generating set S := {a,b,a^-1,b^-1} is a regular language, and we provide
an explicit computation of the geodesic growth series with respect to this set
of generators. In the process, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for
a freely reduced word w in S^* to be geodesic in B_3 with respect to S. Also,
we show that the translation length with respect to S of any element in B_3 is
an integer.
