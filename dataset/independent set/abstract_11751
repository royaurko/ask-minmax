The quasineutral limit of compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson system with heat
conductivity and general (ill-prepared) initial data is rigorously proved in
this paper. It is proved that, as the Debye length tends to zero, the solution
of the compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson system converges strongly to the
strong solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations plus a term of
fast singular oscillating gradient vector fields. Moreover, if the Debye
length, the viscosity coefficients and the heat conductivity coefficient
independently go to zero, we obtain the incompressible Euler equations. In both
cases the convergence rates are obtained.
