Using the canonical formalism, we study the asymptotic symmetries of the
topological 3-dimensional gravity with torsion. In the anti-de Sitter sector,
the symmetries are realized by two independent Virasoro algebras with classical
central charges. In the simple case of the teleparallel vacuum geometry, the
central charges are equal to each other and have the same value as in general
relativity, while in the general Riemann-Cartan geometry, they become
different.
