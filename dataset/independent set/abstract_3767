We study in detail the threshold energy dependence of the seasonal variation
effect in the energy integrated solar neutrino signal of the Super-Kamiokande
detector in the case of the $\nu_{e}\leftrightarrow \nu_{\mu,\tau}$ vacuum
oscillation (VO) solution of the solar neutrino problem. We show, in
particular, that for the values of $\Delta m^2$ and $\sin^22\theta$ from the VO
solution region, the predicted time and threshold e^- energy ($T_{e,Th}$)
dependence of the event rate factorize to a high degree of accuracy. As a
consequence, the VO generated seasonal variation asymmetry is given by the
product of an time-independent function of $T_{e,Th}$ and the standard
geometrical asymmetry. For any given $\Delta m^2$ and $\sin^22\theta$ from the
VO solution region there exists at least one value of $T_{e,Th}$ from the
interval (5 - 11) MeV, for which the seasonal variation effect in the solar
neutrino sample of events, formed by recoil electrons with kinetic energy
$T_{e} \geq T_{e,Th}$, is either maximal or very close to the maximal; it can
vary dramatically with $T_{e,Th}$. Measuring the seasonal effect in each one of
a large number of samples corresponding to different values of $T_{e,Th}$ from
the indicated interval, say, to $T_{e,Th} = 5; 6; 7;...; 11 MeV$, provides a
very effective test of the VO solution. Predictions for the magnitude of the
seasonal effect in such samples are given for a large set of representative
values of $\Delta m^2$ and $\sin^22\theta$ from the VO solution region.
