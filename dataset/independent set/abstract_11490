Dirac matrices, also known as gamma matrices, are defined only up to a
similarity transformation. Usually, some explicit representation of these
matrices is assumed in order to deal with them. In this article, we show how it
is possible to proceed without any such assumption. Various important
identities involving Dirac matrices and spinors have been derived without
assuming any representation at any stage.
