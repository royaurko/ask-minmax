A direct relation is established between the constants of motion for
conformal mechanics and those for its spherical part. In this way we find the
complete set of functionally independent constants of motion for the so-called
cuboctahedric Higgs oscillator, which is just the spherical part of the
rational A_3 Calogero model (describing four Calogero particles after
decoupling their center of mass).
