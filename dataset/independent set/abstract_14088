We prove a formula for the expected euler characteristic of excursion sets of
random sections of powers of an ample bundle $(L,h)$, where $h$ is a Hermitian
metric, over a K\"{a}hler manifold $(M,\omega)$. We then prove that the
critical radius of the Kodaira embedding $\Phi_N:M\rightarrow \CP^n$ given by
an orthonormal basis of $H^0(M,L^N)$ is bounded below when $N\rightarrow
\infty$. This result also gives conditions about when the preceding formula is
valid.
