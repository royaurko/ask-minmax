We prove a structure theorem for the multibrot sets, which are the higher
degree analogues of the Mandelbrot set, and give a complete picture of the
landing behavior of the rational parameter rays and the bifurcation phenomenon.
Our proof is inspired by previous works of Schleicher and Milnor on the
combinatorics of the Mandelbrot set; in particular, we make essential use of
combinatorial tools such as orbit portraits and kneading sequences. However, we
avoid the standard global counting arguments in our proof and replace them by
local analytic arguments to show that the parabolic and the Misiurewicz
parameters are landing points of rational parameter rays.
