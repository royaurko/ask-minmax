For an arbitrary integer N that is at least 2, this paper gives a
construction of a strictly stationary, N-tuplewise independent sequence of
(non-degenerate) bounded random variables such that the Central Limit Theorem
fails to hold. The sequence is in part an adaptation of a non-stationary
example with similar properties constructed by one of the contributors (ARP) in a
paper published in 1998.
