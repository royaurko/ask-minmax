The 2(2s+1)-component relativistic basis spinors for the arbitrary spin
particles are established in position, momentum and four-dimensional spaces,
where s=0,1 / 2,1, 3 / 2, 2, ... . These spinors for integral- and
half-integral spins are reduced to the independent sets of one- and
twocomponent spinors, respectively. Relations presented in this study can be
useful in the linear combination of atomic orbitals approximation for the
solution of generalized Dirac equation of arbitrary spin particles introduced
by the contributor when the orthogonal basis sets of relativistic exponential type
spinor wave functions and Slater type spinor orbitals in position, momentum and
four -dimensional spaces are employed.
