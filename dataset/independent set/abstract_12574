Following [arXiv:1202.5935 [hep-th]] and [arXiv:1212.4328 [hep-th]], we study
non-conformal brane plane wave backgrounds dual to strongly coupled gauge
theories with constant energy flux and holographic entanglement entropy for
strip subsystems in them. We find that for the strip direction along the
direction of the energy flux, the finite cutoff-independent part of
entanglement entropy can be estimated in terms of a dimensionless combination
of the energy density and the strip dimensions, alongwith an effective
scale-dependent number of degrees of freedom. For the strip orthogonal to the
flux direction, there are indications of phase transitions. We also briefly
discuss NS5-brane backgrounds corresponding to plane wave states in little
string theories.
