A flavour independent search for the CP-even and CP-odd neutral Higgs bosons
h and A is performed in 624/pb of data collected with the L3 detector at LEP at
centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209GeV. Higgs boson production through
the e^+e^- -> Z h and the e^+e^- ->h A processes is considered and decays of
the Higgs bosons into hadrons are studied. No significant signal is observed
and 95% confidence level limits on the hZZ and hAZ couplings are derived as a
function of the Higgs boson masses. Assuming the Standard Model cross section
for the Higgs-strahlung process and a 100% branching fraction into hadrons, a
95% confidence level lower limit on the mass of the Higgs boson is set at
110.3GeV.
