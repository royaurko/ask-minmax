An adjoint multiplet of screened monopoles forming a dilute gas fits very
well lattice data at high $T$. There are now seven ratios for k-strings
available, checking within a few percent with the prediction $k(N-k)$. The
diluteness turns out to be a small parameter for SU(N) gluodynamics, to a good
approximation ($1\over N^2$) independent of the value of $N$, and also
independent of $T$. This suggests a dilute Bose-Einstein gas, with a BE
transition at the deconfinement temperature $T_c$.
