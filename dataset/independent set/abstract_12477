We give a new upper bound on the stable commutator length of Dehn twists in
hyperelliptic mapping class groups, and determine the stable commutator length
of some elements. We also calculate values and the defects of homogeneous
quasimorphisms derived from \omega-signatures, and show that they are linearly
independent in the mapping class groups of pointed 2-spheres when the number of
points is small.
