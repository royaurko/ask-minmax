In the present paper, we show the equality of the $\gamma$-factors defined by
Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro and Shalika with those obtained via the
Langlands-Shahidi method. Our results are new in the case of positive
characteristic, where we establish a refined version of the local-global
principle for ${\rm GL}_n$ which has independent interest. In characteristic
zero, the results are due to Shahidi. The comparison of $\gamma$-factors is
made via a uniqueness result for Rankin-Selberg $\gamma$-factors.
