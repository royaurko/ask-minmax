This paper reports experiments with the causal independence inference
algorithm proposed by Zhang and Poole (1994b) on the CPSC network created by
Pradhan et al. (1994). It is found that the algorithm is able to answer 420 of
the 422 possible zero-observation queries, 94 of 100 randomly generated
five-observation queries, 87 of 100 randomly generated ten-observation queries,
and 69 of 100 randomly generated twenty-observation queries.
