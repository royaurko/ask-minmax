We investigate products J of ideals of "row initial" minors in the polynomial
ring K[X] defined by a generic m-by-n matrix. Such ideals are shown to be
generated by a certain set of standard bitableaux that we call superstandard.
These bitableaux form a Gr\"obner basis of J, and J has a linear minimal free
resolution. These results are used to derive a new generating set for the
Grothendieck group of finitely generated (T_m x GL_n(K))-equivariant modules
over K[X]. We employ the Knuth--Robinson--Schensted correspondence and a toric
deformation of the multi-Rees algebra that parameterizes the ideals J.
