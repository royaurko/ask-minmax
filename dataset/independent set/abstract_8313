Suppose we are given a family of choice functions on pairs from a given
finite set. The set is considered as a set of alternatives (say candidates for
an office) and the functions as potential "voters". The question is, what
choice functions agree, on every pair, with the majority of some finite
subfamily of the voters? For the problem as stated, a complete characterization
was given in \citet{shelah2009mdp}, but here we allow each voter to abstain.
There are four cases.
