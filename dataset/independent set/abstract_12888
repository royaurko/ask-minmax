We present a numerical analysis of helicity independent nucleon generalized
parton distributions (GPDs) using the known formalism based on inclusion of
higher Fock states in the soft-wall approach of the anti-de Sitter/QCD model.
We calculate the momentum space GPDs by matching the electromagnetic form
factors in the AdS model to the sum rules in QCD. We investigate their Mellin
moments, transverse impact parameter GPDs, transverse mean square radius, and
transverse width. We further extend this work to investigate the charge and
anomalous magnetization densities for both unpolarized and transversely
polarized nucleons. A comparison of results on density functions with
phenomenological parametrization is also presented.
