We study the structure of asymptotic symmetries in N=1+1 supersymmetric
extension of three-dimensional gravity with torsion. Using a natural
generalization of the bosonic anti-de Sitter asymptotic conditions, we show
that the asymptotic Poisson bracket algebra of the canonical generators has the
form of two independent super-Virasoro algebras with different central charges.
