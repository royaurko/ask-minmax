We compare the single inclusive spectra of isolated photons measured at high
transverse energy in proton-antiproton collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV with
next-to-leading order perturbative QCD predictions with various
parametrizations of the parton distribution functions (PDFs). Within the
experimental and theoretical uncertainties, the Tevatron data can be reproduced
equally well by the recent CTEQ6.6, MSTW08 and NNPDF1.2 PDF sets. We present
also the predictions for isolated gamma spectra in proton-proton collisions at
sqrt(s)=14TeV for central (y=0) and forward (y=4) rapidities relevant for LHC
experiments. Different proton PDFs result in maximum variations of order 30% in
the expected E_T-differential isolated gamma cross sections. The inclusion of
the isolated photon data in global PDF fits will place extra independent
constraints on the gluon density.
