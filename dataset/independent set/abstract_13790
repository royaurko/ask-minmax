We introduce and study Hopf monads on autonomous categories (i.e., monoidal
categories with duals). Hopf monads generalize Hopf algebras to a non-braided
(and non-linear) setting. Indeed, any monoidal adjunction between autonomous
categories gives rise to a Hopf monad. We extend many fundamental results of
the theory of Hopf algebras (such as the decomposition of Hopf modules, the
existence of integrals, Maschke's criterium of semisimplicity, etc...) to Hopf
monads. We also introduce and study quasitriangular and ribbon Hopf monads
(again defined in a non-braided setting).
