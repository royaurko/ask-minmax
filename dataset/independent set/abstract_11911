We measured the low frequency (10mHz < f < 10Hz) resistance fluctuations
(Noise) in single crystalline ferromagnetic Ni nanowires (diameter ~35nm) in
the temperature range 80K-300K. The noise spectral power shows 1/f dependence.
The nanowires in an applied magnetic field show negative magetoresistance that
saturates for H <= HC. The noise spectral power shows a reduction in low
applied field and becomes field independent for H >= HC. This indicates that a
part of the observed 1/f noise arises from magnetic origin. The magnetic part
is associated with thermally activated domain wall fluctuations that couples to
the resistance fluctuations.
