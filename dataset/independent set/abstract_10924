Within the framework of three lepton families we have derived an exact and
compact formula to describe the matter effect on neutrino mixing and CP
violation. This model- and parametrization-independent result can be
particularly useful for recasting the fundamental lepton flavor mixing matrix
from a variety of long-baseline neutrino experiments.
