Searches for scalar top, scalar bottom and degenerate scalar quarks have been
performed with data collected with the ALEPH detector at LEP. The data sample
consists of 57 pb^-1 taken at sqrt{s} = 181-184 GeV. No evidence for scalar
top, scalar bottom or degenerate scalar quarks was found in the channels
tilde{t} --> c chi, tilde{t} --> b l snu, tilde{b} --> b chi, and tilde{q} -->
q chi. From the channel tilde{t} --> c chi a limit of 74 GeV/c^2 has been set
on the scalar top quark mass, independent of the mixing angle. This limit
assumes a mass difference between the stop and the chi in the range 10-40
GeV/c^2. From the channel tilde{t} --> b l snu the mixing-angle-independent
scalar top limit is 82 GeV/c^2, assuming m_stop - m_snu > 10 GeV/c^2. From the
channel tilde{b} --> b chi a limit of 79 GeV/c^2 has been set on the mass of
the supersymmetric partner of the left-handed state of the bottom quark. This
limit is valid for m_sbottom - m_chi > 10 GeV/c^2. From the channel tilde{q}
--> q chi a limit of 87 GeV/c^2 has been set on the mass of supersymmetric
partners of light quarks, assuming five degenerate flavours and the production
of both ``left-handed'' and ``right-handed'' squarks. This limit is valid for
m_squark - m_chi > 5 GeV/c^2.
