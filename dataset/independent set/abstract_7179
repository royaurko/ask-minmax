The spread of a finite set of points is the ratio between the longest and
shortest pairwise distances. We prove that the Delaunay triangulation of any
set of n points in R^3 with spread D has complexity O(D^3). This bound is tight
in the worst case for all D = O(sqrt{n}). In particular, the Delaunay
triangulation of any dense point set has linear complexity. We also generalize
this upper bound to regular triangulations of k-ply systems of balls, unions of
several dense point sets, and uniform samples of smooth surfaces. On the other
hand, for any n and D=O(n), we construct a regular triangulation of complexity
Omega(nD) whose n vertices have spread D.
