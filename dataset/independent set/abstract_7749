Relativistic time synchronization along closed integral lines maintains
magnetic flux quantization independently from gravitation. All Fermi-volume
electrons form time-averaged electromagnetic fields within rotating conductors,
while Fermi-surface superelectrons enable flux quantization in SQUID
experiments. Inertia is not related to instantaneous self-coherent states of
the distributed electric charge and, therefore, the Cooper pair mass can not be
measured in principle from magnetic flux quantization.
