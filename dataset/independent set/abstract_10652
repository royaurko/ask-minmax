Atomic configurations of two or three Pd substituents on the Au(111) surface
are investigated using the first-principles pseudopotential plane wave
approach. Pd atoms are found to form second neighborhoods on PdAu(111). The
Pd-d band becomes narrow and well below the Fermi level, very different from
those in a Pd film or bulk Pd. Nevertheless, surface Pd atoms are still active
and serve as independent attractive centers towards adsorbates. The special
ensembles are important for catalysis applications because of their ability to
confine reactants in a small region.
