Autotuning is an established technique for optimizing the performance of
parallel applications. However, programmers must prepare applications for
autotuning, which is tedious and error prone coding work. We demonstrate how
applications become ready for autotuning with few or no modifications by
extending Threading Building Blocks (TBB), a library for parallel programming,
with autotuning. The extended TBB library optimizes all application-independent
tuning parameters fully automatically. We compare manual effort, autotuning
overhead and performance gains on 17 examples. While some examples benefit only
slightly, others speed up by 28% over standard TBB.
