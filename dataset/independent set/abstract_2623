In many contexts such as queuing theory, spatial statistics, geostatistics
and meteorology, data are observed at irregular spatial positions. One model of
this situation involves considering the observation points as generated by a
Poisson process. Under this assumption, we study the limit behavior of the
partial sums of the marked point process $\{(t_i,X(t_i))\}$, where X(t) is a
stationary random field and the points t_i are generated from an independent
Poisson random measure $\mathbb{N}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We define the sample
mean and sample variance statistics and determine their joint asymptotic
behavior in a heavy-tailed setting, thus extending some finite variance results
of Karr [Adv. in Appl. Probab. 18 (1986) 406--422]. New results on subsampling
in the context of a marked point process are also presented, with the
application of forming a confidence interval for the unknown mean under an
unknown degree of heavy tails.
