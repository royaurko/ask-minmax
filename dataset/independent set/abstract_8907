In this note we establish the boundedness properties of local maximal
operators $M_G$ on the fractional Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}(G)$ whenever $G$ is
an open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $0<s<1$ and $1<p<\infty$. As an application, we
characterize the fractional $(s,p)$-Hardy inequality on a bounded open set $G$
by a Maz'ya-type testing condition localized to Whitney cubes.
