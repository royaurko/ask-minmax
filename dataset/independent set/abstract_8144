We have systematically measured the shot noise in a single electron
transistor (SET) as a function of bias and gate voltages. By embedding a SET in
a resonance circuit we have been able to measure its shot noise at the
resonance frequency 464 MHz, where the 1/f noise is negligible. We can extract
the Fano factor which varies between 0.5 and 1 depending on the amount of
Coulomb blockade in the SET, in very good agreement with the theory.
