Spatial Independent Components Analysis (ICA) is increasingly used in the
context of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to study cognition and
brain pathologies. Salient features present in some of the extracted
Independent Components (ICs) can be interpreted as brain networks, but the
segmentation of the corresponding regions from ICs is still ill-controlled.
Here we propose a new ICA-based procedure for extraction of sparse features
from fMRI datasets. Specifically, we introduce a new thresholding procedure
that controls the deviation from isotropy in the ICA mixing model. Unlike
current heuristics, our procedure guarantees an exact, possibly conservative,
level of specificity in feature detection. We evaluate the sensitivity and
specificity of the method on synthetic and fMRI data and show that it
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
