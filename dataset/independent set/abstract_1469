While hidden class models of various types arise in many statistical
applications, it is often difficult to establish the identifiability of their
parameters. Focusing on models in which there is some structure of independence
of some of the observed variables conditioned on hidden ones, we demonstrate a
general approach for establishing identifiability utilizing algebraic
arguments. A theorem of J. Kruskal for a simple latent-class model with finite
state space lies at the core of our results, though we apply it to a diverse
set of models. These include mixtures of both finite and nonparametric product
distributions, hidden Markov models and random graph mixture models, and lead
to a number of new results and improvements to old ones. In the parametric
setting, this approach indicates that for such models, the classical definition
of identifiability is typically too strong. Instead generic identifiability
holds, which implies that the set of nonidentifiable parameters has measure
zero, so that parameter inference is still meaningful. In particular, this
sheds light on the properties of finite mixtures of Bernoulli products, which
have been used for decades despite being known to have nonidentifiable
parameters. In the nonparametric setting, we again obtain identifiability only
when certain restrictions are placed on the distributions that are mixed, but
we explicitly describe the conditions.
