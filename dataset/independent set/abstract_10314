The idea that the radio jets in AGN contain material in relativistic motion
is supported by many lines of observational evidence, including morphology,
brightness temperature estimated with interferometers and with intrinsic
variations, interstellar scintillations, X-rays, and superluminal motion. These
are largely independent, and taken together make an irrefutable case for
relativistic motion.
