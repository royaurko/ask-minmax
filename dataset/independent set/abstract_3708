Cosmic shear holds great promise for a precision independent measurement of
$\Omega\rm_m$, the mass density of the universe relative to the critical
density. The signal is expected to be weak, so a thorough understanding of
systematic effects is crucial. An important systematic effect is the
atmosphere: shear power introduced by the atmosphere is larger than the
expected signal. Algorithms exist to extract the cosmic shear from the
atmospheric component, though a measure of their success applied to a range of
seeing conditions is lacking.
  To gain insight into atmospheric shear, Gemini South imaging in conjunction
with ground condition and satellite wind data were obtained. We find that under
good seeing conditions Point-Spread-Function (PSF) correlations persist well
beyond the separation typical of high-latitude stars. Under these conditions,
ellipticity residuals based on a simple PSF interpolation can be reduced to
within a factor of a few of the shot-noise induced ellipticity floor. We also
find that the ellipticity residuals are highly correlated with wind direction.
Finally, we correct stellar shapes using a more sophisticated procedure and
generate shear statistics from stars. Under all seeing conditions in our data
set the residual correlations lie everywhere below the target signal level. For
good seeing we find that the systematic error attributable to atmospheric
turbulence is comparable in magnitude to the statistical error (shape noise)
over angular scales relevant to present lensing surveys.
