Independent component analysis (ICA) has proven useful for modeling brain and
electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Here, we present a new, generalized method
to better capture the dynamics of brain signals than previous ICA algorithms.
We regard EEG sources as eliciting spatio-temporal activity patterns,
corresponding to, e.g., trajectories of activation propagating across cortex.
This leads to a model of convolutive signal superposition, in contrast with the
commonly used instantaneous mixing model. In the frequency-domain, convolutive
mixing is equivalent to multiplicative mixing of complex signal sources within
distinct spectral bands. We decompose the recorded spectral-domain signals into
independent components by a complex infomax ICA algorithm. First results from a
visual attention EEG experiment exhibit (1) sources of spatio-temporal dynamics
in the data, (2) links to subject behavior, (3) sources with a limited spectral
extent, and (4) a higher degree of independence compared to sources derived by
standard ICA.
