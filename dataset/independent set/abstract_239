In this paper we present several results on the expected complexity of a
convex hull of $n$ points chosen uniformly and independently from a convex
shape.
  (i) We show that the expected number of vertices of the convex hull of $n$
points, chosen uniformly and independently from a disk is $O(n^{1/3})$, and
$O(k \log{n})$ for the case a convex polygon with $k$ sides. Those results are
well known (see \cite{rs-udkhv-63,r-slcdn-70,ps-cgi-85}), but we believe that
the elementary proof given here are simpler and more intuitive.
  (ii) Let $\D$ be a set of directions in the plane, we define a generalized
notion of convexity induced by $\D$, which extends both rectilinear convexity
and standard convexity.
  We prove that the expected complexity of the $\D$-convex hull of a set of $n$
points, chosen uniformly and independently from a disk, is $O(n^{1/3} +
\sqrt{n\alpha(\D)})$, where $\alpha(\D)$ is the largest angle between two
consecutive vectors in $\D$. This result extends the known bounds for the cases
of rectilinear and standard convexity.
  (iii) Let $\B$ be an axis parallel hypercube in $\Re^d$. We prove that the
expected number of points on the boundary of the quadrant hull of a set $S$ of
$n$ points, chosen uniformly and independently from $\B$ is $O(\log^{d-1}n)$.
Quadrant hull of a set of points is an extension of rectilinear convexity to
higher dimensions. In particular, this number is larger than the number of
maxima in $S$, and is also larger than the number of points of $S$ that are
vertices of the convex hull of $S$.
  Those bounds are known \cite{bkst-anmsv-78}, but we believe the new proof is
simpler.
