In a series of papers, M.Talagrand, the second contributor and others
investigated at length the properties and structure of pointwise compact sets
of measurable functions. A number of problems, interesting in themselves and
important for the theory of Pettis integration, were solved subject to various
special axioms. It was left unclear just how far the special axioms were
necessary. In particular, several results depended on the fact that it is
consistent to suppose that every countable relatively pointwise compact set of
Lebesgue measurable functions is `stable' in Talagrand's sense; the point
being that stable sets are known to have a variety of properties not shared by
all pointwise compact sets. In the present paper we present a model of set
theory in which there is a countable relatively pointwise compact set of
Lebesgue measurable functions which is not stable, and discuss the
significance of this model in relation to the original questions. A feature of
our model which may be of independent interest is the following: in it, there
is a closed negligible set Q subseteq [0,1]^2 such that whenever D subseteq
[0,1] has outer measure 1 then the set Q^{-1}[D]= {x:(exists y in D)((x,y) in
Q)} has inner measure 1.
