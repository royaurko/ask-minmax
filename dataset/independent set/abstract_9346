The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) used an array of 3He proportional
counters to measure the rate of neutral-current interactions in heavy water and
precisely determined the total active (nu_x) 8B solar neutrino flux. This
technique is independent of previous methods employed by SNO. The total flux is
found to be 5.54(+0.33/-0.31 stat, +0.36/-0.34 syst) x 10^6 cm^-2 s^-1, in
agreement with previous measurements and standard solar models. A global
analysis of solar and reactor neutrino results yields Delta m^2 =
7.59(+0.19/-0.21) x 10^-5 eV^2 and theta = 34.4(+1.3/-1.2) degrees. The
uncertainty on the mixing angle has been reduced from SNO's previous results.
