While large scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies involve a
combination of the scalar and tensor fluctuations, the scalar amplitude can be
independently determined through the CMB-galaxy cross-correlation. Using
recently measured cross-correlation amplitudes, arising from the
cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect in CMB
anisotropies, we obtain a constraint r < 0.5 at 68% confidence level on the
tensor-to-scalar fluctuation amplitude ratio. The data also allow us to exclude
gravity waves at a level of a few percent, relative to the density field, in a
low - Lambda dominated universe(Omega_Lambda~0.5). In future, joining
cross-correlation ISW measurements, which captures cosmological parameter
information, with independent determinations of the matter density and CMB
anisotropy power spectrum, may constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio to a level
above 0.05. This value is the ultimate limit on tensor-to-scalar ratio from
temperature anisotropy maps when all other cosmological parameters except for
the tensor amplitude are known and the combination with CMB-galaxy correlation
allows this limit to be reached easily by accounting for degeneracies in
certain cosmological parameters.
