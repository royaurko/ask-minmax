Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph. For a non-empty subset of vertices $S\subseteq V$,
and vertex $v\in V$, let $\delta_S(v)=|\{u\in S:uv\in E\}|$ denote the
cardinality of the set of neighbors of $v$ in $S$, and let $\bar{S}=V-S$.
Consider the following condition: {equation}\label{alliancecondition}
\delta_S(v)\ge \delta_{\bar{S}}(v)+k, \{equation} which states that a vertex
$v$ has at least $k$ more neighbors in $S$ than it has in $\bar{S}$. A set
$S\subseteq V$ that satisfies Condition (\ref{alliancecondition}) for every
vertex $v \in S$ is called a \emph{defensive} $k$-\emph{alliance}; for every
vertex $v$ in the neighborhood of $S$ is called an \emph{offensive}
$k$-\emph{alliance}. A subset of vertices $S\subseteq V$, is a \emph{powerful}
$k$-\emph{alliance} if it is both a defensive $k$-alliance and an offensive $(k
+2)$-alliance. Moreover, a subset $X\subset V$ is a defensive (an offensive or
a powerful) $k$-alliance free set if $X$ does not contain any defensive
(offensive or powerful, respectively) $k$-alliance. In this article we study
the relationships between defensive (offensive, powerful) $k$-alliance free
sets in Cartesian product graphs and defensive (offensive, powerful)
$k$-alliance free sets in the factor graphs.
