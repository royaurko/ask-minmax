It is shown that Julia-Zee dyons do not admit slowly rotating excitations.
This is achieved by investigating the complete set of stationary excitations
which can give rise to non-vanishing angular momentum. The relevant zero modes
are parametrized in a gauge invariant way and analyzed by means of a harmonic
decomposition. Since general arguments show that the solutions to the
linearized Bogomol'nyi equations cannot contribute to the angular momentum, the
relevant modes are governed by a set of electric and a set of non self-dual
magnetic perturbation equations. The absence of axial dipole deformations is
also established.
