We characterize the sets of offspring laws on which the Lotka--Nagaev
estimator for the mean of a supercritical Galton--Watson process is
qualitatively robust. These are exactly the locally uniformly integrating sets
of offspring laws, which may be quite large. If the corresponding global
property is assumed instead, we obtain uniform robustness as well. We
illustrate both results with a number of concrete examples. As a by-product of
the proof we obtain that the Lotka--Nagaev estimator is [locally] uniformly
weakly consistent on the respective sets of offspring laws, conditionally on
non-extinction.
