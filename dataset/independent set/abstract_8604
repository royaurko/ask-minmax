Given a finite set of $r$ points in a closed surface of genus $g$, we
consider the torsion elements in the mapping class group of the surface leaving
the finite set invariant. We show that the torsion elements generate the
mapping class group if and only if $(g, r) \neq (2, 5k+4)$ for some integer
$k$.
