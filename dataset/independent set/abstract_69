We develop a new method for enumerating independent sets of a fixed size in
general graphs, and we use this method to show that a conjecture of Engbers and
Galvin holds for all but finitely many graphs. We also use our method to prove
special cases of a conjecture of Kahn. In addition, we show that our method is
particularly useful for computing the number of independent sets of small sizes
in general regular graphs and Moore graphs, and we argue that it can be used in
many other cases when dealing with graphs that have numerous structural
restrictions.
