We determine the Tevatron's reach in supersymmetric parameter space in
trilepton, like-sign dilepton, and two lepton one tau-jet channels. We
critically study the standard model background processes. We find larger
backgrounds and, hence, significantly smaller reach regions than recent
analyses. We identify the major cause of the background discrepancy. We improve
signal-to-noise by introducing an invariant mass cut which takes advantage of a
sharp edge in the signal dilepton invariant mass distribution. Also, we
independently vary the cuts at each point in SUSY parameter space to determine
the set which yields the maximal reach. We find that this cut optimization can
significantly enhance the Tevatron reach.
