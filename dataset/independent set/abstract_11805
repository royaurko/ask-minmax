Let G be a complex connected reductive group. The PRV conjecture, which was
proved independently by S. Kumar and O. Mathieu in 1989, gives explicit
irreducible submodules of the tensor product of two irreducible G-modules. This
paper has three aims. First, we simplify the proof of the PRV conjecture, then
we generalize it to other branching problems. Finally, we find other
irreducible components of the tensor product of two irreducible G-modules that
appear for "the same reason" as the PRV ones.
