For every positive integer $k$, a set $S$ of vertices in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is
a $k$-tuple dominating set of $G$ if every vertex of $V-S$ is adjacent to least
$k$ vertices and every vertex of $S$ is adjacent to least $k-1$ vertices in
$S$. The minimum cardinality of a $k$-tuple dominating set of $G$ is the
$k$-tuple domination number of $G$. When $k=1$, a $k$-tuple domination number
is the well-studied domination number. We define the $k$-tuple domatic number
of $G$ as the largest number of sets in a partition of $V$ into $k$-tuple
dominating sets. Recall that when $k=1$, a $k$-tuple domatic number is the
well-studied domatic number. In this work, we derive basic properties and
bounds for the $k$-tuple domatic number.
