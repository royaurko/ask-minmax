Consider $n$ independent Goldstein-Kac telegraph processes $X_1(t), \dots
,X_n(t), \; n\ge 2, \; t\ge 0,$ on the real line $\Bbb R$. Each the process
$X_k(t), \; k=1,\dots,n,$ describes a stochastic motion at constant finite
speed $c_k>0$ of a particle that, at the initial time instant $t=0$, starts
from some initial point $x_k^0=X_k(0)\in\Bbb R$ and whose evolution is
controlled by a homogeneous Poisson process $N_k(t)$ of rate $\lambda_k>0$. The
governing Poisson processes $N_k(t), \; k=1,\dots,n,$ are supposed to be
independent as well. Consider the linear form of the processes $X_1(t), \dots
,X_n(t), \; n\ge 2,$ defined by $$L(t) = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k X_k(t) ,$$ where
$a_k, \; k=1,\dots,n,$ are arbitrary real non-zero constant coefficients. We
obtain a hyperbolic system of first-order partial differential equations for
the joint probability densities of the process $L(t)$ and of the directions of
motions at arbitrary time $t>0$. From this system we derive a partial
differential equation of order $2^n$ for the transition density of $L(t)$ in
the form of a determinant of a block matrix whose elements are the differential
operators with constant coefficients. The weak convergence of $L(t)$ to a
homogeneous Wiener process, under Kac's scaling conditions, is proved.
Initial-value problems for the transition densities of the sum and difference
$S^{\pm}(t)=X_1(t) \pm X_2(t)$ of two independent telegraph processes with
arbitrary parameters, are also posed.
