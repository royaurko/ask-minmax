The construction of the cylinder at spatial infinity for stationary
spacetimes is considered. Using a specific conformal gauge and frame, it is
shown that the tensorial fields associated to the conformal Einstein field
equations admit expansions in a neighbourhood of the cylinder at spatial
infinity which are analytic with respect to some suitable time, radial and
angular coordinates. It is then shown that the essentials of the construction
are independent of the choice of conformal gauge. As a consequence, one finds
that the construction of the cylinder at spatial infinity and the regular
finite initial value problem for stationary initial data sets are, in a precise
sense, as regular as they could be.
