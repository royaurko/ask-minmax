We present a dipole-charged generalisation of the Pomeransky-Sen'kov black
ring in five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory. It rotates in two independent
directions, although one of the rotations has been tuned to achieve balance, so
that the space-time does not contain any conical singularities. This solution
was constructed using the inverse-scattering method in six-dimensional vacuum
gravity. We then study various physical properties of this solution, with
particular emphasis on the new features that the dipole charge introduces.
