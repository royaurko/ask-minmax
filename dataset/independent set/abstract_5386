Efficient characteristic set methods for computing solutions of polynomial
equation systems in a finite field are proposed. The concept of proper
triangular sets is introduced and an explicit formula for the number of
solutions of a proper and monic (or regular) triangular set is given. An
improved zero decomposition algorithm which can be used to reduce the zero set
of an equation system in general form to the union of zero sets of monic proper
triangular sets is proposed. As a consequence, we can give an explicit formula
for the number of solutions of an equation system. Bitsize complexity for the
algorithm is given in the case of Boolean polynomials. We also give a
multiplication free characteristic set method for Boolean polynomials, where
the sizes of the polynomials are effectively controlled. The algorithms are
implemented in the case of Boolean polynomials and extensive experiments show
that they are quite efficient for solving certain classes of Boolean equations.
