In this paper we show a characterization of the joint spectral radius of a
set of matrices as the limit of the $p$-radius of an associated probability
distribution when $p$ tends to $\infty$. Allowing the set to have infinitely
many matrices, the obtained formula extends the results in the literature.
Based on the formula, we then present a novel characterization of the stability
of switched linear systems for an arbitrary switching signal via the existence
of stochastic Lyapunov functions of any higher degrees. Numerical examples are
presented to illustrate the results.
