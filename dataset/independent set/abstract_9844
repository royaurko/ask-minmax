The population dynamics of predator-prey systems in the presence of
patch-specific predators are explored in a setting where the prey population
has access to both habitats. The emphasis is in situations where patch-prey
abundance drives prey-dispersal between patches, with the fragile prey
populations, that is, populations subject to the Allee effect. The resulting
four-dimensional model's mathematical analysis is carried out via sub-models
that focus in lower dimensional settings. The outcomes depend on, and in fact
they are quite sensitive to, the structure of the system, the range of
parameter values, and initial conditions. We show that the system can support
multi-stability and a diverse set of predator-prey life-history dynamics that
includes rather complex dynamical system outcomes. It is argued that in general
evolution should favor heterogeneous settings including Allee effects,
prey-refuges, and patch-specific predators.
