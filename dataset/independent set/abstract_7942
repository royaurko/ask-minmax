This letter is on the performance of the turbo signal recovery (TSR)
algorithm for partial discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices based
compressed sensing. Based on state evolution analysis, we prove that TSR with a
partial DFT sensing matrix outperforms the well-known approximate message
passing (AMP) algorithm with an independent identically distributed (IID)
sensing matrix.
