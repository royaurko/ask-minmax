We classify torsion-free real-analytic affine connections on compact oriented
real-analytic surfaces which are locally homogeneous on a nontrivial open set,
without being locally homogeneous on all of the surface. In particular, we
prove that such connections exist. This classification relies in a local result
that classifies germs of torsion-free real-analytic affine connections on a
neighborhood of the origin in the plane which are quasihomogeneous, in the
sense that they are locally homogeneous on an open set containing the origin in
its closure, but not locally homogeneous in the neighborhood of the origin.
