The 2008 Workshop on Algorithms for Modern Massive Data Sets (MMDS 2008),
sponsored by the NSF, DARPA, LinkedIn, and Yahoo!, was held at Stanford
University, June 25--28. The goals of MMDS 2008 were (1) to explore novel
techniques for modeling and analyzing massive, high-dimensional, and
nonlinearly-structured scientific and internet data sets; and (2) to bring
together computer scientists, statisticians, mathematicians, and data analysis
practitioners to promote cross-fertilization of ideas.
