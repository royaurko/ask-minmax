The forward-backward multiplicity and correlations of target evaporated
fragment(black track particle) and target recoiled proton(grey track particle)
emitted in 150 A MeV He-emulsion, 290 A MeV C-emulsion, 400 A MeV C-emulsion,
400 A MeV Ne-emulsion and 500 A MeV Fe-emulsion interactions are investigated.
It is found that the forward and backward averaged multiplicity of grey, black
and heavily ionized track particle increase with the increase of target size.
Averaged multiplicity of forward black track particle, backward black track
particle, and backward grey track particle do not depend on the projectile size
and energy, but the averaged multiplicity of forward grey track particle
increases with increase of projectile size and energy. The backward grey track
particle multiplicity distribution follows an exponential decay law and the
decay constant decreases with increase of target size. The backward-forward
multiplicity correlations follow linear law which is independent of the
projectile size and energy, and the saturation effect is observed in some heavy
target data sets.
