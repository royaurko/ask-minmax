We present the complete next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to the
top quark associated with $\gamma$ production induced by model-independent
$tq\gamma$ and $tqg$ flavor-changing neutral-current (FCNC) couplings at hadron
colliders, respectively. We also consider the mixing effects between the
$tq\gamma$ and $tqg$ FCNC couplings for this process. Our results show that,
for the $tq\gamma$ couplings, the NLO QCD corrections can enhance the total
cross sections by about 50% and 40% at the Tevatron and LHC, respectively.
Including the contributions from the $tq\gamma$, $tqg$ FCNC couplings and their
mixing effects, the NLO QCD corrections can enhance the total cross sections by
about 50% for the $tu\gamma$ and $tug$ FCNC couplings, and by about the 80% for
the $tc\gamma$ and $tcg$ FCNC couplings at the LHC, respectively. Moreover, the
NLO corrections reduce the dependence of the total cross section on the
renormalization and factorization scale significantly. We also evaluate the NLO
corrections for several important kinematic distributions.
