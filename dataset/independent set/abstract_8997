We incorporate a time-independent gravitational field into the BGK scheme for
numerical hydrodynamics. In the BGK scheme the gas evolves via an approximation
to the collisional Boltzmann equation, namely the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK)
equation. Time-dependent hydrodynamical fluxes are computed from local
solutions of the BGK equation. By accounting for particle collisions, the
fundamental mechanism for generating dissipation in gas flow, a scheme based on
the BGK equation gives solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations: the fluxes
carry both advective and dissipative terms. We perform numerical experiments in
both 1D Cartesian geometries and axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates.
