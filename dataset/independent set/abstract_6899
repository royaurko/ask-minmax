We consider symmetric (as well as multi-symmetric) real algebraic varieties
and semi-algebraic sets, as well as symmetric complex varieties in affine and
projective spaces, defined by polynomials of fixed degrees. We give polynomial
(in the dimension of the ambient space) bounds on the number of irreducible
representations of the symmetric group which acts on these sets, as well as
their multiplicities, appearing in the isotypic decomposition of their
cohomology modules with coefficients in a field of characteristic $0$. We also
give some applications of our methods in proving lower bounds on the degrees of
defining polynomials of certain symmetric semi-algebraic sets, as well as
better bounds on the Betti numbers of the images under projections of (not
necessarily symmetric) bounded real algebraic sets.
  Finally, we conjecture that the multiplicities of the irreducible
representations of the symmetric group in the cohomology modules of symmetric
semi-algebraic sets are computable with polynomial complexity, which would
imply that the Betti numbers of such sets are also computable with polynomial
complexity. This is in contrast with general semi-algebraic sets, for which
this problem is provably hard ($\#\mathbf{P}$-hard). We also formulate a
question asking whether these multiplicities can be expressed as a polynomial
in the number $k$ of variables for all large enough $k$.
