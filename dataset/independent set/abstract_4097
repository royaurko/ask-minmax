Let $A$ be a compact $d$-rectifiable set embedded in Euclidean space $\RR^p$,
$d\le p$. For a given continuous distribution $\sigma(x)$ with respect to
$d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure on $A$, our earlier results provided a method
for generating $N$-point configurations on $A$ that have asymptotic
distribution $\sigma (x)$ as $N\to \infty$; moreover such configurations are
"quasi-uniform" in the sense that the ratio of the covering radius to the
separation distance is bounded independent of $N$. The method is based upon
minimizing the energy of $N$ particles constrained to $A$ interacting via a
weighted power law potential $w(x,y)|x-y|^{-s}$, where $s>d$ is a fixed
parameter and $w(x,y)=\left(\sigma(x)\sigma(y)\right)^{-({s}/{2d})}$.
  Here we show that one can generate points on $A$ with the above mentioned
properties keeping in the energy sums only those pairs of points that are
located at a distance of at most $r_N=C_N N^{-1/d}$ from each other, with $C_N$
being a positive sequence tending to infinity arbitrarily slowly. To do this we
minimize the energy with respect to a varying truncated weight
$v_N(x,y)=\Phi\(\left|x-y\right|/r_N\)w(x,y)$, where $\Phi:(0,\infty)\to
[0,\infty)$ is a bounded function with $\Phi(t)=0$, $t\geq 1$, and $\lim_{t\to
0^+}\Phi(t)=1$. This reduces, under appropriate assumptions, the complexity of
generating $N$ point `low energy' discretizations to order $N C_N^d$
computations.
