The inviscid limit of the stochastic Burgers equation, with body forces white
noise in time, is discussed in terms of the level surfaces of the minimising
Hamilton-Jacobi function, the classical mechanical caustic and the Maxwell set
and their algebraic pre-images under the classical mechanical flow map. The
problem is analysed in terms of a reduced (one dimensional) action function. We
give an explicit expression for an algebraic surface containing the Maxwell set
and caustic in the polynomial case. Those parts of the caustic and Maxwell set
which are singular are characterised. We demonstrate how the geometry of the
caustic, level surfaces and Maxwell set can change infinitely rapidly causing
turbulent behaviour which is stochastic in nature, and we determine its
intermittence in terms of the recurrent behaviour of two processes.
