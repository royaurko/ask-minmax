The stress caused by vortices in tetragonal superconductors contributes to
the intervortex interaction which depends on vortex orientation within the
crystal, on elastic moduli, and is attractive within certain angular regions
even in fields along the $c$ crystal axis. For sufficiently strong stress
dependence of the critical temperature, this contribution may result in
distortions of the hexagonal vortex lattice for $\bm H||\bm c$. In small fields
it leads to formation of a square vortex lattice with a fixed $H$ independent
spacing. This should be seen in the magnetization $M(H)$ as a discontinuous
jump of magnetization at the transition from the Meissner to mixed states.
