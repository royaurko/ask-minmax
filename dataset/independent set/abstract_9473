We analyze the recent results of the MiniBooNE short-baseline experiment on
antinu_mu -> antinu_e oscillations in a minimal model-independent framework of
antineutrino mixing in conjunction with the positive LSND signal and the
negative KARMEN measurements. We show that the data of the three short-baseline
antinu_mu -> antinu_e experiments are compatible. Taking into account also the
model-independent constraints due to the limits on short-baseline antinu_e
disappearance obtained in reactor antineutrino experiments, we find that the
favored region of the effective oscillation parameters lies within 0.002 <~
sin^2 2 theta <~ 0.05 and 0.2 <~ Delta m^2 <~ 2 eV^2.
