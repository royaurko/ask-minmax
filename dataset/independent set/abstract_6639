The notion of well-separated sets is crucial in fast multipole methods as the
main idea is to approximate the interaction between such sets via cluster
expansions. We revisit the one-parameter multipole acceptance criterion in a
general setting and derive a relative error estimate. This analysis benefits
asymmetric versions of the method, where the division of the multipole boxes is
more liberal than in conventional codes. Such variants offer a particularly
elegant implementation with a balanced multipole tree, a feature which might be
very favorable on modern computer architectures.
