We reanalyze the mass matrices model of quarks and leptons which gives a
unified description of quark and lepton mass matrices with the same texture
form. By investigating possible types of the assignment for the texture's
components of this mass matrix form, we find that a different assignment for
up-quarks from one for down-quarks can lead to consistent values of CKM mixing
matrix. This finding overcomes a weak point of the previous analysis of the
model. We also obtain some relations among the CKM mixing matrix parameters,
which are independent of evolution effects.
