Given a group G, we let Z(G) denote its center, G' its commutator subgroup,
and Phi (G) its Frattini subgroup (the intersection of all maximal proper
subgroups of G).  Given U leq G, we let N_G (U) stand for the normalizer of
U in G. A group G is FC iff every element g in G has finitely many
conjugates. A p-group E is called extraspecial iff Phi (E) = E' = Z(E) cong
Z_p, the cyclic group with p elements.
  When generalizing a characterization of centre-by-finite groups due to
B. H. Neumann, M. J. Tomkinson asked the following question. Is there an
FC-group G with vert G / Z(G) vert = kappa but [G:N_G(U)] < kappa for all
(abelian) subgroups U of G, where kappa is an uncountable cardinal. We
consider this question for kappa = omega_1 and kappa = omega_2. It turns
out that the answer is largely independent of ZFC, and that it differs
greatly in the two cases.
  More explicitly, for kappa = omega_1, it is consistent with, and
independent of, ZFC that there is a group G with vert G / Z(G) vert =
omega_1 and [G:N_G (A)] leq omega for all abelian A leq G. We do not know
whether the same statement is still consistent if we drop abelian. On the
other hand, for kappa = omega_2, the non-existence of groups G with vert G
/ Z(G) vert = omega_2 and [G : N_G (A) ] leq omega_1 for all (abelian) A
leq G is equiconsistent with the existence of an inaccessible cardinal. In
particular, there is an extraspecial p-group with this property if there is
a Kurepa tree.
