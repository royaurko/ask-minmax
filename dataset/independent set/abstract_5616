A first step in exploring population structure in crop plants and other
organisms is to define the number of subpopulations that exist for a given data
set. The genetic marker data sets being generated have become increasingly
large over time and commonly are of the high-dimension, low sample size (HDLSS)
situation. An algorithm for deciding the number of clusters is proposed, and is
validated on simulated data sets varying in both the level of structure and the
number of clusters covering the range of variation observed empirically. The
algorithm was then tested on six empirical data sets across three small grain
species. The algorithm uses bootstrapping, three methods of clustering, and
defines the optimum number of clusters based on a common criterion, the
Hubert's gamma statistic. Validation on simulated sets coupled with testing on
empirical sets suggests that the algorithm can be used for a wide variety of
genetic data sets.
