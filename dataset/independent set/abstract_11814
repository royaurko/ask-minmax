The transverse densities in a fast-moving nucleon offer a model-independent
framework for analyzing the spatial structure of the pion cloud and its role in
current matrix elements. We calculate the chiral large-distance component of
the charge density using a dispersion representation of the form factor and
discuss its partonic interpretation. The non-chiral core is dominant up to
surprisingly large distances ~2 fm. The chiral component can be probed in
precision low-Q^2 elastic eN scattering or in peripheral deep-inelastic
processes which resolve its quark/gluon content.
