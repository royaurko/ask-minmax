We use Padoa's principle of independence of primitive symbols in axiomatic
systems in order to show that time is dispensable in continuum thermodynamics,
according to the axiomatic formulation of Gurtin and Williams. We also show how
to define time by means of the remaining primitive concepts of Gurtin and
Williams system. Finally, we introduce thermodynamics without any explicit
reference to time and briefly discuss some physical and philosophical
consequences of our main results.
