In this paper, we establish a multiplicative decomposition formula for
nonnegative local martingales and use it to characterize the set of continuous
local submartingales Y of the form Y=N+A, where the measure dA is carried by
the set of zeros of Y. In particular, we shall see that in the set of all local
submartingales with the same martingale part in the multiplicative
decomposition, these submartingales are the smallest ones. We also study some
integrability questions in the multiplicative decomposition and interpret the
notion of saturated sets in the light of our results.
