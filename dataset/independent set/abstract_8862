We introduce a global wave front set suitable for the analysis of tempered
ultradistributions of quasianalytic Gelfand-Shilov type. We study the
transformation properties of the wave front set and use them to give microlocal
existence results for pull-backs and products. We further study quasianalytic
microlocality for classes of localization and ultradifferential operators, and
prove microellipticity for differential operators with polynomial coefficients.
