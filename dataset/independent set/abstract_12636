The library PRAND for pseudorandom number generation for modern CPUs and GPUs
is presented. It contains both single-threaded and multi-threaded realizations
of a number of modern and most reliable generators recently proposed and
studied in [1,2,3,4,5] and the efficient SIMD realizations proposed in [6]. One
of the useful features for using PRAND in parallel simulations is the ability
to initialize up to $10^{19}$ independent streams. Using massive parallelism of
modern GPUs and SIMD parallelism of modern CPUs substantially improves
performance of the generators.
