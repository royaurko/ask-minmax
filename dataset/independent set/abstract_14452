We prove the equivalence (under some conditions) of two sets of coherent
states built for the one-dimensional infinite square well: the so-called
generalized and Gaussian Klauder coherent states. We then derive an approximate
close expression approaching their probability density and wave function to
explore their properties analytically. This process gives thereby explanation
of the quasi-classical behavior of these states in terms of the main
observables and the Heisenberg uncertainty product
