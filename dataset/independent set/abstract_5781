We introduce a graphical representation for a global SO(n) tensor
$\pl_\m\pl_\n h_\ab$, which generally appears in the perturbative approach of
gravity around the flat space: $g_\mn=\del_\mn+h_\mn$. We systematically
construct global SO(n) invariants. Independence and completeness of those
invariants are shown by taking examples of $\pl\pl h$-, and $ (\pl\pl h)^2$-
invariants. They are classified graphically. Indices which characterize all
independent invariants (or graphs) are given. We apply the results to general
invariants with dimension $(Mass)^4$ and the Gauss-Bonnet identity in 4-dim
gravity.
