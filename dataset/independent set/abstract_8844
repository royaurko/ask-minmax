In this work we study the relation between the set of symmetric operators and
the set of mutually unbiased operators from finite plane geometry point of
view. Here symmetric operators are generalization of symmetric informationally
complete probability-operator measurements (SIC POMs), while mutually unbiased
operators are the operator generalization of mutually unbiased bases (MUB). We
also discuss the implication of this relation to the particular cases of rank-1
SIC POMs and MUB.
