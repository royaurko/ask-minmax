In this paper we obtain precise estimates for the $L^2$ norm of the
$s$-dimensional Riesz transforms on very general measures supported on Cantor
sets in $\mathbb R^d$, with $d-1<s<d$. From these estimates we infer that, for
the so called uniformly disconnected compact sets, the capacity $\gamma_s$
associated with the Riesz kernel $x/|x|^{s+1}$ is comparable to the capacity
$\dot{C}_{\frac{2}{3}(d-s),\frac{3}{2}}$ from non-linear potential theory.
