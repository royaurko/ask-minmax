We consider codimension one holomorphic foliations with \textit{non-Kupka
points} in its singular set. We study the foliation near the non-Kupka points
of the singular set, and for a foliation defined in a three dimensional
projective manifold, we computed the number of non-Kupka points in the ambient
space.
