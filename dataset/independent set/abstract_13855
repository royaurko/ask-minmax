A general scheme to seek for the relations between entanglement and
bservables is proposed in principle. In two-qubit systems with enough general
Hamiltonian, we find the entanglement to be the functions of observables for
six kinds of chosen state sets and verify how these functions be invariant with
time evolution. Moreover, we demonstrate and illustrate the cases with
entanglement versus a set of commutable observables under eight kinds of given
initial states. Our conclusions show how entanglement become observable even
measurable by experiment, and they are helpful for understanding of the nature
of entanglement in physics.
