We specify a small set, consisting of $O(d(\log\log d)^2)$ points, that
intersects the basins under Newton's method of \emph{all} roots of \emph{all}
(suitably normalized) complex polynomials of fixed degrees $d$, with
arbitrarily high probability. This set is an efficient and universal
\emph{probabilistic} set of starting points to find all roots of polynomials of
degree $d$ using Newton's method; the best known \emph{deterministic} set of
starting points consists of $\lceil 1.1d(\log d)^2\rceil$ points.
