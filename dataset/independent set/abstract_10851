We estimate the kinematic dependence of the exclusive photo-- and
electroproduction of $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ exotic mesons due to $\pi$ exchange. We
show that the kinematic dependence is largely independent of the exotic meson
form factor, which is explicitly derived for a $1^{-+}$ isovector hybrid meson
in the flux-tube model of Isgur and Paton. The relevance to experiments
currently planned at Jefferson Lab is indicated.
