Electrostatic turbulence in weakly collisional, magnetized plasma can be
interpreted as a cascade of entropy in phase space, which is proposed as a
universal mechanism for dissipation of energy in magnetized plasma turbulence.
When the nonlinear decorrelation time at the scale of the thermal Larmor radius
is shorter than the collision time, a broad spectrum of fluctuations at
sub-Larmor scales is numerically found in velocity and position space, with
theoretically predicted scalings. The results are important because they
identify what is probably a universal Kolmogorov-like regime for kinetic
turbulence; and because any physical process that produces fluctuations of the
gyrophase-independent part of the distribution function may, via the entropy
cascade, result in turbulent heating at a rate that increases with the
fluctuation amplitude, but is independent of the collision frequency.
