We show that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of
number-conserving cellular automata (CA) with $q$ inputs and the set of
balanced sequences with $q$ terms. This allows to enumerate number-conserving
CA. We also show that number-conserving rules are becoming increasingly rare as
the number of states increases.
