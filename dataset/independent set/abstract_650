We study the generalization of the G/G/1 queue obtained by relaxing the
assumption of independence between inter-arrival times and service
requirements. The analysis is carried out for the class of multivariate matrix
exponential distributions introduced in [12]. In this setting, we obtain the
steady state waiting time distribution and we show that the classical relation
between the steady state waiting time and the workload distributions re- mains
valid when the independence assumption is relaxed. We also prove duality
results with the ruin functions in an ordinary and a delayed ruin process.
These extend several known dualities between queueing and risk models in the
independent case. Finally we show that there exist stochastic order relations
between the waiting times under various instances of correlation.
