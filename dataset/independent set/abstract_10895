We present a brief pedagogical introduction to the Effective Electroweak
Chiral Lagrangians, which provide a model independent description of the WW
interactions in the strong regime. When it is complemented with some
unitarization or a dispersive approach, this formalism allows the study of the
general strong scenario expected at the LHC, including resonances.
