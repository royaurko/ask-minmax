An explicit upper bound on the tail probabilities for the normalized
Rademacher sums is given. This bound, which is best possible in a certain
sense, is asymptotically equivalent to the corresponding tail probability of
the standard normal distribution, thus affirming a longstanding conjecture by
Efron. Applications to sums of general centered uniformly bounded independent
random variables and to the Student test are presented.
