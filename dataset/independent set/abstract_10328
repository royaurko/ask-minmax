We derive simple analytic expressions for the continuum lightcurves and
spectra of flaring and flickering events that occur over a wide range of
astrophysical systems. We compare these results to data taken from the
cataclysmic variable SS Cygni and also with SN 1987A, deriving physical
parameters for the material involved. Fits to the data indicate a nearly
time-independent photospheric temperature arising from the strong temperature
dependence of opacity when hydrogen is partially ionized.
