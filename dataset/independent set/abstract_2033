We search for B- ==> \tilde{D0}K- and B- ==> \tilde{D*0}K-, with \tilde{D*0}
==> \tilde{D0}pi0 or \tilde{D*0} ==> \tilde{D0}gamma, and \tilde{D0} ==> K+pi-
(and charge conjugates). These final states can be reached through the b==>c
transition B- ==> D0(*)K- followed by the doubly CKM-suppressed D0 ==> K+pi-,
or the b==>u transition B- ==> D0bar(*)K- followed by the CKM-favored D0bar ==>
K+pi-. The interference of these two amplitudes is sensitive to the angle gamma
of the unitarity triangle. Our results are based on 232 million
Upsilon(4S)==>BBbar decays collected with the BaBar detector at SLAC. We find
no significant evidence for these decays. We set a limit r_B = |A(B- ==> D0bar
K-)/A(B- ==> D0 K-)| < 0.23 at 90% C.L. using the most conservative assumptions
on the values of the CKM angle gamma and the strong phases in the B and D decay
amplitudes. In the case of the D* we set a 90% C.L. limit r*_B^2 = |A(B- ==>
D*0bar K-)/A(B- ==> D*0 K-)|^2 < (0.16)^2 which is independent of assumptions
on gamma and strong phases.
