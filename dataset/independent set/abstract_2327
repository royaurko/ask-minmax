The multiplication of architecture description languages, component models
and platforms implies a serious dilemma for component based software
architects. On the one hand, they have to choose a language to describe
concrete configurations which will be automatically deployed on execution
platforms. On the other hand, they wish to capitalize their software
architectures independently of any description languages or platforms. To solve
this problem, we propose a multi personalities environment for the
configuration and the deployment of component based applications. This
environment is composed of a core capturing a canonical model of configuration
and deployment, and a set of personalities tailored to languages and platforms.
This paper details the architecture of such an environment and describes the
personalities for the CORBA and Fractal component models.
