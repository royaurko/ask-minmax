We construct initial data for a particular class of Brill wave metrics using
Regge calculus, and compare the results to a corresponding continuum solution,
finding excellent agreement. We then search for trapped surfaces in both sets
of initial data, and provide an independent verification of the existence of an
apparent horizon once a critical gravitational wave amplitude is passed. Our
estimate of this critical value, using both the Regge and continuum solutions,
supports other recent findings.
