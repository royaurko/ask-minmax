The Tevatron Run-II started data-taking in spring 2001 and several searches
for new particles have been performed. The preliminary 2005 results are
concisely reviewed for the experiments CDF and D0. Model-independent and
model-dependent limits on Higgs boson and Supersymmetric particle production
are set and interpretations are given. Several limits from the LEP era have
been extended. The outlook for the Tevatron and the prospects for the ATLAS and
CMS experiments at the LHC for selected searches are briefly addressed.
