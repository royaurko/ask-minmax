In a storage ring of discrete magnets with uniform field and edge focusing,
the field averaged over the orbit can be independent of orbit radius (particle
momentum). This ring is suitable for measuring the anomalous magnetic moment of
the muon. The field, averaged over the orbit, can be calibrated by injecting
transversely polarized protons of the same momentum and measuring the proton
(g-2) precession. A measurement at the level of 0.03 ppm may be feasible.
