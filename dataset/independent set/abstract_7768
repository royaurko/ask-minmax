We discuss the application of perturbation theory to a system of particles
confined in a spherical box. A simple argument shows that the particles behave
almost independently in sufficiently strong confinement. We choose the helium
atom with a moving nucleus as a particular example and compare results of first
order with those for the nucleus clamped at the center of the box. We provide a
suitable explanation for some numerical results obtained recently by other
contributors.
