The quasistatic rate-independent damage combined with linearized plasticity
with hardening at small strains is investigated. The fractional-step time
discretisation is devised with the purpose to obtain a numerically efficient
scheme converging possibly to a physically relevant stress-driven solutions,
which however is to be verified a-posteriori by using a suitable integrated
variant of the maximum-dissipation principle. Gradient theories both for damage
and for plasticity are considered to make the scheme numerically stable with
guaranteed convergence within the class of weak solutions. After finite-element
approximation, this scheme is computationally implemented and illustrative
2-dimensional simulations are performed.
