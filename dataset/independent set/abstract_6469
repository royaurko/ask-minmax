Processor cores are becoming less expensive and thus more accessible. To
utilize increasing number of available computing elements, good parallel
algorithms are necessary. In light of these changes in contemporary computing,
multipath Metropolis simulation of classical Heisenberg model is explored. In
contrast to the original single-path algorithm, multipath simulation approach
is inherently parallel because different random-walk paths are mutually
independent. This independence enables easy and efficient harnessing of
numerous cores' computing power in embarrassingly parallel algorithms. Aside
form being inherently parallel, multipath simulation approach results in
independent and normally distributed simulation output. Normal distribution
enables simple and straightforward statistical processing. Thus, multipath
simulation results can be easily computed with arbitrary and statistically
known precision.
