Analogy between an approximate version of Feigenbaum renormalization group
analysis in complex domain and the phase transition theory of Yang-Lee (based
on consideration of formally complexified thermodynamic values) is discussed.
It is shown that the Julia sets of the renormalization transformation
correspond to the approximation of Mandelbrot set of the original map. New
aspects of analogy between the theory of dynamical systems and the phase
transition theory are uncovered.
