A simple model of Dark Matter (DM) which couples with the two nucleons with
different coupling strengths without violating isospin conservation is explored
as an example of the importance of keeping the experimental data analysis as
model independent as possible. The apparent contrast between the recent CRESST
event excess and current XENON100 spin-independent (SI) exclusions is shown to
be removed by simply not assuming that the couplings of the DM with the two
nucleons are equal.
