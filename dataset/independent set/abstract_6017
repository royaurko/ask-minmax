Let $T$ be a random field invariant under the action of a compact group $G$.
In the line of previous work we investigate properties of the Fourier
coefficients as orthogonality and Gaussianity. In particular we give conditions
ensuring that independence of the random Fourier coefficients implies
Gaussianity. As a consequence, in general, it is not possible to simulate a
non-Gaussian invariant random field through its Fourier expansion using
independent coefficients.
