Most dusty winds are described by a set of similarity functions of a single
independent variable that can be chosen as the overall optical depth at visual.
The self-similarity implies general scaling relations among the system
parameters, in agreement with observations. Dust drift through the gas has a
major impact on the structure of most winds.
