In the paper, we focus on the connectedness of planar self-affine sets
$T(A,{\mathcal{D}})$ generated by an integer expanding matrix $A$ with $|\det
(A)|=3$ and a collinear digit set ${\mathcal{D}}=\{0,1,b\}v$, where $b>1$ and
$v\in {\mathbb{R}}^2$ such that $\{v, Av\}$ is linearly independent. We discuss
the domain of the digit $b$ to determine the connectedness of
$T(A,{\mathcal{D}})$. Especially, a complete characterization is obtained when
we restrict $b$ to be an integer. Some results on the general case of $|\det
(A)|> 3$ are obtained as well.
