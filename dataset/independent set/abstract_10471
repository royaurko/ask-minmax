We analyze recent measurements by Ooi et al. of the angular dependence of the
first order vortex phase transition in Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+y}. The experimental
findings of these contributors are interpreted in terms of a 2D versus 3D scaling
approach. Invoking a crossover from a 3D to a 2D scaling approach, it shown,
that the apparent failure of a 3D scaling approach away from the bulk
transition temperature is due to a crossover to decoupled independent
superconducting slabs.
