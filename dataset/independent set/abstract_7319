We consider sets and maps defined over an o-minimal structure over the reals,
such as real semi-algebraic or subanalytic sets. A {\em monotone map} is a
multi-dimensional generalization of a usual univariate monotone function, while
the closure of the graph of a monotone map is a generalization of a compact
convex set. In a particular case of an identically constant function, such a
graph is called a {\em semi-monotone set}. Graphs of monotone maps are,
generally, non-convex, and their intersections, unlike intersections of convex
sets, can be topologically complicated. In particular, such an intersection is
not necessarily the graph of a monotone map. Nevertheless, we prove a
Helly-type theorem, which says that for a finite family of subsets of
$\Real^n$, if all intersections of subfamilies, with cardinalities at most
$n+1$, are non-empty and graphs of monotone maps, then the intersection of the
whole family is non-empty and the graph of a monotone map.
