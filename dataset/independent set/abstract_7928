We present a method for $exact$ sampling of distributions of the form \[
\mathcal{L}((X_1, \ldots, X_n) | E),\] where random variables $X_i$,
$i=1,\ldots,n,$ can be sampled independently subject to membership in an event
$E$ with mild assumptions. Our method includes cases where the event $E$ has
probability 0.
