We present and analyze a gedanken experiment and show that the assumption
that an antenna operating at a single frequency can transmit more than two
independent information channels to the far field violates the Second Law of
Thermodynamics. Transmission of a large number of channels, each associated
with an angular momentum "twisted wave" mode, to the far field in free space is
therefore not possible.
