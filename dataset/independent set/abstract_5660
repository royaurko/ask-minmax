We use semi-analytical modelling techniques to investigate the progenitor
morphologies of present day ellipticals. We find that, independent of the
environment, the fraction of mergers of bulge dominated galaxies (early-types)
increases with time. The last major merger of bright present day ellipticals
with $M_{B} \lesssim -21$ is preferentially between bulge dominated galaxies,
while those with $ M_{B} \sim -20$ have mainly experienced last major mergers
between a bulge dominated and a disk dominated galaxy.
  Independent of specific model assumptions, more than 50% of present day
elliptical in clusters with $M_B \lesssim -18$ had last major mergers which are
not of spirals as usually expected within the standard merger scenario.
