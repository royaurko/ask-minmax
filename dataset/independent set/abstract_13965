We establish a Penrose-Like Inequality for general (not necessarily time
symmetric) initial data sets of the Einstein equations which satisfy the
dominant energy condition. More precisely, it is shown that the ADM energy is
bounded below by an expression which is proportional to the square root of the
area of the outermost future (or past) apparent horizon.
