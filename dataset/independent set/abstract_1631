A search for events with large missing transverse momentum, jets, and at
least two tau leptons has been performed using 2 fb^-1 of proton-proton
collision data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large
Hadron Collider. No excess above the Standard Model background expectation is
observed and a 95% CL visible cross section upper limit for new phenomena is
set. A 95% CL lower limit of 32 TeV is set on the GMSB breaking scale Lambda
independent of tan(beta). These limits provide the most stringent tests to date
in a large part of the considered parameter space.
