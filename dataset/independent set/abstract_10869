We consider the one-loop corrections to the SU(3) skyrmion mass within the
bound state soliton approach. We show that the standard SU(3) renormalization
scheme is not appropiate within this framework and propose to use an
alternative one based on SU(2). For physical meson masses and decay constants
the resulting Casimir correction turns out to be rather scale-independent and
leads to an acceptable estimate of the nucleon mass.
