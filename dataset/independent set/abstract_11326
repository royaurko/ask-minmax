Let $\tau_{D}(Z) $ is the first exit time of iterated Brownian motion from a
domain $D \subset \RR{R}^{n}$ started at $z\in D$ and let $P_{z}[\tau_{D}(Z)
>t]$ be its distribution. In this paper we establish the exact asymptotics of
$P_{z}[\tau_{D}(Z) >t]$ over bounded domains as an extension of the result in
DeBlassie \cite{deblassie}, for $z\in D$ $$ P_{z}[\tau_{D}(Z)>t]\approx t^{1/2}
\exp(-{3/2}\pi^{2/3}\lambda_{D}^{2/3}t^{1/3}), as t\to\infty . $$ We also study
asymptotics of the life time of Brownian-time Brownian motion (BTBM),
$Z^{1}_{t}=z+X(Y(t))$, where $X_{t}$ and $Y_{t}$ are independent
one-dimensional Brownian motions.
