Given a set of Kohn-Sham orbitals from an insulating system, we present a
simple, robust, efficient and highly parallelizable method to construct a set
of, optionally orthogonal, localized basis functions for the associated
subspace. Our method explicitly uses the fact that density matrices associated
with insulating systems decay exponentially along the off-diagonal direction in
the real space representation. Our method avoids the usage of an optimization
procedure, and the localized basis functions are constructed directly from a
set of selected columns of the density matrix (SCDM). Consequently, the only
adjustable parameter in our method is the truncation threshold of the localized
basis functions. Our method can be used in any electronic structure software
package with an arbitrary basis set. We demonstrate the numerical accuracy and
parallel scalability of the SCDM procedure using orbitals generated by the
Quantum ESPRESSO software package. We also demonstrate a procedure for
combining SCDM with Hockney's algorithm to efficiently perform Hartree-Fock
exchange energy calculations with near linear scaling.
