We show that the extra Z boson predicted within the so-called "3-3-1" model
has a leptophobic character, and analyse its effects on Z decay widths and on
the t\bar t production cross section in p\bar p collisions at the Fermilab
Tevatron. Recent model-independent analysis are applied in order to estimate
the contribution of this Z' to the observables that will be measured at LEP2.
