We consider sets of locally finite perimeter in Carnot groups. We show that
if E is a set of locally finite perimeter in a Carnot group G, then for almost
every x in G with respect to the perimeter measure of E, some tangent of E at x
is a vertical halfspace. This is a partial extension of a theorem of
Franchi-Serapioni-Serra Cassano in step 2 Carnot groups: they have shown that,
for almost every x, E has a unique tangent at x, and this tangent is a vertical
halfspace.
