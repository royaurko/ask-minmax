In the framework of three light Majorana neutrinos, we show how to
reconstruct, through the use of 3 x 3 unitarity, the full PMNS matrix from six
independent Majorana-type phases. In particular, we express the strength of
Dirac-type CP violation in terms of these Majorana-type phases by writing the
area of the unitarity triangles in terms of these phases. We also study how
these six Majorana phases appear in CP-odd weak basis invariants as well as in
leptonic asymmetries relevant for flavoured leptogenesis.
