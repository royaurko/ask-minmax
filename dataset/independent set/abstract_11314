Forman's Discrete Morse theory is studied from an algebraic viewpoint.
Analogous to independent work of Emil Skoeldberg we show that this theory can
be extended to chain complexes of free modules over a ring. We provide three
applications of this theory: We construct new resolutions of the residue class
field $k$ over $A$, where $A$ is the quotient of a (i) commutative polynomial
ring or (ii) non-commutaitve polynomial ring by a (twosided) ideal and (iii) we
construct a new resolution of $A$ as an $A \otimes A^{op}$-module in the
situation (ii). In either case we prove minimality of the resolution for
certain classes of algebras $A$.
