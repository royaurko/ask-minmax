We investigate the topological and metric structure of the set of idempotent
operators and projections which have prescribed diagonal entries with respect
to a fixed orthonormal basis of a Hilbert space. As an application, we settle
some cases of conjectures of Larson, Dykema, and Strawn on the connectedness of
the set of unit-norm tight frames.
