Suppose a process yields independent observations whose distributions belong
to a family parameterized by \theta\in\Theta. When the process is in control,
the observations are i.i.d. with a known parameter value \theta_0. When the
process is out of control, the parameter changes. We apply an idea of Robbins
and Siegmund [Proc. Sixth Berkeley Symp. Math. Statist. Probab. 4 (1972) 37-41]
to construct a class of sequential tests and detection schemes whereby the
unknown post-change parameters are estimated. This approach is especially
useful in situations where the parametric space is intricate and mixture-type
rules are operationally or conceptually difficult to formulate. We exemplify
our approach by applying it to the problem of detecting a change in the shape
parameter of a Gamma distribution, in both a univariate and a multivariate
setting.
