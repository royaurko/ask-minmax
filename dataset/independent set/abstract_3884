A remarkable connection between BCFW recursion relations and constraints on
the S-matrix was made by Benincasa and Cachazo in 0705.4305, who noted that
mutual consistency of different BCFW constructions of four-particle amplitudes
generates non-trivial (but familiar) constraints on three-particle coupling
constants --- these include gauge invariance, the equivalence principle, and
the lack of non-trivial couplings for spins >2. These constraints can also be
derived with weaker assumptions, by demanding the existence of four-point
amplitudes that factorize properly in all unitarity limits with complex
momenta. From this starting point, we show that the BCFW prescription can be
interpreted as an algorithm for fully constructing a tree-level S-matrix, and
that complex factorization of general BCFW amplitudes follows from the
factorization of four-particle amplitudes. The allowed set of BCFW deformations
is identified, formulated entirely as a statement on the three-particle sector,
and using only complex factorization as a guide. Consequently, our analysis
based on the physical consistency of the S-matrix is entirely independent of
field theory. We analyze the case of pure Yang-Mills, and outline a proof for
gravity. For Yang-Mills, we also show that the well-known scaling behavior of
BCFW-deformed amplitudes at large z is a simple consequence of factorization.
For gravity, factorization in certain channels requires asymptotic behavior
~1/z^2.
