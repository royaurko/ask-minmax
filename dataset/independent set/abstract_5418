We generalize a theorem by Francois Fages that describes the relationship
between the completion semantics and the answer set semantics for logic
programs with negation as failure. The study of this relationship is important
in connection with the emergence of answer set programming. Whenever the two
semantics are equivalent, answer sets can be computed by a satisfiability
solver, and the use of answer set solvers such as smodels and dlv is
unnecessary. A logic programming representation of the blocks world due to
Ilkka Niemelae is discussed as an example.
