High precision measurements at the linear collider will allow a model-
independent reconstruction of nature at high energy scales. The method of
bottom-up extrapolation from the electroweak scale to the GUT scale is
explained and both a universal minimal supergravity and a gaugino-mediated
model are presented as examples. Comparisons are made with the LHC-only case.
