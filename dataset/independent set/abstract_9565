The modular hadron calorimeter with micro-pixel avalanche photodiodes readout
for the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS is presented. The calorimeter
consists of 44 independent modules with lead-scintillator sandwich structure.
The light from the scintillator tiles is captured by and transported with
WLS-fibers embedded in scintillator grooves. The construction provides a
longitudinal segmentation of the module in 10 sections with independent MAPD
readout. MAPDs with pixel density of $~10^{4}$/mm$^2$ ensure good linearity of
calorimeter response in a wide dynamical range. The performance of the
calorimeter prototype in a beam test is reported.
