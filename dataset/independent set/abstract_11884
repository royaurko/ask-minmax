In this article, we consider the basic contact process in a static random
environment on the half space $Z^d\times Z^+$ where the recovery rates are
constants and the infection rates are independent and identically distributed
random variables. We show that, for almost every environment, the complete
convergence theorem holds. This is a generalization of the known result for the
classical contact process in the half space case.
