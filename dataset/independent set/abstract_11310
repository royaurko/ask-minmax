Concentration inequalities are obtained on Poisson space, for random
functionals with finite or infinite variance. In particular, dimension free
tail estimates and exponential integrability results are given for the
Euclidean norm of vectors of independent functionals.
 In the finite variance case these results are applied to infinitely divisible
random variables such as quadratic Wiener functionals, including L\'evy's
stochastic area and the square norm of Brownian paths.
 In the infinite variance case, various tail estimates such as stable ones are
also presented.
