The Causal Set hypothesis asserts that spacetime, ultimately, is discrete and
its underlying structure is that of a locally finite partial ordered set, and
macroscopic causality reflects a deeper notion of order in terms of which all
the geometrical structure of spacetime must find their ultimate expression.
After reviewing the main aspects of Causal Sets Kinematics, and the recently
developed Stochastic Dynamics. We concentrate on possible implications in the
fields of cosmology and black holes. In the context of black hole, we propose a
possible interpretation of the entropy as the number of links crossing the
horizon.
