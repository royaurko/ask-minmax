We study the Casimir-Lifshitz force and the radiative heat transfer in a
system consisting of three bodies held at three independent temperatures and
immersed in a thermal environment, the whole system being in a stationary
configuration out of thermal equilibrium. The theory we develop is valid for
arbitrary bodies, i.e. for any set of temperatures, dielectric and geometrical
properties, and describes each body by means of its scattering operators. For
the three-body system we provide a closed-form unified expression of the
radiative heat transfer and of the Casimir-Lifshitz force (both in and out of
thermal equilibrium). This expression is thus first applied to the case of
three planar parallel slabs. In this context we discuss the non-additivity of
the force at thermal equilibrium, as well as the equilibrium temperature of the
intermediate slab as a function of its position between two external slabs
having different temperatures. Finally, we consider the force acting on an atom
inside a planar cavity. We show that, differently from the equilibrium
configuration, the absence of thermal equilibrium admits one or more positions
of minima for the atomic potential. While the corresponding atomic potential
depths are very small for typical ground state atoms, they may become
particularly relevant for Rydberg atoms, becoming a promising tool to produce
an atomic trap.
