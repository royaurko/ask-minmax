We address a challenge concerning the spectral-domain-based (i.e., plane wave
eigenfunction expansion) analysis of electromagnetic fields produced by
time-harmonic current sources within planar-layered media, which arises
specifically when sources are embedded inside non-birefringent anisotropic
medium (NBAM) layers. In NBAM, the highly symmetric permeability and
permittivity tensors can induce directionally-dependent, but polarization
independent, propagation properties supporting "degenerate" characteristic
polarizations. That is to say, the considered NBAM support four linearly
independent field polarization eigenvectors associated with only two (rather
than four) unique, non-defective eigenvalues. We explain problems that can
arise when the source(s) specifically reside within NBAM planar layers when
using canonical field expressions as well as obtain alternative expressions,
immune to such problems, that form the foundation for a robust eigenfunction
expansion-based analysis of electromagnetic radiation and scattering within
planar-layered media.
