Recent studies of hadronic -meson decays are reported. Some experimental
searches of CP-symmetry violation using model independent methods are
presented. An importance of unitarity constraints in construction of
phenomenological models of the D-meson decays is underlined. The theoretical
model of the D0 --> K0S pi+ pi- decays, including some two-body unitarity
constraints, is described. Then a comparison of the model results with the
Belle collaboration data is made. The results on the CP-violation in the D0 -->
K0S pi+ pi- decays are given and the necessity to consider the CP-violation in
the subsequent K0S decays is emphasized.
