Let $X$ be a product of locally compact rank one Hadamard spaces and $\Gamma$
a discrete group of isometries which contains two elements projecting to a pair
of independent rank one isometries in each factor. In [arXiv:1308.5584] we gave
a precise description of the structure of the geometric limit set of $\Gamma$;
our aim in this paper is to describe this set from a measure theoretical point
of view, using as a basic tool the properties of the exponent of growth of
$\Gamma$ established in the aforementioned article. We first show that the
conformal density obtained from the classical Patterson-Sullivan construction
is supported in a unique $\Gamma$-invariant subset of the geometric limit set;
generalizing this classical construction we then obtain measures supported in
each $\Gamma$-invariant subset of the regular limit set and investigate their
properties.
  We remark that apart from Kac-Moody groups over finite fields acting on the
Davis complex of their associated twin building, the probably most interesting
examples to which our results apply are isometry groups of reducible
CAT(0)-cube complexes without Euclidean factors.
