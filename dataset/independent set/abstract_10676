The main result of this paper is a proof that there are examples of spatially
compact solutions of the Einstein-dust equations which only exist for an
arbitrarily small amount of CMC time. While this fact is plausible, it is not
trivial to prove. It is necessary to obtain a lower bound for the lapse
function of a CMC foliation in a suitable class of inhomogeneous spacetimes.
This bound, which shows that in these spacetimes the lapse cannot collapse in
finite CMC time, may be of independent interest. This fact is contrasted with
the positive results previously obtained for other matter models, e.g.
collisionless matter or wave maps.
