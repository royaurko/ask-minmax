Consider the random set system of {1,2,...,n}, where each subset in the power
set is chosen independently with probability p. A set H is said to be a hitting
set if it intersects each chosen set. The second moment method is used to
exhibit the sharp concentration of the minimal size of H for a variety of
values of p.
