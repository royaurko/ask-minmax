We have reexamine the effect of entropy production on the cosmic axion
density and find that the Peccei-Quinn scale $F_a$ larger than about
$10^{15}$~GeV is not allowed even if large entropy is produced by the decays of
coherent oscillations or non-relativistic massive particles. We stress that
this result is independent of the details of models for the decaying particles.
