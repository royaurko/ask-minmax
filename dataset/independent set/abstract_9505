In this study, a new method is presented to classify flares derived from the
photoelectric photometry of UV Ceti type stars. This method is based on
statistical analyses using an independent samples t-test. The data used in
analyses were obtained from four flare stars observed between 2004 and 2007.
The total number of flares obtained in the observations of AD Leo, EV Lac, EQ
Peg, and V1054 Oph is 321 in the standard Johnson U band. As a result flares
can be separated into two types, slow and fast, depending on the ratio of flare
decay time to flare rise time. The ratio is below 3.5 for all slow flares,
while it is above 3.5 for all fast flares. Also, according to the independent
samples t-test, there is a difference of about 157 s between equivalent
durations of slow and fast flares. In addition, there are significant
differences between amplitudes and rise times of slow and fast flares.
