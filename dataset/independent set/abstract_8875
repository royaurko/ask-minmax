For an abelian variety $A$ over a number field $K$, we define the set of
Tamagawa torsors of $A$ at a prime $v$ of $K$ to be the set of principal
homogeneous spaces of $A$ over the completion $K_v$ of $K$ at $v$ that are
split by an unramified extension of $K_v$. In this paper, we study the
arithmetic properties of the Tamagawa torsors.
