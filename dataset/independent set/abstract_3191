In genetic studies, not only can the number of predictors obtained from
microarray measurements be extremely large, there can also be multiple response
variables. Motivated by such a situation, we consider semiparametric dimension
reduction methods in sparse multivariate regression models. Previous studies on
joint variable and rank selection have focused on parametric models while here
we consider the more challenging varying-coefficient models which make the
investigation on nonlinear interactions of variables possible. Spline
approximation, rank constraints and concave group penalties are utilized for
model estimation. Asymptotic oracle properties of the estimators are presented.
We also propose reduced-rank independent screening to deal with the situation
when the dimension is so high that penalized estimation cannot be efficiently
applied. In simulations, we show the advantages of simultaneously performing
variable and rank selection. A real data set is analyzed to illustrate the good
prediction performance when incorporating interactions between genetic
variables and an index variable.
