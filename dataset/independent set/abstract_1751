The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem is a cornerstone of electronic density functional
theory, yet completing its proof in the traditional way requires the {\em
assumption} that ground state wavefunctions never vanish on sets of nonzero
Lebesgue measure. This is an unsatisfactory situation, since DFT is supposed to
obviate knowledge of many-body wavefunctions. We approach the issue from a more
density-centric direction, allowing mild hypotheses on the density which can be
regarded as checkable in a DFT context. By ordinary Hilbert space analysis, the
following is proved: If the density $\rho$ is continuous and everywhere
nonzero, then there can be at most one potential (modulo constants) expressible
as a sum of a square-integrable and a bounded function (i.e., Kato-Rellich)
with $\rho$ as a ground state density. In case $\rho$ is not nonzero
everywhere, the theorem allows an independent constant on each connected
component of the set where the density is positive, a weakening which can be
reversed by requiring locally weak-$L^3$ potentials and calling on a unique
continuation result of Schechter and Simon.
