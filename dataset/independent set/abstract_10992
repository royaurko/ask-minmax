We present the generic formulas to calculate the ratios of neutrino masses
and the Majorana phases of CP violation from the neutrino mass matrix with two
independent vanishing entries in the flavor basis where the charged lepton mass
matrix is diagonal. An order-of-magnitude illustration is given for seven
experimentally acceptable textures of the neutrino mass matrix, and some
analytical approximations are made for their phenomenological consequences at
low energy scales.
