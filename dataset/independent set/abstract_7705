Low-energy nuclear weak-interaction processes play important roles in many
astrophysical contexts, and effective field theory is believed to be a highly
useful framework for describing these processes in a model-independent manner.
I present a brief account of the basic features of the nuclear effective theory
approach, and some examples of actual calculations carried out in this method.
