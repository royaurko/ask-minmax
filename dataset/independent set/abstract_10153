In this paper we reconsider, for N=8 supergravity, the problem of gauging the
most general electric subgroup.
  We show that admissible theories are fully characterized by a single
algebraic equation to be satisfied by the embedding of the gauge group G within
the electric subalgebra SL(8,\IR) of E_{7(7)}. The complete set of solutions to
this equation contains 36 parameters. Modding by the action of SL(8,\IR)
conjugations that yield equivalent theories all continuous parameters are
eliminated except for an overall coupling constant and we obtain a discrete set
of orbits. This set is in one--to--one correspondence with 36 Lie subalgebras
of SL(8,\IR), corresponding to all possible real forms of the SO(8) Lie algebra
plus a set of contractions thereof. By means of our analysis we establish the
theorem that the N=8 gaugings constructed by Hull in the middle eighties
constitute the exhaustive set of models. As a corollary we show that there
exists a unique 7--dimensional abelian gauging. The corresponding abelian
algebra is not contained in the maximal abelian ideal of the solvable Lie
algebra generating the scalar manifold E_{7(7)}/SU(8).
