In this paper we present a very simple and independent argument for the
absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost in the recently proposed potentially
ghost-free non-linear massive gravity. The limitation is that, in its simple
form, the argument is, in a sense, non-constructive and less explicit than the
standard approach. However, the formalism developed here may prove to be useful
for discussing the formal aspects of the theory.
