We study the Bjorken `x' (or equivalently Nachtmann `xi') dependence of the
virtual photon spin asymmetry in polarized deep inelastic scattering of
electrons from hadrons. We use an exactly solved relativistic potential model
of the hadron, treating the constituents as independent massless Dirac
particles confined to an infinitely massive force center. The importance of
including the p-wave components of the Dirac wave function is demonstrated.
Comparisons are made to the observed data on the proton by taking into account
the observed flavor dependence of the valence quark distribution functions.
