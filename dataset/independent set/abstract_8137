We propose a generalization of logarithmic and Schwarzenberger bundles over
$\P^n=\P^n(\C)$ when the rank is greater than $n$. The first ones are
associated to finite sets of points on $\P^{n\vee}$ and the second ones to
curves with degree greater than $n$ on $\P^{n\vee}$. On the projective plane we
show that two logarithmic bundles are isomorphic if and only if they are
associated to the same set of points or if the two sets of points belong to a
curve of degree equal to the rank of the considered bundles.
