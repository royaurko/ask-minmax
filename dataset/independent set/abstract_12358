In this note we have tried to determine how the existence of a local entropy
current with non-negative divergence constrains the second order transport
coefficients of an uncharged fluid, following the procedure described in
\cite{Romatschke:2009kr}. Just on symmetry ground the stress tensor of an
uncharged fluid can have 15 transport coefficients at second order in
derivative expansion. The condition of entropy-increase gives five relations
among these 15 coefficients. So finally the relativistic stress tensor of an
uncharged fluid can have 10 independent transport coefficients at second order.
