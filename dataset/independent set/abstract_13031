The connection between the concepts underlying Interaction-Free Evolutions
(IFE) and Decoherence-Free Subspaces (DFS) is explored, bringing to light
similarities and differences. It is shown that IFE states and DFS can exist
independently, in spite of the fact that both classes of states are connected
with the idea of an interaction which is not felt. Inspired by a generalization
of DFS already known, we introduce the notion of generalized IFE and provide
some very simple examples that allow to better understand the relevant idea.
