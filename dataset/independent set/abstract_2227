We present a set of mock redshift catalogs, constructed from N-body
simulations, designed to mimic the DEEP2 survey. Galaxies with a range of
luminosities are placed within virialized halos in the simulation using a
variant of the halo model. The halo model parameters are chosen to reproduce
local clustering and abundance data and assumed to be independent of redshift.
This allows us to predict the luminosity function, two-point correlation
function, luminosity- and scale-dependent bias, redshift space distortions etc.
of our galaxies at higher redshifts. We show that the low order clustering
properties are consistent with preliminary DEEP2 data. The catalogs can be used
to evaluate the selection effects of the survey and to test new algorithms and
statistics that are to be used in the analysis of DEEP2 data.
