The thermal properties of amorphous and crystalline phases in chalcogenide
phase change materials (PCM) play a key role in device performance for
non-volatile random-access memory. Here, we report the nanothermal morphology
of amorphous and crystalline phases in laser pulsed GeTe and Ge2Sb2Te5 thin
films by scanning thermal microscopy (SThM). By performing SThM measurements
and applying quantitative physical models to two film thicknesses, the PCM
thermal conductivities and thermal boundary conductances between the PCM and
SThM probe are independently estimated for the amorphous and crystalline phase
of each stoichiometry.
