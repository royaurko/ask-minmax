We extend our recent work on set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter or
braid relations with new results about their automorphism groups, strong
twisted unions of solutions and multipermutation solutions. We introduce and
study graphs of solutions and use our graphical methods for the computation of
solutions of finite order and their automorphisms. Results include a detailed
study of solutions of multipermutation level 2.
