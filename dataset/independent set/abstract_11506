We consider the algebra associated to a group of transformations which are
symmetries of a regular mechanical system (i.e. system free of constraints).
For time dependent coordinate transformations we show that a central extension
may appear at the classical level which is coordinate and momentum independent.
A cochain formalism naturally arises in the argument and extends the usual
configuration space cochain concepts to phase space.
