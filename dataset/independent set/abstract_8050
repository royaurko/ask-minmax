A sufficient condition for a cluster point of a planar harmonic function to
be an asymptotic value is given, based on a partitioning into regions of
constant valence. A sufficient condition for the cluster set of a planar
harmonic function to have non-empty interior is given. An example is given of a
planar harmonic function where the image of the critical set is not closed and
such that the cluster set has non-empty interior and is a proper subset of the
image.
