In 1984 Edward Witten proposed that an extremely dense form of matter
composed of up, down, and strange quarks may be stable at zero pressure
(Witten, 1984). Massive nuggets of such dense matter, if they exist, may pass
through the Earth and be detectable by the seismic signals they generate (de
Rujula and Glashow, 1984). With this motivation we investigated over 1 million
seismic data reports to the U.S. Geological Survey for the years 1990-1993 not
associated with epicentral sources. We report two results: (1) with an average
of about 0.16 unassociated reports per minute after data cuts, we found a
significant excess over statistical expectation for sets with ten or more
reports in ten minutes; and (2) in spite of a very small a priori probability
from random reports, we found one set of reports with arrival times and other
features appropriate to signals from an epilinear source. This event has the
properties predicted for the passage of a nugget of strange quark matter (SQM)
through the earth, although there is no direct confirmation from other
phenomenologies.
