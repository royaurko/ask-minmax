The most general Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) allows both for the explicit
and the spontaneous CP violation in the scalar sector. Here we discuss CP
violation in terms of basis-independent quantities and show how using two
different sets of known CP-odd weak-basis invariants one can distinguish
between CP conservation, explicit CP violation and spontaneous CP violation.
The special case of CP violation without CP mixing, in which the neutral Higgs
gauge boson interaction respects CP while Higgs self-interaction violates CP
symmetry, is also presented.
