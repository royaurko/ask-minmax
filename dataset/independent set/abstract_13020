Understanding the physical origin of creep in calcium--silicate--hydrate
(C--S--H) is of primary importance, both for fundamental and practical
interest. Here, we present a new method, based on molecular dynamics
simulation, allowing us to simulate the long-term visco-elastic deformations of
C--S--H. Under a given shear stress, C--S--H features a gradually increasing
shear strain, which follows a logarithmic law. The computed creep modulus is
found to be independent of the shear stress applied and is in excellent
agreement with nanoindentation measurements, as extrapolated to zero porosity.
