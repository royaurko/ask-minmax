The conservative dephasing effects of gravitational self forces for extreme
mass-ratio inspirals are studied. Both secular and non-secular conservative
effects may have a significant effect on LISA waveforms that is independent of
the mass ratio of the system. Such effects need to be included in generated
waveforms to allow for accurate gravitational wave astronomy that requires
integration times as long as a year.
