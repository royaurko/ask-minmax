Given a quadratic map Q : K^n -> K^k defined over a computable subring D of a
real closed field K, and a polynomial p(Y_1,...,Y_k) of degree d, we consider
the zero set Z=Z(p(Q(X)),K^n) of the polynomial p(Q(X_1,...,X_n)). We present a
procedure that computes, in (dn)^O(k) arithmetic operations in D, a set S of
(real univariate representations of) sampling points in K^n that intersects
nontrivially each connected component of Z. As soon as k=o(n), this is faster
than the standard methods that all have exponential dependence on n in the
complexity. In particular, our procedure is polynomial-time for constant k. In
contrast, the best previously known procedure (due to A.Barvinok) is only
capable of deciding in n^O(k^2) operations the nonemptiness (rather than
constructing sampling points) of the set Z in the case of p(Y)=sum_i Y_i^2 and
homogeneous Q.
  A by-product of our procedure is a bound (dn)^O(k) on the number of connected
components of Z.
  The procedure consists of exact symbolic computations in D and outputs
vectors of algebraic numbers. It involves extending K by infinitesimals and
subsequent limit computation by a novel procedure that utilizes knowledge of an
explicit isomorphism between real algebraic sets.
