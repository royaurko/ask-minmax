We develop a new tractable model for K-tier heterogeneous cellular networks
(HetNets), where each base station (BS) is powered solely by a self-contained
energy harvesting module. The BSs across tiers differ in terms of the energy
harvesting rate, energy storage capacity, transmit power and deployment
density. Since a BS may not always have enough energy, it may need to be kept
OFF and allowed to recharge while nearby users are served by neighboring BSs
that are ON. We show that the fraction of time a k^{th} tier BS can be kept ON,
termed availability \rho_k, is a fundamental metric of interest. Using tools
from random walk theory, fixed point analysis and stochastic geometry, we
characterize the set of K-tuples (\rho_1, \rho_2, ... \rho_K), termed the
availability region, that is achievable by general uncoordinated operational
strategies, where the decision to toggle the current ON/OFF state of a BS is
taken independently of the other BSs. If the availability vector corresponding
to the optimal system performance, e.g., in terms of rate, lies in this
availability region, there is no performance loss due to the presence of
unreliable energy sources. As a part of our analysis, we model the temporal
dynamics of the energy level at each BS as a birth-death process, derive the
energy utilization rate, and use hitting/stopping time analysis to prove that
there exists a fundamental limit on \rho_k that cannot be surpassed by any
uncoordinated strategy.
