We propose a new approach to the transfer operator based analysis of the
conformation dynamics of molecules. It is based on a statistical independence
ansatz for the eigenfunctions of the operator related to a partitioning into
subsystems. Numerical tests performed on small systems show excellent
qualitative agreement between mean field and exact model, at greatly reduced
computational cost.
