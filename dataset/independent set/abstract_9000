Lorentz time is replaced by three parameters: a global time, a local rate of
aging, and a new spatial coordinate. This enables successful reconstruction of
relativity's observables in a four dimensional Euclidean hyperspace. The new
formulation predicts that the age of the universe, as inferred from the Hubble
Constant, is less than the observed evolutionary age of astronomical
configurations, as has been repeatedly measured. It also predicts a new
phenomenon that provides closure of the universe without introduction of
unobserved dark matter and independent of gravity. Further, it predicts
observation of an accelerating expansion rate of the universe. It also explains
our ability to perceive only three of the four spatial coordinates and predicts
parallel, mutually unobserved universes that evolve independently while being
correlated as past, present, and future.
