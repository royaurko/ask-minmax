In addition to revealing spherical harmonic degrees, $\ell$, of excited
modes, pulsational amplitudes and phases from multicolour photometry and radial
velocity data yield a valuable constraints on stellar atmospheric parameters
and on subphotospheric convection. Multiperiodic pulsators are of particular
interest because each mode yields independent constraints. We present an
analysis of data on twelve modes observed in FG Vir star.
