We demonstrate that the recent measurements of the angular diameter distance
of 38 cluster of galaxies using Chandra X-ray data and radio observations from
the OVRO and BIMA interferometric arrays place new and independent constraints
on deviations in the duality relation between angular and luminosity distances.
Using only cluster data, we found that the ratio between the two distances
defined as $\eta = D_L/D_A(1+z)^2.$ is bound to be $\eta=0.97\pm0.03$ at 68%
c.l. with no evidence for distance duality violation. Comparing the cluster
angular diameter distance data with luminosity distance data from type Ia
Supernovae, we obtain the model independent constraint $\eta=1.01\pm0.07$ at
68% c.l.. Those results provide an useful check for the cosmological
concordance model and for the presence of systematics in SN-Ia and clusters
data.
