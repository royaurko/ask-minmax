Recently, Sogge-Zelditch and Colding-Minicozzi gave new power law lower
bounds on the size of the nodal sets of eigenfunctions. The purpose of this
short note is to point out a third method to obtain a power law lower bound on
the volume of the nodal sets. Our method is based on the Donnelly-Fefferman
growth bound for eigenfunctions and a growth vs. volume relation we proved in a
previous work.
