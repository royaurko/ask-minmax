We investigate envelopes of positive metrics with a prescribed singularity
type. First we generalise work of Berman to this setting, proving C^{1,1}
regularity of such envelopes, showing their Monge-Ampere measure is supported
on a certain ``equilibrium set'' and connecting with the asymptotics of the
partial Bergman functions coming from multiplier ideals. We investigate how
these envelopes behave on certain products, and how they relate to the Legendre
transform of a test curve of singularity types in the context of geodesic rays
in the space of K\"ahler potentials. Finally we consider the associated
exhaustion function of these equilibrium sets, connecting it both to the
Legendre transform and to the geometry of the Okounkov body.
