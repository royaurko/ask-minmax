We study the moderate-deviations (MD) setting for lossy source coding of
stationary memoryless sources. More specifically, we derive fundamental
compression limits of source codes whose rates are $R(D) \pm \epsilon_n$, where
$R(D)$ is the rate-distortion function and $\epsilon_n$ is a sequence that
dominates $\sqrt{1/n}$. This MD setting is complementary to the
large-deviations and central limit settings and was studied by Altug and Wagner
for the channel coding setting. We show, for finite alphabet and Gaussian
sources, that as in the central limit-type results, the so-called dispersion
for lossy source coding plays a fundamental role in the MD setting for the
lossy source coding problem.
