We answer in the negative a question by Gruenbaum who asked if there exists a
finite basis of affine invariant points. We give a positive answer to another
question by Gruenbaum about the "size" of the set of all affine invariant
points. Related, we show that the set of all convex bodies K, for which the set
of affine invariant points is all of n-dimensional Euclidean space, is dense in
the set of convex bodies. Crucial to establish these results, are new affine
invariant points, not previously considered in the literature.
