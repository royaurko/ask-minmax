Super-Kamiokande (SK) can search for weakly interacting massive particles
(WIMPs) by detecting neutrinos produced from WIMP annihilations occurring
inside the Sun. In this analysis, we include neutrino events with interaction
vertices in the detector in addition to upward-going muons produced in the
surrounding rock. Compared to the previous result, which used the upward-going
muons only, the signal acceptances for light (few-GeV/$c^2$ $\sim$
200-GeV/$c^2$) WIMPs are significantly increased. We fit 3903 days of SK data
to search for the contribution of neutrinos from WIMP annihilation in the Sun.
We found no significant excess over expected atmospheric-neutrino background
and the result is interpreted in terms of upper limits on WIMP-nucleon elastic
scattering cross sections under different assumptions about the annihilation
channel. We set the current best limits on the spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-proton
cross section for WIMP masses below 200 GeV/$c^2$ (at 10 GeV/$c^2$, 1.49$\times
10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ for $\chi\chi\rightarrow b \bar{b}$ and 1.31$\times 10^{-40}$
cm$^2$ for $\chi\chi\rightarrow\tau^+\tau^-$ annihilation channels), also
ruling out some fraction of WIMP candidates with spin-independent (SI) coupling
in the few-GeV/$c^2$ mass range.
