The motion involved in barrier crossing for protein folding are investigated
in terms of the chain dynamics of the polymer backbone, completing the
microscopic description of protein folding presented in the previous paper.
Local reaction coordinates are identified as collective growth modes of the
unstable fluctuations about the saddle-points in the free energy surface. The
description of the chain dynamics incorporates internal friction (independent
of the solvent viscosity) arising from the elementary isomerizations of the
backbone dihedral angles. We find that the folding rate depends linearly on the
solvent friction for high viscosity, but saturates at low viscosity because of
internal friction. For $\lambda$-repressor, the calculated folding rate
prefactor, along with the free energy barrier from the variational theory,
gives a folding rate that agrees well with the experimentally determined rate
under highly stabilizing conditions, but the theory predicts too large a
folding rate at the transition midpoint. This discrepancy obtained using a
fairly complete quantitative theory inspires a new set of questions about chain
dynamics, specifically detailed motions in individual contact formation.
