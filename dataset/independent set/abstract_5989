We present nuclear spin-independent and dependent parity non-conservation
amplitudes for the $[4f^{14}]6s\;^2S_{1/2}-[4f^{14}]5d\;^2D_{3/2}$ transition
of $^{171}$Yb$^+$, calculated using perturbed relativistic coupled-cluster
theory. As a proxy to estimate theoretical uncertainty of these results we
calculate the excitation energies, hyperfine structure constants and E1
transition amplitudes for the important low lying states. The PNC results
presented in paper shall be useful in the propose PNC experiments.
