We use the martingale convergence method to get the weak convergence theorem
on general functionals of partial sums of independent heavy-tailed random
variables. The limiting process is the stochastic integral driven by
$\alpha-$stable L\'evy process. Our method is very powerful to obtain the limit
behavior of heavy-tailed random variables.
