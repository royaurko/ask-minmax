We define a class of algebras describing links of binary isolating formulas
on a set of realizations for a family of 1-types of a complete theory. We prove
that a set of labels for binary isolating formulas on a set of realizations for
a 1-type p forms a groupoid of a special form if there is an atomic model over
a realization of p. We describe the class of these groupoids and consider
features of these groupoids in a general case and for special theories. A
description of the class of partial groupoids relative to families of 1-types
is given.
