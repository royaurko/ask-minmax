Quantum geometry gives a regularization scheme-independent effective action,
whoes equation of motion for the conformal mode has a stable de Sitter solution
at the high-energy region where the coupling of the self-interactions of the
traceless mode can be neglected because of the asymptotic freedom. However, the
dynamics of the traceless mode suggests that inflation ends at the low-energy
region.
