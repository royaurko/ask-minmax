We study behavioral metrics in an abstract coalgebraic setting. Given a
coalgebra alpha: X -> FX in Set, where the functor F specifies the branching
type, we define a framework for deriving pseudometrics on X which measure the
behavioral distance of states.
  A first crucial step is the lifting of the functor F on Set to a functor in
the category PMet of pseudometric spaces. We present two different approaches
which can be viewed as generalizations of the Kantorovich and Wasserstein
pseudometrics for probability measures. We show that the pseudometrics provided
by the two approaches coincide on several natural examples, but in general they
differ.
  Then a final coalgebra for F in Set can be endowed with a behavioral distance
resulting as the smallest solution of a fixed-point equation, yielding the
final coalgebra in PMet. The same technique, applied to an arbitrary coalgebra
alpha: X -> FX in Set, provides the behavioral distance on X. Under some
constraints we can prove that two states are at distance 0 if and only if they
are behaviorally equivalent.
