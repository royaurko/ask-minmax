We present radio and optical analysis of a sample of Low Luminosity Compact
(LLC) objects, selected from FIRST survey and observed with MERLIN at L-band
and C-band. The main criterion used for selection was luminosity of the objects
and approximately one third of the CSS sources from the new sample have a value
of radio luminosity comparable to FR\,Is.The analysis of a radio properties of
LLC sources show they occupy the space in radio power versus linear size
diagram below the main evolutionary path of radio objects. We suggest that many
of them might be short-lived objects, and their radio emission may be disrupted
several times before becoming FR\,IIs. The optical analysis of the LLC sources
were made based on the available SDSS images and spectra. We have classified
the sources as high and low excitation galaxies (HEG and LEG, respectively).
The optical and radio properties of the LLC sample are in general consistent
with brighter CSSs and large-scale radio sources. However, when LLC are added
to the other samples, HEG and LEG seem to follow independent, parallel
evolutionary tracks. LLC and luminous CSS behave like FR\,II sources, while
FR\,I seem to belong to a different group of objects, concerning ionization
mechanisms. Based on our results, we propose the independent, parallel
evolutionary tracks for HEG and LEG sources, evolving from GPS - CSS - FR.
