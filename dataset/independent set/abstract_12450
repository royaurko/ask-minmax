Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) at low redshift provide a precise and
largely model-independent way to measure the Hubble constant, H0. The 6dF
Galaxy Survey measurement of the BAO scale gives a value of H0 = 67 +/- 3.2
km/s/Mpc, achieving a 1-sigma precision of 5%. With improved analysis
techniques, the planned WALLABY (HI) and TAIPAN (optical) redshift surveys are
predicted to measure H0 to 1-3% precision.
