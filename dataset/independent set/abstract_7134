We present a systematic derivation of a model based on the central moment
lattice Boltzmann equation that rigorously maintains Galilean invariance of
forces to simulate inertial frame independent flow fields. In this regard, the
central moments, i.e. moments shifted by the local fluid velocity, of the
discrete source terms of the lattice Boltzmann equation are obtained by
matching those of the continuous full Boltzmann equation of various orders.
This results in an exact hierarchical identity between the central moments of
the source terms of a given order and the components of the central moments of
the distribution functions and sources of lower orders. The corresponding
source terms in velocity space are then obtained from an exact inverse
transformation due to a suitable choice of orthogonal basis for moments.
Furthermore, such a central moment based kinetic model is further extended by
incorporating reduced compressibility effects to represent incompressible flow.
Moreover, the description and simulation of fluid turbulence for full or any
subset of scales or their averaged behavior should remain independent of any
inertial frame of reference. Thus, based on the above formulation, a new
approach in lattice Boltzmann framework to incorporate turbulence models for
simulation of Galilean invariant statistical averaged or filtered turbulent
fluid motion is discussed.
