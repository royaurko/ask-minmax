We are concerned with describing the structure of the set of points in the
unit interval which, when subjected to rotation by irrational alpha modulo one,
for all finite portions of the orbit contain at least as many points in the
bottom half of the interval as in the top half. Specifically, an inductive
procedure for describing the set based on the continued fraction expansion of
alpha is developed, leading into a discussion of the Hausdorff dimension of
this set. Depending on the parameter alpha, all possible dimensions may be
achieved, and the essential infimum (with respect to alpha) of this dimension
is positive.
