We study percolation in the following random environment: let $Z$ be a
Poisson process of constant intensity in the plane, and form the Voronoi
tessellation of the plane with respect to $Z$. Colour each Voronoi cell black
with probability $p$, independently of the other cells. We show that the
critical probability is 1/2. More precisely, if $p>1/2$ then the union of the
black cells contains an infinite component with probability 1, while if $p<1/2$
then the distribution of the size of the component of black cells containing a
given point decays exponentially. These results are analogous to Kesten's
results for bond percolation in the square lattice.
  The result corresponding to Harris' Theorem for bond percolation in the
square lattice is known: Zvavitch noted that one of the many proofs of this
result can easily be adapted to the random Voronoi setting. For Kesten's
results, none of the existing proofs seems to adapt. The methods used here also
give a new and very simple proof of Kesten's Theorem for the square lattice; we
hope they will be applicable in other contexts as well.
