The Riemann-Roch theorem is of utmost importance in the algebraic geometric
theory of compact Riemann surfaces. It tells us how many linearly independent
meromorphic functions there are having certain restrictions on their poles. The
aim of this article is to present a simple direct proof of this theorem and
explore some of its numerous consequences. We also give an analytic proof of
the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. As an application, we compute the genus of some
interesting algebraic curves.
