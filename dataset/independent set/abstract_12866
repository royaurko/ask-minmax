Rotational and electromagnetic properties of the yrast band in $^{102}$Pd are
analyzed in terms of a phenomenological phonon model that includes anharmonic
terms. Both the moment of inertia and $B(E2)$'s are well reproduced by the
model, providing an independent confirmation of the multi-phonon picture
recently proposed. The (empirical) dependence of the phonon-phonon interaction
on the phonon frequency, in Ru, Pd, and Ru isotopes, follows the expectations
from particle-vibration coupling.
