Consider $d$ disjoint closed subintervals of the unit interval and consider
an orientation preserving expanding map which maps each of these subintervals
to the whole unit interval. The set of points where all iterates of this
expanding map are defined is a Cantor set. Associated to the construction of
this Cantor set is the scaling function which records the infinitely deep
geometry of this Cantor set. This scaling function is an invariant of $C^1$
conjugation. We solve the inverse problem posed by Dennis Sullivan: given a
scaling function, determine the maximal possible smoothness of any expanding
map which produces it.
