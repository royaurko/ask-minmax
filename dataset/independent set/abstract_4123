Multiplicity is a key statistic for understanding the formation of very low
mass (VLM) stars and brown dwarfs. Currently, the separation distribution of
VLM binaries remains poorly constrained at small separations (< 1 AU), leading
to uncertainty in the overall binary fraction. We approach this problem by
searching for spectral binaries whose identification is independent of
separation. The combined spectra of these systems exhibit traces of methane
imposed on an earlier-type spectra. When the primary of such a system is a
late-type M or early-type L dwarf, however, the relative faintness of the T
dwarf secondary (up to 5 magnitudes at K-band) renders these features extremely
subtle. We present a set of spectral indices newly designed to identify these
systems, and a spectral fitting method to confirm and characterize them. We
apply this method to a library of over 750 spectra from the SpeX Prism Spectral
Libraries. We present new spectral binary candidates, compare them to recent
discoveries, and describe ongoing followup to search for resolved companions
and/or radial velocity variability.
