The minimum number of total independent sets of $V \cup E$ of graph $G(V,E)$
is called the \emph{total chromatic number} of $G$, denoted by $\chi"(G)$. If
difference of cardinalities of any two total independent sets is at most one,
then the minimum number of total independent partition sets of $V \cup E$ is
called the \emph{equitable total chromatic number}, and denoted by
$\chi"_=(G)$.
  In this paper we consider equitable total coloring of corona of cubic graphs,
$G \circ H$. It turns out that, independly on equitable total chromatic numbers
of $G$ and $H$, equitable total chromatic number of corona $G \circ H$ is equal
to $\Delta(G \circ H) +1$. Thereby, we confirm TCC and ETCC conjectures for
coronas of cubic graphs. As a direct consequence we get that all coronas of
cubic graphs are of Type 1.
