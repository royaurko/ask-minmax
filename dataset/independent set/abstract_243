We prove that the diagonal operator defined by a positive sequence preserves
tropical and central indices if and only if the sequence is log-concave. In
particular we obtain an elementary proof of that such an operator preserves the
set of sign-independently real-rooted polynomials if and only if the sequence
is log-concave.
