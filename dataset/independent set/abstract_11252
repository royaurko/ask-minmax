We prove finite jet determination results for smooth CR embeddings which are
of constant degeneracy, using the method of complete systems. As an
application, we derive a reflection principle for mappings between a
Levi-nondegenerate hypersurface in C^N and a Levi-nondegenerate hypersurface in
C^{N+1}. We also give an independent proof of the reflection principle for
mappings between strictly pseudoconvex hypersurfaces in any codimension due to
Forstneric.
