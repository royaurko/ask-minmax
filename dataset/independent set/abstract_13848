Tsallis identified a set of numbers, the q-triplet, (qstat, qsen, qrel), for
a system described by nonextensive statistical mechanics. The deviation of the
q's from unity is a measure of the departure from thermodynamic equilibrium. We
present observations of the q-triplets derived from two sets of daily averages
of the magnetic field strength B observed by Voyager 1 in the solar wind near
40 A.U. during 1989 and near 85 A.U. during 2002, respectively. The results for
1989 do not differ significantly from those for 2002. We find qstat = 1.75,
qsen = -0.6, and qrel = 3.8.
