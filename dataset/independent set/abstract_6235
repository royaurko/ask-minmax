In [15], Jean Taylor has proved a regularity theorem away from boundary for
Almgren almost minimal sets of dimension two in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. It is quite
important for understanding the soap films and the solutions of Plateau's
problem away from boundary. In this paper, we will give a regularity result on
the boundary for two dimensional sliding almost minimal sets in
$\mathbb{R}^{3}$. It will be of use for understanding their boundary behavior.
