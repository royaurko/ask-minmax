We demonstrate that a minor modification of the extrapolation proposed by
Jensen [(2005): Theor Chem Acc 113:267] yields very reliable estimates of the
Hartree-Fock limit in conjunction with correlation consistent basis sets.
Specifically, a two-point extrapolation of the form
$E_{HF,L}=E_{HF,\infty}+A(L+1)\exp(-9\sqrt{L})$ yields HF limits
$E_{HF,\infty}$ with an RMS error of 0.1 millihartree using aug-cc-pVQZ and
aug-cc-pV5Z basis sets, and of 0.01 millihartree using aug-cc-pV5Z and
aug-cc-pV6Z basis sets.
