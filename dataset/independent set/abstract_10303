Light echoes are a promising tool to probe the environment where SNe Ia
explode and an independent source of information on the progenitor's nature.
After giving a brief introduction to the phenomenon we review the two known
cases, i.e. SNe 1991T and 1998bu. We then present the results we obtained from
the test case of SN1998es in NGC632. This object was classified as a 1991T-like
event and was affected by a strong reddening, a fact which made it a good
candidate for a light echo detection.
