We study cubical sets without degeneracies, which we call square sets. These
sets arise naturally in a number of settings and they have a beautiful
intrinsic geometry; in particular a square set C has an infinite family of
associated square sets J^i(C), i=1,2,..., which we call James complexes. There
are mock bundle projections p_i:|J^i(C)|-->|C| (which we call James bundles)
defining classes in unstable cohomotopy which generalise the classical
James--Hopf invariants of Omega(S^2). The algebra of these classes mimics the
algebra of the cohomotopy of Omega(S^2) and the reduction to cohomology defines
a sequence of natural characteristic classes for a square set. An associated
map to BO leads to a generalised cohomology theory with geometric
interpretation similar to that for Mahowald orientation [M Mahowald, Ring
Spectra which are Thom complexes, Duke Math. J. 46 (1979) 549--559] and [B
Sanderson, The geometry of Mahowald orientations, SLN 763 (1978) 152--174].
