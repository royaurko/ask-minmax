We predict the charm and bottom quark nuclear modification factors using
weakly coupled pQCD and strongly coupled AdS/CFT drag methods. The
log(pT/M_Q)/pT dependence of pQCD loss and the momentum independence of drag
loss lead to different momentum dependencies for the R_{AA} predictions. This
difference is enhanced by examining a new experimental observable, the double
ratio of charm to bottom nuclear modification factors,
R^{cb}=R^c_{AA}/R^b_{AA}. At LHC the weakly coupled theory predicts R^{cb} goes
to 1; whereas the strongly coupled theory predicts R^{cb} .2 independent of pT.
At RHIC the differences are less dramatic, as the production spectra are
harder, but the drag formula is applicable to higher momenta, due to the lower
temperature.
