We prove a central limit theorem for random sums of the form
$\sum_{i=1}^{N_n} X_i$, where $\{X_i\}_{i \geq 1}$ is a stationary
$m-$dependent process and $N_n$ is a random index independent of
$\{X_i\}_{i\geq 1}$. Our proof is a generalization of Chen and Shao's result
for i.i.d. case and consequently we recover their result. Also a variation of a
recent result of Shang on $m-$dependent sequences is obtained as a corollary.
Examples on moving averages and descent processes are provided, and possible
applications on non-parametric statistics are discussed.
