We construct a smooth and projective surface over an arbitrary number field
that is a counterexample to the Hasse principle but has the infinite etale
Brauer-Manin set. We also construct a surface with a unique rational point and
the infinite etale Brauer-Manin set. The key new ingredient is the arithmetic
of singular projective curves.
