This paper provides a description of the Java software framework which has
been constructed to run the Astrometric Global Iterative Solution for the Gaia
mission. This is the mathematical framework to provide the rigid reference
frame for Gaia observations from the Gaia data itself. This process makes Gaia
a self calibrated, and input catalogue independent, mission. The framework is
highly distributed typically running on a cluster of machines with a database
back end. All code is written in the Java language. We describe the overall
architecture and some of the details of the implementation.
