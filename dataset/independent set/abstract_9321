We report the results of the Monte-Carlo study of the method to determine the
CKM angle phi3 using Dalitz plot analysis of D0 decay from B->DK process. Our
main goal is to find the optimal strategy for a model-independent phi3
extraction. We find that the analysis using decays of CP-tagged D mesons only
cannot provide a completely model-independent measurement in the case of
limited data sample. The procedure involving binned analysis of B->DK and
psi(3770)->(K0 pi+ pi-)_D (K0 pi+ pi-)_D decays is proposed, that allows to
reach the phi3 precision comparable to unbinned model-dependent fit.
