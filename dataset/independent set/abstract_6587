The set of points of a one-dimensional cut-and-project quasicrystal or model
set, while not additive, is shown to be multiplicative for appropriate choices
of acceptance windows. This leads to the definition of an associative additive
graded composition law and permits the introduction of Lie algebras over such
aperiodic point sets. These infinite dimensional Lie algebras are shown to be
representatives of a new type of semi-direct product induced Lie algebras.
