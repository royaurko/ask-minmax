We perform three tests on our proposal to implement diffeomorphism invariance
in the non-abelian D0-brane DBI action as a basepoint independence constraint
between matrix Riemann normal coordinate systems. First we show that T-duality
along an isometry correctly interchanges the potential and kinetic terms in the
action. Second, we show that the method to impose basepoint independence using
an auxiliary dN^2-dimensional non-linear sigma model also works for metrics
which are curved along the brane, provided a physical gauge choice is made at
the end. Third, we show that without alteration this method is applicable to
higher order in velocities. Testing specifically to order four, we elucidate
the range of validity of the symmetrized trace approximation to the non-abelian
DBI action.
