The Dirac constraint formalism is applied to the d(d>2) dimensional
Einstein-Hilbert action when written in first order form, using the metric
density and affine connection as independent fields. Field equations not
involving time derivatives are not used to eliminate fields. Primary, secondary
and tertiary constraints arise, leaving d(d-3) degrees of freedom in phase
space. The Poisson Bracket algebra of these constraints is given.
