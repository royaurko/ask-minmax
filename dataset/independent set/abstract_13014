We consider a general class of black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell
theory which are holographically dual to CFTs with spatially dependent sources.
We show that an averaged DC thermoelectric conductivity matrix can be obtained
by solving the forced, linearised, time-independent Navier-Stokes equations on
the black hole horizon for an incompressible and charged fluid.
