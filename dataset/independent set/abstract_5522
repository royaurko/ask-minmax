Given a compact set of real numbers, a random $C^{m + \alpha}$-diffeomorphism
is constructed such that the image of any measure concentrated on the set and
satisfying a certain condition involving a real number $s$, almost surely has
Fourier dimension greater than or equal to $s / (m + \alpha)$. This is used to
show that every Borel subset of the real numbers of Hausdorff dimension $s$ is
$C^{m + \alpha}$-equivalent to a set of Fourier dimension greater than or equal
to $s / (m + \alpha)$. In particular every Borel set is diffeomorphic to a
Salem set, and the Fourier dimension is not invariant under
$C^m$-diffeomorphisms for any $m$.
