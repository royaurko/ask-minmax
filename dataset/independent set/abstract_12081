We discuss universality properties of blow-up of a classical (smooth)
solutions of conservation laws in one space dimension. It is shown that the
renormalized wave profile tends to a universal function, which is independent
both of initial conditions and of the form of a conservation law. This property
is explained in terms of the renormalization group theory. A solitary wave
appears in logarithmic coordinates of the Fourier space as a counterpart of
this universality. Universality is demonstrated in two examples: Burgers
equation and dynamics of ideal polytropic gas.
