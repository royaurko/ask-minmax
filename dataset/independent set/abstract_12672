We propose a kernel method to identify finite mixtures of nonparametric
product distributions. It is based on a Hilbert space embedding of the joint
distribution. The rank of the constructed tensor is equal to the number of
mixture components. We present an algorithm to recover the components by
partitioning the data points into clusters such that the variables are jointly
conditionally independent given the cluster. This method can be used to
identify finite confounders.
