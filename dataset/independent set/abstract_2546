An infinite family of classical superintegrable Hamiltonians defined on the
N-dimensional spherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces are shown to have a
common set of (2N-3) functionally independent constants of the motion. Among
them, two different subsets of N integrals in involution (including the
Hamiltonian) can always be explicitly identified. As particular cases, we
recover in a straightforward way most of the superintegrability properties of
the Smorodinsky-Winternitz and generalized Kepler-Coulomb systems on spaces of
constant curvature and we introduce as well new classes of (quasi-maximally)
superintegrable potentials on these spaces. Results here presented are a
consequence of the sl(2) Poisson coalgebra symmetry of all the Hamiltonians,
together with an appropriate use of the phase spaces associated to Poincare and
Beltrami coordinates.
