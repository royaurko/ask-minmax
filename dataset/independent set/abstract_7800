In this note we show that the n-2-dimensional volumes of codimension 2 faces
of an n-dimensional simplex are algebraically independent quantities of the
volumes of its edge-lengths. The proof involves computation of the eigenvalues
of Kneser graphs. We also construct families of non-congurent simplices not
determined by their codimension-2 areas.
