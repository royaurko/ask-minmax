We report the realization and characterization of independently controllable
tunnel barriers within a carbon nanotube. The nanotubes are mechanically bent
or kinked using an atomic force microscope, and top gates are subsequently
placed near each kink. Transport measurements indicate that the kinks form
gate-controlled tunnel barriers, and that gates placed away from the kinks have
little or no effect on conductance. The overall conductance of the nanotube can
be controlled by tuning the transmissions of either the kinks or the
metal-nanotube contacts.
