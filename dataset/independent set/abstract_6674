we start the study of Schur analysis in the quaternionic setting using the
theory of slice hyperholomorphic functions. The novelty of our approach is that
slice hyperholomorphic functions allows to write realizations in terms of a
suitable resolvent, the so called S-resolvent operator and to extend several
results that hold in the complex case to the quaternionic case. We discuss
reproducing kernels, positive definite functions in this setting and we show
how they can be obtained in our setting using the extension operator and the
slice regular product. We define Schur multipliers, and find their co-isometric
realization in terms of the associated de Branges-Rovnyak space.
