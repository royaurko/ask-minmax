Core-valence basis sets for the alkali and alkaline earth metals Li, Be, Na,
Mg, K, and Ca are proposed. The basis sets are validated by calculating
spectroscopic constants of a variety of diatomic molecules involving these
elements. Neglect of $(3s,3p)$ correlation in K and Ca compounds will lead to
erratic results at best, and chemically nonsensical ones if chalcogens or
halogens are present. The addition of low-exponent $p$ functions to the K and
Ca basis sets is essential for smooth convergence of molecular properties.
Inclusion of inner-shell correlation is important for accurate spectroscopic
constants and binding energies of all the compounds. In basis set
extrapolation/convergence calculations, the explicit inclusion of alkali and
alkaline earth metal subvalence correlation at all steps is essential for K and
Ca, strongly recommended for Na, and optional for Li and Mg, while in Be
compounds, an additive treatment in a separate `core correlation' step is
probably sufficient. Consideration of $(1s)$ inner-shell correlation energy in
first-row elements requires inclusion of $(2s,2p)$ `deep core' correlation
energy in K and Ca for consistency. The latter requires special CCV$n$Z `deep
core correlation' basis sets. For compounds involving Ca bound to
electronegative elements, additional $d$ functions in the basis set are
strongly recommended. For optimal basis set convergence in such cases, we
suggest the sequence CV(D+3d)Z, CV(T+2d)Z, CV(Q+$d$)Z, and CV5Z on calcium.
