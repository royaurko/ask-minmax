The joint spectral radius of a set of matrices is a measure of the maximal
asymptotic growth rate that can be obtained by forming long products of
matrices taken from the set. This quantity appears in a number of application
contexts but is notoriously difficult to compute and to approximate. We
introduce in this paper a procedure for approximating the joint spectral radius
of a finite set of matrices with arbitrary high accuracy. Our approximation
procedure is polynomial in the size of the matrices once the number of matrices
and the desired accuracy are fixed.
