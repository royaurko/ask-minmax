A survey of 329 nearby galaxies (redshift z < 0.045) has been conducted to
study the distribution of mass and light within spiral galaxies over a range of
environments. The 18 observed clusters and groups span a range of richness,
density, and X-ray temperature, and are supplemented by a set of 30 isolated
field galaxies. Optical spectroscopy taken with the 200-inch Hale Telescope
provides separately resolved H-alpha and [NII] major axis rotation curves for
the complete set of galaxies, which are analyzed to yield velocity widths and
profile shapes, extents and gradients. HI line profiles provide an independent
velocity width measurement and a measure of HI gas mass and distribution.
I-band images are used to deconvolve profiles into disk and bulge components,
to determine global luminosities and ellipticities, and to check morphological
classification. These data are combined to form a unified data set ideal for
the study of the effects of environment upon galaxy evolution.
