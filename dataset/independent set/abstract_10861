The relativistic transformation properties of the heavy quark-antiquark
interaction potential are considered in the framework of the relativistic quark
model. A special attention is paid to the long-range (confining) contribution
to the spin-independent part of qq bar interaction. The retardation effects are
consistently taken into account.
