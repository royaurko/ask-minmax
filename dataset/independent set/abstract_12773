Consider a bipartite random geometric graph on the union of two independent
homogeneous Poisson point processes in $d$-space, with distance parameter $r$
and intensities $\lambda,\mu$. We show for $d \geq 2$ that if $\lambda$ is
supercritical for the one-type random geometric graph with distance parameter
$2r$, there exists $\mu$ such that $(\lambda,\mu)$ is supercritical (this was
previously known for $d=2$). For $d=2$ we also consider the restriction of this
graph to points in the unit square. Taking $\mu = \tau \lambda$ for fixed
$\tau$, we give a strong law of large numbers as $\lambda \to \infty$, for the
connectivity threshold of this graph.
