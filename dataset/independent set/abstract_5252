Let $X$ be a compact metric space and $f:X\to X$ a homeomorphism on $X$. We
construct a fundamental domain for the set with finite peaks for each cocycle
induced by $\phi\in C(X,R)$. In particular we prove that if a partially
hyperbolic diffeomorphism is accessible, then either the set with finite peaks
for the Jacobian cocycle is of full volume, or the set of transitive points is
of positive volume.
