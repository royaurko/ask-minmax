There seems to be a non-negligible discrepancy between Daya Bay and T2K
experimental results of a neutrino mixing angle, $\theta_{13}$ . We show the
discrepancy can be simply passed away even in the standard three neutrinos
framework by taking the same value of $\Delta m^2_{32}$ with a normal neutrino
mass hierarchy and Dirac CP phase $\delta = -\pi/ 2$, which is favorable in T2K
experiment. For numerical analyses of neutrino oscillation probabilities, there
are five independent parameters, $\Delta m_{21}^2$, $\Delta m_{32}^2$,
$\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, and $\delta$. We reevaluate $\theta_{13}$ by
scatter plots within $1 \sigma$ range of five-dimensional parameters space
suggested by PDG, T2K, and Daya Bay. We project onto $\delta$-$\sin^2 2
\theta_{13}$ plane and find an overlap area of $\theta_{13}$ suggested by T2K
and Daya Bay. In the normal hierarchy case, the largest overlap area is given
by parameters set suggested by T2K, and the overlap area becomes small in order
of parameters sets suggested by PDG and Daya Bay. In the inverted hierarchy
case, there is a tiny overlap area only in parameters set suggested by T2K. We
also show several sample points of four parameters set, $\Delta m_{21}^2$,
$\Delta m_{32}^2$, $\theta_{12}$, and $\theta_{23}$, where the dissonance of
$\theta_{13}$ is really disappeared with $\delta = -\pi/2$.
