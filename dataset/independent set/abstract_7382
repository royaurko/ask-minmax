The vacant set of random interlacements at level $u>0$, introduced in
arXiv:0704.2560, is a percolation model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \geq 3$ which
arises as the set of sites avoided by a Poissonian cloud of doubly infinite
trajectories, where $u$ is a parameter controlling the density of the cloud. It
was proved in arXiv:0704.2560 and arXiv:0808.3344 that for any $d \geq 3$ there
exists a positive and finite threshold $u_*$ such that if $u<u_*$ then the
vacant set percolates and if $u>u_*$ then the vacant set does not percolate. We
give an elementary proof of these facts. Our method also gives simple upper and
lower bounds on the value of $u_*$ for any $d \geq 3$.
