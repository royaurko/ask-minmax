This paper analyzes the eigenvalue distribution of neutral differential
systems and the corresponding difference systems, and establishes the
relationship between the eigenvalue distribution and delay-independent
stability of neutral differential systems. By using the ``Complete
Discrimination System for Polynomials", easily testable necessary and
sufficient algebraic criteria for delay-independent stability of a class of
neutral differential systems are established. The algebraic criteria generalize
and unify the relevant results in the literature. Moreover, the maximal delay
bound guaranteeing stability can be determined if the systems are not
delay-independent stable. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate
the effectiveness of our results.
