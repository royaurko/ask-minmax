We design and implement a parallel algebraic multigrid method for isotropic
graph Laplacian problems on multicore Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). The
proposed AMG method is based on the aggregation framework. The setup phase of
the algorithm uses a parallel maximal independent set algorithm in forming
aggregates and the resulting coarse level hierarchy is then used in a K-cycle
iteration solve phase with a $\ell^1$-Jacobi smoother. Numerical tests of a
parallel implementation of the method for graphics processors are presented to
demonstrate its effectiveness.
