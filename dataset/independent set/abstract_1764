High resolution spectro-polarimetric observations of a sunspot light bridge
by Hinode, reveal small-scale inhomogeneities in the magnetic field and
velocity. These inhomogeneities arise as a consequence of a weak, secondary
lobe in the Stokes V profile which have a polarity opposite that of the sunspot
and very large (>5 km/s) Doppler velocities of both signs, suggesting two
distinct types of magnetic anomalies. These two sets of inhomogeneities are
highly time-dependent and appear exclusively in the upper half of the light
bridge and only after the light bridge is completely formed. Both sets of
inhomogeneities appear as patches and can be present independent of the other,
next to one another, or spatially separated in a single scan. A two-component
inversion of the corresponding spectral profiles indicate that the
inhomogeneities occupy a very small fraction, amounting to less than 10 %, of
the resolution element. These structures are likely driven by small-scale
magneto-convection where they could further interact with the overlying sunspot
magnetic field to produce reconnection jets in the chromosphere.
