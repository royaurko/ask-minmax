We provide an asymptotic linear representation for the Breslow estimator of
the baseline cumulative hazard function in the Cox model. Our representation
consists of an average of independent random variables and a term involving the
difference between the maximum partial likelihood estimator and the underlying
regression parameter. The order of the remainder term is arbitrarily close to
1/n.
