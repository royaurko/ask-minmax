We investigate the potential of the sparse data produced by the Catalina Sky
Survey astrometric project (CSS for short) in asteroid shape and rotational
state determination by the lightcurve inversion method. We show that although
the photometric quality of the CSS data, compared to the dense data, is
significantly worse, it is in principle possible that these data are for some
asteroids with high lightcurve amplitudes sufficient for a unique shape
determination. CSS data are available for $\sim$180 asteroids for which shape
models were previously derived from different photometric data sets. For 13
asteroids from this sample, we derive their unique shape models based only on
CSS data, compare the two independent shape models together and discuss the
reliability of models derived from only CSS data. We also use CSS data to
determine shape models for asteroids with already known rotational period
values, derive 12 unique models and compare previously published periods with
periods determined from the full 3D modeling by the lightcurve inversion
method. Finally, we test different shape resolutions used in the lightcurve
inversion method in order to find reliable asteroid models.
