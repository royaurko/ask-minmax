I point out a simple algebraic error in Joy Christian's refutation of Bell's
theorem. In substituting the result of multiplying some derived bivectors with
one another by consultation of their multiplication table, he confuses the
generic vectors which he used to define the table, with other specific vectors
having a special role in the paper, which had been introduced earlier. The
result should be expressed in terms of the derived bivectors which indeed do
follow this multiplication table. When correcting this calculation, the result
is not the singlet correlation any more. Moreover, curiously, his normalized
correlations are independent of the number of measurements and certainly do not
require letting n converge to infinity. On the other hand his unnormalized or
raw correlations are identically equal to -1, independently of the number of
measurements too. Correctly computed, his standardized correlations are the
bivectors - a . b - a x b, and they find their origin entirely in his
normalization or standardization factors. I conclude that his research program
has been set up around an elaborately hidden but trivial mistake.
