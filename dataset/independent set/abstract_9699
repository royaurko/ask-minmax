In recent work, we related the structure of subvarieties of $n\times n$
complex matrices defined by eigenvalue coincidences to
$GL(n-1,\mathbb{C})$-orbits on the flag variety of
$\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C})$. In the first part of this paper, we extend these
results to the complex orthogonal Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{so}(n,\mathbb{C})$. In the second part of the paper, we
use these results to study the geometry and invariant theory of the $K$-action
on $\mathfrak{g}$, in the cases where $(\mathfrak{g}, K)$ is
$(\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C}), GL(n-1,\mathbb{C}))$ or
$(\mathfrak{so}(n,\mathbb{C}), SO(n-1,\mathbb{C}))$. We study the geometric
quotient $\mathfrak{g}\to \mathfrak{g}//K$ and describe the closed $K$-orbits
on $\mathfrak{g}$ and the structure of the zero fibre. We also prove that for
$x\in \mathfrak{g}$, the $K$-orbit $Ad(K)\cdot x$ has maximal dimension if and
only if the algebraically independent generators of the invariant ring
$\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]^{K}$ are linearly independent at $x$, which extends a
theorem of Kostant. We give applications of our results to the Gelfand-Zeitlin
system.
