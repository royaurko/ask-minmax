The Macaulay2 package GraphicalModels contains algorithms for the algebraic
study of graphical models associated to undirected, directed and mixed graphs,
and associated collections of conditional independence statements. Among the
algorithms implemented are procedures for computing the vanishing ideal of
graphical models, for generating conditional independence ideals of families of
independence statements associated to graphs, and for checking for identifiable
parameters in Gaussian mixed graph models. These procedures can be used to
study fundamental problems about graphical models.
