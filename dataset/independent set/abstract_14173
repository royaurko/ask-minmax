The asymptotic pseudo-trajectory approach to stochastic approximation of
Benaim, Hofbauer and Sorin is extended for asynchronous stochastic
approximations with a set-valued mean field. The asynchronicity of the process
is incorporated into the mean field to produce convergence results which remain
similar to those of an equivalent synchronous process. In addition, this allows
many of the restrictive assumptions previously associated with asynchronous
stochastic approximation to be removed. The framework is extended for a coupled
asynchronous stochastic approximation process with set-valued mean fields.
Two-timescales arguments are used here in a similar manner to the original work
in this area by Borkar. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated
through learning in a Markov decision process.
