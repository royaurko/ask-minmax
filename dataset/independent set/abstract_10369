This paper describes a method for compiling a constraint-based grammar into a
potentially more efficient form for processing. This method takes dependent
disjunctions within a constraint formula and factors them into non-interacting
groups whenever possible by determining their independence. When a group of
dependent disjunctions is split into smaller groups, an exponential amount of
redundant information is reduced. At runtime, this means that an exponential
amount of processing can be saved as well. Since the performance of an
algorithm for processing constraints with dependent disjunctions is highly
determined by its input, the transformation presented in this paper should
prove beneficial for all such algorithms.
