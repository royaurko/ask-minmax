S-Boxes are important security components of block ciphers. We provide
theoretical results on necessary or sufficient criteria for an (invertible)
4-bit S-Box to be weakly APN. Thanks to a classification of 4-bit invertible
S-Boxes achieved independently by De Canni\'ere and Leander-Poschmann, we can
strengthen our results with a computer-aided proof.
