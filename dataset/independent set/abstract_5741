We study the magnitudes of soft masses in heterotic string models with
anomalous U(1) symmetry model-independently. In most cases, D-term contribution
to soft scalar masses is expected to be comparable to or dominant over other
contributions provided that supersymmetry breaking is mediated by the
gravitational interaction and/or an anomalous U(1) symmetry and the magnitude
of vacuum energy is not more than of order $m_{3/2}^2 M^2$.
