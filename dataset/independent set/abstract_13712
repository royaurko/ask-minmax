We notice that for any positive integer $k$, the set of $(1,2)$-specialized
characters of level $k$ standard $A_{1}^{(1)}$-modules is the same as the set
of rescaled graded dimensions of the subspaces of level $2k+1$ standard
$A_{2}^{(2)}$-modules that are vacuum spaces for the action of the principal
Heisenberg subalgebra of $A_{2}^{(2)}$. We conjecture the existence of a
semisimple category induced by the "equal level" representations of some
algebraic structure which would naturally explain this duality-like property,
and we study potential such structures in the context of generalized vertex
operator algebras.
