Using the U(1)_Q invariance, the photon eigenstate and matching gauge
coupling constants in SU(3)_C X SU(3)_L X U(1)_X models with beta arbitrary are
given. The mass matrix of neutral gauge bosons is exactly diagonalized, and the
photon eigenstate is independent on the symmetry breaking parameters - VEV's of
Higgs scalars. By obtaining the electromagnetic vertex, the model is embedded
naturally into the standard model.
