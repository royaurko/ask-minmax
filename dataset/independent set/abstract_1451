Frequencies of magnetic patch processes on supergranule boundary, namely flux
emergence, splitting, merging, and cancellation, are investigated through an
automatic detection. We use a set of line of sight magnetograms taken by the
Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board Hinode satellite. We found 1636 positive
patches and 1637 negative patches in the data set, whose time duration is 3.5
hours and field of view is 112" \times 112". Total numbers of magnetic
processes are followed: 493 positive and 482 negative splittings, 536 positive
and 535 negative mergings, 86 cancellations, and 3 emergences. Total numbers of
emergence and cancellation are significantly smaller than those of splitting
and merging. Further, frequency dependences of merging and splitting processes
on flux content are investigated. Merging has a weak dependence on flux content
only with a power- law index of 0.28. Timescale for splitting is found to be
independent of parent flux content before splitting, which corresponds to \sim
33 minutes. It is also found that patches split into any flux contents with a
same probability. This splitting has a power-law distribution of flux content
with an index of -2 as a time independent solution. These results support that
the frequency distribution of flux content in the analyzed flux range is
rapidly maintained by merging and splitting, namely surface processes. We
suggest a model for frequency distributions of cancellation and emergence based
on this idea.
