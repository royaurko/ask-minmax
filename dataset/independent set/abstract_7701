Main properties (strength function, energy-dependent transition density,
branching ratios for direct nucleon decay) of the isoscalar giant dipole
resonance in several medium-heavy mass spherical nuclei are described within a
continuum-RPA approach, taking into account the smearing effect. All model
parameters used in the calculations are taken from independent data.
Calculation results are compared with available experimental data.
