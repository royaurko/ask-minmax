We investigate families of infinite automata for context-sensitive languages.
An infinite automaton is an infinite labeled graph with two sets of initial and
final vertices. Its language is the set of all words labelling a path from an
initial vertex to a final vertex. In 2001, Morvan and Stirling proved that
rational graphs accept the context-sensitive languages between rational sets of
initial and final vertices. This result was later extended to sub-families of
rational graphs defined by more restricted classes of transducers.

  Our contribution is to provide syntactical and self-contained proofs of the
above results, when earlier constructions relied on a non-trivial normal form
of context-sensitive grammars defined by Penttonen in the 1970's. These new
proof techniques enable us to summarize and refine these results by considering
several sub-families defined by restrictions on the type of transducers, the
degree of the graph or the size of the set of initial vertices.
