At LEP~1, cross sections and cross section asymmetries may be analysed model
independently. Cross sections depend on four, asymmetries on two free
parameters. As an example, I discuss the model independent $Z$ boson mass
determination from the $Z$ line shape and compare it to the Standard Model
approach.
