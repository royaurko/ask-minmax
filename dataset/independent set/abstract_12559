We present a program that manages a database of temporally scoped beliefs.
The basic functionality of the system includes maintaining a network of
constraints among time points, supporting a variety of fetches, mediating the
application of causal rules, monitoring intervals of time for the addition of
new facts, and managing data dependencies that keep the database consistent. At
this level the system operates independent of any measure of belief or belief
calculus. We provide an example of how an application program mi9ght use this
functionality to implement a belief calculus.
