The bright, dark and grey solitons are well-known soliton solutions of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the attractive and repulsive BEC. We consider
solitons in the dipolar BEC of the fully polarized particles, speaking of the
dipolar BEC we mean both the magnetized BEC and the electrically polarized BEC.
We show that these two types of the dipolar BEC reveal different behavior of
the collective excitations. This is related to the fact that the electric and
the magnetic fields satisfy to the different pairs of the Maxwell equation set.
Thus we consider them independently. We obtain exact analytical solutions for
the bright, dark, and grey solitons in the magnetized (electrically polarized)
BEC when they propagate parallel and perpendicular to an external magnetic
(electric) field. Comparison of spectrum of the linear collective excitations
for the two kinds of the dipolar BEC is presented as well.
