In a recent paper the contributor proved a theorem to the effect that the matrix
of normalized Euclidean distances on the set of specially distributed random
points in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb R^{n}$ with independent
coordinates converges in probability as $n\rightarrow\infty$ to an ultrametric
matrix, the latter being completely determined by the expectations of
conditional variances of random coordinates of points. The main theorem of the
present paper extends this result to the case of weakly correlated coordinates
of random points. Prior to formulating and stating this result we give two
illustrative examples describing particular algorithms of generation of such
ultrametric spaces.
