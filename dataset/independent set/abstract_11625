In this article, the estimation of reliability of a system is discussed
$p(y<x)$ when strength, $X$, and stress, $Y$, are two independent exponential
distribution with different scale parameters when the available data are type
II Censored sample. Different methods for estimating the reliability are
applied. The point estimators obtained are maximum likelihood estimator,
uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator, and Bayesian estimators based on
conjugate and non informative prior distributions. A comparison of the
estimates obtained is performed. Interval estimators of the reliability are
also discussed.
