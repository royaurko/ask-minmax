A subset of Euclidean space will be said to be $n$-smooth if it has an
$n$-dimensional tangent plane at each of its points. Let ${\frak d}_n$
denote the least number $n$-smooth sets into which $n+1$-dimensional
Euclidean space can be decomposed. For each $n$ it is shown to be
consistent that ${\frak d}_n > {\frak d}_{n+1} $.  Moreover, the
inequalities ${\frak d}_{n+1}^+ \geq ${\frak d}_n$ are established
where ${\frak d}_1$ is defined to be the continuum. The cardinal
invariant ${\frak d}_2$ is shown to be the same as the least $\kappa$
such that each continuous function from the reals to the reals can be
decomposed into $\kappa$ differentiable functions.
