We have conducted a thorough study of the acoustic properties between 10^-4
and 1 Kelvin for the amorphous metal Zr_x Cu_1-x (x=0.3 and x=0.4), by
measuring the relative change of sound velocity dv/v and internal friction Q^-1
as a function of temperature and also of the applied strain, in both
superconducting and normal state. We have found that when plotted versus the
ratio of strain energy to thermal energy, all measurements display the same
behavior: a crossover from a linear regime of ``independent'' tunneling systems
at very low strains and/or high enough temperatures to a nonlinear regime where
dv/v and Q^-1 depend on applied strain and the tunneling systems cannot be
considered as independent.
