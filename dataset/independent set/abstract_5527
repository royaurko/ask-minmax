Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a Polish group. We say that a set $X \subset G$ is Haar
null if there exists a universally measurable set $U \supset X$ and a Borel
probability measure $\mu$ such that for every $g, h \in G$ we have
$\mu(gUh)=0$. We call a set $X$ naively Haar null if there exists a Borel
probability measure $\mu$ such that for every $g, h \in G$ we have
$\mu(gXh)=0$.
  Generalizing a result of Elekes and Stepr\=ans, which answers the first part
of Problem FC from Fremlin's list, we prove that in every abelian Polish group
there exists a naively Haar null set that is not Haar null.
