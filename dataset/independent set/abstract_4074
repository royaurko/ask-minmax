We derive a lower bound on the capacity pre-log of a temporally correlated
Rayleigh block-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with T
transmit antennas and R receive antennas in the noncoherent setting (no a
priori channel knowledge at the transmitter and the receiver). In this model,
the fading process changes independently across blocks of length L and is
temporally correlated within each block for each transmit-receive antenna pair,
with a given rank Q of the corresponding correlation matrix. Our result implies
that for almost all choices of the coloring matrix that models the temporal
correlation, the pre-log can be lower-bounded by T(1-1/L) for T <= (L-1)/Q
provided that R is sufficiently large. The widely used constant block-fading
model is equivalent to the temporally correlated block-fading model with Q = 1
for the special case when the temporal correlation for each transmit-receive
antenna pair is the same, which is unlikely to be observed in practice. For the
constant block-fading model, the capacity pre-log is given by T(1-T/L), which
is smaller than our lower bound for the case Q = 1. Thus, our result suggests
that the assumptions underlying the constant block- fading model lead to a
pessimistic result for the capacity pre-log.
