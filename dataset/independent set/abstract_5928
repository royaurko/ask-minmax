We consider integrals that generalize both the Mellin transforms of rational
functions of the form 1/f and the classical Euler integrals. The domains of
integration of our so-called Euler--Mellin integrals are naturally related to
the coamoeba of f, and the components of the complement of the closure of the
coamoeba give rise to a family of these integrals. After performing an explicit
meromorphic continuation of Euler--Mellin integrals, we interpret them as
A-hypergeometric functions and discuss their linear independence and relation
to Mellin--Barnes integrals.
