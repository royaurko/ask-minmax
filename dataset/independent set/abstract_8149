Arithmetic automata recognize infinite words of digits denoting
decompositions of real and integer vectors. These automata are known expressive
and efficient enough to represent the whole set of solutions of complex linear
constraints combining both integral and real variables. In this paper, the
closed convex hull of arithmetic automata is proved rational polyhedral.
Moreover an algorithm computing the linear constraints defining these convex
set is provided. Such an algorithm is useful for effectively extracting
geometrical properties of the whole set of solutions of complex constraints
symbolically represented by arithmetic automata.
