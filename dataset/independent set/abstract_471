We present the status of the CKM matrix parameters in the framework of the
Standard Model. We perform a model independent analysis to set constraints on
additional effective parameters accounting for possible New Physics effects and
to evaluate the present allowed space for these effects both from $B_d$ and
$B_s$ mesons.
