A 5x5 board is the smallest board on which one can set up all kind of chess
pieces as a start position. We consider Gardner's minichess variant in which
all pieces are set as in a standard chessboard (from Rook to King). This game
has roughly 9x10^{18} legal positions and is comparable in this respect with
checkers. We weakly solve this game, that is we prove its game-theoretic value
and give a strategy to draw against best play for White and Black sides. Our
approach requires surprisingly small computing power. We give a human readable
proof. The way the result is obtained is generic and could be generalized to
bigger chess settings or to other games.
