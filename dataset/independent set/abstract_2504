A $\widetilde{Q}-$representation of real numbers is introduced as a
generalization of the $p-$adic and $Q-$representations. It is shown that the
$\widetilde{Q}-$representation may be used as a convenient tool for the
construction and study of fractals and sets with complicated local structure.
Distributions of random variables $\xi$ with independent
$\widetilde{Q}-$symbols are studied in details. Necessary and sufficient
conditions for the probability measures $\mu_\xi $ associated with $\xi$ to be
either absolutely continuous or singular (resp. pure continuous, or pure point)
are found in terms of the $\widetilde{Q}-$representation. In addition the
metric-topological properties for the distribution of $\xi $ are investigated.
A number of examples are presented.
