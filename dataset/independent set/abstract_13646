A method of analyzing time bounds for randomized distributed algorithms is
presented, in the context of a new and general framework for describing and
reasoning about randomized algorithms. The method consists of proving
auxiliary statements of the form U (t)->(p) U', which means that whenever the
algorithm begins in a state in set U, with probability p, it will reach a
state in set U' within time t. The power of the method is illustrated by its
use in proving a constant upper bound on the expected time for some process to
reach its critical region, in Lehmann and Rabin's Dining Philosophers
algorithm.
