In this note we prove an abstract version of a result from 2002 due to
Delgado and Pi\~{n}ero on absolutely summing operators. Several applications
are presented; some of them in the multilinear framework and some in a
completely nonlinear setting. In a final section we investigate the size of the
set of non uniformly dominated sets of linear operators under the point of view
of lineability.
