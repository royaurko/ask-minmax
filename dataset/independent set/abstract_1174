E-commerce is one of the most important web applications. We present here a
set of patterns that describe shopping carts, products, catalogue, customer
accounts, shipping, and invoices. We combine them in the form of composite
patterns, which in turn make up a domain model for business-to-consumer
e-commerce. We also indicate how to add security constraints to this model.
This domain model can be used as a computation-independent model from which
specific applications can be produced using a model-driven architecture
approach.
