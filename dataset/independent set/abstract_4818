The computational complexity of a Delta 2 set will be calibrated by the
amount of changes needed for any of its computable approximations. Firstly, we
study Martin-Loef random sets, where we quantify the changes of initial
segments. Secondly, we look at c.e. sets, where we quantify the overall amount
of changes by obedience to cost functions. Finally, we combine the two
settings. The discussions lead to three basic principles on how complexity and
changes relate.
