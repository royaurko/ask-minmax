The $K_L \to \pi^0 \nu \bar\nu$ decay is analyzed in a model independent way.
When lepton flavor is conserved, this decay mode is a manifestation of CP
violating interference between mixing and decay. Consequently, a theoretically
clean relation between the measured rate and electroweak parameters holds in
any given model.
