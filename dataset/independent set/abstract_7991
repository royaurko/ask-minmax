We construct a distinguished set of positive and negative energy modes of the
Klein-Gordon equation for any Born frame of reference in Minkowski's
space-time. Unlike the case of a galilean frame of reference it is unclear
whether this set of modes may be an appropriate basis to define the vacuum of a
quantized scalar field in an accelerated cavity.
