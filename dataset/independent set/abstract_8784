A dynamic systems model has previously been proposed for mem-resistors based
on a driven damped harmonic oscillator differential equation describing
electron and ionic depletion widths in a thin semiconductor film. This paper
derives equations for set, reset, and retention times based on the previously
proposed model. Keywords- mem-resistor, RRAM, ReRAM
