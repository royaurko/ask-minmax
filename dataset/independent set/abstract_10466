The rapid destruction of long-range antiferromagnetic order upon doping of
Mott-Hubbard antiferromagnetic insulators is studied within a generalized
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless renormalization group theory in accordance with
recent calculations suggesting that holes dress with vortices. We calculate the
doping-dependent Neel temperature in good agreement with experiments for
high-Tc cuprates. Interestingly, the critical doping where long-range order
vanishes at zero temperature is predicted to be xc ~ 0.02, independently of any
energy scales of the system.
