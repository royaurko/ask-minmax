We study the set of solutions of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in
$\real^d, d<3$. We consider the global attracting set (i.e., the forward map
of the set of bounded initial data), and restrict it to a cube $Q_L$ of side
$L$. We cover this set by a (minimal) number $N_{Q_L}(\epsilon)$ of balls of
radius $\epsilon$ in $\Linfty(Q_L)$. We show that the Kolmogorov
$\epsilon$-entropy per unit length, $H_\epsilon =\lim_{L\to\infty} L^{-d} \log
N_{Q_L}(\epsilon)$ exists. In particular, we bound $H_\epsilon$ by
$\OO(\log(1/\epsilon)$, which shows that the attracting set is smaller than the
set of bounded analytic functions in a strip. We finally give a positive lower
bound: $H_\epsilon>\OO(\log(1/\epsilon))$
