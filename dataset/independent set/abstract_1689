Spatial information can be difficult to present to a visually impaired
computer user. In this paper we examine a new kind of tactile cueing for
non-visual interaction as a potential solution, building on earlier work on
vibrotactile Tactons. However, unlike vibrotactile Tactons, we use a pin array
to stimulate the finger tip. Here, we describe how to design static and dynamic
Tactons by defining their basic components. We then present user tests
examining how easy it is to distinguish between different forms of pin array
Tactons demonstrating accurate Tacton sets to represent directions. These
experiments demonstrate usable patterns for static, wave and blinking pin array
Tacton sets for guiding a user in one of eight directions. A study is then
described that shows the benefits of structuring Tactons to convey information
through multiple parameters of the signal. By using multiple independent
parameters for a Tacton, this study demonstrates participants perceive more
information through a single Tacton. Two applications using these Tactons are
then presented: a maze exploration application and an electric circuit
exploration application designed for use by and tested with visually impaired
users.
