Difference-difference systems are suggested corresponding to the Cartan
matrices of any simple or affine Lie algebra. In the cases of the algebras
$A_N$, $B_N$, $C_N$, $G_2$, $D_3$, $A_1^{(1)}$, $A_2^{(2)}$, $D^{(2)}_N$ these
systems are proved to be integrable. For the systems corresponding to the
algebras $A_2$, $A_1^{(1)}$, $A_2^{(2)}$ generalized symmetries are found. For
the systems $A_2$, $B_2$, $C_2$, $G_2$, $D_3$ complete sets of independent
integrals are found. The Lax representation for the difference-difference
systems corresponding to $A_N$, $B_N$, $C_N$, $A^{(1)}_1$, $D^{(2)}_N$ are
presented.
