This paper examines linear independence of shearlet systems. This property
has already been studied for wavelets and other systems such as, for instance,
for Gabor systems. In fact, for Gabor systems this problem is commonly known as
the HRT conjecture. In this paper we present a proof of linear independence of
compactly supported separable shearlet systems. For this, we employ a sampling
strategy to utilize the structure of an implicitly given underlying oversampled
wavelet system as well as the shape of the supports of the shearlet elements.
