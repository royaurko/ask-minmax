The covariant formulation of Maxwell's equations can be expressed in a form
independent of the usual systems of units by introducing the constants alpha,
beta and gamma into these equations. Maxwell's equations involving these
constants are then specialized to the most commonly used systems of units:
Gaussian, SI and Heaviside-Lorentz by giving the constants alpha, beta and
gamma the values appropriate to each system.
