We find a new highly symmetrical and very numerous class (millions of
non-isomorphic sets) of 4-dim Kochen-Specker (KS) vector sets. Due to the
nature of their geometrical symmetries, they cannot be obtained from previously
known ones. We generate the sets from a single set of 60 orthogonal spin
vectors and 75 of their tetrads (which we obtained from the 600-cell) by means
of our newly developed "stripping technique." We also consider "critical KS
subsets" and analyze their geometry. The algorithms and programs for the
generation of our KS sets are presented.
