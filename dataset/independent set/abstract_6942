This is the third installment in a series of papers on algebraic set theory.
In it, we develop a uniform approach to sheaf models of constructive set
theories based on ideas from categorical logic. The key notion is that of a
"predicative category with small maps" which axiomatises the idea of a category
of classes and class morphisms, together with a selected class of maps whose
fibres are sets (in some axiomatic set theory). The main result of the present
paper is that such predicative categories with small maps are stable under
internal sheaves. We discuss the sheaf models of constructive set theory this
leads to, as well as ideas for future work.
