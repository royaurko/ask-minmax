In this paper, we study the p-ary linear code Ck(n, q), q = ph, p prime, h >=
1, generated by the incidence matrix of points and k-dimensional spaces in
PG(n, q). For k >= n/2, we link codewords of Ck(n, q)\Ck(n, q) of weight
smaller than 2q^k to k-blocking sets. We first prove that such a k-blocking set
is uniquely reducible to a minimal k-blocking set, and exclude all codewords
arising from small linear k-blocking sets. For k < n/2, we present
counterexamples to lemmas valid for k >= n/2. Next, we study the dual code of
Ck(n, q) and present a lower bound on the weight of the codewords, hence
extending the results of Sachar [12] to general dimension.
