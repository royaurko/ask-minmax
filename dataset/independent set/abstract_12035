We argue that the possibility of having infinite energy in the centre of mass
frame of colliding particles is a generic property of rotating black holes. We
suggest a general model-independent derivation valid for "dirty" black holes.
The earlier observations for the Kerr or Kerr-Newman metrics are confirmed and
generalized.
