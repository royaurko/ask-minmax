The simple independent quark models have difficulties explaining
simultaneously the totality of the known hyperon magnetic moments and hyperon
semi-leptonic decay rates. We show that both the Goldstone boson loop
contributions and the two-quark effective exchange currents are essential in
explaining these observables.
