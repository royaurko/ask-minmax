Finding a suitable measurement matrix is an important topic in compressed
sensing. Though the known random matrix, whose entries are drawn independently
from a certain probability distribution, can be used as a measurement matrix
and recover signal well, in most cases, we hope the measurement matrix imposed
with some special structure. In this paper, based on random graph models, we
show that the mixed symmetric random matrices, whose diagonal entries obey a
distribution and non-diagonal entries obey another distribution, can be used to
recover signal successfully with high probability.
