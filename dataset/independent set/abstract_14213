Let G be an affine algebraic group over an algebraically closed field such
that the identity component G^0 of G is reductive. Let W be the Weyl group of G
and let D be a connected component of G whose image in G/G^0 is a unipotent
element.
  In this paper we define a map from the set of "twisted conjugay classes" in W
to the set of unipotent G^0-conjugacy classes in D, generalizing an earlier
construction which applied when G is connected.
