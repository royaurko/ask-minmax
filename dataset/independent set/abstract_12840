We investigate the trade-off between information gain and disturbance for a
class of weak von Neumann measurements on spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles, and
derive the unusual measurement pointer state that saturates this trade-off. We
then consider the fundamental question of sharing the non-locality of a single
particle of an entangled pair among multiple observers, and demonstrate that by
exploiting the information gain disturbance trade-off, one can obtain an
arbitrarily long sequence of consecutive and independent violations of the
CHSH-Bell inequality.
