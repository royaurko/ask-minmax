It is shown how a C*-algebra representation of the transformations of a
physical system can be derived from two operational postulates: 1) the
existence of dynamically independent systems}; 2) the existence of symmetric
faithful states. Both notions are crucial for the possibility of performing
experiments on the system, in preventing remote instantaneous influences and in
allowing calibration of apparatuses. The case of Quantum Mechanics is
thoroughly analyzed. The possibility that other no-signaling theories admit a
C*-algebra formulation is discussed.
