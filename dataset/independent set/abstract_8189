The theory of direct decomposition of a centrally orthocomplete effect
algebra into direct summands of various types utilizes the notion of a
type-determining (TD) set. A pseudo-effect algebra (PEA) is a (possibly)
noncommutative version of an effect algebra. In this article we develop the
basic theory of centrally orthocomplete PEAs, generalize the notion of a TD set
to PEAs, and show that TD sets induce decompositions of centrally orthocomplete
PEAs into direct summands.
