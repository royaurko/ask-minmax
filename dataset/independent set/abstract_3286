We combine constraints from analyticity with experimental electron-proton
scattering data to determine the proton magnetic radius without model-dependent
assumptions on the shape of the form factor. We also study the impact of
including electron-neutron scattering data, and $\pi\pi\to N\bar{N}$ data.
Using representative datasets we find for a cut of $Q^2\leq0.5$ GeV$^2$,
$r_M^p=0.91^{+0.03}_{-0.06}\pm0.02$ fm using just proton scattering data;
$r_M^p=0.87^{+0.04}_{-0.05}\pm0.01$ fm adding neutron data; and
$r_M^p=0.87^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ fm adding $\pi\pi$ data. We also extract the
neutron magnetic radius from these data sets obtaining
$r_M^n=0.89^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ fm from the combined proton, neutron, and $\pi\pi$
data.
