We discuss spontaneous breaking of continuum symmetries, whose generators do
explicitly depend on the spacetime coordinates. We clarify the relation between
broken symmetries and elastic variables at both zero and finite temperatures,
and/or finite densities, and show the general counting rule that is
model-independently determined by the symmetry breaking pattern. We apply it to
three intriguing examples: rotational, conformal, and gauge symmetries.
