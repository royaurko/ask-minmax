The paper argues the importance of high-quality translation for spoken
language translation systems. It describes an architecture suitable for rapid
development of high-quality limited-domain translation systems, which has been
implemented within an advanced prototype English to French spoken language
translator. The focus of the paper is the hybrid transfer model which combines
unification-based rules and a set of trainable statistical preferences;
roughly, rules encode domain-independent grammatical information and
preferences encode domain-dependent distributional information. The preferences
are trained from sets of examples produced by the system, which have been
annotated by human judges as correct or incorrect. An experiment is described
in which the model was tested on a 2000 utterance sample of previously unseen
data.
