We give a multidimensional generalisation of the complete set of
Bell-correlation inequalities given by Werner and Wolf, and by Zukowski and
Brukner, for the two-dimensional case. Our construction applies for the n
parties, two-observables case, where each observable is d-valued. The d^{d^n}
inequalities obtained involve homogeneous polynomials. They define the facets
of a polytope in a complex vector space of dimension d^n. We also show that
these inequalities are violated by Quantum Mechanics. We exhibit examples in
the three-dimensional case.
