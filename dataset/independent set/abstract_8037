We show that on an infinite set, there exist no other precomplete clones
closed under conjugation except those which contain all permutations. Since on
base sets of some infinite cardinalities, in particular on countably infinite
ones, the precomplete clones containing the permutations have been determined,
this yields a complete list of the precomplete conjugation-closed clones in
those cases. In addition, we show that there exist no precomplete submonoids of
the full transformation monoid which are closed under conjugation except those
which contain the permutations; the monoids of the latter kind are known.
