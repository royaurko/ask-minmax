We investigate the question of distinguishing between different microstates
of the D1-D5 system (with charges Q_1 and Q_5), by scattering with an
incoherent beam, composed of a supergravity probe, with central energy E_0 and
width (\Delta E). The scattering is studied in the dual CFT description in the
orbifold limit for finite R, where R is the radius of the circle on which the
D1 branes are wrapped. When R(\Delta E) >> 1, the absorption cross-section is
found to be independent of the microstate and identical to the leading
semiclassical answer computed from the naive geometry. For smaller (\Delta E),
the answer depends on the particular microstate, which we examine for both
typical and atypical microstates. We derive an upper bound for the leading
correction to the cross-section when 1/R >> \Delta E >> (the average energy gap
1/{R [sqrt(Q_1Q_5)]}. For a typical state the bound is proportional to the area
of the stretched horizon, [\sqrt(Q_1 Q_5)], up to [log (Q_1Q_5)] terms.
Furthermore, when E_0 << (\Delta E), the proportionality constant is a pure
number independent of all energy scales. Numerical calculations using
Lorentzian profiles show that the actual value of the correction is in fact
proportional to [sqrt(Q_1Q_5)] without the logarithmic factor. We offer some
speculations about how this result can be consistent with a resolution of the
naive geometry by higher derivative corrections to supergravity.
