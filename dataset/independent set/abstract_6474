Inspired by Gentzen's 1936 consistency proof, Goodstein found a close fit
between descending sequences of ordinals epsilon_0 and sequences of integers,
now known as Goodstein sequences. This article revisits Goodstein's 1944 paper.
In light of new historical details found in a correspondence between Bernays
and Goodstein, we address the question of how close Goodstein came to proving
an independence result for PA. We also present an elementary proof of the fact
that already the termination of all special Goodstein sequences, i.e. those
induced by the shift function, is not provable in PA. This was first proved by
Kirby and Paris in 1982, using techniques from the model theory of arithmetic.
The proof presented here arguably only uses tools that would have been
available in the 1940's or 1950's. Thus we ponder the question whether striking
independence results could have been proved much earlier? In the same vein we
also wonder whether the search for strictly mathematical examples of an
incompleteness in PA really attained its "holy grail" status before the late
1970's. Almost no direct moral is ever given; rather, the paper strives to lay
out evidence for the reader to consider and have the reader form their own
conclusions. However, in relation to independence results, we think that both
Goodstein and Gentzen are deserving of more credit.
