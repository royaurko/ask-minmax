Processing of Diffusion MRI data obtained from High Angular Resolution
measurements consists of a series of steps, starting with the estimation of an
orientation distribution function (ODF), which is then used as input for e.g.
tractography algorithms. It is important that ODF reconstruction methods yield
accurate, coherent ODFs, in particular for low SNR or coarsely sampled data
sets. As the diffusion process is modelled independently in each voxel,
reconstructions are often carried out for each voxel separately, disregarding
the observation that neighboring voxels are often quite similar if they belong
to the same fiber structure. There are surprisingly few approaches that make
use of this kind of spatial regularity to improve coherence and stability of
the reconstruction. In this work, we focus on a variation of a method proposed
by Reisert and Kiselev based on the concept of fiber continuity. The method has
already been shown to yield good numerical results, but has not yet been
analyzed theoretically. Under suitable smoothness assumptions, we apply results
on constrained Tikhonov-type regularization with approximate operator to show
convergence of reconstructions from discrete, noisy data for linear forward
models. Further, we numerically illustrate the performance of the method on
phantom and in-vivo data.
