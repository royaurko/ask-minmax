Following the model independent approach to deuteron photodisintegration with
linearly polarized $\gamma-$rays, we show that the measurements of the tensor
analyzing powers on aligned deuterons along with the differential cross section
involve five different linear combinations of the isovector $E1^j_v; j=0,1,2$
amplitudes interfering with the isoscalar $M1_s$ and $E2_s$ amplitudes. This is
of current interest in view of the recent experimental finding
\cite{blackston1} that the three $E1^j_v$ amplitudes are distinct and also the
reported experimental observation \cite{sawatzky} on the front-back (polar
angle) asymmetry in the differential cross section.
