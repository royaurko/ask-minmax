We investigate the truth-table degrees of (co-)c.e.\ sets, in particular,
sets of random strings. It is known that the set of random strings with respect
to any universal prefix-free machine is Turing complete, but that truth-table
completeness depends on the choice of universal machine. We show that for such
sets of random strings, any finite set of their truth-table degrees do not meet
to the degree~0, even within the c.e. truth-table degrees, but when taking the
meet over all such truth-table degrees, the infinite meet is indeed~0. The
latter result proves a conjecture of Allender, Friedman and Gasarch. We also
show that there are two Turing complete c.e. sets whose truth-table degrees
form a minimal pair.
