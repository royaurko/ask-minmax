At a low resolution scale with $Q^2={\mu}^2$ corresponding to the nucleon
bound state; deep inelastic unpolarized structure functions $F_1(x,{\mu}^2)$
and $F_2(x,{\mu}^2)$ are derived with correct support using the symmetric part
of the hadronic tensor under some simplifying assumptions in the Bjorken limit.
For doing this; the nucleon in its ground state has been represented by a
suitably constructed momentum wave packet of its valence quarks in their
appropriate SU(6) spin flavor configuration with the momentum probability
amplitude taken phenomenologically in reference to the independent quark model
of scalar-vector harmonic potential. The valence quark distribution functions
$u_v(x,{\mu}^2)$ and $d_v(x,{\mu}^2)$, extracted from the structure function
$F_1(x,{\mu}^2)$ in a parton model interpretation, satisfy normalization
constraints as well as the momentum sum-rule requirements at a bound state
scale of ${\mu}^2=0.1 GeV^2$. QCD evolution of these distribution functions
taken as the inputs; yields at $Q_0^2=15 GeV^2; xu_v(x,Q_0^2)$ and
$xd_v(x,Q_0^2)$ in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data. The
gluon distribution $G(x,Q_0^2)$ and the sea-quark distribution $q_s(x,Q_0^2)$;
which are dynamically generated using the leading order renormalization group
equation; also match reasonably well with the available experimental data.
