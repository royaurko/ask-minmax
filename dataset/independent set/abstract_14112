Finding a basis matrix (dictionary) by which objective signals are
represented sparsely is of major relevance in various scientific and
technological fields. We consider a problem to learn a dictionary from a set of
training signals. We employ techniques of statistical mechanics of disordered
systems to evaluate the size of the training set necessary to typically succeed
in the dictionary learning. The results indicate that the necessary size is
much smaller than previously estimated, which theoretically supports and/or
encourages the use of dictionary learning in practical situations.
