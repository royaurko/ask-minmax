We consider independent edge percolation models on Z, with edge occupation
probabilities p_<x,y> = p if |x-y| = 1, 1 - exp{- beta / |x-y|^2} otherwise. We
prove that oriented percolation occurs when beta > 1 provided p is chosen
sufficiently close to 1, answering a question posed in [Commun. Math. Phys.
104, 547 (1986)]. The proof is based on multi-scale analysis.
