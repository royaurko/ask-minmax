Motivated by applications in sociology, economy and medicine, we study
variants of the Target Set Selection problem, first proposed by Kempe,
Kleinberg and Tardos. In our scenario one is given a graph $G=(V,E)$, integer
values $t(v)$ for each vertex $v$ (\emph{thresholds}), and the objective is to
determine a small set of vertices (\emph{target set}) that activates a given
number (or a given subset) of vertices of $G$ \emph{within} a prescribed number
of rounds. The activation process in $G$ proceeds as follows: initially, at
round 0, all vertices in the target set are activated; subsequently at each
round $r\geq 1$ every vertex of $G$ becomes activated if at least $t(v)$ of its
neighbors are already active by round $r-1$. It is known that the problem of
finding a minimum cardinality Target Set that eventually activates the whole
graph $G$ is hard to approximate to a factor better than
$O(2^{\log^{1-\epsilon}|V|})$. In this paper we give \emph{exact} polynomial
time algorithms to find minimum cardinality Target Sets in graphs of bounded
clique-width, and \emph{exact} linear time algorithms for trees.
