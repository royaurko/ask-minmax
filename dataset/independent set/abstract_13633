Based on recent proposals linking four and five-dimensional BPS solutions, we
discuss the explicit dictionary between general stationary 4D and 5D
supersymmetric solutions in N=2 supergravity theories with cubic prepotentials.
All these solutions are completely determined in terms of the same set of
harmonic functions and the same set of attractor equations. As an example, we
discuss black holes and black rings in G\"odel-Taub-NUT spacetime. Then we
consider corrections to the 4D solutions associated with more general
prepotentials and comment on analogous corrections on the 5D side.
