We present limits to anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background
radiation (CMB) at angular scales of a few arcminutes. The observations were
made at a frequency of 142 GHz using a 6-element bolometer array (the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Infrared Experiment) at the Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory. Two patches of sky, each approximately 36'x4' and free of known
sources, were observed for a total of 6-8 hours each, resulting in
approximately 80 independent 1.7' full-width half-maximum pixels. Each pixel is
observed with both a dual-beam and a triple-beam chop, with a sensitivity per
pixel of 90-150 uK in each chop. These data have been analyzed using maximum
likelihood techniques by assuming a gaussian autocorrelation function for the
distribution of CMB fluctuations on the sky. We set an upper limit of Delta T/T
<= 2.1 x 10^{-5} (95% confidence) for a coherence angle to the fluctuations of
1.1. These limits are comparable to the best limits obtained from
centimeter-wavelength observations on similar angular scales but have the
advantage that the contribution from known point sources is negligible at these
frequencies. They are the most sensitive millimeter-wavelength limits for
coherence angles <= 3'. The results are also considered in the context of
secondary sources of anisotropy, specifically the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
from galaxy clusters.
