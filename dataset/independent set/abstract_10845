We calculate the corrections to the strange matrix elements of the nucleon
resulting from the breaking of rotational invariance on the light-cone. In the
meson cloud model, the strange magnetic moment mu_S is seen to change sign once
the spurious form factors arising from this violation are subtracted. The
resulting mu_S is small and slightly positive, in agreement with the trend of
the recent data from the SAMPLE experiment. The value of the strange magnetic
form factor is predicted to be largely Q^2 independent over the range
accessible in upcoming experiments.
