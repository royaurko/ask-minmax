We study the Maker-Breaker tournament game played on the edge set of a given
graph $G$. Two players, Maker and Breaker claim unclaimed edges of $G$ in
turns, and Maker wins if by the end of the game she claims all the edges of a
pre-defined goal tournament. Given a tournament $T_k$ on $k$ vertices, we
determine the threshold bias for the $(1:b)$ $T_k$-tournament game on $K_n$. We
also look at the $(1:1)$ $T_k$-tournament game played on the edge set of a
random graph ${\mathcal{G}_{n,p}}$ and determine the threshold probability for
Maker's win. We compare these games with the clique game and discuss whether a
random graph intuition is satisfied.
