Recent analyses of nebular spectra have resulted in discrepant abundances
from CNO forbidden and recombination lines. We consider independent methods of
determining ion abundances for emission nebulae, comparing ion emission
measures with column densities derived from resonance absorption lines viewed
against the central star continuum. Separate analyses of the nebular emission
lines and the stellar UV absorption lines yield independent abundances for
ions, and their ratio can be expressed in terms of a parameter n_e_{em}, the
``emission density'' for each ion. Adequate data for this technique are still
scarce, but separate analyses of spectra of the planetary nebula and central
star of IC 418 do show discrepant abundances for several ions, especially Fe
II. The discrepancies are probably due to the presence of absorbing gas which
does not emit and/or to uncertain atomic data and excitation processes, and
they demonstrate the importance of applying the technique of combining
emission- and absorption-line data in deriving abundances for nebulae.
