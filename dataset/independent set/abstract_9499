An almost model-independent parametrization for the ratio of the total cross
section to the elastic slope, as function of the center of mass energy, is
introduced. The analytical result is based on the approximate relation of this
quantity with the ratio $R$ of the elastic to total cross section and empirical
fits to the $R$ data from proton-proton scattering above 10 GeV, under the
conditions of asymptotic unitarity and the black-disk limit. This
parametrization may be useful in studies of extensive air showers and the
determination of the proton-proton total cross section from proton-air
production cross section in cosmic-ray experiments.
