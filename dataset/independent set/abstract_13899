Recent spectral clustering methods are a propular and powerful technique for
data clustering. These methods need to solve the eigenproblem whose
computational complexity is $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of data samples.
In this paper, a non-eigenproblem based clustering method is proposed to deal
with the clustering problem. Its performance is comparable to the spectral
clustering algorithms but it is more efficient with computational complexity
$O(n^2)$. We show that with a transitive distance and an observed property,
called K-means duality, our algorithm can be used to handle data sets with
complex cluster shapes, multi-scale clusters, and noise. Moreover, no
parameters except the number of clusters need to be set in our algorithm.
