We study the states localized near an interface between conducting and
insulating bilayer graphene (BLG) and show that they have highly unusual
properties that have no analog in conventional systems. Moreover, the states
belonging to the two independent valleys in the Brillouin zone of BLG show
contrasting properties that allows a relatively easier experimental realization
of various valley based functionalities desired in valleytronics without
requiring any sophisticated techniques.
