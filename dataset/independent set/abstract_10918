We present our calculation of the correlator $<T\{V_sV_s^\dag\} >$ between
two external vector-currents with the quantum-numbers of a charged kaon. The
renormalized expression to $O(p^6)$ in $SU(3) \times SU(3)$ standard chiral
perturbation theory is finite and scale-independent. The result is used to
determine, via an IMFESR, the phenomenologically relevant finite
$O(p^6)$-counterterm combination $Q_V$ in a way which is not sensitive to
isospin breaking.
