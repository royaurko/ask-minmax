This paper analyzes the asymptotic exponent of both the weight spectrum and
the stopping set size spectrum for a class of generalized low-density
parity-check (GLDPC) codes. Specifically, all variable nodes (VNs) are assumed
to have the same degree (regular VN set), while the check node (CN) set is
assumed to be composed of a mixture of different linear block codes (hybrid CN
set). A simple expression for the exponent (which is also referred to as the
growth rate or the spectral shape) is developed. This expression is consistent
with previous results, including the case where the normalized weight or
stopping set size tends to zero. Furthermore, it is shown how certain symmetry
properties of the local weight distribution at the CNs induce a symmetry in the
overall weight spectral shape function.
