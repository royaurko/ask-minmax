A set of consistent Poisson brackets for an open string in generic spacetime
background and NS-NS $B$-field is constructed. Upon quantization, this set of
Poisson brackets lead to spacial \emph{commutative} $D$-branes at the string
ends, showing that noncommutativity between spacial coordinates on the
$D$-branes can be avoided.
