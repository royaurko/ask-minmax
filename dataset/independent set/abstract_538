A new criterion is developed which provides a check as to whether a chosen
set of polarization observables is complete with respect to the determination
of all independent $T$-matrix elements of a reaction of the type $a+b\to
c+d+...$. As an illustrative example, this criterion is applied to the
longitudinal observables of deuteron electrodisintegration.
