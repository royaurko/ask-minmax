Measures in the context of Category Theory lead to various relations, even
differential relations, of categories that are independent of the mathematical
structure forming objects of a category. Such relations, which are independent
of mathematical structure that we may represent a physical body or a system of
reference with, are, precisely, demanded to be the Laws of Physics by the
General Principle of Relativity. This framework leads to a theory for the
physical entirety.
