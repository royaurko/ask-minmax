In this paper, we extend Bourgain's double recurrence result to the
Wiener-Wintner averages. Let $(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu, T)$ be a standard ergodic
system. We will show that for any $f_1, f_2 \in L^\infty(X)$, the double
recurrence Wiener-Wintner average
  \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N f_1(T^{an}x)f_2(T^{bn}x) e^{2\pi i n t} \]
converges off a single null set of $X$ independent of $t$ as $N \to \infty$.
Furthermore, we will show a uniform Wiener-Wintner double recurrence result: If
either $f_1$ or $f_2$ belongs to the orthogonal complement of the Conze-Lesigne
factor, then there exists a set of full measure such that the supremum on $t$
of the absolute value of the averages above converges to $0$.
