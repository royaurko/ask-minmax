We prove an analogue of Sadullaev's theorem concerning the size of the set
where a maximal totally real manifold can meet a pluripolar set. The manifold
has to be of class C-1 only. This readily leads to a version of Shcherbina's
theorem for C-1 functions f that are defined in a neighborhood of certain
compact sets K in the complex plane. If the graph of f on K is pluripolar, then
f satisfies the Cauchy Riemann equations in the closure of the fine interior of
K.
