General relativity can be cast as a gauge theory by introducing a tetrad
field and a spin-connection. This formalism was extended by replacing the
tetrad field with a mixed tensor field independent of the metric tensor in
order to develop a mechanism of adjustment of the vacuum energy density that
takes advantage of Weinberg's no-go theorem. With no anthropic considerations,
it was shown that the vacuum energy density is bounded and the gravitational
and cosmological constants are proportional to a tiny dimensionless parameter
determined by the coupling constants of the model.
