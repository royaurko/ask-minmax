We show the $L^2$-convergence of continuous time ergodic averages of a
product of functions evaluated at return times along polynomials. These
averages are the continuous time version of the averages appearing in
Furstenberg's proof of Szemer\'edi's Theorem. For each average we show that it
is sufficient to prove convergence on special factors, the Host-Kra factors,
which have the structure of a nilmanifold. We also give a description of the
limit. In particular, if the polynomials are independent over the real numbers
then the limit is the product of the integrals. We further show that if the
collection of polynomials has "low complexity", then for every set $E$ of real
numbers with positive density and for every $\delta >0$, the set of polynomial
return times for the "$\delta$-thickened" set $E_{\delta}$ has bounded gaps.
