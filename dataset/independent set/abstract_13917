Using lattice theory, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the
set of Fourier-Mukai partners of a projective $K3$ surface and the set of
0-dimensional standard cusps of its Kahler moduli. We also study the relation
between twisted Fourier-Mukai partners and general 0-dimensional cusps, and the
relation between Fourier-Mukai partners with elliptic fibrations and certain
1-dimensional cusps.
