FlexibleSUSY is a software package that takes as input descriptions of
(non-)minimal supersymmetric models written in Wolfram/Mathematica and
generates a set of spectrum generator libraries and executables, with the aid
of SARAH. The design goals are precision, reliability, modularity, speed, and
readability of the code. The boundary conditions are independent C++ objects
that are plugged into the boundary value problem solver together with the model
objects. This clean separation makes it easy to adapt the generated code for
individual projects. The current status of the interface and implementation is
sketched.
