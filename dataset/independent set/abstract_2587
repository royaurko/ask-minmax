In large-eddy simulations of atmospheric boundary layer turbulence, the
lumped coefficient in the eddy-diffusion subgrid-scale (SGS) model is known to
depend on scale for the case of inert scalars. This scale dependence is
predominant near the surface. In this paper, a scale-dependent dynamic SGS
model for the turbulent transport of reacting scalars is implemented in
large-eddy simulations of a neutral boundary layer. Since the model coefficient
is computed dynamically from the dynamics of the resolved scales, the
simulations are free from any parameter tuning. A set of chemical cases
representative of various turbulent reacting flow regimes is examined. The
reactants are involved in a first-order reaction and are injected in the
atmospheric boundary layer with a constant and uniform surface flux. Emphasis
is placed on studying the combined effects of resolution and chemical regime on
the performance of the SGS model. Simulations with the scale-dependent dynamic
model yield the expected trends of the coefficients as function of resolution,
position in the flow and chemical regime, leading to resolution-independent
turbulent reactant fluxes.
