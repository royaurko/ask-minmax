Prehistory - Starting from 't Hooft's (1971) we have a short look at Taylor's
and Slavnov's works (1971-72) and at the lectures given by Rouet and Stora in
Lausanne-1973 which determine the transition from pre-history to history.
History - We give a brief account of the main analyses and results of the BRS
collaboration concerning the renormalized gauge theories, in particular the
method of the regularization independent, algebraic renormalization, the
algebraic proof of S-matrix unitarity and that of gauge choice independence of
the renormalized physics. We conclude this report with a suggestion to the
crucial question: what could remain of BRS invariance beyond perturbation
theory.
