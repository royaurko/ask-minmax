We present a new two-body finite-range and momentum-dependent but
density-independent effective interaction, which can be interpreted as a
regularized zero-range force. We show that no three-body or density-dependent
terms are needed for a correct description of saturation properties in infinite
matter, that is, on the level of low-energy density functional, the physical
three-body effects can be efficiently absorbed in effective two-body terms. The
new interaction gives a very satisfying equation of state of nuclear matter and
opens up extremely interesting perspectives for the mean-field and
beyond-mean-field descriptions of atomic nuclei.
