A study of the colour-ordered one-loop amplitudes in N=4 SYM reveals a
surprising property: numerically, the amplitudes have an Approximately
Universal form A^{1-loop}_n ~ A^{tree}_n \times U_n, where U_n is helicity
independent. This form is exact if the amplitude is a MHV amplitude, but has an
"error" which is typically less than 1% for the six, seven and eight gluon NMHV
one-loop amplitudes.
