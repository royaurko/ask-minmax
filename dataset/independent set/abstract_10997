In crystalline color superconductivity, quark pairs form at non-zero total
momentum. This crystalline order potentially enlarges the domain of color
superconductivity in cold dense quark matter. We present a perturbative
calculation of the parameters governing the crystalline phase and show that
this is indeed the case. Nevertheless, the enhancement is modest, and to lowest
order is independent of the strength of the color interaction.
