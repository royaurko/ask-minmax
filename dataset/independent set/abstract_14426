In this book chapter we survey known approaches and algorithms to compute
discrepancy measures of point sets. After providing an introduction which puts
the calculation of discrepancy measures in a more general context, we focus on
the geometric discrepancy measures for which computation algorithms have been
designed. In particular, we explain methods to determine $L_2$-discrepancies
and approaches to tackle the inherently difficult problem to calculate the star
discrepancy of given sample sets. We also discuss in more detail three
applications of algorithms to approximate discrepancies.
