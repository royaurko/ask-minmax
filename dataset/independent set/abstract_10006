We propose a robust alternative to principal component analysis (PCA) --
named elliptical component analysis (ECA) -- for analyzing high dimensional
elliptically distributed data. ECA aims at estimating the eigenspace of the
covariance matrix of the elliptical data. To cope with the heavy-tailed
elliptical distributions, a multivariate rank statistic is exploited. At the
model-level, we consider two settings that the leading eigenvectors of the
covariance matrix are non-sparse or sparse. Methodologically, we propose ECA
procedures corresponding to both non-sparse and sparse settings. Theoretically,
we provide both non-asymptotic and asymptotic analysis in quantifying the
theoretical performances of ECA. Under the non-sparse setting, we show that
ECA's performance is highly related to the effective rank of the covariance
matrix. Under the sparse setting, the results are in two folds: (i) We show
that the sparse ECA estimator based on a combinatoric program attains the
optimal rate of convergence; (ii) Built upon some recent developments in
estimating sparse leading eigenvectors, we show that a computationally
efficient sparse ECA estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence under a
suboptimal scaling.
