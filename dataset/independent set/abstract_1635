In this paper we study Lifshitz tails for continuous Laplacian in a
continuous site percolation situation. By this we mean that we delete a random
set $\Gamma_\omega$ from $IR^d$ and consider the Dirichlet or Neumann Laplacian
on $D=IR^d\setminus\Gamma_\omega$. We prove that the integrated density of
states exhibits Lifshitz behavior at the bottom of the spectrum when we
consider Dirichlet boundary conditions, while when we consider Neumann boundary
conditions, it is bounded from below by a van Hove behavior. The Lifshitz tails
are proven independently of the percolation probability, whereas for the van
Hove case we need some assumption on the volume of the sets taken out as well
as on the percolation probability.
