In this paper we prove that all the existing conditional event algebras embed
into a three-valued extension of temporal logic of discrete past time, which
the contributors of this paper have proposed in anothe paper as a general model of
conditional events.
  First of all, we discuss the descriptive incompleteness of the cea's. In this
direction, we show that some important notions, like independence of
conditional events, cannot be properly addressed in the framework of
conditional event algebras, while they can be precisely formulated and analyzed
in the temporal setting.
  We also demonstrate that the embeddings allow one to use Markov chain
algorithms (suitable for the temporal calculus) for computing probabilities of
complex conditional expressions of the embedded conditional event algebras, and
that these algorithms can outperform those previously known.
