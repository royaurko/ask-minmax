Let G be a definably compact group in an o-minimal expansion of a real closed
field. We prove that if dim(G X) < dim G for some definable X subset of G then
X contains a torsion point of G. Along the way we develop a general theory for
so-called G-linear sets, and investigate definable sets which contain abstract
subgroups of G.
