We describe a class of theories obtained by fibering a Landau-Ginburg
orbifold over a compact Kaehler base. While such theories are often described
as phases of some GLSM, our description is independent of such an embedding. We
provide a method for computing the massless spectrum. This note is based on the
longer paper arXiv:1307.7063.
