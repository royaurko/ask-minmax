Realizing test scenarios through a tutoring system involve questions about
architecture and didactic methods in such a system. Observing the fact that
traditional tutoring systems normally are domain-static, this paper shows
investigations for a generic domain-independent tutoring system for utilizing
test scenarios in computer-based and web-based environments. Furthermore, test
paradigms are analyzed and it is presented an approach for realizing
functionality for applying test paradigms in the presented generic tutoring
system architecture by an XML-specified language.
