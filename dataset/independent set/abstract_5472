In this short paper, we consider the functional density on sets of uniformly
bounded triangulations with fixed sets of vertices. We prove that if a
functional attains its minimum on the Delaunay triangulation, for every finite
set in the plane, then for infinite sets the density of this functional attains
its minimum also on the Delaunay triangulations.
