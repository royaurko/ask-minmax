Motivated by problems modeling the spread of infections in networks, in this
paper we explore which bipartite graphs are most resilient to widespread
infections under various parameter settings. Namely, we study bipartite
networks with a requirement of a minimum degree $d$ on one side under an
independent infection, independent transmission model. We completely
characterize the optimal graphs in the case $d=1$, which already produces
non-trivial behavior, and we give some extremal results for the more general
cases. We also show that determining the subgraph of an arbitrary bipartite
graph most resilient to infection is NP-hard for any one-sided minimal degree
$d \ge 1$.
