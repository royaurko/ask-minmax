One of the simplest axiomatizations of a matroid is in terms of independent
sets. Curiously, no such independent set axiomatization is known for Gelfand
and Serganova's WP-matroids (which are ``Coxeter group analogues'' of
matroids). Here we state and prove such an axiomatization in the special case
of symplectic matroids. No prior knowledge of WP-matroids is assumed; we
believe the paper should be accessible and interesting to anyone with some
interest in matroids.
