In this paper, several aspects of the random noble means substitution are
studied. Beyond important dynamical facets as the frequency of subwords and the
computation of the topological entropy, the important issue of ergodicity is
addressed. From the geometrical point of view, we outline a suitable cut and
project setting for associated point sets and present results for the spectral
analysis of the diffraction measure.
