We investigate the large-time behavior of the solutions of the
two-dimensional Keller-Segel system in self-similar variables, when the total
mass is subcritical, that is less than 8\pi after a proper adimensionalization.
It was known from previous works that all solutions converge to stationary
solutions, with exponential rate when the mass is small. Here we remove this
restriction and show that the rate of convergence measured in relative entropy
is exponential for any mass in the subcritical range, and independent of the
mass. The proof relies on symmetrization techniques, which are adapted from a
paper of J.I. Diaz, T. Nagai, and J.-M. Rakotoson, and allow us to establish
uniform estimates for Lp norms of the solution. Exponential convergence is
obtained by the mean of a linearization in a space which is defined
consistently with relative entropy estimates and in which the linearized
evolution operator is self-adjoint. The core of proof relies on several new
spectral gap estimates which are of independent interest.
