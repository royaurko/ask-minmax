In this paper, we prove a differential analog of the Noether normalization
lemma.
  It states, that in a finitely generated integral differential $k$-algebra
($char$ $k = 0$) of differential transcendence degree~$d$ there are
differentially independent elements $b_1, \ldots, b_d$ such that, for every
prime differential ideal $\mathfrak{p} \subset A = k\{ b_1, \ldots, b_d\}$,
there exists a prime differential ideal $\mathfrak{q} \subset B$ such that
$\mathfrak{q} \cap A = \mathfrak{p}$.
  Moreover, the extension $A \subset B$ satisfies weakened versions of going-up
and going-down properties.
