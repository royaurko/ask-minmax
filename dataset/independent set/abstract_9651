The article treats the geometrical theory of partial differential equations
in the absolute sense, i.e., without any additional structures and especially
without any preferred choice of independent and dependent variables. The
equations are subject to arbitrary transformations of variables in the widest
possible sense. In this preparatory Part 1, the involutivity and the related
standard bases are investigated as a technical tool within the framework of
commutative algebra. The particular case of ordinary differential equations is
briefly mentioned in order to demonstrate the strength of this approach in the
study of the structure, symmetries and constrained variational integrals under
the simplifying condition of one independent variable. In full generality,
these topics will be investigated in subsequent Parts of this article.
