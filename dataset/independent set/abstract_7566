We present a preliminary account of a new global QCD analysis of DIS data,
including recent $\nu, \bar \nu$ DIS measurements. The model-independent cross
section reanalysis by CCFR allows a new determination of the strange sea
asymmetry, whose first moment is found to be small. The impact on the NuTeV
measurement of $\sin^2 \theta_W$ is discussed.
