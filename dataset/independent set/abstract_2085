We analyse a model consisting of a population of individuals which is
subdivided into a finite set of demes, each of which has a fixed but differing
number of individuals. The individuals can reproduce, die and migrate between
the demes according to an arbitrary migration network. They are haploid, with
two alleles present in the population; frequency independent selection is also
incorporated, where the strength and direction of selection can vary from deme
to deme. The system is formulated as an individual-based model, and the
diffusion approximation systematically applied to express it as a set of
nonlinear coupled stochastic differential equations. These can be made amenable
to analysis through the elimination of fast-time variables. The resulting
reduced model is analysed in a number of situations, including
migration-selection balance leading to a polymorphic equilibrium of the two
alleles, and an illustration of how the subdivision of the population can lead
to non-trivial behaviour in the case where the network is a simple hub. The
method we develop is systematic, may be applied to any network, and agrees well
with the results of simulations in all cases studied and across a wide range of
parameter values.
