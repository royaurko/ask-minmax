In a previous paper we formulated a set of necessary conditions for the
spherically symmetric weakly charged dust to avoid Big Bang/Big Crunch, shell
crossing and permanent central singularities. However, we did not discuss the
properties of the energy density, some of which are surprising and seem not to
have been known up to now. A singularity of infinite energy density does exist
-- it is a point singularity situated on the world line of the center of
symmetry. The condition that no mass shell collapses to $R = 0$ if it had $R >
0$ initially thus turns out to be still insufficient for avoiding a
singularity. Moreover, at the singularity the energy density $\epsilon$ is
direction-dependent: $\epsilon \to - \infty$ when we approach the singular
point along a $t =$ const hypersurface and $\epsilon \to + \infty$ when we
approach that point along the center of symmetry. The appearance of
negative-energy-density regions turns out to be inevitable. We discuss various
aspects of this property of our configuration. We also show that a permanently
pulsating configuration, with the period of pulsation independent of mass, is
possible only if there exists a permanent central singularity.
