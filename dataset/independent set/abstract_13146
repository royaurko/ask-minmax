Recent HST determinations of the expansion's rate of the Universe (the Hubble
constant, H_0) assumed that the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation at V and I
are independent of metallicity (Freedman, et al., 1996, Saha et al., 1996,
Tanvir et al., 1995). The three groups obtain different vales for H_0. We note
that most of this discrepancy stems from the asumption (by both groups) that
the Period-Luminosity relation is independent of metallicity. We come to this
conclusion as a result of our study of the Period-Luminosity relation of 481
Cepheids with 3 millions two colour measurements in the Large Magellanic Cloud
and the Small Magellanic Cloud obtained as a by-product of the EROS
microlensing survey. We find that the derived interstellar absorption
corrections are particularly sensitive to the metallicity and when our result
is applied to recent estimates based on HST Cepheids observations it makes the
low-H_0 values higher and the high-H_0 value lower, bringing those discrepant
estimates into agrement around $H_0 \approx 70 km/s Mpc^{-1}$.
