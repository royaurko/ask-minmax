We propose a background-independent formulation of cosmic inflation. The
inflation in this picture corresponds to a dynamical process to generate space
and time while the conventional inflation is simply an (exponential) expansion
of a preexisting spacetime owing to the vacuum energy carried by an inflaton
field. We observe that the cosmic inflation is triggered by the condensate of
Planck energy into vacuum responsible for the generation of spacetime and must
be a single event according to the exclusion principle of noncommutative
spacetime caused by the Planck energy condensate in vacuum. The emergent
spacetime picture admits a background-independent formulation so that the
inflation can be described by a conformal Hamiltonian system characterized by
an exponential phase space expansion without introducing any inflaton field as
well as an ad hoc inflation potential. This implies that the emergent spacetime
may incapacitate all the rationales to introduce the multiverse hypothesis.
