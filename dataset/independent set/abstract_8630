Applying results from partial difference sets, quadratic forms, and recent
results of Brouwer and Van Dam, we construct the first known amorphic
association scheme with negative Latin square type graphs and whose underlying
set is a non-elementary abelian 2-group. We give a simple proof of a result of
Hamilton that generalizes Brouwer's result. We use multiple distinct quadratic
forms to construct amorphic association schemes with a large number of classes.
