We demonstrate the proof of principle for a ternary adder using silicon
metal-on-insulator single electron transistors (SET). Gate dependent rectifying
behavior of a single electron transistor results in a robust three-valued
output as a function of the potential of the SET island. Mapping logical,
ternary inputs to the three gates controlling the potential of the SET island
allows us to perform complex, inherently ternary operations, on a single
transistor.
