We investigate the size of the distance set determined by two subsets of
finite dimensional vector spaces over finite fields. A lower bound of the size
is given explicitly in terms of cardinalities of the two subsets. As a result,
we improve upon the results by Rainer Dietmann. In the case that one of the
subsets is a product set, we obtain further improvement on the estimate.
