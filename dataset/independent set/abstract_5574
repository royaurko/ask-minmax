A closed set of a Euclidean space is said to be Chebyshev if every point in
the space has one and only one closest point in the set. Although the situation
is not settled in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, in 1932 Bunt showed that
in Euclidean spaces a closed set is Chebyshev if and only if the set is convex.
In this paper, from the more general perspective of Bregman distances, we show
that if every point in the space has a unique nearest point in a closed set,
then the set is convex. We provide two approaches: one is by nonsmooth
analysis; the other by maximal monotone operator theory. Subdifferentiability
properties of Bregman nearest distance functions are also given.
