In this paper we look at normed spaces of differentiable functions on compact
plane sets, including the spaces of infinitely differentiable functions
originally considered by Dales and Davie. For many compact plane sets the
classical definitions give rise to incomplete spaces. We introduce an
alternative definition of differentiability which allows us to describe the
completions of these spaces. We also consider some associated problems of
polynomial and rational approximation.
