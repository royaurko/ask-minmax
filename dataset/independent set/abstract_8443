We put a model structure on the category of categories internal to simplicial
sets whose weak equivalences are reflected by the nerve functor to bisimplicial
sets with Rezk's model structure. This model structure is shown to be Quillen
equivalent to Rezk's model structure, thus internal category are another model
for $(\infty,1)$-categories.
