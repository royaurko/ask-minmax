We observe that most known results of the form "v is not a finite-type
invariant" follow from two basic theorems. Among those invariants which are not
of finite type, we discuss examples which are "ft-independent" and examples
which are not. We introduce (n,q)-finite invariants, which are generalizations
of finite-type invariants based on Fox's (n,q) congruence classes of knots.
