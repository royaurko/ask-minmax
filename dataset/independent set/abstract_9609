The latest results from LHC searches for jets in association with missing
transverse energy place strong bounds on the scattering cross section of dark
matter. For the case of spin-dependent or momentum suppressed interactions
these limits seem to be superior to the bounds from direct detection
experiments. In this article, we show that loop contributions can significantly
alter this conclusion and boost direct detection bounds, whenever they induce
spin-independent interactions. This effect is most striking for tensor and
pseudotensor interactions, which induce magnetic and electric dipole moments at
loop level. For axialvector and anapole interactions a relevant contribution to
direct detection signals arises from loop-induced Yukawa-like couplings between
dark matter and quarks. We furthermore compare the resulting bounds to
additional constraints on these effective operators arising from indirect
searches and relic density requirements.
