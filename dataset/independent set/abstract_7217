It is known that each symmetric stable distribution in $R^d$ is related to a
norm on $R^d$ that makes $R^d$ embeddable in $L_p([0,1])$. In case of a
multivariate Cauchy distribution the unit ball in this norm corresponds is the
polar set to a convex set in $R^d$ called a zonoid. This work interprets
general stable laws using convex or star-shaped sets and exploits recent
advances in convex geometry in order to come up with new probabilistic results
for multivariate stable distributions. In particular, it provides expressions
for moments of the Euclidean norm of a stable vector, mixed moments and various
integrals of the density function. It is shown how to use geometric
inequalities in order to bound important parameters of stable laws. It is shown
that each symmetric stable laws appears as the limit for the sum of
sub-Gaussian laws and an estimate for the probability distance to a
sub-Gaussian law is given. Operations with convex sets induce the well-known
and new operations with stable vectors. Furthermore, covariation, regression
and orthogonality concepts for stable laws acquire geometric interpretations. A
similar collection of results is presented for one-sided stable laws.
