The study deals with a minimal energy problem over noncompact classes of
infinite dimensional vector measures in a locally compact space. The components
are positive measures (charges) satisfying certain normalizing assumptions and
supported by given closed sets (plates) with the sign +1 or -1 prescribed such
that oppositely signed sets are mutually disjoint, and the interaction matrix
for the charges corresponds to an electrostatic interpretation of a condenser.
For all positive definite kernels satisfying Fuglede's condition of consistency
between the weak* and strong topologies, sufficient conditions for the
existence of equilibrium measures are established and properties of their
uniqueness, vague compactness, and continuity are studied.
