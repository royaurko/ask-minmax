In Paper I in this series we constructed evolution equations for the complete
gauge-invariant linear perturbations of a time-dependent spherically symmetric
perfect fluid spacetime. A key application of this formalism is the interior of
a collapsing star. Here we derive boundary conditions at the surface of the
star, matching the interior perturbations to the well-known perturbations of
the vacuum Schwarzschild spacetime outside the star.
