We show that a slightly modified Breit-Wigner formula can successfully
describe the total cross section even for the broad resonances, from light
rho(770) to the heavy Z boson. In addition to mass, width, and branching
fraction, we include another resonance parameter that turns out to be directly
related to the pole residue phase. The new formula has two mathematically
equivalent forms: one with the pole, and the other with the Breit-Wigner
parameters.
