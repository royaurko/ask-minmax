By comparing the responses to an in-plane magnetic field near the
metal-insulator transition (MIT), we find that the observed MIT in Si MOSFETs
can be described by the non-perturbative Mott-Hubbard scenario. Interrelations
between independent measurables are uncovered and confirmed by replotting the
experimental data. A universal critical energy scale vanishing at the MIT is
extracted from the experimental data and the critical exponent found.
