We report on a measurement of D0-D0bar mixing and a search for CP violation
in the D0->K+K-, pi+pi- and K+-pi-+ channels. We use D0's coming from D*+
decays, so that the flavour of the D0 at production is tagged by the charge of
the pion that is also emitted. We also use an independent set of D0's coming
directly from the hadronization of the charm quark, but in this case the
flavour of the charmed meson is not known. We analyze events collected by the
BaBar experiment at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- collider, corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of 468 fb-1. We measure the mixing parameter value
to be yCP = [0.72 +- 0.18 (stat) +- 0.12 (syst)]%, and exclude the no-mixing
hypothesis at 3.3sigma significance. We find no evidence of CP violation,
observing DeltaY = [0.09 +- 0.26 (stat) +- 0.06 syst)]% which is consistent
with zero.
