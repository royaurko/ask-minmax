Certain power-counting non-renormalizable theories, including the most
general self-interacting scalar fields in four and three dimensions and
fermions in two dimensions, have a simplified renormalization structure. For
example, in four-dimensional scalar theories, 2n derivatives of the fields,
n>1, do not appear before the nth loop. A new kind of expansion can be defined
to treat functions of the fields (but not of their derivatives)
non-perturbatively. I study the conditions under which these theories can be
consistently renormalized with a reduced, eventually finite, set of independent
couplings. I find that in common models the number of couplings sporadically
grows together with the order of the expansion, but the growth is slow and a
reasonably small number of couplings is sufficient to make predictions up to
very high orders. Various examples are solved explicitly at one and two loops.
