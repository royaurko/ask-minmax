The crystal structure and oxygen stoichiometry in two-layer Na0.74CoO2 and
Na0.38CoO2 at room temperature are analyzed by powder neutron diffraction. Two
sets of diffraction data for each sample, taken at different incident neutron
wavelengths, lambda=1.1968 Angstroms and lambda=1.5403 Angstroms, are analyzed
simultaneously by the Rietveld method, allowing for the independent refinement
of all structural parameters. The fractional oxygen site occupancies are found
to be 1.01(1) for Na0.74CoO2 and 0.99(2) for Na0.38CoO2 respectively. These
results indicate that the oxygen content of these phases is stoichiometric to a
precision of 1 to 2%, and therefore the formal cobalt oxidation state is
determined solely by the sodium content. The analysis also reveals that both
types of sodium ions in the structure are in off-center distorted trigonal
prismatic geometry.
