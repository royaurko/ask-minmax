A formula for an average connectivity between cortical areas in mammals is
derived. Based on comparative neuroanatomical data, it is found, surprisingly,
that this connectivity is either only weakly dependent or independent of brain
size. It is discussed how this formula can be used to estimate the average
length of axons in white matter. Other allometric relations, such as cortical
patches and area sizes vs. brain size, are also provided. Finally, some
functional implications, with an emphasis on efficient cortical computation,
are discussed as well.
