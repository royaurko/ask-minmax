In this paper we investigate the Erd\"os/Falconer distance conjecture for a
natural class of sets statistically, though not necessarily arithmetically,
similar to a lattice. We prove a good upper bound for spherical means that have
been classically used to study this problem. We conjecture that a majorant for
the spherical means suffices to prove the distance conjecture(s) in this
setting. For a class of non-Euclidean distances, we show that this generally
cannot be achieved, at least in dimension two, by considering integer point
distributions on convex curves and surfaces. In higher dimensions, we link this
problem to the question about the existence of smooth well-curved hypersurfaces
that support many integer points.
