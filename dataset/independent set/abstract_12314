Consider an $n \times n$ non-Hermitian random matrix $M_n$ whose entries are
independent real random variables. Under suitable conditions on the entries, we
study the fluctuations of the entries of $f(M_n)$ as $n$ tends to infinity,
where $f$ is analytic on an appropriate domain. This extends the results for
symmetric random matrices to the non-Hermitian case.
