We prove an L^1 subsequence ergodic theorem for sequences chosen by
independent random selector variables, thereby showing the existence of
universally L^1-good sequences nearly as sparse as the set of squares. In the
process, we prove that a certain deterministic condition implies a weak maximal
inequality for a sequence of \ell^1 convolution operators.
