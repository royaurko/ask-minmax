The moduli space of (1,7)-polarized abelian surfaces with a level structure
was shown by Manolache and Schreyer to be rational with compactification a Fano
3-fold of genus 12 which is also a compactification of the variety of powersum
presentations of the Klein quartic curve. In this paper the possible
degenerations of the abelian surfaces are classified in terms of degenerations
of powersum presentations. In particular, the surface degenerations into
fourteen planes are recovered. These were independently discovered by Alfio
Marini using degenerations of twisted cubic curves.
