A unified account, from a pedagogical perspective, is given of the
longitudinal and transverse projective delta functions proposed by Belinfante
and of their relation to the Helmholtz theorem for the decomposition of a
three-vector field into its longitudinal and transverse components. It is
argued that the results are applicable to fields that are time-dependent as
well as fields that are time-independent.
