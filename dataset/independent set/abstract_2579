As a consequence of greenhouse forcing, all state of the art general
circulation models predict a positive temperature trend that is greater for the
troposphere than the surface. This predicted positive trend increases in value
with altitude until it reaches a maximum ratio with respect to the surface of
as much as 1.5 to 2.0 at about 200 to 400 hPa. However, the temperature trends
from several independent observational data sets show decreasing as well as
mostly negative values. This disparity indicates that the three models examined
here fail to account for the effects of greenhouse forcings.
