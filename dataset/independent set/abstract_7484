We have studied the free expansion of a Bose condensate in which both the
usual s-wave contact interaction and the dipole-dipole interaction contribute
considerably to the total interaction energy. We calculate corrections due to
dipolar forces to the expansion of such a condensate after release from a trap.
In the Thomas-Fermi limit, we find that the modifications are to lowest order
independent from the total number of atoms.
