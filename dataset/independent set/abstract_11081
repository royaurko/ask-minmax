The Lagrangian of pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector mesons is determined
by the explicit global chiral symmetry and hidden local chiral symmetry. There
are fourteen interacting terms up to the dimension-four of covariant
derivatives rather than the usual eleven interacting terms given in literature
from hidden local symmetry approach. There are only two independent parameters.
The three new terms are important in phenomenology.
