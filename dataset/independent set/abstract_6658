We study infinite two-player games where one of the players is unsure about
the set of moves available to the other player. In particular, the set of moves
of the other player is a strict superset of what she assumes it to be. We
explore what happens to sets in various levels of the Borel hierarchy under
such a situation. We show that the sets at every alternate level of the
hierarchy jump to the next higher level.
