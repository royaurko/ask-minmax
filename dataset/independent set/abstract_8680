A set of natural numbers will be called \emph{harmonic} if the reciprocals of
its elements form a divergent series. An ultrafilter of the natural numbers
will he called \emph{harmonic} if all each members are harmonic sets. The
harmonic ultrafilters are shown to constitute a compact semigroup under the
Glazer addition and its smallest ideal is obtained.
