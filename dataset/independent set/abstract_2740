It is shown that while entanglement remains a significant factor in
discriminating a set of mutually orthogonal entangled states perfectly by local
operations and classical communication (LOCC), entanglement content is not. In
particular, for a class of entangled multi-qubit states, the maximum number of
perfectly LOCC distinguishable orthogonal states is shown to be independent of
the average entanglement of the states, and the spatial configuration with
respect to which LOCC operations may be carried out. It is also pointed out
that the make-up of an ensemble, that is, whether it consists only of entangled
states or is a mix of both entangled and product states, determines the maximum
number of perfectly distinguishable states.
