We present a new set of generators for unitary maps over \otimes^n(C^2) which
differs from the traditional rotation-based generating set in that it uses a
single-parameter family of 1-qubit unitaries J(a), together with a single
2-qubit unitary controlled-Z.
  Each generator is implementable in the one-way model using only two qubits,
and this leads to both parsimonious and robust implementations of general
unitaries. As an illustration, we give an implementation of the controlled-U
family which uses only 14 qubits, and has a 2-colourable underlying
entanglement graph (known to yield robust entangled states).
