We calculate the perturbative value of the Free Energy in Lattice QCD in
three dimensions, up to three loops. Our calculation is performed using the
Wilson formulation for gluons in SU(N) gauge theories.
  The Free Energy is directly related to the average plaquette. To carry out
the calculation, we compute the coefficients involved in the perturbative
expansion of the Free Energy up to three loops, using an automated set of
procedures developed by us in Mathematica. The dependence on N is shown
explicitly in our results.
  For purposes of comparison, we also present the individual contributions from
every diagram. These have been obtained by means of two independent
calculations, in order to cross check our results.
