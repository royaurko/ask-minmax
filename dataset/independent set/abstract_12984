A revolution ring $R_{a,b}(\mathcal{S})$ in the Heisenberg group
$\mathfrak{H}$ is a domain bounded by two dilated images $D_a(\mathcal{S})$ and
$D_b(\mathcal{S})$, $0<a<b$, of a compact surface of revolution $\mathcal{S}$
embedded in $\mathfrak{H}$. We prove that the modulus of the family $\Gamma$ of
boundary connecting curves inside $R_{a,b}(\mathcal{S})$ is $$ {\rm
Mod}(\Gamma)=\pi^2(\log(b/a))^{-3} $$ and thus is independent of the surface
$\mathcal{S}$.
