This paper discusses a method for pipelining the calculation of CRC's, such
as ITU/CCITT CRC32, into a mostly feed-forward architecture. This method allows
several benefits such as independent scaling of circuit frequency and data
throughput. Additionally it allows calculation over packet tails (packet length
not a multiple of CRC input width). Finally it offers the ability to update a
CRC where a subset of data in the packet has changed.
