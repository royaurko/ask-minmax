For a very general class of probability distributions in disordered Ising
spin systems, in the thermodynamical limit, we prove the following property for
overlaps among real replicas. Consider the overlaps among s replicas. Add one
replica s+1. Then, the overlap q(a,s+1) between one of the first s replicas,
let us say a, and the added s+1 is either independent of the former ones, or it
is identical to one of the overlaps q(a,b), with b running among the first s
replicas, excluding a. Each of these cases has equal probability 1/s.
