Context. {\beta} Pictoris b is one of the most studied objects nowadays since
it was identified with VLT/NaCo as a bona-fide exoplanet with a mass of about 9
times that of Jupiter at an orbital separation of 8-9 AU. The link between the
planet and the dusty disk is unambiguously attested and this system provides an
opportunity to study the disk/planet interactions and to constrain formation
and evolutionary models of gas giant planets. Still, {\beta} Pictoris b had
never been confirmed with other telescopes so far. Aims. We aimed at an
independent confirmation using a different instrument. Methods. We retrieved
archive images from Gemini South obtained with the instrument NICI, which is
designed for high contrast imaging. The observations combine coronagraphy and
angular differential imaging and were obtained at three epochs in Nov. 2008,
Dec. 2009 and Dec. 2010. Results. We report the detection with NICI of the
planet {\beta} Pictoris b in Dec. 2010 images at a separation of 404 \pm 10 mas
and P A = 212.1 \pm 0.7{\deg} . It is the first time this planet is observed
with a telescope different than the VLT.
