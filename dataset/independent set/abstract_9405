We present a novel method of simulating wave effects in graphics using
ray--based renderers with a new function: the Wave BSDF (Bidirectional
Scattering Distribution Function). Reflections from neighboring surface patches
represented by local BSDFs are mutually independent. However, in many surfaces
with wavelength-scale microstructures, interference and diffraction requires a
joint analysis of reflected wavefronts from neighboring patches. We demonstrate
a simple method to compute the BSDF for the entire microstructure, which can be
used independently for each patch. This allows us to use traditional ray--based
rendering pipelines to synthesize wave effects of light and sound. We exploit
the Wigner Distribution Function (WDF) to create transmissive, reflective, and
emissive BSDFs for various diffraction phenomena in a physically accurate way.
In contrast to previous methods for computing interference, we circumvent the
need to explicitly keep track of the phase of the wave by using BSDFs that
include positive as well as negative coefficients. We describe and compare the
theory in relation to well understood concepts in rendering and demonstrate a
straightforward implementation. In conjunction with standard raytracers, such
as PBRT, we demonstrate wave effects for a range of scenarios such as
multi--bounce diffraction materials, holograms and reflection of high frequency
surfaces.
