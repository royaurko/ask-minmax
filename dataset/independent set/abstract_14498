Let $K$ be a polygonal knot in general position with vertex set $V$. A
\emph{generic quadrisecant} of $K$ is a line that is disjoint from the set $V$
and intersects $K$ in exactly four distinct points. We give an upper bound for
the number of generic quadrisecants of a polygonal knot $K$ in general
position. This upper bound is in terms of the number of edges of $K$.
