We study populations of agents evolving in fitness landscapes constructed
according to the rules of a modified NK model with a tunable amount of neutral
paths. In the `punctuated equilibrium' regime evolutionary events are
identified as jumps in the mean population fitness, and the statistics of these
jumps in an ensemble of independently evolving populations is analyzed. We show
that, for a wide range of landscapes parameters, the number of events in time t
is Poisson distributed, with the time parameter replaced by the logarithm of
time. This simple log-Poisson statistics likewise describes the number n of
records in any sequence of t independently generated random numbers. The
implications of this behavior for evolution dynamics are discussed.
