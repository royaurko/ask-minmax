We develop a metric and probabilistic theory for the Ostrogradsky
representation of real numbers, i.e., the expansion of a real number $x$ in the
following form: \begin{align*} x&= \sum_n\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{q_1q_2... q_n}=
&=\sum_n\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{g_1(g_1+g_2)...(g_1+g_2+...+g_n)}\equiv
\bO1(g_1,g_2,...,g_n,...), \end{align*} where $q_{n+1}>q_n\in\N$, $g_1=q_1$,
$g_{k+1}=q_{k+1}-q_k$. We compare this representation with the corresponding
one in terms of continued fractions.
  We establish basic metric relations (equalities and inequalities for ratios
of the length of cylindrical sets). We also compute the Lebesgue measure of
subsets belonging to some classes of closed nowhere dense sets defined by
characteristic properties of the $\bO1$-representation. In particular, the
conditions for the set $\Cset{V}$, consisting of real numbers whose
$\bO1$-symbols take values from the set $V \subset N$, to be of zero resp.
positive Lebesgue measure are found. For a random variable $\xi$ with
independent $\bO1$-symbols $g_n(\xi)$ we prove the theorem establishing the
purity of the distribution. In the case of singularity the conditions for such
distributions to be of Cantor type are also found.
