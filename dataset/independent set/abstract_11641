We report on detailed microscopy studies of graphene and few-layer-graphene
produced by mechanical exfoliation on various semi-conducting substrates. We
demonstrate the possibility to prepare and analyze graphene on (001)-GaAs,
manganese p-doped (001)-GaAs and InGaAs substrates. The morphology of graphene
on these substrates was investigated by scanning electron and atomic force
microscopy and compared to layers on silicon oxide. It was found that graphene
sheets strongly follow the texture of the sustaining substrates independent on
doping, polarity or roughness. Furthermore resist residues exist on top of
graphene after a lithographic step. The obtained results provide the
opportunity to research the graphene-substrate interactions.
