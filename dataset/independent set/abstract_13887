The $\sigma$-ideal $(v^0)$ is associated with the Silver forcing, see
\cite{bre}. Also, it constitutes the family of all completely doughnut null
sets, see \cite{hal}. We introduce segments and $*$-segments topologies, to
state some resemblances of $(v^0)$ to the family of Ramsey null sets. To
describe $add(v^0)$ we adopt a proof of Base Matrix Lemma. Consistent results
are stated, too. Halbeisen's conjecture $cov(v^0) = add(v^0)$ is confirmed
under the hypothesis $t= \min \{\cf (\frak c), r\} $. The hypothesis
$h=\omega_1$ implies that $(v^0)$ has the ideal type $(\frak c, \omega_1,\frak
c)$.
