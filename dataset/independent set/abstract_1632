A poset game is a two-player game played over a partially ordered set (poset)
in which the players alternate choosing an element of the poset, removing it
and all elements greater than it. The first player unable to select an element
of the poset loses. Polynomial time algorithms exist for certain restricted
classes of poset games, such as the game of Nim. However, until recently the
complexity of arbitrary finite poset games was only known to exist somewhere
between NC^1 and PSPACE. We resolve this discrepancy by showing that deciding
the winner of an arbitrary finite poset game is PSPACE-complete. To this end,
we give an explicit reduction from Node Kayles, a PSPACE-complete game in which
players vie to chose an independent set in a graph.
