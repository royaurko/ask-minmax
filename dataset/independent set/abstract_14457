Due to its fractal nature, much about the area of the Mandelbrot set $M$
remains to be understood. While a series formula has been derived by Ewing and
Schober to calculate the area of $M$ by considering its complement inside the
Riemann sphere, to date the exact value of this area remains unknown. This
paper presents new improved upper bounds for the area based on a parallel
computing algorithm and for the 2-adic valuation of the series coefficients in
terms of the sum-of-digits function.
