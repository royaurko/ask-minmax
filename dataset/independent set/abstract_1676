Over the last years the Tevatron Run-II has extended several limits on Higgs
boson masses and coupling which were pioneered during the LEP accelerator
operation between 1989 and 2000. Higgs boson searches will also be at the
forefront of research at the LHC. This review concisely discusses the
experimental constraints set by the CDF and D0 collaborations in summer 2010 at
the beginning of the LHC era. Model-independent and model-dependent limits on
Higgs boson masses and couplings have been set and interpretations are
discussed both in the Standard Model and in extended models. Recently, the
Tevatron has extended the excluded SM Higgs boson mass range (158-175 GeV)
beyond the LEP limit at 95% CL. The experimental sensitivities are estimated
for the completion of the Tevatron programme.
