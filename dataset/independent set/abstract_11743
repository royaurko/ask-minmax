It is pointed out that point defects on graphene are strongly correlated and
can not be treated as independent scatters. In particular, for large on-site
defect potential, it is shown that defects induce an impurity band with density
of state characterized by the Wigner semi-circle law. We find that the impurity
band enhances conductivity to the order of $4 e^2 /h $ and explains the absence
of strong localization. Furthermore,the impurity band supports ferromagnetism
with the induced magnetic moment approaching 1$\mu_B$ per defect in the limit
of infinite quasi-particle lifetime.
