We study the problem of interpolating all values of a discrete signal f of
length N when d<N values are known, especially in the case when the Fourier
transform of the signal is zero outside some prescribed index set J; these
comprise the (generalized) bandlimited spaces B^J. The sampling pattern for f
is specified by an index set I, and is said to be a universal sampling set if
samples in the locations I can be used to interpolate signals from B^J for any
J. When N is a prime power we give several characterizations of universal
sampling sets, some structure theorems for such sets, an algorithm for their
construction, and a formula that counts them. There are also natural
applications to additive uncertainty principles.
