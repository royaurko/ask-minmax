Overlap-free words are words over the binary alphabet $A=\{a, b\}$ that do
not contain factors of the form $xvxvx$, where $x \in A$ and $v \in A^*$. We
analyze the asymptotic growth of the number $u_n$ of overlap-free words of
length $n$ as $ n \to \infty$. We obtain explicit formulas for the minimal and
maximal rates of growth of $u_n$ in terms of spectral characteristics (the
lower spectral radius and the joint spectral radius) of certain sets of
matrices of dimension $20 \times 20$. Using these descriptions we provide new
estimates of the rates of growth that are within 0.4% and $0.03 %$ of their
exact values. The best previously known bounds were within 11% and 3%
respectively. We then prove that the value of $u_n$ actually has the same rate
of growth for ``almost all'' natural numbers $n$. This ``average'' growth is
distinct from the maximal and minimal rates and can also be expressed in terms
of a spectral quantity (the Lyapunov exponent). We use this expression to
estimate it. In order to obtain our estimates, we introduce new algorithms to
compute spectral characteristics of sets of matrices. These algorithms can be
used in other contexts and are of independent interest.
