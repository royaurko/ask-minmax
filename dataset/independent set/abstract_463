The propositional logic is generalized on the real numbers field. The logical
analog of the Bernoulli independent tests scheme is constructed. The variant of
the nonstandard analysis is adopted for the definition of the logical function,
which has all properties of the classical probability function. The logical
analog of the Large Number Law is deduced from properties of this function.
