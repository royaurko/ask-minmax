We describe a mathematical formalism and numerical algorithms for identifying
and tracking slowly mixing objects in nonautonomous dynamical systems. In the
autonomous setting, such objects are variously known as almost-invariant sets,
metastable sets, persistent patterns, or strange eigenmodes, and have proved to
be important in a variety of applications. In this current work, we explain how
to extend existing autonomous approaches to the nonautonomous setting. We call
the new time-dependent slowly mixing objects coherent sets as they represent
regions of phase space that disperse very slowly and remain coherent. The new
methods are illustrated via detailed examples in both discrete and continuous
time.
