New families of matroids are constructed in this note. These new fami- lies
are derived from the concept of linearly independent set family (LISF)
introduced by Eicker and Ewald [Linear Algebra and its Applications 388 (2004)
173-191]. The proposed construction generalizes in a natural way the well known
class of vectorial matroids over a ?field.
