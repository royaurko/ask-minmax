For a closed topological $n$--manifold $K$ and a map $p:K\to B$ inducing an
isomorphism $\pi_1(K)\to\pi_1(B)$, there is a canonicaly defined morphism
$b:H_{n+1}(B,K,\LL)\to \SS (K)$, where $\LL$ is the periodic simply-connected
surgery spectrum and $\SS (K)$ is the topological structure set. We construct a
refinement $a:H_{n+1}^{+}(B,K,\LL )\to \SS_{\varepsilon ,\delta }(K)$ in the
case when $p$ is $UV^1$, and we show that $a$ is bijective if $B$ is a
finite-dimensional compact metric ANR. Here, $H_{n+1}^{+}(B,K,\LL )\subset
H_{n+1}(B,K,\LL )$, and $\SS_{\varepsilon ,\delta }(K)$ is the controlled
structure set. We show that the Pedersen-Quinn-Ranicki controlled surgery
sequence is equivalent to the exact $\LL$-homology sequence of the map $p:K \to
B$, i.e. that $$H_{n+1}(B,\LL)\to H_{n+1}^{+}(B,K,\LL )\to H_n(K,\LL^{+})\to
H_n(B,\LL ), \ \LL^{+}\to \LL,$$ is the connected covering spectrum of $\LL$.
By taking for $B$ various stages of the Postnikov tower of $K$, one obtains an
interesting filtration of the controlled structure set.
