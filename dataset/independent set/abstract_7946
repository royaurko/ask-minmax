Tur\'an, Mitrinovi\'c-Adamovi\'c and Wilker type inequalities are deduced for
regular Coulomb wave functions. The proofs are based on a Mittag-Leffler
expansion for the regular Coulomb wave function, which may be of independent
interest. Moreover, some complete monotonicity results concerning the Coulomb
zeta functions and some interlacing properties of the zeros of Coulomb wave
functions are given.
