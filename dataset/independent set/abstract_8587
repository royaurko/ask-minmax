Generalizations of linear numeration systems in which the set of natural
numbers is recognizable by finite automata are obtained by describing an
arbitrary infinite regular language following the lexicographic ordering. For
these systems of numeration, we show that ultimately periodic sets are
recognizable. We also study the translation and the multiplication by constants
as well as the order dependence of the recognizability.
