In answer-set programming (ASP), the solutions of a problem are encoded in
dedicated models, called answer sets, of a logical theory. These answer sets
are computed from the program that represents the theory by means of an ASP
solver and returned to the user as sets of ground first-order literals. As this
type of representation is often cumbersome for the user to interpret, tools
like ASPVIZ and IDPDraw were developed that allow for visualising answer sets.
The tool Kara, introduced in this paper, follows these approaches, using ASP
itself as a language for defining visualisations of interpretations. Unlike
existing tools that position graphic primitives according to static coordinates
only, Kara allows for more high-level specifications, supporting graph
structures, grids, and relative positioning of graphical elements. Moreover,
generalising the functionality of previous tools, Kara provides modifiable
visualisations such that interpretations can be manipulated by graphically
editing their visualisations. This is realised by resorting to abductive
reasoning techniques. Kara is part of SeaLion, a forthcoming integrated
development environment (IDE) for ASP.
