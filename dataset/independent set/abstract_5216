We prove that for meromorphic maps with logarithmic tracts (e.g. entire or
meromorphic maps with a finite number of poles from class $\mathcal B$), the
Julia set contains a compact invariant hyperbolic Cantor set of Hausdorff
dimension greater than 1. Hence, the hyperbolic dimension of the Julia set is
greater than 1.
