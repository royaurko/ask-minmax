Let $\{X, X_n, n\geq 1\}$ be a sequence of independent identically
distributed non-degenerate random variables. Put $S_0=0, S_n = \sum^n_{i=1}
X_i$ and $V_n^2=\sum^n_{i=1} X_i^2, n\ge 1.$ A weak convergence theorem is
established for the self-normalized partial sums processes $\{S_{[nt]}/V_n,
0\le t\le 1\}$ when $X$ belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law
with index $\alpha \in (0,2]$. The respective limiting distributions of the
random variables ${\max_{1\le i\le n}|X_i|}/{S_n}$ and ${\max_{1\le i\le
n}|X_i|}/{V_n}$ are also obtained under the same condition.
