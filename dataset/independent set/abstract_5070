The AllWISE processing pipeline has measured motions for all objects detected
on WISE images taken between 2010 January and 2011 February. In this paper, we
discuss new capabilities made to the software pipeline in order to make motion
measurements possible, and we characterize the resulting data products for use
by future researchers. Using a stringent set of selection criteria, we find
22,445 objects that have significant AllWISE motions, of which 3,525 have
motions that can be independently confirmed from earlier 2MASS images yet lack
any published motions in SIMBAD. Another 58 sources lack 2MASS counterparts and
are presented as motion candidates only. Limited spectroscopic follow-up of
this list has already revealed eight new L subdwarfs. These may provide the
first hints of a "subdwarf gap" at mid-L types that would indicate the break
between the stellar and substellar populations at low metallicities (i.e., old
ages). Another object in the motion list -- WISEA J154045.67-510139.3 -- is a
bright (J ~ 9 mag) object of type M6; both the spectrophotometric distance and
a crude preliminary parallax place it ~6 pc from the Sun. We also compare our
list of motion objects to the recently published list of 762 WISE motion
objects from Luhman (2014). While these first large motion studies with WISE
data have been very successful in revealing previously overlooked nearby
dwarfs, both studies missed objects that the other found, demonstrating that
many other nearby objects likely await discovery in the AllWISE data products.
