A functional Menger $\cap$-algebra is a set of n-place functions containing n
projections and closed under the so-called Menger's compositions of n-place
functions and the set-theoretic intersection of functions. We give the abstract
characterization for these subsets of functional Menger $\cap$-algebras which
contain functions with fixed points.
