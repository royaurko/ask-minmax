The spectral density of random matrices is studied through a quaternionic
generalisation of the Green's function, which precisely describes the mean
spectral density of a given matrix under a particular type of random
perturbation. Exact and universal expressions are found in the high-dimension
limit for the quaternionic Green's functions of random matrices with
independent entries when summed or multiplied with deterministic matrices. From
these, the limiting spectral density can be accurately predicted.
