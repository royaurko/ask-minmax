In this paper we represent the $k$-th Riesz transform in the ultraspherical
setting as a principal value integral operator for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. We
also measure the speed of convergence of the limit by proving $L^p$-boundedness
properties for the oscillation and variation operators associated with the
corresponding truncated operators.
