Motivated by the recent experimental data of the E787, E949 and E865
collaborations and by the difference between the standard model (SM) prediction
and data, we consider in detail R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetric
contributions to K -> pi nu nubar. The theoretical cleaness of this decay
constitutes a useful way to provide constraints, independent of long distance
effects. Including the possiblity of interferences between one-loop R-parity
conserving (RPC) supersymmetry and tree-level RPV supersymmetric contributions,
our results allow to improve the limits on R-parity violating couplings with
respect to previous analyses.
