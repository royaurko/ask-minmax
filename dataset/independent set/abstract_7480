We find that multiple Andreev reflections mediating the transport in
superconducting point contacts are strongly affected by a small amount of
impurities in the area of the contact. We also argue that the model based on
Zener transitions within independent conducting channels is not suitable for
kinetic processes in multichannel contacts.
