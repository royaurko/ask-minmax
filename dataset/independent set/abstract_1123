The paper is discussing infinite divisibility in the setting of
operator-valued boolean, free and, more general, c-free independences.
Particularly, using Hilbert bimodules and non-commutative functions techniques,
we obtain analogues of the Levy-Hincin integral representation for infinitely
divisible real measures.
