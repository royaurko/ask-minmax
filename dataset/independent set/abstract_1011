Let X be an infinite set of regular cardinality. We determine all clones on X
which contain all almost unary functions. It turns out that independently of
the size of X, these clones form a countably infinite descending chain.
Moreover, all such clones are finitely generated over the unary functions. In
particular, we obtain an explicit description of the only maximal clone in this
part of the clone lattice. This is especially interesting if X is countably
infinite, in which case it is known that such a description cannot be obtained
for the second maximal clone over the unary functions.
