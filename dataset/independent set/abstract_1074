We provide a study of the supersymmetric Adler--Bardeen anomaly in the $\N=1,
d=4,6,10$ super-Yang--Mills theories. We work in the component formalism that
includes shadow fields, for which Slavnov--Taylor identities can be
independently set for both gauge invariance and supersymmetry. We find a method
with improved descent equations for getting the solutions of the consistency
conditions of both Slavnov--Taylor identities and finding the local field
polynomials for the standard Adler--Bardeen anomaly and its supersymmetric
counterpart. We give the explicit solution for the ten-dimensional case.
