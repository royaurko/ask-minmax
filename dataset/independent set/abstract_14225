In this paper we adapt the technique developed in [17] to show that many
harmonic analysis operators in the Bessel setting, including maximal operators,
Littlewood-Paley-Stein type square functions, multipliers of Laplace or
Laplace-Stieltjes transform type and Riesz transforms are, or can be viewed as,
Calder\'on-Zygmund operators for all possible values of type parameter
$\lambda$ in this context. This extends the results obtained recently in [7],
which are valid only for a restricted range of $\lambda$.
