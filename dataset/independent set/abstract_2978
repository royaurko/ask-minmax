We consider gravity in three dimensions with an arbitrary number of curvature
corrections. We show that such corrections are always functions of only three
independent curvature invariants. Demanding the existence of a holographic
c-theorem we show how to fix the coefficients in the action for an arbitrarily
high order, recovering the new massive gravity lagrangian at quadratic order.
We calculate the central charge $c$ and show that using Cardy's formula it
matches the entropy of black hole solutions, which we construct. We also
consider fluctuations about an AdS background, and find that it is possible to
obtain two derivative equations by imposing a single constraint, thereby
lifting the pathologic massive modes of new massive gravity. If we do not
impose this, there is a set of ghosty massive modes propagating in the bulk.
However, at $c=0$ these become massless and it is expected that these theories
encode the dynamics of the spin two sector of strongly coupled logarithmic
CFT's.
