We study various dynamical properties of the weakly pinned Wigner crystal in
a high magnetic field. Using a Gaussian variational method we can compute the
full frequency and field dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the
diagonal and Hall conductivities. The zero temperature Hall resistivity is
independent of frequency and remains unaffected by disorder at its classical
value. We show that, depending on the inherent length scales of the system, the
pinning peak and the threshold electric field exhibit strikingly different
magnetic field dependences.
