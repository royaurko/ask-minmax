We analyze fluctuation-dissipation relations in the Backgammon model: a
system that displays glassy behavior at zero temperature due to the existence
of entropy barriers. We study local and global fluctuation relations for the
different observables in the model. For the case of a global perturbation we
find a unique negative fluctuation-dissipation ratio that is independent of the
observable and which diverges linearly with the waiting time. This result
suggests that a negative effective temperature can be observed in glassy
systems even in the absence of thermally activated processes.
