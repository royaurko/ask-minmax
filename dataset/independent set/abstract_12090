We consider a periodically gated two-dimensional electron system, with a
central gate finger biased independently creating a tunable plasmonic cavity in
a planar plasmonic crystal. We demonstrate that the plasmons resonantly excited
in the periodic plasmonic lattice by incident terahertz radiation can strongly
pump the cavity plasmon modes leading to a deep sub-wavelength concentration of
terahertz energy with giant electric field enhancement factor up to 10000.
