We propose a definition for the entropy of capacities defined on lattices.
Classical capacities are monotone set functions and can be seen as a
generalization of probability measures. Capacities on lattices address the
general case where the family of subsets is not necessarily the Boolean lattice
of all subsets. Our definition encompasses the classical definition of Shannon
for probability measures, as well as the entropy of Marichal defined for
classical capacities. Some properties and examples are given.
