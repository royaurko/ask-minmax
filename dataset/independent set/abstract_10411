The dynamical hysteresis is studied in the kinetic Ising model in the
presence of a sinusoidal magnetic field both by Monte Carlo simulation and by
solving the dynamical meanfield equation for the averaged magnetisation. The
frequency variations of the dynamic coercive field are studied below the
critical temperature. In both the cases, it shows a power law frequency
variation however it becomes frequency independent in the low frequency regime
for the meanfield case.
