Motivated by neutron scattering experiments in the high-$T_c$ cuprates, we
propose the two-component spin-fermion model as a minimal phenomenological
model which has both local spins and itinerant fermions as independent degrees
of freedom. Our calculations of the dynamic spin correlation function provide a
successful description of the puzzling neutron experiment data and show that:
(1) the upward dispersion branch of magnetic excitations is mostly due to the
local spin excitations; (2) the downward dispersion branch is from collective
particle-hole excitations of fermions; and (3) the resonance mode is a mixture
of both degrees of freedom. Using the same model with the same set of
parameters we calculated the renormalized quasiparticle dispersion and
successfully reproduced one of the key features of the angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, i.e., the high energy kink
structure in the fermion quasiparticle dispersion, hence further support the
two component spin-fermion phenomenology.
