In studying the enumerative theory of super characters' of the group of upper
triangular matrices over a finite field we found that the moments (mean,
variance and higher moments) of novel statistics on set partitions have simple
closed expressions as linear combinations of shifted bell numbers. It is shown
here that families of other statistics have similar moments. The coefficients
in the linear combinations are polynomials in $n$. This allows exact
enumeration of the moments for small $n$ to determine exact formulae for all
$n$.
