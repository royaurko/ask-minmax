Motivated by the statistical evaluation of complex computer models, we deal
with the issue of objective prior specification for the parameters of Gaussian
processes. In particular, we derive the Jeffreys-rule, independence Jeffreys
and reference priors for this situation, and prove that the resulting posterior
distributions are proper under a quite general set of conditions. A proper flat
prior strategy, based on maximum likelihood estimates, is also considered, and
all priors are then compared on the grounds of the frequentist properties of
the ensuing Bayesian procedures. Computational issues are also addressed in the
paper, and we illustrate the proposed solutions by means of an example taken
from the field of complex computer model validation.
