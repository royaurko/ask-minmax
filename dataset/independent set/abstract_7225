Let us call subdivision {\it good}, if 1) set corresponding to each symbol is
convex (i.e. interval or (semi)closed interval). 2) If points $A$ and $B$
corresponds to the some color and interval $(A,B)$ has discontinuity point,
then $f(A)$ and $f(B)$ has different color. Every subdivision can be further
divided into good subdivision, old superword can be obtained from new one by
gluing letters. Hence in the section ``Equivalence of the set of uniformly
recurrent words generated by piecewise-continuous transformation to the set of
words generated by interval exchange transformation'' one can consider only
good subdivision.
