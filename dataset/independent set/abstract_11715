We describe 12 measurements in the 4th detector that yield particle
identification information. Seven of these have been demonstrated with test
beam data from the DREAM collaboration, one demonstrated in cosmic muon test
data, one verified in ILCroot, and the remaining three will be tested in
ILCroot. Not all are independent, but as a whole they cover all partons of the
standard model.
