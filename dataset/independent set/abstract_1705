We investigate the prospects for reconstructing the mass, spin-independent
and spin-dependent cross-sections of Dark Matter particles with a combination
of future direct detection experiments such as XENON1T, and the IceCube
neutrino telescope in the 86-string configuration including the DeepCore array.
We quantify the degree of complementarity between the two experiments by
adopting realistic values for their exposure, energy threshold and resolution.
Starting from benchmark models arising from a supersymmetric model with 25 free
parameters, we show that despite the stringent constraints set by the run with
79 strings, IceCube can help break the degeneracies in the Dark Matter
cross-section parameter space, even in the unfortunate case where it fails to
discover high energy neutrinos from the Sun. We also discuss how the
reconstruction of the Dark Matter particle parameters from the combined data
sets is affected by the uncertainties associated with the nuclear structure of
the target material in case of spin-dependent scattering and those associated
with astrophysical quantities such as the Dark Matter density and velocity
distribution.
