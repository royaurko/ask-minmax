It is shown that it is possible to perform a model-independent extraction of
the CKM Unitarity Triangle angle $\gamma$ using only the decays $B^0\to D
K^+\pi^-$ with $D\to K^0_S\pi^+\pi^-$ and $B^0\to D K^+\pi^-$ with
flavour-specific $D$ decays. The proposed method can also utilise the $B^0\to D
K^+\pi^-$ data with CP-eigenstate decays of the D meson in a model-independent
way.
