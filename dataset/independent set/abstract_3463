Suppose we are interested in the mean of an outcome variable missing not at
random. Suppose however that one has available an {\it ancillary variable},
which is associated with the outcome but independent of the missingness process
conditional on covariates and the possibly unobserved outcome. Such an
ancillary variable may be a proxy or a mismeasured version of the outcome
available for all individuals. We have previously established necessary and
sufficient conditions for identification of the full data law in such setting,
and have described various semiparametric estimators including a doubly robust
estimator of the outcome mean. Here, we extend these results and we propose two
alternative doubly robust estimators for the outcome mean. The estimators can
be viewed as extensions of analogous methods under missing at random, but enjoy
different properties.
