We propose and constrain with the latest observational data three
parameterizations of the deceleration parameter, valid from the matter era to
the far future. They are well behaved and do not diverge at any redshift. On
the other hand, they are model independent in the sense that in constructing
them the only assumption made was that the Universe is homogeneous and
isotropic at large scales.
