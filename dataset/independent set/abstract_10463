We studied Li intercalated carbon nanotube ropes by using first principles
methods. Our results show charge transfer between Li and C and small structural
deformation of nanotube due to intercalation. Both inside of nanotube and the
interstitial space are susceptible for intercalation. The Li intercalation
potential of SWNT rope is comparable to that of graphite and almost independent
of Li density up to around LiC$_2$, as observed in recent experiments. This
density is significantly higher than that of Li intercalated graphite, making
nanorope to be a promising candidate for anode material in battery
applications.
