The normalization factor in the star-triangle relation can be evaluated in a
simple form by taking determinants. If we combine this with the rotation
symmetries, then we can show that a certain simple quantity $I$ has to be
independent of the rapidities. In this sense it is an invariant. We evaluate it
for several particular models and find it is one for self-dual models, and is
related to the modulus $k$ (or $k'$) for the Ising, Kashiwara-Miwa and chiral
Potts models.
