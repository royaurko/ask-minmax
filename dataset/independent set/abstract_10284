Radial O/H abundance gradients derived from HII regions, hot stars and
planetary nebulae are combined with [Fe/H] gradients from open cluster stars in
order to derive an independent [O/Fe] x [Fe/H] relation for the galactic disk.
A comparison of the obtained relation with recent observational data and
theoretical models suggests that the [O/Fe] ratio is not higher than [O/Fe] ~
0.4, at least within the metallicity range of the considered samples.
