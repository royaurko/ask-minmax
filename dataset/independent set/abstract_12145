It has been shown recently that the limit moments of $W(n)=B(n)B^{*}(n)$,
where B(n) is a product of $p$ independent rectangular random matrices, are
certain homogenous polynomials in the asymptotic dimensions of these matrices.
Using the combinatorics of noncrossing partitions, we explicitly determine
these polynomials and show that they are closely related to polynomials which
can be viewed as multivariate Fuss-Narayana polynomials. Using this result, we
compute the moments of the n-fold free multiplicative convolution of
Marchenko-Pastur distributions with arbitrary shape parameters.
