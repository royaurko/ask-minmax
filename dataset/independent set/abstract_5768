Some new results on magnetic dipole (M1) transitions in heavy quarkonium from
nonrelativistic effective field theories of QCD are briefly reported. This
model-independent approach not only facilitates a systematic and lucid way to
investigate the relativistic corrections, it also clarifies some inconsistent
treatment in previous potential model approach. The impact of our formalism on
J/Psi -> eta_c gamma, Upsilon(Upsilon') -> eta_b gamma and h_c -> chi_{c0}
gamma are discussed.
