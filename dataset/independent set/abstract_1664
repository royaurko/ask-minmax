Wurdi Youang is an egg-shaped Aboriginal stone arrangement in Victoria,
Australia. Here we present a new survey of the site, and show that its major
axis is aligned within a few degrees of east-west. We confirm a previous
hypothesis that it contains alignments to the position on the horizon of the
setting sun at the equinox and the solstices, and show that two independent
sets of indicators are aligned in these directions. We show that these
alignments are unlikely to have arisen by chance, and instead the builders of
this stone arrangement appear to have deliberately aligned the site on
astronomically significant positions.
