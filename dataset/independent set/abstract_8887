T. Mostowski showed that every (real or complex) germ of an analytic set is
homeomorphic to the germ of an algebraic set. In this paper we show that every
(real or complex) analytic function germ, defined on a possibly singular
analytic space, is topologically equivalent to a polynomial function germ
defined on an affine algebraic variety.
