We explore some important implications of the KamLAND measurment on the
lepton flavor mixing matrix $V$ and the neutrino mass matrix $M$. The
model-independent constraints on nine matrix elements of $V$ are obtained to a
reasonable degree of accuracy. We find that nine two-zero textures of $M$ are
compatible with current experimental data, but two of them are only marginally
allowed. Instructive predictions are given for the absolute neutrino masses,
Majorana phases of CP violation, effective masses of the tritium beta decay and
neutrinoless double beta decay.
