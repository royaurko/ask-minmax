We study the spectra of scalar and vector mesons in four dimensional strongly
coupled SQCD-like theories in the Veneziano limit. The gauge theories describe
the low energy dynamics of intersecting D3 and D7-branes on the singular and
deformed conifold and their strong coupling regime can be explored by means of
dual fully backreacted supergravity backgrounds. The mesons we focus on are
dual to fluctuations of the worldvolume gauge field on a probe D7-brane in
these backgrounds. As we will comment in detail, the general occurrence of
various UV pathologies in the D3-D7 set-ups under study, forces us to adapt the
standard holographic recipes to theories with intrinsic cutoffs. Just as for
QED, the low energy spectra for mesonic-like bound states will be consistent
and largely independent of the UV cutoffs. We will study in detail how these
spectra vary with the number of the fundamental sea flavors and their mass.
