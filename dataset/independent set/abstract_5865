Corresponding to $n$ independent non-negative random variables $X_1,...,X_n$,
are values $M_1,...,M_n$, where each $M_i$ is the expected value of the maximum
of $n$ independent copies of $X_i$. We obtain an upper bound to the expected
value of the maximum of $X_1,...,X_n$ in terms of $M_1,...,M_n$. This
inequality is sharp in the sense that the quantity and its bound can be made as
close to each other as we want. We also present related comparison results.
