The stability number of a graph G, is the cardinality of a stable set of
maximum size in G. If the stability number of G remains the same upon the
addition of any edge, then G is called $\alpha ^{+}$-stable. G is a
K\"{o}nig-Egervary graph if its order equals the sum of its stability number
and the cardinality of a maximum matching. In this paper we characterize
$\alpha ^{+}$-stable K\"{o}nig-Egervary graphs, generalizing some previously
known results on bipartite graphs and trees. Namely, we prove that a
K\"{o}nig-Egervary graph is $\alpha ^{+}$-stable if and only if either the set
of vertices belonging to no maximum stable set is empty, or the cardinality of
this set equals one, and G has a perfect matching. Using this characterization
we obtain several new findings on general K\"{o}nig-Egervary graphs, for
example, the equality between the cardinalities of the set of vertices
belonging to all maximum stable sets and the set of vertices belonging to no
maximum stable set of G is a necessary and sufficient condition for a
K\"{o}nig-Egervary graph G to have a perfect matching.
