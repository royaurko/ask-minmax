We present VLT UVES echelle spectrophotometry of the Orion nebula in the 3100
to 10400 A range. We have measured the intensity of 555 emission lines, many of
them corresponding to permitted lines of different heavy-element ions. This is
the largest set of spectral emission lines ever obtained for a Galactic or
extragalactic HII region. We have derived He+, C++, O+, O++ and Ne++ abundances
from pure recombination lines. This is the first time that O+ and Ne++
abundances are obtained from this kind of lines in the nebula. We have also
derived abundances from collisionally excited lines for a large number of ions
of different elements. In all cases, ionic abundances obtained from
recombination lines are larger than those derived from collisionally excited
lines. We have obtained remarkably consistent independent estimations of the
temperature fluctuations parameter, t2, from different methods, which are also
similar to other estimates from the literature. This result strongly suggests
that moderate temperature fluctuations -t2 between 0.02 and 0.03- are present
in the Orion nebula. We have compared the chemical composition of the nebula
with those of the Sun and other representative objects. The heavy element
abundances in the Orion nebula are only slightly higher than the solar ones, a
difference that can be explained by the chemical evolution of the solar
vicinity.
