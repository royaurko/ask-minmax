We explore the fluorescence signals from a pair of atoms driven towards
Rydberg states on a three-level ladder transition. The dipole--dipole
interactions between Rydberg excited atoms significantly distort the dark state
and electromagnetically induced transparency behavior observed with independent
atoms and, thus, their steady state light emission. We calculate and analyze
the temporal correlations between intensities and amplitudes of the signals
emitted by the atoms and explain their origin in the atomic Rydberg state
interactions.
