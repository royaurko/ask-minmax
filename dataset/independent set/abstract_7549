We investigate the impact of instantons on scalar glueball properties in a
largely model-independent analytical approach based on the instanton-improved
operator product expansion (IOPE) of the $0^{++}$ glueball correlator. The
instanton contributions turn out to be dominant, to substantially improve the
consistency of the correponding QCD sum rules, and to increase the glueball
residue about fivefold.
