In Cooperative Games with Externalities when the members of a set S \subset N
of agents wish to deviate they need to calculate their worth. This worth
depends on what the non-members (outsiders) N \setminus S will do, which in
turn depends on which coalition structure the outsiders will form. Since this
coalition formation problem is NP-hard, various approaches have been adopted.
In this paper using an evolutionary game theoretic approach we provide a set of
equations that can help agents in S reason about the coalition structures the
outsiders may form in terms of minimum distances on an n-s dimensional space,
where n=|N|, s=|S|.
