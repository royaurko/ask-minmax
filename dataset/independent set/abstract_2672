Electronic structures of the zigzag bilayer graphite nanoribbons(Z-BGNR) with
various ribbon width $N$ are studied within the tight binding approximation.
Neglecting the inter-layer hopping amplitude $\gamma_4$, which is an order of
magnitude smaller than the other inter-layer hopping parameters $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_3$, there exist two fixed Fermi points $\pm k^*$ independent of the
ribbon width with the peculiar energy dispersion near $k^*$ as $\ve (k) \sim
\pm (k-k^*)^N$. By investigating the edge states of the Z-BGNR, we notice that
the trigonal warping of the bilayer graphene sheets are reflected on in the
edge state structure. With the inclusion of $\gamma_4$, the above two Fermi
points are not fixed, but drift toward the vicinity of the Dirac point with the
increase of the width $N$ as shown by the finite scaling method and the
peculiar dispersions change to the parabolic ones. The edge magnetism of the
Z-BGNR is also examined by solving the half-filled Hubbard Hamiltonian for the
ribbon using the Hartree-Fock approximation. We have shown that within the same
side of the edges, the edge spins are aligned ferromagnetically for the
experimentally relevant set of parameters.
