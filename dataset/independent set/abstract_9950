A positive integer is expressed as a sum of squares of positive integers in a
unique way applying a special technique. The expression, thus obtained is
resolved into two factors using the concept of the Clifford algebra. This
technique is applied on a set of positive integers. Using these factors, a new
mean of the set of integers, different from the arithmetic mean, is developed.
A detailed discussion involving Cl(0,3) as an example is presented. The new
mean bears the imprint of degree of randomness of the data set. More random is
the data set more away is the new mean from the arithmetic mean. It is
suggested that this averaging technique may be useful in signal and image
processing with some special gain.
