Observations with interferometric gravitational-wave detectors result in
probability sky maps that are multimodal and spread over 10-100 deg^2. We
present a scheme for maximizing the probability of imaging optical counterparts
to gravitational-wave transients given limited observing resources. Our
framework is capable of coordinating many telescopes with different fields of
view and limiting magnitudes. We present a case study comparing three different
planning algorithms. We find that, with the network of telescopes that was used
in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo science run, a relatively straightforward
coordinated approach doubles the detection efficiency relative to each
telescope observing independently.
