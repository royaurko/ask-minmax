We study the relationship between the sigma-ideal generated by closed measure
zero sets and the ideals of null and meager sets. We show that the additivity
of the ideal of closed measure zero sets is not bigger than covering for
category. As a consequence we get that the additivity of the ideal of closed
measure zero sets is equal to the additivity of the ideal of meager sets.
