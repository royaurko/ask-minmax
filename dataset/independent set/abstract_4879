By means of a model-independent analysis, we discuss the constraints on
anomalous trilinear gauge-boson couplings that can be obtained from the study
of electron-positron annihilation into $W$ pairs at LC with \sqrt{s}=0.5 TeV
and 1 TeV. We consider the general CP conserving anomalous effective
Lagrangian, as well as some specific models with reduced number of independent
couplings. The analysis is based on combinations of observables with initial
and final state polarizations, that allow to separately constrain the different
couplings and to improve the corresponding numerical bounds.
