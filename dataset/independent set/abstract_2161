A common experimental strategy for demonstrating non-classical correlations
is to show violation of a Bell inequality by measuring a continuously emitted
stream of entangled photon pairs. The measurements involve the detection of
photons by two spatially separated parties. The detection times are recorded
and compared to quantify the violation. The violation critically depends on
determining which detections are coincident. Because the recorded detection
times have "jitter", coincidences cannot be inferred perfectly. In the presence
of settings-dependent timing errors, this can allow a local-realistic system to
show apparent violation--the so-called "coincidence loophole". Here we
introduce a family of Bell inequalities based on signed, directed distances
between the parties' sequences of recorded timetags. Given that the timetags
are recorded for synchronized, fixed observation periods and that the settings
choices are random and independent of the source, violation of these
inequalities unambiguously shows non-classical correlations violating local
realism. Distance-based Bell inequalities are generally useful for two-party
configurations where the effective size of the measurement outcome space is
large or infinite. We show how to systematically modify the underlying Bell
functions to improve the signal to noise ratio and to quantify the significance
of the violation.
