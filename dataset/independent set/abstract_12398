We develop the necessary tools for computing fluctuations around a mean-field
background in the context of SU(N) lattice gauge theories in five dimensions.
In particular, expressions for the scalar observable and the Wilson Loop are
given. As an application, using these observables we compute a certain quantity
k5 that can be viewed as Coulomb's constant in five dimensions. We show that
this quantity becomes independent of N in the large N limit. Furthermore, the
numerical value of k5 we find for SU(infinity) deviates by 17% from its value
predicted by holography.
