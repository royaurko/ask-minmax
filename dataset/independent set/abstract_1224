The different sets of PDF with the new form of t-dependence of generalized
parton distributions (GPDs) were examined in the descriptions of the
electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron. One of the purposes was
to minimize the number of fitting parameters. We found that main flavor
difference related to the spin-dependent of PDF incoming as part in GPDs.
Hence, contrary to some other work, our result shows a little flavor dependence
of the t-dependence of the $GPDs(x,t,\xi=0$).
