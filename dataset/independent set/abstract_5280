In this paper, we improve the known estimates for the invariance entropy of a
nonlinear control system. For sets of complete approximate controllability we
derive an upper bound in terms of Lyapunov exponents and for uniformly
hyperbolic sets we obtain a similar lower bound. Both estimates can be applied
to hyperbolic chain control sets, and we prove that under mild assumptions they
can be merged into a formula.
