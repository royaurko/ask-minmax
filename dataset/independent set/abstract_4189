We have discovered a new, forerunning mode transition as the periodic
transition wave propagating in a uniform continuous waveguide. The latter is
represented by an elastic beam separating from the elastic foundation under the
action of sinusoidal waves. The critical displacement is the separation
criterion. We show that the steady-state separation mode, where the separation
front speed is independent of the wave amplitude, exists only in a bounded
speed-dependent range of the wave amplitude. As the latter exceeds the critical
value the steady-state mode is replaced by a more complicated regime with
porous-like local separations emerging at a distance ahead of the main
transition front. The crucial feature of this simple model is that the wave
group speed is greater than the phase speed. The analytical solution allows us
to show in detail how the steady-state mode transforms into the forerunning
one. The established forerunning mode studied numerically manifests itself as a
periodic process. As the incident wave amplitude grows the period decreases,
while the separation front speed averaged over the period increases to the
group velocity of the wave. In addition, the complete set of relations is
presented for the waves excited by the oscillating force moving along the free
beam, including the resonant case corresponding to a certain relation between
the load's speed and frequency.
