This report describes a new version of the OntoSpec methodology for ontology
building. Defined by the LaRIA Knowledge Engineering Team (University of
Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France), OntoSpec aims at helping builders to
model ontological knowledge (upstream of formal representation). The
methodology relies on a set of rigorously-defined modelling primitives and
principles. Its application leads to the elaboration of a semi-informal
ontology, which is independent of knowledge representation languages. We
recently enriched the OntoSpec methodology by endowing it with a new resource,
the DOLCE top-level ontology defined at the LOA (IST-CNR, Trento, Italy). The
goal of this integration is to provide modellers with additional help in
structuring application ontologies, while maintaining independence
vis-\`{a}-vis formal representation languages. In this report, we first provide
an overview of the OntoSpec methodology's general principles and then describe
the DOLCE re-engineering process. A complete version of DOLCE-OS (i.e. a
specification of DOLCE in the semi-informal OntoSpec language) is presented in
an appendix.
