Extending a method of D. Wolke, we establish a general result on the large
sieve with sparse sets S of moduli which are in a sense well-distributed in
arithmetic progressions. We then apply our result to the case when S consists
of sqares. In this case we obtain an estimate which improves a recent result by
L. Zhao.
