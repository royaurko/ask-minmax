We show that any Pisot substitution on a finite alphabet is conjugate to a
primitive proper substitution (satisfying then a coincidence condition) whose
incidence matrix has the same eigenvalues as the original one, with possibly 0
and 1. Then, we prove also substitutive systems sharing this property and
admitting "enough" multiplicatively independent eigenvalues (like for
unimodular Pisot substitutions) are measurably conjugate to domain exchanges in
Euclidean spaces which factorize onto minimal translations on tori. The
combination of these results generalizes a well-known result of Arnoux-Ito to
any unimodular Pisot substitution.
