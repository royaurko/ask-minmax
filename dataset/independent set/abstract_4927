In investigation of boundary-value problems for certain partial differential
equations arising in applied mathematics, we often need to study the solution
of system of partial differential equations satisfied by hypergeometric
functions and find explicit linearly independent solutions for the system. Here
we choose the Exton function $K_{2}$ among his 21 functions to show how to find
the linearly independent solutions of partial differential equations satisfied
by this function $K_{2}$. Based upon the classical derivative and integral
operators we introduce a new operational images for hypergeometric function
$K_{2}$. By means of these operational images a number of finite series and
decomposition formulas are then fund.
