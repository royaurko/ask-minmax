Matching markets play a prominent role in economic theory. A prime example of
such a market is the sponsored search market. Here, as in other markets of that
kind, market equilibria correspond to feasible, envy free, and bidder optimal
outcomes. For settings without budgets such an outcome always exists and can be
computed in polynomial-time by the so-called Hungarian Method. Moreover, every
mechanism that computes such an outcome is incentive compatible. We show that
the Hungarian Method can be modified so that it finds a feasible, envy free,
and bidder optimal outcome for settings with budgets. We also show that in
settings with budgets no mechanism that computes such an outcome can be
incentive compatible for all inputs. For inputs in general position, however,
the presented mechanism---as any other mechanism that computes such an outcome
for settings with budgets---is incentive compatible.
