Final results of a detailed analysis of p+p elastic scattering data are
presented, utilizing the quark-diquark model of protons in a form proposed by
Bialas and Bzdak. The differential cross-section of elastic proton-proton
collisions is analyzed in a detailed and systematic manner at small momentum
transfers, starting from the energy range of CERN ISR at $ \sqrt{s}= 23.5 $
GeV, including also recent TOTEM data at the present LHC energies at $\sqrt{s}
= 7$ TeV. These studies confirm the picture that the size of proton increases
systematically with increasing energies, while the size of the constituent
quarks and diquarks remains approximately independent of (or only increases
only slightly with) the colliding energy. The detailed analysis indicates
correlations between model parameters and also indicates an increasing role of
shadowing at LHC energies. Within the investigated class of models, a simple
and model-independent phenomenological relation was discovered that connects
the total p+p scattering cross-section to the effective quark, diquark size and
their average separation. Our best fits indicate, that the relative error of
this phenomenological relation is 10-15% in the considered energy range.
