We investigate the possibility to detect WIMPs at the ILC in a
model-independent way using events with single photons. The study is done with
a full detector simulation of the LDC detector and MarlinReco. It turns out
that WIMPs are observable this way at the ILC if their coupling to electrons is
not too small. Beam polarisation can increase the accessible phase space
significantly.
