A set of vertices in a graph is a dominating set if every vertex outside the
set has a neighbor in the set. A dominating set is connected if the subgraph
induced by its vertices is connected. The connected domatic partition problem
asks for a partition of the nodes into connected dominating sets. The connected
domatic number of a graph is the size of a largest connected domatic partition
and it is a well-studied graph parameter with applications in the design of
wireless networks. In this note, we consider the fractional counterpart of the
connected domatic partition problem in \emph{node-capacitated} graphs. Let $n$
be the number of nodes in the graph and let $k$ be the minimum capacity of a
node separator in $G$. Fractionally we can pack at most $k$ connected
dominating sets subject to the capacities on the nodes, and our algorithms
construct packings whose sizes are proportional to $k$. Some of our main
contributions are the following: \begin{itemize} \item An algorithm for
constructing a fractional connected domatic packing of size $\Omega(k)$ for
node-capacitated planar and minor-closed families of graphs. \item An algorithm
for constructing a fractional connected domatic packing of size $\Omega(k /
\ln{n})$ for node-capacitated general graphs. \end{itemize}
