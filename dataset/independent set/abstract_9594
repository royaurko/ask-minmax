In this paper we present a new and simple language-independent method for
word-alignment based on the use of external sources of bilingual information
such as machine translation systems. We show that the few parameters of the
aligner can be trained on a very small corpus, which leads to results
comparable to those obtained by the state-of-the-art tool GIZA++ in terms of
precision. Regarding other metrics, such as alignment error rate or F-measure,
the parametric aligner, when trained on a very small gold-standard (450 pairs
of sentences), provides results comparable to those produced by GIZA++ when
trained on an in-domain corpus of around 10,000 pairs of sentences.
Furthermore, the results obtained indicate that the training is
domain-independent, which enables the use of the trained aligner 'on the fly'
on any new pair of sentences.
