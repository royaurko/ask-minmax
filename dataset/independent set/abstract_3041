We show that G\"odel's negative results concerning arithmetic, which date
back to the 1930s, and the ancient "sand pile" paradox (known also as "sorites
paradox") pose the questions of the use of fuzzy sets and of the effect of a
measuring device on the experiment. The consideration of these facts led, in
thermodynamics, to a new one-parameter family of ideal gases. In turn, this
leads to a new approach to probability theory (including the new notion of
independent events). As applied to economics, this gives the correction, based
on Friedman's rule, to Irving Fisher's "Main Law of Economics" and enables us
to consider the theory of debt crisis.
