The Karhunen-Lo\'{e}ve (KL) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the sample
correlation matrix are used to analyse the spatial fluctuations of the REFLEX
clusters of galaxies. The method avoids the disturbing effects of correlated
power spectral densities which affects all previous cluster measurements on Gpc
scales. Comprehensive tests use a large set of independent REFLEX-like mock
cluster samples extracted from the Hubble Volume Simulation. It is found that
unbiased measurements on Gpc scales are possible with the REFLEX data. The
distribution of the KL eigenvalues are consistent with a Gaussian random field
on the 93.4% confidence level. Assuming spatially flat cold dark matter models,
the marginalization of the likelihood contours over different sample volumes,
fiducial cosmologies, mass/X-ray luminosity relations and baryon densities,
yields the 95.4% confidence interval for the matter density of
$0.03<\Omega_mh^2<0.19$. The N-body simulations show that cosmic variance,
although difficult to estimate, is expected to increase the confidence
intervals by about 50%.
