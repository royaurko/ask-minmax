We apply Doeblin's ergodicity coefficient as a computational tool to
approximate the occupancy distribution of a set of states in a homogeneous but
possibly non-stationary finite Markov chain. Our approximation is based on new
properties satisfied by this coefficient, which allow us to approximate a chain
of duration n by independent and short-lived realizations of an auxiliary
homogeneous Markov chain of duration of order ln(n). Our approximation may be
particularly useful when exact calculations via first-step methods or transfer
matrices are impractical, and asymptotic approximations may not be yet
reliable. Our findings may find applications to pattern problems in Markovian
and non-Markovian sequences that are treatable via embedding techniques.
