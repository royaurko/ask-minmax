Numerical evidence of directed transport driven by symmetric Levy noise in
time-independent ratchet potentials in the absence of an external tilting force
is presented. The results are based on the numerical solution of the fractional
Fokker-Planck equation in a periodic potential and the corresponding Langevin
equation with Levy noise. The Levy noise drives the system out of thermodynamic
equilibrium and an up-hill net current is generated. For small values of the
noise intensity there is an optimal value of the Levy noise index yielding the
maximum current. The direction and magnitude of the current can be manipulated
by changing the Levy noise asymmetry and the potential asymmetry.
