We present a method which allows, at least in principle, the direct
extraction of the gauge-invariant and process-independent neutrino charge
radius (NCR) from experiments. Under special kinematic conditions, the
judicious combination of neutrino and anti-neutrino forward differential
cross-sections allows the exclusion of all target-dependent contributions, such
as gauge-independent box-graphs, not related to the NCR. We show that the
remaining contributions contain universal, renormalization group invariant
combinations, such as the electroweak effective charge and the running mixing
angle, which must be also separated out. By considering the appropriate number
of independent experiments we show that one may systematically eliminate these
universal terms, and finally express the NCR entirely in terms of physical
cross-sections. Even though the kinematic conditions and the required precision
may render the proposed experiments unfeasible, at the conceptual level the
analysis presented here allows for the promotion of the NCR into a genuine
physical observable.
