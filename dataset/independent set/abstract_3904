We establish a stronger symmetry between the numbers of northeast and
southeast chains in the context of 01-fillings of moon polyominoes. Let $\M$ be
a moon polyomino with $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Consider all the 01-fillings of
$\M$ in which every row has at most one 1. We introduce four mixed statistics
with respect to a bipartition of rows or columns of $\M$. More precisely, let
$S \subseteq \{1,2,..., n\}$ and $\mathcal{R}(S)$ be the union of rows whose
indices are in $S$. For any filling $M$, the top-mixed (resp. bottom-mixed)
statistic $\alpha(S; M)$ (resp. $\beta(S; M)$) is the sum of the number of
northeast chains whose top (resp. bottom) cell is in $\mathcal{R}(S)$, together
with the number of southeast chains whose top (resp. bottom) cell is in the
complement of $\mathcal{R}(S)$. Similarly, we define the left-mixed and
right-mixed statistics $\gamma(T; M)$ and $\delta(T; M)$, where $T$ is a subset
of the column index set $\{1,2,..., m\}$. Let $\lambda(A; M)$ be any of these
four statistics $\alpha(S; M)$, $\beta(S; M)$, $\gamma(T; M)$ and $\delta(T;
M)$, we show that the joint distribution of the pair $(\lambda(A; M),
\lambda(\bar A; M))$ is symmetric and independent of the subsets $S, T$. In
particular, the pair of statistics $(\lambda(A;M), \lambda(\bar A; M))$ is
equidistributed with $(\se(M),\ne(M))$, where $\se(M)$ and $\ne(M)$ are the
numbers of southeast chains and northeast chains of $M$, respectively.
