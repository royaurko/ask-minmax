In this paper we generalize the intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS),
paraconsistent set, and intuitionistic set to the neutrosophic set (NS).
Several examples are presented. Also, a geometric interpretation of the
Neutrosophic Set is given using a Neutrosophic Cube. Many distinctions between
NS and IFS are underlined.
