The present work illustrates a difficulty with the level-set method to
accurately capture the curvature of interfaces in regions that are of equal
distance to two or more interfaces. Such regions are characterized by kinks in
the level-set function where the derivative is discontinuous. Thus the standard
discretization scheme is not suitable. Three discretization schemes are
outlined that are shown to perform better than the standard discretization on
two selected test cases.
