We show that in the framework of the pinch technique the universal part of
the $\rho$ parameter can be meaningfully defined, beyond one loop. The
universal part so obtained satisfies the crucial requirements of
gauge-independence, finiteness, and process-independence, even when subleading
contributions of the top quark are included. The mechanism which enforces the
aforementioned properties is explained in detail, and several subtle field
theoretical issues are discussed. Explicit calculations of the sub-leading
two-loop corrections of order $O(G_{\mu}^{2}m^{2}_{t}M_{Z}^{2})$ are carried
out in the context of an $SU(2)$ model, with $M_{W}=M_{Z}$, and various
intermediate and final results are reported.
