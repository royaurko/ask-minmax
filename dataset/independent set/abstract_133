We show that, for any n-vertex graph G and integer parameter k, there are at
most 3^{4k-n}4^{n-3k} maximal independent sets I \subset G with |I| <= k, and
that all such sets can be listed in time O(3^{4k-n} 4^{n-3k}). These bounds are
tight when n/4 <= k <= n/3. As a consequence, we show how to compute the exact
chromatic number of a graph in time O((4/3 + 3^{4/3}/4)^n) ~= 2.4150^n,
improving a previous O((1+3^{1/3})^n) ~= 2.4422^n algorithm of Lawler (1976).
