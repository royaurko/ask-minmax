Spatial Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an increasingly used
data-driven method to analyze functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
data. To date, it has been used to extract sets of mutually correlated brain
regions without prior information on the time course of these regions. Some of
these sets of regions, interpreted as functional networks, have recently been
used to provide markers of brain diseases and open the road to paradigm-free
population comparisons. Such group studies raise the question of modeling
subject variability within ICA: how can the patterns representative of a group
be modeled and estimated via ICA for reliable inter-group comparisons? In this
paper, we propose a hierarchical model for patterns in multi-subject fMRI
datasets, akin to mixed-effect group models used in linear-model-based
analysis. We introduce an estimation procedure, CanICA (Canonical ICA), based
on i) probabilistic dimension reduction of the individual data, ii) canonical
correlation analysis to identify a data subspace common to the group iii)
ICA-based pattern extraction. In addition, we introduce a procedure based on
cross-validation to quantify the stability of ICA patterns at the level of the
group. We compare our method with state-of-the-art multi-subject fMRI ICA
methods and show that the features extracted using our procedure are more
reproducible at the group level on two datasets of 12 healthy controls: a
resting-state and a functional localizer study.
