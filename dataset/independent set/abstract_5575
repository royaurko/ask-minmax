A numerical set $S$ with Frobenius number $g$ is a set of integers with
$\min(S) = 0$ and $\max(\Zbb - S)=g$, and its atom monoid is $A(S) = \setpres{n
\in \Zbb}{$n+s \in S$ for all $s \in S$}$. Let $\gamma_g$ be the number of
numerical sets $S$ having $A(S) = \set{0} \cup (g,\infty)$ divided by the total
number of numerical sets with Frobenius number $g$. We show that the sequence
$\set{\gamma_g}$ is decreasing and converges to a number $\gamma_\infty \approx
.4844$ (with accuracy to within $.0050$). We also examine the singularities of
the generating function for $\set{\gamma_g}$. Parallel results are obtained for
the ratio $\gsymm{g}$ of the number of symmetric numerical sets $S$ with $A(S)
= \set{0} \cup (g,\infty)$ by the number of symmetric numerical sets with
Frobenius number $g$. These results yield information regarding the asymptotic
behavior of the number of finite additive 2-bases.
