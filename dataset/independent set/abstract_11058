We study the running of the QCD coupling with the momentum squared ($Q^2$)
and the temperature scales in the high temperature limit ($T > T_{c}$), using a
mass dependent renormalization scheme to build the Renormalization Group
Equations. The approach used guaranty gauge invariance, through the use of the
Hard Thermal Loop approximation, and independence of the vertex chosen to
renormalize the coupling. In general, the dependence of the coupling with the
temperature is not logarithmical, although in the region $Q^2 \sim T^2$ the
logarithm approximation is reasonable. Finally, as known from Debye screening,
color charge is screened in the coupling. The number of flavors, however, is
anti-screened.
