We study the photocurrent response of topological insulator surface states to
circularly polarized light for arbitrary oblique incidence. We describe the
surface states within a Dirac model, including several perturbations such as
hexagonal warping, nonlinear corrections to the mode velocity, and applied
magnetic fields. We find that the photogalvanic current is strongly suppressed
for the usual orbital coupling, prompting us to include the weaker Zeeman
coupling. We find that the helicity-independent photocurrent dominates over the
helicity-dependent contributions.
