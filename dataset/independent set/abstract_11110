Based on chiral dynamics, existence of exotic hadrons is discussed in the
SU(3) symmetric limit. The low energy s-wave interaction of the Nambu-Goldstone
boson with a hadron is known to be determined model-independently, which has
been used to generate some hadron resonances in nonexotic channels. We show
that this interaction in any exotic channels is not strong enough to generate a
bound state.
