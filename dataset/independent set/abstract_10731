Discrete symmetries, parity, time reversal, antipodal, and charge conjugation
transformations for spinor field in de Sitter space, are presented in the
ambient space notation, i.e. in a coordinate independent way. The PT and PCT
transformations are also discussed in this notation. The five-current density
is studied and their transformation under the discrete symmetries is discussed.
