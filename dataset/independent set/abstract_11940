Metamaterials are constructed such that, for a narrow range of frequencies,
the momentum density depends on the local displacement gradient, and the stress
depends on the local velocity. In these models the momentum density generally
depends not only on the strain, but also on the local rotation, and the stress
is generally not symmetric. A variant is constructed for which, at a fixed
frequency, the momentum density is independent of the local rotation (but still
depends on the strain) and the stress is symmetric (but still depends on the
velocity). Generalizations of these metamaterials may be useful in the design
of elastic cloaking devices.
