The Gamma-Gamma (GG) distribution has recently attracted the interest within
the research community due to its involvement in various communication systems.
In the context of RF wireless communications, GG distribution accurately models
the power statistics in composite shadowing/fading channels as well as in
cascade multipath fading channels, while in optical wireless (OW) systems, it
describes the fluctuations of the irradiance of optical signals distorted by
atmospheric turbulence. Although GG channel model offers analytical
tractability in the analysis of single input single output (SISO) wireless
systems, difficulties arise when studying multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
systems, where the distribution of the sum of independent GG variates is
required. In this paper, we present a novel simple closed-form approximation
for the distribution of the sum of independent, but not necessarily identically
distributed GG variates. It is shown that the probability density function
(PDF) of the GG sum can be efficiently approximated either by the PDF of a
single GG distribution, or by a finite weighted sum of PDFs of GG
distributions. To reveal the importance of the proposed approximation, the
performance of RF wireless systems in the presence of composite fading, as well
as MIMO OW systems impaired by atmospheric turbulence, are investigated.
Numerical results and simulations illustrate the accuracy of the proposed
approach.
