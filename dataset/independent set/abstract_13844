Datasets of online communication often take the form of contact sequences --
ordered lists contacts (where a contact is defined as a triple of a sender, a
recipient and a time). We propose measures of attractiveness and activity for
such data sets and analyze these quantities for anonymized contact sequences
from an Internet dating community. For this data set the attractiveness and
activity measures show broad power-law like distributions. Our attractiveness
and activity measures are more strongly correlated in the real-world data than
in our reference model. Effects that indirectly can make active users more
attractive are discussed.
