A multiple-descriptions (MD) coding strategy is proposed and an inner bound
to the achievable rate-distortion region is derived. The scheme utilizes linear
codes. It is shown in two different MD set-ups that the linear coding scheme
achieves a larger rate-distortion region than previously known random coding
strategies. Furthermore, it is shown via an example that the best known random
coding scheme for the set-up can be improved by including additional randomly
generated codebooks.
