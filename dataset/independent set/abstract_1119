This paper deals with criteria of algebraic independence for the derivatives
of solutions of rank one difference equations. The key idea consists in
deriving from the commutativity of the differentiation and difference operators
a sequence of iterated extensions of the original difference module, thereby
setting the problem in the framework of difference Galois theory and finally
reducing it to an exercise in linear algebra. The involved tannakian categories
are neutral over non necessarily algebraically closed fields, and this leads us
to study the behaviour of Galois groups under base field extensions.
