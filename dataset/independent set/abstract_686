A recent framework for generalizing the Erdos-Ko-Rado Theorem, due to
Holroyd, Spencer, and Talbot, defines the Erdos-Ko-Rado property for a graph in
terms of the graph's independent sets. Since the family of all independent sets
of a graph forms a simplicial complex, it is natural to further generalize the
Erdos-Ko-Rado property to an arbitrary simplicial complex. An advantage of
working in simplicial complexes is the availability of algebraic shifting, a
powerful shifting (compression) technique, which we use to verify a conjecture
of Holroyd and Talbot in the case of sequentially Cohen-Macaulay near-cones.
