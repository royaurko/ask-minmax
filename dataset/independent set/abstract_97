If alpha=alpha(G) is the maximum size of an independent set and s_{k} equals
the number of stable sets of cardinality k in graph G, then
I(G;x)=s_{0}+s_{1}x+...+s_{alpha}x^{alpha} is the independence polynomial of G.
  In this paper we prove that: 1. I(T;-1) equels either -1 or 0 or 1 for every
tree T; 2. I(G;-1)=0 for every connected well-covered graph G of girth > 5,
non-isomorphic to C_{7} or K_{2}; 3. the absolute value of I(G;-1) is not
greater than 2^nu(G), for every graph G, where nu(G) is its cyclomatic number.
