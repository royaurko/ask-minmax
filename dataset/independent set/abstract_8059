Given a finite set of closed rational points of affine space over a field, we
give a Gr\"obner basis for the lexicographic ordering of the ideal of
polynomials which vanish at all given points. Our method is an alternative to
the Buchberger--M\"oller algorithm, but in contrast to that, we determine the
set of leading terms of the ideal without solving any linear equation but by
induction over the dimension of affine space. The elements of the Gr\"obner
basis are also computed by induction over the dimension, using one-dimensional
interpolation of coefficients of certain polynomials.
