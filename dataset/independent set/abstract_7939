In this paper we introduce a new probability distribution on (0,1),
associated with the I-function, namely, the I-function distribution. This
distribution generalizes several known distributions with positive support. It
is also shown that the distribution of products, quotients and powers of
independent I-function variates are I-function variates. Another distribution
called the I-function inverse Gaussian distribution is also introduced and
studied.
