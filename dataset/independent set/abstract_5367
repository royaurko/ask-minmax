We study the classical electron scattering from a driven inverted Gaussian
potential, an open system, in terms of its chaotic invariant set. This chaotic
invariant set is described by a ternary horseshoe construction on an
appropriate Poincare surface of section. We find the development parameters
that describe the hyperbolic component of the chaotic invariant set. In
addition, we show that the hierarchical structure of the fractal set of
singularities of the scattering functions is the same as the structure of the
chaotic invariant set. Finally, we construct a symbolic encoding of the
hierarchical structure of the set of singularities of the scattering functions
and use concepts from the thermodynamical formalism to obtain one of the
measures of chaos of the fractal set of singularities, the topological entropy.
