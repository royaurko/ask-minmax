Most of the known literature on Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) is based on
earliest theoretical attempts and later approximations led by F.C.Jones and
J.B.Blumenthal. We found an independent and more general analytical procedure
which provide both relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits for ICS. These new
analytical expressions can be derived in a straightforward way and they contain
the previously reminded Jones' results. Our detailed solutions may be probed by
already existing as well future ICS experiments.
