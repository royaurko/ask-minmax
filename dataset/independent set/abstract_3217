Magnetic fields are present on all scales in the Universe. While we
understand the processes which amplify the fields fairly well, we do not have a
"natural" mechanism to generate the small initial seed fields. By using fully
relativistic cosmological perturbation theory and going beyond the usual
confines of linear theory we show analytically how magnetic fields are
generated. This is the first analytical calculation of the magnetic field at
second order, using gauge-invariant cosmological perturbation theory, and
including all the source terms. To this end, we have rederived the full set of
governing equations independently. Our results suggest that magnetic fields of
the order of $10^{-30}$ G can be generated (although this depends on the small
scale cut-off of the integral), which is largely in agreement with previous
results that relied upon numerical calculations. These fields are likely too
small to act as the primordial seed fields for dynamo mechanisms.
