Detection of 5 events by the Liquid Scintillation Detector (LSD) on February,
23, 1987 was recently interpreted as a detection of the electron neutrino flux
from the first stage of the two-stage Supernova collapse. We show that, if
neutrino mass hierarchy is normal, such interpretation excludes values of
neutrino mixing angle \theta_{13} larger than 3\cdot 10^{-2}, independently of
the particular Supernova collapse model. Also constraints on the original
fluxes of neutrinos and antineutrinos of different flavours are obtained.
