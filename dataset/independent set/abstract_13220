We have prepared the oxyhydrate Na03RhO206H2O by extracting Na+ cations from
NaRhO2 and intercalating water molecules using an aqueous solution of Na2S2O8.
Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and
energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) reveal that a non-stoichiometric
Na03(H2O)06 network separates layers of edge-sharing RhO6 octahedra containing
Rh3+(4d6, S=0) and Rh4+ (4d5, S=1/2). The resistivities of NaRhO2 and
Na03RhO206H2O (T < 300) reveal insulating and semi-conducting behavior with
activation gaps of 134 meV and 7.8 meV, respectively. Both Na03RhO206H2O and
NaRhO2 show paramagnetism at room temperature, however, the sodium-deficient
sample exhibits simultaneously a weak but experimentally reproducible
ferromagnetic component. Both samples exhibit a temperature-independent Pauli
paramagnetism, for NaRhO2 at T > 50 K and for Na03RhO206H2O at T > 25 K. The
relative magnitudes of the temperature-independent magnetic susceptibilities,
that of the oxide sample being half that of the oxyhydrate, is consistent with
a higher density of thermally accessible electron states at the Fermi level in
the hydrated sample. At low temperatures the magnetic moments rise sharply,
providing evidence of localized and weakl -ordered electronic spins.
