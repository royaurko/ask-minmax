A generalization of the lattice Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (LBGK) model for the
simulation of hydrodynamics is presented, which takes into account the
difference and the frame-independence of the relaxation of non-hydrodynamic
modes. The present model retains the computationally efficient standard LBGK
form with the generalized equilibrium explicitly derived. The two-dimensional
realization on the standard lattice is discussed in detail. Performance of the
model is assessed through a shear layer simulation and enhanced stability and
accuracy with respect to the standard LBGK are reported. The results
demonstrate that the present model is a useful upgrade of the standard LBGK
without compromising its computational efficiency and accuracy.
