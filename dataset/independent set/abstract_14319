We consider an economy where agents' consumption sets are given by the cone
$\mathbf{L}^0_+$ of non-negative measurable functions and whose preferences are
defined by additive utilities satisfying the Inada conditions. We extend to
this setting the results in \citet{Dana:93} on the existence and uniqueness of
Arrow-Debreu equilibria. In the case of existence, our conditions are necessary
and sufficient.
