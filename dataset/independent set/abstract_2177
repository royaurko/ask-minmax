An interesting sociophysical research problem consists of the compatibility
between collective social behavior in the short term and cultural diversity in
the long term. Recently, it has been shown that, when studying a model of short
term collective behavior in parallel with one of long term cultural diversity,
one is lead to the puzzling conclusion that the 2 aspects are mutually
exclusive. However, the compatibility is restored when switching from the
randomly generated cultural space distribution to an empirical one for
specifying the initial conditions in those models. This calls for understanding
the extent to which such a compatibility restoration is independent of the
empirical data set, as well as the relevant structural properties of such data.
Firstly, this work shows that the restoration patterns are largely robust
across data sets. Secondly, it provides a possible mechanism explaining the
restoration, for the special case when the cultural space is formulated only in
terms of nominal variables. The proposed model assumes that a realistic
distribution in cultural space is governed by the existence of several
"cultural prototype", a hypothesis already used in previous work, provided that
every individual's sequence of cultural traits is a combination of the
sequences associated to the prototypes. This can be considered indirect
empirical evidence in favor of social science theories having inspired the
model.
