In applications involving conversational speech, data sparsity is a limiting
factor in building a better language model. We propose a simple,
language-independent method to quickly harvest large amounts of data from
Twitter to supplement a smaller training set that is more closely matched to
the domain. The techniques lead to a significant reduction in perplexity on
four low-resource languages even though the presence on Twitter of these
languages is relatively small. We also find that the Twitter text is more
useful for learning word classes than the in-domain text and that use of these
word classes leads to further reductions in perplexity. Additionally, we
introduce a method of using social and textual information to prioritize the
download queue during the Twitter crawling. This maximizes the amount of useful
data that can be collected, impacting both perplexity and vocabulary coverage.
