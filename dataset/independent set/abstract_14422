The accuracy of two widely used scalar-relativistic Hartree-Fock
pseudopotentials, the Trail-Needs-Dirac-Fock (TNDF) and the
Burkatzki-Filippi-Dolg (BFD) pseudopotentials, is assessed. The performance of
the pseudopotentials is tested for a chemically representative set of 34
first-row molecules. All comparisons are made at the Hartree-Fock level of
theory, and both sets of pseudopotentials give good results. The all-electron
equilibrium geometries, molecular dissociation energies, and zero-point
vibrational energies are reproduced a little more accurately by the TNDF
pseudopotentials than the BFD ones.
