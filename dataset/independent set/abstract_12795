Synchrotron photon spectrum in heavy-ion collisions is computed taking into
account the spatial and temporal structure of magnetic field. It is found that
a significant fraction of photon excess in heavy-ion collisions in the region
$k_\bot=1-3$GeV can be attributed to the synchrotron radiation. Azimuthal
anisotropy of the synchrotron photon spectrum is characterized by the Fourier
coefficients $v_2=4/7$ and $v_4=1/10$ that are independent of photon momentum
and centrality.
