We study p-adic counterparts of stable distributions, that is limit
distributions for sequences of normalized sums of independent identically
distributed p-adic-valued random variables. In contrast to the classical case,
non-degenerate limit distributions can be obtained only under certain
assumptions on the asymptotic behaviour of the number of summands in the
approximating sums. This asymptotics determines the ``exponent of stability''.
