We report low-temperature magnetoconductance measurements of a patterned
two-dimensional electron system (2DES) at the surface of strontium titanate,
gated by an ionic liquid electrolyte. We observe universal conductance
fluctuations, a signature of phase-coherent transport in mesoscopic devices.
From the universal conductance fluctuations we extract an electron dephasing
rate linear in temperature, characteristic of electron-electron interaction in
a disordered conductor. Furthermore, the dephasing rate has a
temperature-independent offset, suggestive of unscreened local magnetic moments
in the sample.
