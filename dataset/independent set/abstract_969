The properties of the non-forward quark-quark correlation function are
examined. We derive constraints on the correlation function from the
transformation properties of the fundamental fields of QCD occurring in its
definition. We further develop a method to construct an ansatz for this
correlator. We present the complete leading order set of generalized parton
distributions in terms of the amplitudes of the ansatz. Finally we conclude
that the number of independent generalized parton helicity changing
distributions is four.
