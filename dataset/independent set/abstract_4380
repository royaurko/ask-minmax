We report on the discovery of Cepheids in the Virgo spiral galaxy NGC 4535,
based on observations made with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 on board
the Hubble Space Telescope. NGC 4535 is one of 18 galaxies observed as a part
of The HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale which aims to
measure the Hubble constant to 10% accuracy. NGC 4535 was observed over 13
epochs using the F555W filter, and over 9 epochs using the F814W filter. The
HST F555W and F814W data were transformed to the Johnson V and Kron-Cousins I
magnitude systems, respectively. Photometry was performed using two independent
programs, DoPHOT and DAOPHOT II/ALLFRAME.
  Period-luminosity relations in the V and I bands were constructed using 39
high-quality Cepheids present in our set of 50 variable candidates. We obtain a
distance modulus of 31.02+/-0.26 mag, corresponding to a distance of 16.0+/-1.9
Mpc. Our distance estimate is based on values of mu = 18.50 +/- 0.10 mag and
E(V-I) = 0.13 mag for the distance modulus and reddening of the LMC,
respectively.
