The famous de Boor conjecture states that the condition of the polynomial
B-spline collocation matrix at the knot averages is bounded independently of
the knot sequence, i.e., depends only on the spline degree. For highly
nonuniform knot meshes, like geometric meshes, the conjecture is known to be
false. As an effort towards finding an answer for uniform meshes, we
investigate the spectral condition number of cardinal B-spline collocation
matrices. Numerical testing strongly suggests that the conjecture is true for
cardinal B-splines.
