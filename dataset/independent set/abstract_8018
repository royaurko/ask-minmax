We investigate characterizations of the Galois connection sInv-Aut between
sets of finitary relations on a base set A and their automorphisms. In
particular, for A=omega_1, we construct a countable set R of relations that is
closed under all invariant operations on relations and under arbitray
intersections, but is not closed under sInv(Aut(-)).
  Our structure (A,R) has an omega-categorical first order theory. A higher
order definable well-order makes it rigid, but any reduct to a finite language
is homogeneous.
