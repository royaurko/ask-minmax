Some remarks are presented on a recent paper (Leinweber,Thomas and Young,
Phys.Rev.Lett. 86, 5011, 2001). In particular a statement of the above paper on
the fact that the ratio between the magnetic moments of proton and neutron
should remain constant at -3/2, independent of the change of the quark mass is
discussed on the basis of the general parameterization.
