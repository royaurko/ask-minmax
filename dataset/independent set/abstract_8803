We analyze, by means of numerical simulations, transmission enhancements
through sub- wavelength slits due to the presence of sets of plasmonic
nanocylinders, placed near the exit of these apertures. Further, we extend this
study to photonic crystals of dipolar plasmonic particles in front of an array
of extraordinarily transmitting slits practiced in a metallic slab.
