Supersymmetry combined with little-Higgs can render the Higgs vev
super-little, providing models of electroweak symmetry breaking free from
fine-tunings. We discuss the difficulties that arise in implementing this idea
and propose one simple successful model. Thanks to appropriately chosen Higgs
representations, D-terms give no tree-level mass term to the Goldstone. The
fermion representations are anomaly free, generation independent and embeddable
into an SU(6) GUT. A simple mechanism provides the large top quark mass.
