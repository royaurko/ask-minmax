Let $(U_t,V_t)$ be a bivariate L\'evy process, where $V_t$ is a subordinator
and $U_t$ is a L\'evy process formed by randomly weighting each jump of $V_t$
by an independent random variable $X_t$ having cdf $F$. We investigate the
asymptotic distribution of the self-normalized L\'evy process $U_t/V_t$ at 0
and at $\infty$. We show that all subsequential limits of this ratio at 0
($\infty$) are continuous for any nondegenerate $F$ with finite expectation if
and only if $V_t$ belongs to the centered Feller class at 0 ($\infty$). We also
characterize when $U_t/V_t$ has a non-degenerate limit distribution at 0 and
$\infty$.
