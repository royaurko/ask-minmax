The class HCM consists of all nonnegative functions f such that
f(uv)*f(u/v)is completely monotone with respect to w=v+1/v, for all fixed
positive numbers u, and has been extensively studied for a long time. It is
closed with respect to (wr) a number of useful operations such as products and
quotients of independent random variables, some changes of variables and the
Laplace transform. We consider its multivariate (bivariateI counterparts MVHCM
(BVHCM) and study some of their properties. In particular, we prove that MVHCM
is closed wrt the Laplace transform and use this to define a class BVHCM-L of
bivariate random vectors having this property. Then BVHCM-L contains
Bondesson's class of random vectors in BVHCM in the strong sense. Finally, we
show that BVHCM, in contrast to HCM, is not closed wrt multiplication of
independent bivariate random vectors.
