The spatial coherence of laser sources has limited their application to
parallel imaging and projection due to coherent artifacts, such as speckle. In
contrast, traditional incoherent light sources, such as thermal sources or
light emitting diodes (LEDs), provide relatively low power per independent
spatial mode. Here, we present a chip-scale, electrically-pumped semiconductor
laser based on a novel design, demonstrating high power per mode with much
lower spatial coherence than conventional laser sources. The laser resonator
was fabricated with a chaotic, D-shaped cavity optimized to achieve highly
multimode lasing. Lasing occurs simultaneously and independently in ~1000
modes, and hence the total emission exhibits very low spatial coherence.
Speckle-free full-field imaging is demonstrated using the chaotic cavity laser
as the illumination source. The power per mode of the sample illumination is
several orders of magnitude higher than that of a LED or thermal light source.
Such a compact, low-cost source, which combines the low spatial coherence of a
LED with the high spectral radiance of a laser, could enable a wide range of
high-speed, full-field imaging and projection applications.
