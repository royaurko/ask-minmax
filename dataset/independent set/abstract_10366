The paper describes a substitutional approach to ellipsis resolution giving
comparable results to Dalrymple, Shieber and Pereira (1991), but without the
need for order-sensitive interleaving of quantifier scoping and ellipsis
resolution. It is argued that the order-independence results from viewing
semantic interpretation as building a description of a semantic composition,
instead of the more common view of interpretation as actually performing the
composition
