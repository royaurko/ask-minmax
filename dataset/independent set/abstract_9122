We study the feasibility of using an isotropic flux of cosmic neutrinos in
the energy range of 10 to 10000 TeV to study the interior structure of Earth.
The angular distribution of events in a $\sim {\rm km}^3$-scale neutrino
telescope can be inverted to yield information on the Earth's mass distribution
that is independent of other methods. The energy spectrum of the neutrino
primaries is also determined from consistency with the angular distribution. It
is possible to make a model independent determination of the density profile of
Earth's interior, separate from the absolute normalization of the incident
cosmic neutrinos.
