We propose a general inverse formula for extracting inflationary parameters
from the observed power spectrum of cosmological perturbations. Under the
general slow-roll scheme, which helps to probe the properties of inflation in a
model independent way, we invert the leading order, single field, power
spectrum formula. We also give some physically interesting examples to
demonstrate its wide applicability and illuminate its properties.
