Let $M$ be a model set meeting two simple conditions: (1) the internal space
$H$ is a product of $\R^n$ and a finite group, and (2) the window $W$ is a
finite union of disjoint polyhedra. Then any point pattern with finite local
complexity (FLC) that is topologically conjugate to $M$ is mutually locally
derivable (MLD) to a model set $M'$ that has the same internal group and window
as $M$, but has a different projection from $H \times \R^d$ to $\R^d$. In
cohomological terms, this means that the group $H^1_{an}(M,\R)$ of
asymptotically negligible classes has dimension $n$. We also exhibit a
counterexample when the second hypothesis is removed, constructing two
topologically conjugate FLC Delone sets, one a model set and the other not even
a Meyer set.
