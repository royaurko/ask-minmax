A simple algebraic algorithm is described to recover the (complex valued)
gaugino/Higgsino basic parameters $\mu = |\mu| e^{i \phi_\mu}$, $M_1 = |M_1|
e^{i \phi_{M_1}}$, $M_2 = |M_2|$, directly in terms of (a minimal set of)
neutralino and chargino masses, accurately measurable at future linear collider
energies. An ambiguity in the $M_1$ reconstruction can be resolved by measuring
the corresponding $e^+e^- \to \chi^0_1 \chi^0_2$ cross section. This approach
should simplify the determination of allowed ranges of the gaugino parameters,
in particular if only a partial set of gaugino masses were measured.
