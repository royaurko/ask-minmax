We investigate the integrability of almost complex structures on the twistor
space of an almost quaternionic manifold constructed with the help of a
quaternionic connection. We show that if there is an integrable structure it is
independent on the quaternionic connection. In dimension four, we express the
anti-self-duality condition in terms of the Riemannian Ricci forms with respect
to the associated quaternionic structure.
