In this paper we investigate the distribution of the set of values of a
linear map at integer points on a quadratic surface. In particular we show that
this set is dense in the range of the linear map subject to certain algebraic
conditions on the linear map and the quadratic form that defines the surface.
The proof uses Ratner's Theorem on orbit closures of unipotent subgroups acting
on homogeneous spaces.
