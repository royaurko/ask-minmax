Learning mathematics requires students to work in an independent way which is
particularly challenging for such an abstract subject. Advancements in
technology and, taking the student as the focus of his own learning, led to a
change of paradigm in the design and development of educational contents. In
this paper we describe the first experience with an interactive feedback and
assessment tool (Siacua), based on parameterized math exercises, and explain
how we use it to motivate student independent study in a multivariate calculus
environment. We have defined an index about the subject, trying to make it
consensual enough for being used in other courses about multivariate calculus.
Then we have created a concept map, selected some existing parameterized
true/false questions from PmatE project and classified them using our concept
map, for being reused in our system. For complementing the course we have
created about one hundred parameterized multiple choice question templates in
system Megua and generated about one thousand instances for using in Siacua.
Results based on data collected by this tool and also based on an informal
survey are presented. This first experience allows us to conclude our approach
has an important impact on student motivation and contributes to the success on
learning multivariate calculus.
