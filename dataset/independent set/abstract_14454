We construct the first examples of rational functions defined over a
non-archimedean field with certain dynamical properties. In particular, we find
such functions whose Julia sets, in the Berkovich projective line, are
connected but not contained in a line segment. We also show how to compute the
measure-theoretic and topological entropy of such maps. In particular, we show
for some of our examples that the measure-theoretic entropy is strictly smaller
than the topological entropy, thus answering a question of Favre and
Rivera-Letelier.
