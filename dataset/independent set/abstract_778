New local "hybrid" functionals proposed by V. V. Karasiev in [J. Chem. Phys.
{\bf 118}, 8567 (2003)] are benchmarked against nonlocal hybrid functionals.
Their performance is tested on the total and high occupied orbital energies, as
well as the electric moments of selected diatomic molecules. The new
functionals, along with the Hartree-Fock and non-hybrid functionals, are
employed for finite-difference calculations, which are basis-independent. Basis
set errors in the total energy and electric moments are calculated for the
6-311G, 6-311G++G(3df,3pd) and AUG-cc-pVnZ (n=3,4,6) basis sets used in
conjunction with the Hartree-Fock and conventional density functional methods.
A comparison between the results of the finite-difference local "hybrid" and
basis set nonlocal hybrid functional shows that total energies of local and
nonlocal hybrid functionals agree to within the basis set error. Discrepancies
for multipole moments are larger in magnitude when compared to the basis set
errors, but still reasonably small (smaller than errors produced by the 6-311G
basis set). Thus, we recommend using the new local "hybrid" functionals
whenever the accuracy is expected to be sufficient, because they require a
solution of just differential Kohn-Sham equations, instead of
integro-differential ones in the case of hybrid functionals.
