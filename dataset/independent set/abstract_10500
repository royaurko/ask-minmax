The incommensurate spin fluctuation of the doped triangular antiferromagnet
is studied within the t-J model. It is shown that the commensurate peak near
the half-filling is split into six incommensurate peaks in the underdoped and
optimally doped regimes. The incommensurability increases with the hole
concentration at lower dopings, and saturates at higher dopings. Although the
incommensurability is almost energy independent, the weight of these
incommensurate peaks decreases with energy and temperature.
