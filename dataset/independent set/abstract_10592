The superfluid fraction of ideal and interacting inhomogeneous Bose gases
with varying asymmetry is investigated at finite temperature using well-known
properties of the harmonic oscillator as well as the essentially exact
microscopic path integral Monte Carlo method. We find that the superfluid
fraction (i) is essentially independent of the interaction strength for all
temperatures considered, (ii) changes profoundly as the effective
dimensionality is varied from three- to one-dimensional, (iii) is approximately
equal to the condensate fraction N0/N for spherical Bose gases, and (iv)
deviates dramatically from N0/N for highly-elongated Bose gases.
