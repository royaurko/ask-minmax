Quantile regression is an increasingly important empirical tool in economics
and other sciences for analyzing the impact of a set of regressors on the
conditional distribution of an outcome. Extremal quantile regression, or
quantile regression applied to the tails, is of interest in many economic and
financial applications, such as conditional value-at-risk, production
efficiency, and adjustment bands in (S,s) models. In this paper we provide
feasible inference tools for extremal conditional quantile models that rely
upon extreme value approximations to the distribution of self-normalized
quantile regression statistics. The methods are simple to implement and can be
of independent interest even in the non-regression case. We illustrate the
results with two empirical examples analyzing extreme fluctuations of a stock
return and extremely low percentiles of live infants' birthweights in the range
between 250 and 1500 grams.
