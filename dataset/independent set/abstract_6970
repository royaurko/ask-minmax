We show that the set of realizations of a given dimension of a max-plus
linear sequence is a finite union of polyhedral sets, which can be computed
from any realization of the sequence. This yields an (expensive) algorithm to
solve the max-plus minimal realization problem. These results are derived from
general facts on rational expressions over idempotent commutative semirings: we
show more generally that the set of values of the coefficients of a commutative
rational expression in one letter that yield a given max-plus linear sequence
is a semi-algebraic set in the max-plus sense. In particular, it is a finite
union of polyhedral sets.
