We consider the multiplicative structure of sets of the form AA+1, where
where A is a large, finite set of real numbers. In particular, we show that the
additively shifted product set, AA+1 must have a large part outside of any
generalized geometric progression of comparable length. We prove an analogous
result in finite fields as well.
