We give a uniform construction that, on input of a recursive presentation $P$
of a group, outputs a recursive presentation $P^{\tf}$ of a torsion-free group,
isomorphic to $P$ whenever $P$ is itself torsion-free. We use this to form a
universal finitely presented torsion-free group; one into which all finitely
presented torsion-free groups embed. We apply our techniques to extend a result
by Lempp that recognising torsion-freeness of finitely presented groups is
$\Pi^{0}_{2}$-complete; we show that recognising embeddability of finitely
presented groups is $\Pi^{0}_{2}$-hard, $\Sigma^{0}_{2}$-hard, and lies in
$\Sigma^{0}_{3}$. We also show that the sets of orders of torsion elements of
finitely presented groups are precisely the $\Sigma^{0}_{2}$ sets which are
factor-complete (i.e. closed under taking factors); by a simple numbering trick
any $\Sigma^{0}_{2}$ set is thus one-one equivalent to the set of orders of
torsion elements of a finitely presented group.
