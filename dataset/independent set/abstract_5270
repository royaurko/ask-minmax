A subset $X$ in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is called a $k$-distance
set if there are exactly $k$ distances between two distinct points in $X$.
Einhorn and Schoenberg conjectured that the vertices of the regular icosahedron
is the only 12-point three-distance set in $\mathbb{R}^3$ up to isomorphism. In
this paper, we prove the uniqueness of 12-point three-distance sets in
$\mathbb{R}^3$.
