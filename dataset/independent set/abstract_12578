This paper describes a practical method of developing custom HPC software
products using a store of libraries and tools independent from the OS called a
"garden". All dependencies from the product to libraries of the underlying OS
distribution are carefully severed, isolating the package from instability due
to system upgrades and ensuring repeatable deterministic builds on different
flavors of Linux. The method also guarantees multiple versions of a software
product may exist together and function correctly, greatly facilitating upgrade
and rollback. The method is the first known system to expose all past software
versions to the designer, and support deterministic single-package rollback
without affecting other installed software. An application of this method for
building a high performance trading system in C++ is presented.
