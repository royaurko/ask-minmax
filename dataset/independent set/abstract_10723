High-precision interpolation of LISA phase measurements allows signal
reconstruction and formulation of Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) combinations
to be conducted in post-processing. The reconstruction is based on phase
measurements made at approximately 10 Hz, at regular intervals independent of
the TDI delay times. Interpolation introduces an error less than 1e-8 with
continuous data segments as short as two seconds in duration. Potential
simplifications in the design and operation of LISA are presented.
