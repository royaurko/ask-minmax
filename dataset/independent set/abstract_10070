In dealing with the problem of recognition of handwritten character patterns
of varying shapes and sizes, selection of a proper feature set is important to
achieve high recognition performance. The current research aims to evaluate the
performance of the convex hull based feature set, i.e. 125 features in all
computed over different bays attributes of the convex hull of a pattern, for
effective recognition of isolated handwritten Bangla basic characters and
digits. On experimentation with a database of 10000 samples, the maximum
recognition rate of 76.86% is observed for handwritten Bangla characters. For
Bangla numerals the maximum success rate of 99.45%. is achieved on a database
of 12000 sample. The current work validates the usefulness of a new kind of
feature set for recognition of handwritten Bangla basic characters and
numerals.
