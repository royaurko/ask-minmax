The spatial distribution of interacting chemical fields is investigated in
the non-diffusive limit. The evolution of fluid parcels is described by
independent dynamical systems driven by chaotic advection. The distribution can
be filamental or smooth depending on the relative strength of the dispersion
due to chaotic advection and the stability of the chemical dynamics. We give
the condition for the smooth-filamental transition and relate the H\"older
exponent of the filamental structure to the Lyapunov exponents. Theoretical
findings are illustrated by numerical experiments.
