We consider three types of multivariate records in this paper and derive the
mean and the variance of their numbers for independent and uniform random
samples from two prototype regions: hypercubes $[0,1]^d$ and $d$-dimensional
simplex. Central limit theorems with convergence rates are established when the
variance tends to infinity. Effective numerical procedures are also provided
for computing the variance constants to high degree of precision.
