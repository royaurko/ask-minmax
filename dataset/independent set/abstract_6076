For the nonparametric estimation of multivariate finite mixture models with
the conditional independence assumption, we propose a new formulation of the
objective function in terms of penalized smoothed Kullback-Leibler distance.
The nonlinear majorization-minimization smoothing algorithm (NMMS) is derived
from this perspective. A more precise monotonicity property of the algorithm is
discovered and the existence of a solution to the main optimization problem is
proved for the first time.
