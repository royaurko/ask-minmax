We establish a boundary Harnack principle for a large class of subordinate
Brownian motion, including mixtures of symmetric stable processes, in bounded
$\kappa$-fat open set (disconnected analogue of John domains). As an
application of the boundary Harnack principle, we identify the Martin boundary
and the minimal Martin boundary of bounded $\kappa$-fat open sets with respect
to these processes with their Euclidean boundary.
