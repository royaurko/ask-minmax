We present preliminary results from our on-going survey of Galactic globular
clusters relative ages. The investigation is based on V,I images obtained at
the ESO and La Palma telescopes, which make up the largest homogenous
photometric catalog to date. A second, independent sample of globulars observed
in the B, V bands provides an independent check of the results based on the
groundbased data.
  Age-dependent morphological parameters are measured on the CMDs and are
compared with two sets of independent models. We find that the so-called
``vertical'' and ``horizontal'' methods give compatible results when the
groundbased dataset is used, and that in both cases the observed trends are
well reproduced by the isochrones. The interpretation of the HST data trends
are more controversial, due to both a stronger dependence on metallicity, and
to the discrepancies in the theoretical loci.
  Our data clearly show that (a) no age dispersion can be revealed for the bulk
of the GGCs at the ~1 Gyr level; (b) no age-metallicity relation is found,
although the age dispersion is somwhat larger for intermediate and higher
metallicity clusters; and (c) there is no clear trend with the galactocentric
distance, out to the present limits of our survey (R(GC) < 22 Kpc).
