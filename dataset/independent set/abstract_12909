In this paper, we study a class of multi-dimensional reflected backward
stochastic differential equations when the noise is driven by a Brownian motion
and an independent Poisson point process, and when the solution is forced to
stay in a time-dependent adapted and continuous convex domain ${\cal{D}}=\{D_t,
t\in[0,T]\}$. We prove the existence an uniqueness of the solution, and we also
show that the solution of such equations may be approximated by backward
stochastic differential equations with jumps reflected in appropriately defined
discretizations of $\cal{D}$, via a penalization method.
