We demonstrate that semiconductor nanowires measuring just a few nanometers
in diameter can be translated, rotated, cut, fused and organized into
nontrivial structures using holographic optical traps. The holographic approach
to nano-assembly allows for simultaneous independent manipulation of multiple
nanowires, including relative translation and relative rotation.
