In this letter, we consider two sets of observations defined as subspace
signals embedded in noise and we wish to analyze the distance between these two
subspaces. The latter entails evaluating the angles between the subspaces, an
issue reminiscent of the well-known Procrustes problem. A Bayesian approach is
investigated where the subspaces of interest are considered as random with a
joint prior distribution (namely a Bingham distribution), which allows the
closeness of the two subspaces to be adjusted. Within this framework, the
minimum mean-square distance estimator of both subspaces is formulated and
implemented via a Gibbs sampler. A simpler scheme based on alternative maximum
a posteriori estimation is also presented. The new schemes are shown to provide
more accurate estimates of the angles between the subspaces, compared to
singular value decomposition based independent estimation of the two subspaces.
