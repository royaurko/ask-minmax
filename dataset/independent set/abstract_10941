Model independent radiative correction to the recoil proton polarization for
the elastic electron-proton scattering is calculated within method of electron
structure functions. The explicit expressions for the recoil proton
polarization are represented as a contraction of the electron structure and the
hard part of the polarization dependent contribution into cross-section. The
calculation of the hard part with first order radiative correction is
performed. The obtained representation includes the leading radiative
corrections in all orders of perturbation theory and the main part of the
second order next-to-leading ones. Numerical calculations illustrate our
analytical results.
