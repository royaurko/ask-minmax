Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold and $P_g$ an elliptic, formally
self-adjoint, conformally covariant operator of order $m$ acting on smooth
sections of a bundle over $M$. We prove that if $P_g$ has no rigid eigenspaces
(see Definition 2.2), the set of functions $f \in C^\infty(M, R)$ for which
$P_{e^fg}$ has only simple non-zero eigenvalues is a residual set in
$C^\infty(M,R)$. As a consequence we prove that if $P_g$ has no rigid
eigenspaces for a dense set of metrics, then all non-zero eigenvalues are
simple for a residual set of metrics in the $C^m$-topology. We also prove that
the eigenvalues of $P_g$ depend continuously on $g$ in the $C^m$-topology,
provided $P_g$ is strongly elliptic. As an application of our work, we show
that if $P_g$ acts on $C^\infty(M)$ (e.g. GJMS operators), its non-zero
eigenvalues are generically simple.
