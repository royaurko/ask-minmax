The recent increase in dimensionality of data has thrown a great challenge to
the existing dimensionality reduction methods in terms of their effectiveness.
Dimensionality reduction has emerged as one of the significant preprocessing
steps in machine learning applications and has been effective in removing
inappropriate data, increasing learning accuracy, and improving
comprehensibility. Feature redundancy exercises great influence on the
performance of classification process. Towards the better classification
performance, this paper addresses the usefulness of truncating the highly
correlated and redundant attributes. Here, an effort has been made to verify
the utility of dimensionality reduction by applying LVQ (Learning Vector
Quantization) method on two Benchmark datasets of 'Pima Indian Diabetic
patients' and 'Lung cancer patients'.
