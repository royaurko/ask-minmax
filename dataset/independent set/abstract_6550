The critical set C of the operator F:H^2_D([0,pi]) -> L^2([0,pi]) defined by
F(u)=-u''+f(u) is studied. Here X:=H^2_D([0,pi]) stands for the set of
functions that satisfy the Dirichlet boundary conditions and whose derivatives
are in L^2([0,pi]). For generic nonlinearities f, C=\cup C_k decomposes into
manifolds of codimension 1 in X. If f''<0 or f''>0, the set C_j is shown to be
non-empty if, and only if, -j^2 (the j-th eigenvalue of u -> u'') is in the
range of f'. The critical components C_k are (topological) hyperplanes.
