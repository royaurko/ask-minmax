We define the symplectic displacement energy of a non-empty subset of a
compact symplectic manifold as the infimum of the Hofer-like norm [5] of
symplectic diffeomorphisms that displace the set. We show that this energy
(like the usual displacement energy defined using Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms)
is a strictly positive number on sets with non-empty interior. As a consequence
we prove a result justifying the introduction of the notion of strong
symplectic homeomorphisms [4].
