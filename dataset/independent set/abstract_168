Recently Blondel, Nesterov and Protasov proved that the finiteness conjecture
holds for the generalized and the lower spectral radii of the sets of
non-negative matrices with independent row/column uncertainty. We show that
this result can be obtained as a simple consequence of the so-called hourglass
alternative earlier used by the contributor and his companions to analyze the
minimax relations between the spectral radii of matrix products. Axiomatization
of the statements that constitute the hourglass alternative makes it possible
to define a new class of sets of positive matrices having the finiteness
property, which includes the sets of non-negative matrices with independent row
uncertainty. This class of matrices, supplemented by the zero and identity
matrices, forms a semiring with the Minkowski operations of addition and
multiplication of matrix sets, which gives means to construct new sets of
non-negative matrices possessing the finiteness property for the generalized
and the lower spectral radii.
