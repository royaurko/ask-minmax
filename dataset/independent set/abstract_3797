Using Kontsevich's identification of the homology of the Lie algebra l_infty
with the cohomology of Out(F_r), Morita defined a sequence of 4k-dimensional
classes mu_k in the unstable rational homology of Out(F_{2k+2}). He showed by a
computer calculation that the first of these is non-trivial, so coincides with
the unique non-trivial rational homology class for Out(F_4). Using the
"forested graph complex" introduced in [Algebr. Geom. Topol. 3 (2003)
1167--1224], we reinterpret and generalize Morita's cycles, obtaining an
unstable cycle for every connected odd-valent graph. (Morita has independently
found similar generalizations of these cycles.) The description of Morita's
original cycles becomes quite simple in this interpretation, and we are able to
show that the second Morita cycle also gives a nontrivial homology class.
Finally, we view things from the point of view of a different chain complex,
one which is associated to Bestvina and Feighn's bordification of outer space.
We construct cycles which appear to be the same as the Morita cycles
constructed in the first part of the paper. In this setting, a further
generalization becomes apparent, giving cycles for objects more general than
odd-valent graphs. Some of these cycles lie in the stable range. We also
observe that these cycles lift to cycles for Aut(F_r).
