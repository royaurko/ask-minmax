We report results from a search for neutral Higgs bosons decaying to tau
pairs produced in association with a b-quark in 1.2/fb of data taken from June
2006 to August 2007 with the D0 detector at Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory. The final state includes a muon, hadronically decaying tau and jet
identified as coming from a $b$-quark. We set cross section times branching
ratio limits on production of such neutral Higgs bosons in the mass range from
90 GeV/c^2 to 160 GeV/c^2. Exclusion limits are set at the 95% Confidence Level
for several supersymmetric scenarios.
