We present a method for measuring nuclear-spin-dependent atomic parity
violation without nuclear-spin-independent background. Such measurements can be
achieved by observing interference of parity-conserving and parity-violating
two-photon J=0-to-1 transitions driven by collinear photons of the same
frequency in the presence of an external static magnetic field.
