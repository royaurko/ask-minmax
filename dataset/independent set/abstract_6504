We investigate charge and valley conductances along with the tunnelling
magneto-resistance (TMR) in silicene junctions composed of normal silicene and
ferromagnetic silicene. We show distinct features of the conductances and the
TMR, as the ferromagnetic-normal-ferromagnetic (FNF) junction is tuned by an
external electric field. We analyse the behaviour of the charge and valley
conductances in terms of the independent conductances at the two valleys and
the band structure of ferromagnetic silicene and show how the conductances are
affected by the vanishing of the propagating states at one or the other valley.
In particular, unlike in graphene, the band structure at the two valleys are
independently affected by the spin in the ferromagnetic regions and lead to
non-zero valley conductances, which can be tuned by the external electric
field. We also investigate the oscillatory behavior of the TMR with respect to
the barrier potential in the presence of spin-independent as well as
spin-dependent barriers in the normal silicene region and note that the TMR can
even go from positive to negative values, as a function of the external
electric field.
