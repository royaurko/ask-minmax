Mixed mode (I+III) loading induces segmented crack front \'echelon structures
connected by steps. We study this instability in a highly deformable,
strain-hardening material. We find that \'echelons develop beyond a finite,
size-independent mode mixity threshold, markedly growing with energy release
rate. They appear via nucleation of localized helical front distortions, and
their emergence is the continuation of the mode I cross-hatching instability of
gels and rubbers, shifted by the biasing effect of shear. This result, at odds
with the direct bifurcation predicted by linear elastic fracture mechanics, can
be assigned to the controlling role of elastic nonlinearity.
