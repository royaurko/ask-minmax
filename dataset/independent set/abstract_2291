We present a study of the effects of non-stoichiometry, boron purity, wire
diameter and post-synthesis treatment (etching and Mg distilling) on the
temperature dependent resistance and resistivity of sintered MgB2 pellets and
wire segments. Whereas the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) varies between RRR
\~ 4 to RRR > 20 for different boron purity, it is only moderately affected by
non-stoichiometry (from 20% Mg deficiency to 20% Mg excess) and is apparently
independent of wire diameter and presence of Mg metal traces on the wire
surface. The obtained set of data indicates that RRR values in excess of 20 and
residual resistivities as low as rho{0} ~ 0.4 mu Ohm cm are intrinsic material
properties of high purity MgB2.
