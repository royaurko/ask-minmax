We calculate the thermopower of monolayer graphene in various circumstances.
First we show that experiments on the thermopower of graphene can be understood
quantitatively with a very simple model of screening in the semiclassical
limit. We can calculate the energy dependent scattering time for this model
exactly. We then consider acoustic phonon scattering which might be the
operative scattering mechanism in free standing films, and predict that the
thermopower will be linear in any induced gap in the system. Further, the
thermopower peaks at the same value of chemical potential (tunable by gate
voltage) independent of the gap. Finally, we show that in the semiclassical
approximation, the thermopower in a magnetic field saturates at high field to a
value which can be calculated exactly and is independent of the details of the
scattering. This effect might be observable experimentally.
