Possible universal dynamics of a many-body system far from thermal
equilibrium are explored. A focus is set on meta-stable non-thermal states
exhibiting critical properties such as self-similarity and independence of the
details of how the respective state has been reached. It is proposed that
universal dynamics far from equilibrium can be tuned to exhibit a dynamical
phase transition where these critical properties change qualitatively. This is
demonstrated for the case of a superfluid two-component Bose gas exhibiting
different types of long-lived but non-thermal critical order. Scaling exponents
controlled by the ratio of experimentally tuneable coupling parameters offer
themselves as natural smoking guns. The results shed light on the wealth of
universal phenomena expected to exist in the far-from-equilibrium realm.
