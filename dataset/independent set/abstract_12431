We study the inhomogeneous chiral condensates in the proximity of the chiral
tricritical point (TCP) of two-flavor QCD. Deriving the Ginzburg-Landau (GL)
functional up to the eighth order in the order parameter and its spatial
derivative, we explore off the TCP and find that critical curves are bent by
non-linear effects. In the newly extend GL coupling space, we find the TCP
being realized as a multicritical point where five independent critical lines
meet up. We also present general analyses for the energies associated with
several higher dimensional crystal structures.
