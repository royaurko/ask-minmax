This paper presents a hierarchical Bayesian approach to the estimation of
components' reliability (survival) using a Weibull model for each of them. The
proposed method can be used to estimation with general survival censored data,
because the estimation of a component's reliability in a series (parallel)
system is equivalent to the estimation of its survival function with right-
(left-) censored data. Besides the Weibull parametric model for reliability
data, independent gamma distributions are considered at the first hierarchical
level for the Weibull parameters and independent uniform distributions over the
real line as priors for the parameters of the gammas. In order to evaluate the
model, an example and a simulation study are discussed.
