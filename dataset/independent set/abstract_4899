Let $\xi(k,n)$ be the local time of a simple symmetric random walk on the
line. We give a strong approximation of the centered local time process
$\xi(k,n)-\xi(0,n)$ in terms of a Wiener sheet and an independent Wiener
process, time changed by an independent Brownian local time. Some related
results and consequences are also established.
