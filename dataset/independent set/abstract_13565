A generalization of the multiphase chemical evolution model applied to a wide
set of theoretical galaxies is shown. This set of models has been computed by
using the so-called Universal Rotation Curve from Persic, Salucci & Steel to
calculate the radial mass distributions of each theoretical galaxy. By assuming
that the molecular cloud and star formation efficiencies depend on the
morphological type of each galaxy, we construct a bi-parametric grid of models
whose results are valid in principle for any spiral galaxy, of given maximum
rotation velocity or total mass, and morphological type.
