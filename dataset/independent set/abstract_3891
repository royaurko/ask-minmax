We introduce and implement a new, extended approach to placing bounds on
trilinear R-parity violating couplings. We focus on a limited set of leptonic
and semi-leptonic processes involving neutrinos, combining multidimensional
plotting and cross-checking constraints from different experiments. This allows
us to explore new regions of parameter space and to relax a number of bounds
given in the literature. We look for qualitatively different results compared
to those obtained previously using the assumption that a single coupling
dominates the R-parity violating contributions to a process (SCD). By combining
results from several experiments, we identify regions in parameter space where
two or more parameters approach their maximally allowed values. In the same
vein, we show a circumstance where consistency between independent bounds on
the same combinations of trilinear coupling parameters implies mass constraints
among slepton or squark masses. Though our new bounds are in most cases weaker
than the SCD bounds, the largest deviations we find on individual parameters
are factors of two, thus indicating that a conservative, order of magnitude
bound on an individual coupling is reliably estimated by making the SCD
assumption.
