We present updated predictions for single top-quark production in hadronic
collisions. The analysis is based on next-to-leading order QCD calculations.
The input parameters are fixed to recent measurements. We compare different PDF
sets and investigate the related uncertainties. The impact of uncalculated
higher orders is estimated using an independent variation of the
renormalisation and factorisation scale. The theoretical predictions are
compared with recent measurements from Tevatron and LHC. Furthermore, the cross
section measurements are used to estimate the top-quark mass. To perform the
analysis we extended the publicly available HatHor program to single top-quark
production. We thus provide a unified framework for the fast numerical
evaluation of total cross sections for top-quark production, which may be used
for example in Standard Model fits. For future extensions towards NNLO
accuracy, we include already all scale dependent terms at NNLO. We briefly
describe how to use the program and provide all required tools to repeat the
aforementioned analysis.
