New set of wavenumber values for electronic-vibro-rotational (rovibronic)
transitions in limited part of the emission spectrum of the $D_2$ molecule
($545 \div 627$ nm) have been measured with a precision $0.007 \div 0.1$
cm$^{-1}$ depending on the translational temperature in plasma, the
signal-to-noise ratio, and the degree of overlap with adjacent spectral lines.
For the first time partly resolved fine structure of the $D_2$ spectral lines
has been observed in the visible part of the spectrum.
