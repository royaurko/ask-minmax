We derive stringy symmetries with conserved charges of arbitrarily high spins
from the decoupling of two types of zero-norm states in the old covariant first
quantized (OCFQ) spectrum of open bosonic string. These symmetries are valid to
all energy and all loop orders in string perturbation theory. The high-energy
limit of these stringy symmetries can then be used to fix the proportionality
constants between scattering amplitudes of different string states
algebraically without referring to Gross and Mende's saddle point calculation
of high-energy string-loop amplitudes. These proportionality constants are, as
conjectured by Gross, independent of the scattering angle and the order of
string perturbation theory. However, we also discover some new nonzero
components of high-energy amplitudes not found previously by Gross and Manes.
These components are essential to preserve massive gauge invariances or
decouple massive zero-norm states of string theory. A set of massive scattering
amplitudes and their high energy limit are calculated explicitly to justify our
results.
