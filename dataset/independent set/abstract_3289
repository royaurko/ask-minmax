The physical properties of the so-called Ostriker isothermal, non-rotating
filament have been classically used as benchmark to interpret the stability of
the filaments observed in nearby clouds. However, such static picture seems to
contrast with the more dynamical state observed in different filaments. In
order to explore the physical conditions of filaments under realistic
conditions, in this work we theoretically investigate how the equilibrium
structure of a filament changes in a rotating configuration. To do so, we solve
the hydrostatic equilibrium equation assuming both uniform and differential
rotations independently. We obtain a new set of equilibrium solutions for
rotating and pressure truncated filaments. These new equilibrium solutions are
found to present both radial and projected column density profiles shallower
than their Ostriker-like counterparts. Moreover, and for rotational periods
similar to those found in the observations, the centrifugal forces present in
these filaments are also able to sustain large amounts of mass (larger than the
mass attained by the Ostriker filament) without being necessary unstable. Our
results indicate that further analysis on the physical state of star-forming
filaments should take into account rotational effects as stabilizing agents
against gravity
