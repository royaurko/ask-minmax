We study energy minimization for pair potentials among periodic sets in
Euclidean spaces. We derive some sufficient conditions under which a point
lattice locally minimizes the energy associated to a large class of potential
functions. This allows in particular to prove a local version of Cohn and
Kumar's conjecture that $\mathsf{A}_2$, $\mathsf{D}_4$, $\mathsf{E}_8$ and the
Leech lattice are globally universally optimal, regarding energy minimization,
and among periodic sets of fixed point density.
