Research has linked a student's affect to her epistemology (Boaler & Greeno,
2000), but those constructs often apply broadly to a discipline and/or
classroom culture. Independently, an emerging line of research shows that a
student in a given classroom and discipline can shift between multiple locally
coherent epistemological stances (Hammer, Elby, Scherr, & Redish, 2005). Our
case study of Judy, an undergraduate engineering major, begins our long-term
effort at uniting these two bodies of literature.
