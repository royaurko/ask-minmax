It is shown that the 1S level hyperfine populations prior to muon capture
will be statistical when either target or beam are unpolarised independent of
the atomic level at which the hyperfine interaction becomes appreciable. This
assertion holds in the absence of magnetic transitions during the cascade and
is true because of minimal polarisation after atomic capture and selective
feeding during the cascade.
