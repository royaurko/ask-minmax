The algebra Mul[[B]] of formal multilinear function series over an algebra B
and its quotient SymMul[[B]] are introduced, as well as corresponding
operations of formal composition. In the setting of Mul[[B]], the unsymmetrized
R- and T-transforms of random variables in B-valued noncommutative probability
spaces are introduced. These satisfy properties analogous to the usual R- and
T-transforms, (the latter being just the reciprocal of the S-transform), but
describe all moments of a random variable, not only the symmetric moments. The
partially ordered set of noncrossing linked partitions is introduced and is
used to prove properties of the unsymmetrized T-transform.
