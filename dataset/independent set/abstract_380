We study the asymptotic of the spectral distribution for large empirical
covariance matrices composed of independent Multifractal Random Walk processes.
The asymptotic is taken as the observation lag shrinks to 0. In this setting,
we show that there exists a limiting spectral distribution whose Stieltjes
transform is uniquely characterized by equations which we specify. We also
illustrate our results by numerical simulations.
