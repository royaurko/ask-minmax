The classical random matrix theory is mostly focused on asymptotic spectral
properties of random matrices as their dimensions grow to infinity. At the same
time many recent applications from convex geometry to functional analysis to
information theory operate with random matrices in fixed dimensions. This
survey addresses the non-asymptotic theory of extreme singular values of random
matrices with independent entries. We focus on recently developed geometric
methods for estimating the hard edge of random matrices (the smallest singular
value).
