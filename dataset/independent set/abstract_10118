We consider the classical $k$-means clustering problem in the setting
bi-criteria approximation, in which an algoithm is allowed to output $\beta k >
k$ clusters, and must produce a clustering with cost at most $\alpha$ times the
to the cost of the optimal set of $k$ clusters. We argue that this approach is
natural in many settings, for which the exact number of clusters is a priori
unknown, or unimportant up to a constant factor. We give new bi-criteria
approximation algorithms, based on linear programming and local search,
respectively, which attain a guarantee $\alpha(\beta)$ depending on the number
$\beta k$ of clusters that may be opened. Our gurantee $\alpha(\beta)$ is
always at most $9 + \epsilon$ and improves rapidly with $\beta$ (for example:
$\alpha(2)<2.59$, and $\alpha(3) < 1.4$). Moreover, our algorithms have only
polynomial dependence on the dimension of the input data, and so are applicable
in high-dimensional settings.
