Electronic structure of graphene monolayer-bilayer junction in a magnetic
field is studied within an effective-mass approximation. The energy spectrum is
characterized by interface Landau levels, i.e., the locally flat bands
appearing near the boundary region, resulting in a series of characteristic
peaks in the local density of states. Their energies are independent of
boundary types such as zigzag or armchair. In the atomic scale, the local
density of states shows a Kekul\'{e} pattern due to the valley mixing in the
armchair boundary, while does not in the zigzag boundary.
