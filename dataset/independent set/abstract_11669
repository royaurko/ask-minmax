We study the transmission of a tightly focused beam through a thick slab of
3D disordered medium in the Anderson localized regime. We show that the
transverse profile of the transmitted beam exhibits clear signatures of
Anderson localization and that its mean square width provides a direct measure
of the localization length. For a short incident pulse, the width is
independent of absorption.
