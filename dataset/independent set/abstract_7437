A locally recoverable code (LRC code) is a code over a finite alphabet such
that every symbol in the encoding is a function of a small number of other
symbols that form a recovering set. In this paper we derive new finite-length
and asymptotic bounds on the parameters of LRC codes. For LRC codes with a
single recovering set for every coordinate, we derive an asymptotic
Gilbert-Varshamov type bound for LRC codes and find the maximum attainable
relative distance of asymptotically good LRC codes. Similar results are
established for LRC codes with two disjoint recovering sets for every
coordinate. For the case of multiple recovering sets we derive a lower bound on
the parameters using expander graph arguments. Finally, we also derive
finite-length upper bounds on the rate and distance of LRC codes with multiple
recovering sets.
