We report on the status of a direct computation of the time-like splitting
functions at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD. Time-like splitting
functions govern the collinear kinematics of inclusive hadron production and
the evolution of the parton fragmentation distributions. Current knowledge
about them at three loops has been inferred by means of crossing symmetry from
their related space-like counterparts, which has left certain parts of the
off-diagonal quark-gluon splitting function undetermined. This motivates an
independent calculation from first principles. We review the tools and methods
which are applied to attack the problem.
