The study of patterns in permutations in a very active area of current
research. Klazar defined and studied an analogous notion of pattern for set
partitions. We continue this work, finding exact formulas for the number of set
partitions which avoid certain specific patterns. In particular, we enumerate
and characterize those partitions avoiding any partition of a 3-element set.
This allows us to conclude that the corresponding sequences are P-recursive.
Finally, we define a second notion of pattern in a set partition, based on its
restricted growth function. Related results are obtained for this new
definition.
