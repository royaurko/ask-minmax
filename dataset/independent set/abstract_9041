A linear algebraic method named the shifted
conjugate-orthogonal-conjugate-gradient method is introduced for large-scale
electronic structure calculation. The method gives an iterative solver
algorithm of the Green's function and the density matrix without calculating
eigenstates.The problem is reduced to independent linear equations at many
energy points and the calculation is actually carried out only for a single
energy point. The method is robust against the round-off error and the
calculation can reach the machine accuracy. With the observation of residual
vectors, the accuracy can be controlled, microscopically, independently for
each element of the Green's function, and dynamically, at each step in
dynamical simulations. The method is applied to both semiconductor and metal.
