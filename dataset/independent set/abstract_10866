Various methods of implementing the Bose-Einstein effect into Monte Carlo
generators, especially for the process e^+ e^- > W^+ W^-, are briefly reviewed
and their predictions for the W mass shifts are compared. The weight methods,
which yield very similar predictions independent on the detailed prescription
for weights, are discussed in more detail. In particular, we advocate a new
method, which seems to be practical and reasonably well justified
theoretically.
