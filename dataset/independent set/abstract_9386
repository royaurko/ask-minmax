In the anomaly-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking scenario, neutral
gaugino of SU(2)_L multiplet, Wino, can be the lightest SUSY particle and
become a candidate for dark matter. We calculated scattering cross section of
Wino dark matter with nucleon, which is responsible for direct detection of the
dark matter, on the assumption that the SUSY particles and the heavier Higgs
bosons have masses of the order of the gravitino mass in the SUSY standard
model. In such a case, the Wino-nucleon coupling is generated by loop
processes. We have included two-loop contribution to Wino-gluon interaction in
the calculation, since it is one of the leading contributions to the
Wino-nucleon coupling. It was found that the spin-independent scattering cross
section with proton is 10^-(46-48) cm^2. While it is almost independent of the
Wino mass, the result is quite sensitive to the Higgs boson mass due to the
accidental cancellation.
