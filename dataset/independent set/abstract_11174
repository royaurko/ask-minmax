We use the conformal Ward identities to study the structure of correlation
functions in coset conformal field theories. For a large class of primary
fields of arbitrary g/h theory a factorization anzatz is found.Corresponding
correlation functions are explicitly expressed in terms of correlation
functions of two independent WZNW theories for g and h.
