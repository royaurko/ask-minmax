Contrary to common belief, both the Earth's human population and its economic
output have grown faster than exponential, i.e., in a super-Malthusian mode,
for most of the known history. These growth rates are compatible with a
spontaneous singularity occuring at the same critical time 2052 +- 10 signaling
an abrupt transition to a new regime. The degree of abruptness can be infered
from the fact that the maximum of the world population growth rate was reached
in 1970, i.e., about 80 years before the predicted singular time, corresponding
to approximately 4% of the studied time interval over which the acceleration is
documented. This rounding-off of the finite-time singularity is probably due to
a combination of well-known finite-size effects and friction and suggests that
we have already entered the transition region to a new regime. In theoretical
support, a multivariate analysis coupling population, capital, R&D and
technology shows that a dramatic acceleration in the population during most of
the timespan can occur even though the isolated dynamics do not exhibit it.
Possible scenarios for the cross-over and the new regime are discussed.
Nottale, Chaline and Grou have recently independently applied a log-periodic
analysis to the main crises of different civilisations. It is striking that
these two independent analyses based on a different data set gives a critical
time which is compatible within the error bars.
