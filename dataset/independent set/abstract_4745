Balanced Viscosity solutions to rate-independent systems arise as limits of
regularized rate-independent flows by adding a superlinear vanishing-viscosity
dissipation.
  We address the main issue of proving the existence of such limits for
infinite-dimensional systems and of characterizing them by a couple of
variational properties that combine a local stability condition and a balanced
energy-dissipation identity.
  A careful description of the jump behavior of the solutions, of their
differentiability properties, and of their equivalent representation by time
rescaling is also presented.
  Our techniques rely on a suitable chain-rule inequality for functions of
bounded variation in Banach spaces, on refined lower semicontinuity-compactness
arguments, and on new BV-estimates that are of independent interest.
