We study models of HST, a nonstandard set theory which includes, in
particular, the ZFC Replacement and Separation schemata in the language
containing the membership and standardness predicates, and Saturation for
well-orderable families of internal sets.
  This theory admits an adequate formulation of the isomorphism property IP:
"any two elementarily equivalent internally presented structures of a
wellorderable language are isomorphic."
  IP implies, for instance, that all infinite internal sets are
equinumerous, and there exists a unique (modulo isomorphisms) internal
elementary extension of the standard reals.
  We prove that IP is independent of HST (using the class of all sets
constructible from internal sets) and consistent with HST (using generic
extensions of $\HST$ models by a sufficient number of generic isomorphisms).
