In this article, basing on NQD samples, we investigate the fixed design
nonparametric regression model, where the errors are pairwise NQD random
errors, with fixed design points, and an unknown function. Nonparametric
weighted estimator will be introduced and its consistency is studied. As
special case, the consistency result for weighted kernel estimators of the
model is obtained. This extends the earlier work on independent random and
dependent random errors to NQD case.
