Let k be an arbitrary field and Q an acyclic quiver of tame type. Consider
the path algebra kQ and the category of finite dimensional right modules Mod
kQ. In the first part of the paper we deduce that the Gabriel-Roiter inclusions
in preprojective indecomposables and simple homogeneous regulars (with
dimension the minimal radical vector) as well as their Gabriel-Roiter measures
are field independent. Using this result we can prove in a more general setting
a theorem by Bo Chen which states that the Gabriel-Roiter submodule of a simple
homogeneous regular (with dimension the minimal radical vector) is a
preprojective indecomposable of defect -1. The generalization consists in
considering the originally missing case $\tilde E_8$ and using arbitrary fields
(instead of algebraically closed ones). Our proof is based on the idea of
Ringel (used in the Dynkin quiver context) of comparing all possible
Ringel-Hall polynomials with the special form they take in case of a
Gabriel-Roiter inclusion. For this purpose we compute (using a program written
in GAP) a list of useful Ringel-Hall polynomials in tame cases.
