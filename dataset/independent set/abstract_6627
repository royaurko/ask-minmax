An explanation is given for the initially surprising ubiquity of separating
sets in normal complex surface germs. It is shown that they are quite common in
higher dimensions too. The relationship between separating sets and the
geometry of the metric tangent cone of Bernig and Lytchak is described.
Moreover, separating sets are used to show that the inner Lipschitz type need
not be constant in a family of normal complex surface germs of constant
topology.
