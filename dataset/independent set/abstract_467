We introduce the Plancherel measure on the set of partition collections,
which parameterize irreducible representations of order n general linear group
over a finite field. We prove that as n goes to infinity, the random partitions
from the random collections converge in finite dimencional distribution to
independent random variables. We give explicit formulas for the corresponding
limit distributions.
