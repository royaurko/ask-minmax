Based on the assumption that some apparent properties of the observable
universe are accurate at a reasonable level of approximation, a tentative is
made to independently derive the values of the baryon density parameter, the
Hubble constant, the cosmic microwave background temperature and the helium
mass fraction. The obtained values are in excellent agreement with those given
by the most recent observational data.
