The symmetries inherent to the nuclear version of the Schr\"odinger
wave-equation are identical to the symmetries of a face-centered cubic lattice,
as already noted by Wigner in 1937 in the initial development of the
independent-particle model (IPM) of nuclear structure. The significance of the
identity is that it implies a high-density version of the IPM that has the
gross properties of a liquid-drop, rather than a diffuse, chaotic gas of
nucleons. As a consequence, all of the predictive strengths of the liquid-drop
model (binding energies, radii, nuclear densities, vibrational states, etc.)
and the "independent-particle" predictions of the IPM (nuclear spins, parities,
magnetic moments, etc.) are retained in the lattice.
