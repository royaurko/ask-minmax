A general formalism for double and triple spin-correlations of the reaction
NN -> DeltaN is developed for the case of collinear kinematics. A complete
polarization experiment allowing to reconstruct all of the four amplitudes
describing this process is suggested. Furthermore, the spin observables of the
inelastic charge-exchange reaction pd -> Delta^0(pp)(1S0) are analyzed in
collinear kinematics within the single pN scattering mechanism involving the
subprocess pn -> Delta^0p. The full set of spin observables related to the
polarization of one or two initial particles and one final particle is obtained
in terms of three invariant amplitudes of the reaction pd -> Delta (pp)(1S0)
and the transition form factor d->(pp)(1S0). A complete polarization experiment
for the reaction pd -> Delta^0(pp)(1S0) is suggested which allows one to
determine three independent combinations of the four amplitudes of the
elementary subprocess NN -> DeltaN.
