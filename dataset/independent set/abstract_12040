We measured the decay time of the scintillation pulses produced by electron
and nuclear recoils in CaF2(Eu) by a new fitting method. In the recoil energy
region 5-30 keVee, we found differences of the decay time between electron and
nuclear recoil events. In the recoil energy region above 20 keVee, we found
that the decay time is independent of the recoil energy.
