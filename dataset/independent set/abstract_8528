We show that if an automorphism of a standard Borel space does not admit
finite invariant measures, then it has a two-set generator modulo the
sigma-ideal generated by wandering sets. This implies that if the entropies of
invariant probability measures of a Borel system are all less than log(k), then
the system admits a k-set generator, and that a wide class of hyperbolic-like
systems are classified completely at the Borel level by entropy and periodic
points counts.
