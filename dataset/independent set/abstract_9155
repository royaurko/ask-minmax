We discuss if one can verify the MSW effect in neutrino oscillations at a
high confidence level in long-baseline experiments. We demonstrate that for
long enough baselines at neutrino factories, the matter effect sensitivity is,
as opposed to the mass hierarchy sensitivity, not suppressed by $\sin^2 2
\theta_{13}$ because it is driven by the solar oscillations in the appearance
probability. Furthermore, we show that for the parameter independent direct
verification of the MSW effect at long-baseline experiments, a neutrino factory
with a baseline of at least 6000 km is needed. For superbeams, we do not find a
$5\sigma$ discovery potential of the MSW effect independent of $\sin^2 2
\theta_{13}$. We finally summarize different methods to test the MSW effect.
