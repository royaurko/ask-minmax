We consider the distribution of the sum and the maximum of a collection of
independent exponentially distributed random variables. The focus is laid on
the explicit form of the density functions (pdf) of non-i.i.d. sequences. Those
are recovered in a simple and direct way based on conditioning. A connection
between the pdf and a representation of the convolution characteristic function
as a linear combination of the single characteristic functions is drawn. It is
demonstrated how the results on the pdf of order statistics and the convolution
merge.
