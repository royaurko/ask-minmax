The asymptotic tail behaviour of sums of independent subexponential random
variables is well understood, one of the main characteristics being the
principle of the single big jump. We study the case of dependent subexponential
random variables, for both deterministic and random sums, using a fresh
approach, by considering conditional independence structures on the random
variables. We seek sufficient conditions for the results of the theory with
independent random variables still to hold. For a subexponential distribution,
we introduce the concept of a boundary class of functions, which we hope will
be a useful tool in studying many aspects of subexponential random variables.
The examples we give in the paper demonstrate a variety of effects owing to the
dependence, and are also interesting in their own right.
