We discuss the GW/DT correspondence for 3-folds in both the absolute and
relative cases. Descendents in Gromov-Witten theory are conjectured to be
equivalent to Chern characters of the universal sheaf in Donaldson-Thomas
theory. Relative constraints in Gromov-Witten theory are conjectured to
correspond in Donaldson-Thomas theory to cohomology classes of the Hilbert
scheme of points of the relative divisor. Independent of the conjectural
framework, we prove degree 0 formulas for the absolute and relative
Donaldson-Thomas theories of toric varieties.
