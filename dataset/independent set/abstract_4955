One says that a property $P$ of sets of natural numbers can be made into
itself iff there is a numbering $\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\ldots$ of all left-r.e.
sets such that the index set $\{e: \alpha_e$ satisfies $P\}$ has the property
$P$ as well. For example, the property of being Martin-L\"of random can be made
into itself. Herein we characterize those singleton properties which can be
made into themselves. A second direction of the present work is the
investigation of the structure of left-r.e. sets under inclusion modulo a
finite set. In contrast to the corresponding structure for r.e. sets, which has
only maximal but no minimal members, both minimal and maximal left-r.e. sets
exist. Moreover, our construction of minimal and maximal left-r.e. sets greatly
differs from Friedberg's classical construction of maximal r.e. sets. Finally,
we investigate whether the properties of minimal and maximal left-r.e. sets can
be made into themselves.
