We introduce, on a complex Kahler manifold (M,\omega), a notion of energy for
harmonic currents of bidegree (1,1). This allows us to define $\int T \wedge T
\wedge \omega^{k-2},$ for positive harmonic currents. We then show that for a
lamination with singularities of a compact set in P^2 there is a unique
positive harmonic current which minimizes energy. If X is a compact laminated
set in P^2 of class C^1 it carries a unique positive harmonic current T of mass
1. The current T can be obtained by an Ahlfors type construction starting with
a arbitrary leaf of X.
