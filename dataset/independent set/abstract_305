We prove that the set of exceptional $\lambda\in (1/2,1)$ such that the
associated Bernoulli convolution is singular has zero Hausdorff dimension, and
likewise for biased Bernoulli convolutions, with the exceptional set
independent of the bias. This improves previous results by Erd\"os, Kahane,
Solomyak, Peres and Schlag, and Hochman. A theorem of this kind is also
obtained for convolutions of homogeneous self-similar measures. The proofs are
very short, and rely on old and new results on the dimensions of self-similar
measures and their convolutions, and the decay of their Fourier transform.
