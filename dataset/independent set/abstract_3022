Noisy network coding, which elegantly combines the conventional
compress-and-forward relaying strategy and ideas from network coding, has
recently drawn much attention for its simplicity and optimality in achieving to
within constant gap of the capacity of the multisource multicast Gaussian
network. The constant-gap result, however, applies only to Gaussian relay
networks with independent noises. This paper investigates the application of
noisy network coding to networks with correlated noises. By focusing on a
four-node Gaussian relay chain network with a particular noise correlation
structure, it is shown that noisy network coding can no longer achieve to
within constant gap to capacity with the choice of Gaussian inputs and Gaussian
quantization. The cut-set bound of the relay chain network in this particular
case, however, can be achieved to within half a bit by a simple concatenation
of a correlation-aware noisy network coding strategy and a decode-and-forward
scheme.
