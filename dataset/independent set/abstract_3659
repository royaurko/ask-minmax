We present the redshift distribution of a complete sample of 480 galaxies
with Ks<20 distributed over two independent fields covering a total area of 52
arcmin^2. The redshift completeness is 87% and 98% respectively with
spectroscopic and high-quality and tested photometric redshifts. The redshift
distribution of field galaxies has a median redshift z_{med}\sim 0.80, with
\sim 32% and \sim 9% of galaxies at z>1 and z>1.5 respectively. A ``blind''
comparison is made with the predictions of a set of the most recent LambdaCDM
hierarchical merging and pure luminosity evolution (PLE) models. The
hierarchical merging models overpredict and underpredict the number of galaxies
at low-z and high-z respectively, whereas the PLE models match the median
redshift and the low-z distribution, still being able to follow the high-z tail
of N(z). We briefly discuss the implications of this comparison and the
possible origins of the observed discrepancies. We make the redshift
distribution publicly available.
