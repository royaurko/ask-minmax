We consider the self-similar structure of the class of generalized Cantor
sets $$\Gamma_{\mathcal{D}}=\Big\{\sum_{n=1}^\infty d_n\beta^{n}: d_n\in D_n,
n\ge 1\Big\},$$ where $0<\beta<1$ and $D_n, n\ge 1,$ are nonempty and finite
subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for
$\Gamma_{\mathcal{D}}$ to be a homogeneously generated self similar set. An
application to the self-similarity of intersections of generalized Cantor sets
will be given.
