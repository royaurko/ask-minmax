Stopping sets, and in particular their numbers and sizes, play an important
role in determining the performance of iterative decoders of linear codes over
binary erasure channels. In the 2004 Shannon Lecture, McEliece presented an
expression for the number of stopping sets of size three for a full-rank
parity-check matrix of the Hamming code. In this correspondence, we derive an
expression for the number of stopping sets of any given size for the same
parity-check matrix.
