In this paper we give new deviation inequalities of Bernstein's type for the
partial sums of weakly dependent time series. The loss from the independent
case is studied carefully. We give non mixing examples such that dynamical
systems and Bernoulli shifts for whom our deviation inequalities hold. The
proofs are based on the blocks technique and different coupling arguments.
