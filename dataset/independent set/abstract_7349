The set of natural integers is fundamental for at least two reasons: it is
the free induction algebra over the empty set (and at such allows definitions
of maps by primitive recursion) and it is the free monoid over a one-element
set, the latter structure being a consequence of the former. In this
contribution, we study the corresponding structure in the linear setting, i.e.,
in the category of modules over a commutative ring rather than in the category
of sets, namely the free module generated by the integers. It also provides
free structures of induction algebra and of monoid (in the category of
modules). Moreover we prove that each of its linear endomorphisms admits a
unique normal form, explicitly constructed, as a non-commutative formal power
series.
