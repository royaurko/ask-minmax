We give an algorithm that learns a representation of data through
compression. The algorithm 1) predicts bits sequentially from those previously
seen and 2) has a structure and a number of computations similar to an
autoencoder. The likelihood under the model can be calculated exactly, and
arithmetic coding can be used directly for compression. When training on digits
the algorithm learns filters similar to those of restricted boltzman machines
and denoising autoencoders. Independent samples can be drawn from the model by
a single sweep through the pixels. The algorithm has a good compression
performance when compared to other methods that work under random ordering of
pixels.
