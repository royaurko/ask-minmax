We characterize the canonical algebras such that for all dimension vectors of
homogeneous modules the corresponding module varieties are complete
intersections (respectively, normal). We also investigate the sets of common
zeros of semi-invariants of non-zero degree in important cases. In particular,
we show that for sufficiently big vectors they are complete intersections and
calculate the number of their irreducible components.
