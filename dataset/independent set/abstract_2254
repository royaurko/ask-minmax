Microwave, submillimetre-wave, and far-infrared phased arrays are of
considerable importance for astronomy. We consider the behaviour imaging phased
arrays and interferometric phased arrays from a functional perspective. It is
shown that the average powers, field correlations, power fluctuations, and
correlations between power fluctuations at the output ports of an imaging or
interferometric phased array can be found once the synthesised reception
patterns are known. The reception patterns do not have to be orthogonal or even
linearly independent. It is shown that the operation of phased arrays is
intimately related to the mathematical theory of frames, and that the theory of
frames can be used to determine the degree to which any class of intensity or
field distribution can be reconstructed unambiguously from the complex
amplitudes of the travelling waves at the output ports. The theory can be used
to set up a likelihood function that can, through Fisher information, be used
to determine the degree to which a phased array can be used to recover the
parameters of a parameterised source. For example, it would be possible to
explore the way in which a system, perhaps interferometric, might observe two
widely separated regions of the sky simultaneously.
