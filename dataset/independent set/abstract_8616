A theorem of Christol states that a power series over a finite field is
algebraic over the polynomial ring if and only if its coefficients can be
generated by a finite automaton. Using Christol's result, we prove that the
same assertion holds for generalized power series (whose index sets may be
arbitrary well-ordered sets of nonnegative rationals).
