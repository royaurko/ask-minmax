We prove that the chiral propagator of the deformed N=4 SYM theory can be
made finite to all orders in perturbation theory for any complex value of the
deformation parameter. For any such value the set of finite deformed theories
can be parametrized by a whole complex function of the coupling constant g. We
reveal a new protection mechanism for chiral operators of dimension three.
These are obtained by differentiating the Lagrangian with respect to the
independent coupling constants. A particular combination of them is a CPO
involving only chiral matter. Its all-order form is derived directly from the
finiteness condition. The procedure is confirmed perturbatively through order
g^6.
