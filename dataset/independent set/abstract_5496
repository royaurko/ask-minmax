We introduce generator blocking sets of finite classical polar spaces. These
sets are a generalisation of maximal partial spreads. We prove a
characterization of these minimal sets of the polar spaces Q(2n,q), Q-(2n+1,q)
and H(2n,q^2), in terms of cones with vertex a subspace contained in the polar
space and with base a generator blocking set in a polar space of rank 2.
