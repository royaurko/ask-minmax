According to Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL), a generic spacelike
singularity is characterized by asymptotic locality: Asymptotically, toward the
singularity, each spatial point evolves independently from its neighbors, in an
oscillatory manner that is represented by a sequence of Bianchi type I and II
vacuum models. Recent investigations support a modified conjecture: The
formation of spatial structures (`spikes') breaks asymptotic locality. The
complete description of a generic spacelike singularity involves spike
oscillations, which are described by sequences of Bianchi type I and certain
inhomogeneous vacuum models. In this paper we describe how BKL and spike
oscillations arise from concatenations of exact solutions in a
Hubble-normalized state space setting, suggesting the existence of hidden
symmetries and showing that the results of BKL are part of a greater picture.
