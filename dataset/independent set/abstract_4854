An integer additive set-indexer is defined as an injective function
$f:V(G)\rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0}$ such that the induced function $g_f:E(G)
\rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0}$ defined by $g_f (uv) = f(u)+ f(v)$ is also
injective. An integer additive set-indexer $f$ is said to be an arithmetic
integer additive set-indexer if every element of $G$ are labeled by non-empty
sets of non negative integers, which are in arithmetic progressions. An integer
additive set-indexer $f$ is said to be a semi-arithmetic integer additive
set-indexer if vertices of $G$ are labeled by non-empty sets of non negative
integers, which are in arithmetic progressions, but edges are not labeled by
non-empty sets of non negative integers, which are in arithmetic progressions.
In this paper, we discuss about semi-arithmetic integer additive set-indexer
and establish some results on this type of integer additive set-indexers.
