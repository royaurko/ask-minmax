Let c be the cardinality of the continuum.
  We give a family of pairwise incomparable clones (on a countable base set)
2^c members, all with the same unary fragment, namely the set of all unary
operations.
  We also give, for each n, a family of 2^c clones all with the same n-ary
fragment, and all containing the set of all unary operations.
