In this paper we will discuss the design of abstract firewall model along
with platform-independent policy definition language. We will also discuss the
main design challenges and solutions to these challenges, as well as examine
several differences in policy semantics between vendors and how it could be
mapped to our platform-independent language. We will also touch upon a
processing model, describing the mechanism by which an abstract policy could be
compiled into a concrete firewall policy syntax. We will discuss briefly some
future research directions, such as policy optimization and validation
