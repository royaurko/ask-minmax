We discuss the possibility of extracting |V_{ub}| from various spectra of
inclusive B decays, without large systematic errors which usually arise from
having to model the Fermi motion of the heavy quark. This strategy can be
applied to the electron energy spectrum, as well as the hadronic mass spectrum.
Modulo violation of local hadron-parton duality, the theoretical error in the
extraction is estimated to be less than 10%.
