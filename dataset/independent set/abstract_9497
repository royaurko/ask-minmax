In the present work we consider the role that metric fluctuations could have
upon the properties of a Bose--Einstein condensate. In particular we consider
the Bogoliubov space associated to it and show that there are, at least, two
independent ways in which the average size of these metric fluctuations could
be, experimentally, determined. Indeed, we prove that the pressure and the
speed of sound of the ground state define an expression allowing us to
determine the average size of these fluctuations. Afterwards, an
interferometric experiment involving Bogoliubov excitations of the condensate
and the pressure (or the speed of sound of the ground state) provides a second
and independent way in which this average size could be determined,
experimentally.
