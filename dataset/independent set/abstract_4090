We introduce a new class of models of Higgs inflation using the
superconformal approach to supergravity by modifying the K$\ddot{a}$hler
geometry. Using such a mechanism, we construct a phenomenological functional
form of a new K$\ddot{a}$hler potential. From this we construct various types
of models which are characterized by a superconformal symmetry breaking
parameter $\chi$, and depending on the numerical values of $\chi$ we classify
all of the proposed models into three categories. Models with minimal coupling
are identified by $\chi=\pm\frac{2}{3}$ branch which are made up of shift
symmetry preserving flat directions. We also propose various other models by
introducing a non-minimal coupling of the inflaton field to gravity described
by $\chi\neq\frac{2}{3}$ branch. We employ all these proposed models to study
the inflationary paradigm by estimating the major cosmological observables and
confront them with recent observational data from WMAP9 along with other
complementary data sets, as well as independently with PLANCK. We also mention
an allowed range of non-minimal couplings and the {\it Yukawa} type of
couplings appearing in the proposed models used for cosmological parameter
estimation.
