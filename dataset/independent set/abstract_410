We obtain sets of infinite number of conserved nonlocal charges of strings in
a flat space and pp-wave backgrounds, and compare them before and after
T-duality transformation. In the flat background the set of nonlocal charges is
the same before and after the T-duality transformation with interchanging odd
and even-order charges. In the IIB pp-wave background an infinite number of
nonlocal charges are independent, contrast to that in a flat background only
the zero-th and first order charges are independent. In the IIA pp-wave
background, which is the T-dualized compactified IIB pp-wave background, the
zero-th order charges are included as a part of the set of nonlocal charges in
the IIB background. To make this correspondence complete a variable conjugate
to the winding number is introduced as a Lagrange multiplier in the IIB action
a la Buscher's transformation.
