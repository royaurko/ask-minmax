We present a general scheme and scale independent parameterization of
two-body non-leptonic B decay amplitudes which includes perturbative QCD
corrections as well as final state interactions in a consistent way. This
parameterization is based on the Next-to-Leading effective Hamiltonian for
non-leptonic B decays and on Wick contractions in the matrix elements of the
local operators. Using this parameterization, and making no dynamical
assumption, we present a classification of two-body B decay channels in terms
of the parameters entering in the decay amplitudes. This classification can be
considered as the starting point for a model-independent analysis of
non-leptonic B decays and of CP violating asymmetries. We also propose, on the
basis of the large N expansion, a possible hierarchy among the different
effective parameters. We discuss the strategy to extract the most important
effective parameters from the experimental data. Finally, we establish a
connection between our parameterization and the diagrammatic approach which is
widely used in the literature.
