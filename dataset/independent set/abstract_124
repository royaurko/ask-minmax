Operators on the ring of algebraically constructible functions are used to
compute local obstructions for a four-dimensional semialgebraic set to be
homeomorphic to a real algebraic set. The link operator and arithmetic
operators yield $2^{43}-43$ independent characteristic numbers mod 2, which
generalize the Akbulut-King numbers in dimension three.
