The exceptional Lie group G_2 acts on the set of real symmetric 7x7-matrices
by conjugation. We solve the normal form problem for this group action. In view
of earlier results, this gives rise to a classification of all
finite-dimensional real flexible division algebras. By a classification is
meant a list of pairwise non-isomorphic algebras, exhausting all isomorphism
classes.
  We also give a parametrisation of the set of all real symmetric matrices,
based on eigenvalues.
