We compute the relation between the pole quark mass and the minimally
subtracted quark mass in the framework of QCD applying dimensional reduction as
a regularization scheme. Special emphasis is put on the evanescent couplings
and the renormalization of the epsilon-scalar mass. As a by-product we obtain
the three-loop on-shell renormalization constants Zm(OS) and Z2(OS) in
dimensional regularization and thus provide the first independent check of the
analytical results computed several years ago.
