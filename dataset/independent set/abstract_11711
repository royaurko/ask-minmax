We present first-principles calculations of the impact ionization rate (IIR)
in the $GW$ approximation ($GW$A) for semiconductors. The IIR is calculated
from the quasiparticle (QP) width in the $GW$A, since it can be identified as
the decay rate of a QP into lower energy QP plus an independent electron-hole
pair. The quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ method was used to generate the
noninteracting hamiltonian the $GW$A requires as input. Small empirical
corrections were added so as to reproduce experimental band gaps. Our results
are in reasonable agreement with previous work, though we observe some
discrepancy. In particular we find high IIR at low energy in the narrow gap
semiconductor InAs.
