In this paper we prove a randomized difference norm characterization for
Bessel potential spaces with values in UMD Banach spaces. The main ingredients
are $\mathcal{R}$-boundedness results for Fourier multiplier operators, which
are of independent interest. As an application we characterize the pointwise
multiplier property of the indicator function of the half-space on these
spaces. All results are proved in the setting of weighted spaces.
