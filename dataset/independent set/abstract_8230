An infinite binary sequence is deemed to be random if it has all definable
properties that hold almost surely for the usual probability measure on the set
of infinite binary sequences. There are only countably many such properties, so
it would seem that the set of random sequences should have full measure. But in
fact there might be no random sequences, because for all we know, there might
be no undefinable sets.
