This note records a curious numerical identity: the number 1318, connected
with Vandermonde's cyclotomic quintic, may be decomposed in two distinct ways
as a sum of products of pairs of numbers taken from the set \{$6, 16, 26,
41$\}, namely $1318 = 6\cdot41 + 16\cdot26 + 16\cdot41 = 6\cdot16 + 6\cdot26 +
26\cdot41$. Based on the existence of radical solutions of certain families of
Abelian and generalized Abelian equations, we conjecture the existence of an
infinite number of analogous decompositions, involving arbitrarily large sets
of numbers.
