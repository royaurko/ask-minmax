We consider the quasispecies description of a population evolving in both the
"master sequence" landscape (where a single sequence is evolutionarily
preferred over all others) and the REM landscape (where the fitness of
different sequences is an independent, identically distributed, random
variable). We show that, in both cases, the error threshold is analogous to a
first order thermodynamical transition, where the overlap between the average
genotype and the optimal one drops discontinuously to zero.
