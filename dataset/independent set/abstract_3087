In processes involving small-x partons, like in deep inelastic scattering and
in hadronic collisions at high energy, the final state can be expressed in
terms of correlators of Wilson lines. We study such high-point correlators
evolving according to the JIMWLK equation and we confirm the results of
previous numerical and analytic work, by using an independent method, that the
solution to the JIMWLK equation can be very well approximated by an appropriate
Gaussian wavefunction. We explore both fixed and running coupling evolution,
where in the latter the scale is set according to various prescriptions. As a
byproduct, we also numerically confirm to high accuracy the validity of the law
governing the behavior of the S-matrix close to the unitarity limit, the
Levin-Tuchin formula. We furthermore outline how to calculate correlators with
open color indices.
