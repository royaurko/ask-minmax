The back-to-back $J/\psi$ and $\pi$ associated production at $e^+ e^-$
colliders is proposed to detect the gluon transverse momentum dependent(TMD)
fragmentation functions. TMD factorization is assumed for this process. With
spinless pion, unpolarized and linearly polarized gluon TMD fragmentation
functions can be defined. It is found at parton level the hadronic tensor can
be described by four structure functions. As a result, there are three
independent angular distributions, of which a $\cos{2\phi}$ azimuthal asymmetry
is sensitive to the linearly polarized gluon fragmentation function.
