We present an alternative approach for calculating helicity amplitudes for
processes involving both massless and massive fermions. With this method one
can easily obtain covariant expressions for the helicity amplitudes. The final
expressions involve only four vector products and are independent of the basis
for gamma matrices or specific form of the spinors. We use the method to obtain
the helicity amplitudes for several processes involving top quark production.
