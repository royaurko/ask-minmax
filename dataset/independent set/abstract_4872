We have accurately measured the effective mass in a dilute two-dimensional
electron system in silicon by analyzing temperature dependence of the
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the low-temperature limit. A sharp increase
of the effective mass with decreasing electron density has been observed. Using
tilted magnetic fields, we have found that the enhanced effective mass is
independent of the degree of spin polarization, which points to a
spin-independent origin of the mass enhancement and is in contradiction with
existing theories.
