We study the dynamics of a tagged monomer of a Rouse polymer for different
initial configurations. In the case of free evolution, the monomer displays
subdiffusive behavior with strong memory of the initial state. In presence of
either elastic pinning or harmonic absorption, we show that the steady state is
independent of the initial condition which however strongly affects the
transient regime, resulting in non-monotonous behavior and power-law relaxation
with varying exponents.
