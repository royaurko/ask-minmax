We describe radiative corrections to bremsstrahlung and their application to
high energy collider physics, focusing on the applications to luminosity
measurement, fermion pair production and radiative return. We review the status
of one loop radiative corrections in BHLUMI and the KKMC, including cross
checks with newer results developed independently for radiative return. We
outline a YFS-exponentiated approach to the Drell-Yan process for LHC physics,
including a discussion of the relevant radiative corrections.
