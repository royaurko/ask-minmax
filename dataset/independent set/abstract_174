We propose a new class of models for random permutations, which we call
log-linear models, by the analogy with log-linear models used in the analysis
of contingency tables. As a special case, we study the family of all
Luce-decomposable distributions, and the family of those random permutations,
for which the distribution of both the permutation and its inverse is
Luce-decomposable. We show that these latter models can be described by
conditional independence relations. We calculate the number of free parameters
in these models, and describe an iterative algorithm for maximum likelihood
estimation, which enables us to test if a set of data satisfies the conditional
independence relations or not.
