A scheme is proposed to electrically measure the spin-momentum coupling in
the topological insulator surface state by injection of spin polarized
electrons from silicon. As a first approach, devices were fabricated consisting
of thin (<100nm) exfoliated crystals of Bi2Se3 on n-type silicon with
independent electrical contacts to silicon and Bi2Se3. Analysis of the
temperature dependence of thermionic emission in reverse bias indicates a
barrier height of 0.34 eV at the Si-Bi2Se3 interface. This robust Schottky
barrier opens the possibility of novel device designs based on sub-band gap
internal photoemission from Bi2Se3 into Si.
