The paper provides a simpler method for proving a delicate inequality that
was used by Achlioptis and Naor to establish asymptotic concentration for
chromatic numbers of Erdos-Renyi random graphs. The simplifications come from
two new ideas. The first involves a sharpened form of a piece of statistical
folklore regarding goodness-of-fit tests for two-way tables of Poisson counts
under linear conditioning constraints. The second idea takes the form of a new
inequality that controls the extreme tails of the distribution of a quadratic
form in independent Poissons random variables.
