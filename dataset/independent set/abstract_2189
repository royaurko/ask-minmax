We use the void probability statistics to study the redshift-space galaxy
distribution as described by a volume-limited subsample of the Perseus-Pisces
survey. We compare the results with the same analysis realized on artificial
samples, extracted from high-resolution N-body simulations by reproducing the
observational biases of the real data set. Simulations are run for the
Cold+HotDM model (CHDM) and for unbiased and biased (b=1.5) CDM models in a 50
Mpc/h box. We identify galaxies as residing in peaks of the evolved density
field. We fragment overmerged structures into individual galaxies so as to
reproduce both the correct luminosity function (after assuming M/ L values for
the resulting galaxy groups) and the two-point correlation function. Our main
result is that a void-probability function (VPF) from the standard CHDM model
with fractions 60% cold, 30% hot, 10% barions, exceeds the observational VPF
with a high confidence level. CDM models produce smaller VPF independent of the
biasing parameter. We verify the robustness of this result against changing the
observer position in the simulations and the galaxy identification in the
evolved density field.
