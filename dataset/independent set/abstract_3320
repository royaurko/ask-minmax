We propose to generalize the extensions of the Standard Model where the $Z$
boson serves as a mediator between the Standard Model sector and the dark
sector $\chi$. We show that, like in the Higgs portal case, the combined
constraints from the recent direct searches restrict severely the nature of the
coupling of the dark matter to the $Z$ boson and set a limit $m_\chi \gtrsim
200$ GeV (except in a very narrow region around the $Z-$pole region). Using
complementarity between spin dependent, spin independent and FERMI limits, we
predict the nature of this coupling, more specifically the axial/vectorial
ratio that respects a thermal dark matter coupled through a $Z$-portal while
not being excluded by the current observations. We also show that the next
generation of experiments of the type LZ or XENON1T will test Z-portal scenario
for dark matter mass up to 2 TeV. The condition of a thermal dark matter
naturally predicts the spin--dependent scattering cross section on the neutron
to be $\sigma^{SD}_{\chi n} \simeq 10^{-40} \mrm{cm^2}$, which then becomes a
clear prediction of the model and a signature testable in the near future
experiments.
