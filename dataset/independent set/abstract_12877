In this paper, we study the behavior of the bounds of matrix-valued maximal
inequality in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for large $n$. The main result of this paper is
that the $L_p$-bounds ($p>1$) can be taken to be independent of $n$, which is a
generalization of Stein and Str\"omberg's resut in the scalar-valued case. We
also show that the weak type $(1,1)$ bound has similar behavior as Stein and
St\"omberg's.
