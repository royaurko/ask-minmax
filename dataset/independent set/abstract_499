We study initial sequences of various configurations of planar points. We
answer several questions asked in our previous paper (Symbolic powers of planar
point configurations), and we extend our considerations to the asymptotic
setting of Waldschmidt constants. We introduce the concept of Bezout
Decomposition which might be of independent interest.
