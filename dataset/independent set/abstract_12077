We derive an exact analytical solution for the redshift evolution of linear
and scale-independent bias, by solving a second order differential equation
based on linear perturbation theory. This bias evolution model is applicable to
all different types of dark energy and modified gravity models. We propose that
the combination of the current bias evolution model with data on the bias of
extragalactic mass tracers could provide an efficient way to discriminate
between "geometrical" dark energy models and dark energy models that adhere to
general relativity.
