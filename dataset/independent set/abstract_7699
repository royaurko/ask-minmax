In response to recent critcism, we show how to define the spectator equations
for negative energies so that charge conjugation invariance is preserved. The
result, which emerges naturally from the application of spectator principles to
systems of particles with negative energies, is to replace all factors of the
external energies $W_i$ by $\sqrt{W^2_i}$, insuring that the amplitudes are
independent of the sign of the energies $W_i$.
