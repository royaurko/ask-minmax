We present a new approach to credal nets, which are graphical models that
generalise Bayesian nets to imprecise probability. Instead of applying the
commonly used notion of strong independence, we replace it by the weaker notion
of epistemic irrelevance. We show how assessments of epistemic irrelevance
allow us to construct a global model out of given local uncertainty models and
mention some useful properties. The main results and proofs are presented using
the language of sets of desirable gambles, which provides a very general and
expressive way of representing imprecise probability models.
