Given graphs H_1,...,H_k, we study the minimum order of a graph G such that
for each i, the induced copies of H_i in G cover V(G). We prove a general upper
bound of twice the sum of the numbers m_i, where m_i is one less than the order
of H_i. When k=2 and one graph is an independent set of size n, we determine
the optimum within a constant. When k=2 and the graphs are a star and an
independent set, we determine the answer exactly.
