A variance swap is a derivative with a path-dependent payoff which allows
investors to take positions on the future variability of an asset. In the
idealised setting of a continuously monitored variance swap written on an asset
with continuous paths it is well known that the variance swap payoff can be
replicated exactly using a portfolio of puts and calls and a dynamic position
in the asset. This fact forms the basis of the VIX contract.
  But what if we are in the more realistic setting where the contract is based
on discrete monitoring, and the underlying asset may have jumps? We show that
it is possible to derive model-independent, no-arbitrage bounds on the price of
the variance swap, and corresponding sub- and super-replicating strategies.
Further, we characterise the optimal bounds. The form of the hedges depends
crucially on the kernel used to define the variance swap.
