We discuss the main features of the recent NNPDF2.1 NLO set, a determination
of parton distributions from a global set of hard scattering data using the
NNPDF methodology including heavy quark mass effects. We present the
implications for LHC observables of this new PDF set. Then we briefly review
recent NNPDF progress towards NNLO sets, and in particular the impact of the
treatment of fixed target NMC data on NNLO Higgs cross sections.
