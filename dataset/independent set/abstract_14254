We present a new global QCD analysis of nuclear parton distribution
functions. In addition to the most commonly analyzed data sets for deep
inelastic scattering of charged leptons off nuclei and Drell Yan di-lepton
production, we include also measurements for neutrino-nuclei scattering as well
as inclusive pion production in deuteron-gold collisions. The emerging picture
is one of consistency, where universal nuclear modification factors for each
parton flavor reproduce the main features of all data without any significant
tension among the different sets.
