Considering gravitational and gauge anomalies at the horizon, a new
successful method that to derive Hawking radiations from black holes has been
developed recently by Wilczek et al.. By using the dimensional reduction
technique, we apply this method to a non-vacuum solution, the 2+1 dimensional
spinning black hole. The Hawking temperature and angular velocity on the
horizon are obtained. The results may partially imply that this method is
independent of the gravity theory, the dimension of spacetime and the
topological structure of the event horizon.
