We give a deterministic algorithm to construct a graph with no loops (a tree
or a forest) whose vertices are the points of a d-dimensional stationary
Poisson process S, subset of R^d. The algorithm is independent of the origin of
coordinates. We show that (1) the graph has one topological end --that is, from
any point there is exactly one infinite self-avoiding path; (2) the graph has a
unique connected component if d=2 and d=3 (a tree) and it has infinitely many
components if d\ge 4 (a forest); (3) in d=2 and d=3 we construct a bijection
between the points of the Poisson process and Z using the preorder-traversal
algorithm. To construct the graph we interpret each point in S as a space-time
point (x,r)\in\R^{d-1}\times R. Then a (d-1) dimensional random walk in
continuous time continuous space starts at site x at time r. The first jump of
the walk is to point x', at time r'>r, (x',r')\in S, where r' is the minimal
time after r such that |x-x'|<1. All the walks jumping to x' at time r'
coalesce with the one starting at (x',r'). Calling (x',r') = \alpha(x,r), the
graph has vertex set S and edges {(s,\alpha(s)), s\in S}. This enables us to
shift the origin of S^o = S + \delta_0 (the Palm version of S) to another point
in such a way that the distribution of S^o does not change (to any point if d =
2 and d = 3; point-stationarity).
