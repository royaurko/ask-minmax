We develop a theory for density, disorder, and temperature dependent
electrical conductivity of bilayer graphene in the presence of long-range
charged impurity scattering as well as an additional short-range disorder of
independent origin, establishing that both scattering mechanisms contribute
significantly to determining bilayer transport properties. We find that
although strong screening properties of bilayer graphene lead to qualitative
differences with the corresponding single layer situation, both systems exhibit
the linearly density dependent conductivity at high density and the minimum
graphene conductivity behavior around the charge neutrality point due to the
formation of inhomogeneous electron-hole puddles induced by the random charged
impurity centers.
