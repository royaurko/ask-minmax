In the first section of this paper we present generalizations of known
results on the set of associated primes of Matlis duals of local cohomology
modules; we prove these generalizations by using a new technique. In section 2
we compute the set of associated primes of the Matlis dual of $\LCMo
^{d-1}_J(R)$, where $R$ is a $d$-dimensional local ring and $J\subseteq R$ an
ideal such that $\dim (R/J)=1$ and $\LCMo ^d_J(R)=0$.
