Let $G$ be a graph. In a famous paper Collatz and Sinogowitz had proposed to
measure its deviation from regularity by the difference of the (adjacency)
spectral radius and the average degree: $\epsilon(G)=\rho(G)-\frac{2m}{n}$.
  We obtain here a new upper bound on $\epsilon(G)$ which seems to consistently
outperform the best known upper bound to date, due to Nikiforov. The method of
proof may also be of independent interest, as we use notions from numerical
analysis to re-cast the estimation of $\epsilon(G)$ as a special case of the
estimation of the difference between Rayleigh quotients of proximal vectors.
