We measured with unprecedented precision the induced polarization Py in
4He(e,e'p)3H at Q^2 = 0.8 (GeV/c)^2 and 1.3 (GeV/c)^2. The induced polarization
is indicative of reaction-mechanism effects beyond the impulse approximation.
Our results are in agreement with a relativistic distorted-wave impulse
approximation calculation but are over-estimated by a calculation with strong
charge-exchange effects. Our data are used to constrain the strength of the
spin independent charge-exchange term in the latter calculation.
