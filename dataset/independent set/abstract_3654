We present new B, V, I photometry in the standard Johnson-Cousins photometric
system of two regions near the bar of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), one of
which is very close to LMC field used for the "Coimbra test on the synthetic
CMD techniques". The two areas contain 128 RR Lyrae variables and more than
8000 clump stars. Once combined with Clementini et al. 2001 (astro-ph/0007471)
photometry the new data-set allows us to get (i) accurate CMD's down to V~23
mag, (ii) full coverage of the B and V light variation for more than 80% of the
RR Lyrae's, (iii) a very precise estimate of the LMC RR Lyrae's average
apparent luminosity, (iv) an accurate estimate of the I luminosity of the LMC
clump stars, and (v) an independent evaluation of the reddening in these
regions of the LMC using the pulsational properties of the RR Lyrae's in our
sample. A detailed comparison is made between our, OGLE II and MACHO
photometries. We discuss the impact of our new results on the distance to the
LMC and on the "short" and "long" distance scale controversy.
