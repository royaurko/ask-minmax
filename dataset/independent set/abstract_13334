The H-free process, for some fixed graph H, is the random graph process
defined by starting with an empty graph on n vertices and then adding edges one
at a time, chosen uniformly at random subject to the constraint that no H
subgraph is formed. Let G be the random maximal H-free graph obtained at the
end of the process. When H is strictly 2-balanced, we show that for some c>0,
with high probability as $n \to \infty$, the minimum degree in G is at least
$cn^{1-(v_H-2)/(e_H-1)}(\log n)^{1/(e_H-1)}$. This gives new lower bounds for
the Tur\'an numbers of certain bipartite graphs, such as the complete bipartite
graphs $K_{r,r}$ with $r \ge 5$. When H is a complete graph $K_s$ with $s \ge
5$ we show that for some C>0, with high probability the independence number of
G is at most $Cn^{2/(s+1)}(\log n)^{1-1/(e_H-1)}$. This gives new lower bounds
for Ramsey numbers R(s,t) for fixed $s \ge 5$ and t large. We also obtain new
bounds for the independence number of G for other graphs H, including the case
when H is a cycle. Our proofs use the differential equations method for random
graph processes to analyse the evolution of the process, and give further
information about the structure of the graphs obtained, including asymptotic
formulae for a broad class of subgraph extension variables.
