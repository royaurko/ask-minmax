The Pairwise Summation Approximation (PSA) of Casimir energy is applied to a
system of two dielectrics with magnetoelectric coupling. In particular, the
case of Topological Insulators (TI) is studied in detail. Depending on the the
optical response of the TI, we obtain a stable equilibrium distance, atraction
for all distances, or repulsion for all distances at zero temperature. This
equilibrium distance disappears in the high temperature limit. These results
are independent on the geometry of the TI, but are only valid in the diluted
approximation.
