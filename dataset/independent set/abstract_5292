We construct functions in the disc algebra with pointwise universal Fourier
series on sets which are G-delta and dense and at the same time with Fourier
series whose set of divergence is of Hausdorff dimension zero. We also see that
some classes of closed sets of measure zero do not accept uniformly universal
Fourier series, although all such sets accept divergent Fourier series.
