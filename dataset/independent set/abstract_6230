In this paper a knowledge representation model are proposed, FP5, which
combine the ideas from fuzzy sets and penta-valued logic. FP5 represents
imprecise properties whose accomplished degree is undefined, contradictory or
indeterminate for some objects. Basic operations of conjunction, disjunction
and negation are introduced. Relations to other representation models like
fuzzy sets, intuitionistic, paraconsistent and bipolar fuzzy sets are
discussed.
