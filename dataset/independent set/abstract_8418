We characterize and construct linearly ordered sets, abelian groups and
fields that are {\emph symmetrically complete}, meaning that the intersection
over any chain of closed bounded intervals is nonempty. Such ordered abelian
groups and fields are important because generalizations of Banach's Fixed Point
Theorem hold in them. We prove that symmetrically complete ordered abelian
groups and fields are divisible Hahn products and real closed power series
fields, respectively. We show how to extend any given ordered set, abelian
group or field to one that is symmetrically complete. A main part of the paper
establishes a detailed study of the cofinalities in cuts.
