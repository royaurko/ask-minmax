In this paper we propose the opinion leader-follower through mediators
systems (OLFM systems) a multiple-action collective choice model for societies.
In those societies three kind of actors are considered: opinion leaders that
can exert certain influence over the decision of other actors, followers that
can be convinced to modify their original decisions, and independent actors
that neither are influenced nor can influence; mediators are actors that both
are influenced and influence other actors. This is a generalization of the
opinion leader-follower systems (OLF systems) proposed by van den Brink R, et
al. (2011).
  The satisfaction score is defined on the set of actors. For each actor it
measures the number of society initial decisions in which the final collective
decision coincides with the one that the actor initially selected. We
generalize in OLFM systems some properties that the satisfaction score meets
for OLF systems. By using these properties, we provide an axiomatization of the
satisfaction score for the case in which followers maintain their own initial
decisions unless all their opinion leaders share an opposite inclination. This
new axiomatization generalizes the one given by van den Brink R, et al. (2012)
for OLF systems under the same restrictions.
