This article addresses a fundamental problem faced by the ab initio
community: the lack of an effective formalism for the rapid exploration and
exchange of new methods. To rectify this, we introduce a novel, basis-set
independent, matrix-based formulation of generalized density functional
theories which reduces the development, implementation, and dissemination of
new ab initio techniques to the derivation and transcription of a few lines of
algebra. This new framework enables us to concisely demystify the inner
workings of fully functional, highly efficient modern ab initio codes and to
give complete instructions for the construction of such for calculations
employing arbitrary basis sets. Within this framework, we also discuss in full
detail a variety of leading-edge ab initio techniques, minimization algorithms,
and highly efficient computational kernels for use with scalar as well as
shared and distributed-memory supercomputer architectures.
