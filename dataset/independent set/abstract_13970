We discuss methods to extract neutrino oscillation parameters based on the
directly observable quantities, without reconstruction of neutrino energy. The
distributions of muon energies and production angles are compared to Monte
Carlo predictions made for a set of different neutrino oscillation parameters.
The method is applied to T2K neutrino beam and tested for a set of MC data
samples in order to evaluate the statistical error.
