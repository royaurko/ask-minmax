We study the generation of a secret key of maximum rate by a pair of
terminals observing correlated sources and with the means to communicate over a
noiseless public com- munication channel. Our main result establishes a
structural equivalence between the generation of a maximum rate secret key and
the generation of a common randomness that renders the observations of the two
terminals conditionally independent. The minimum rate of such common
randomness, termed interactive common information, is related to Wyner's notion
of common information, and serves to characterize the minimum rate of
interactive public communication required to generate an optimum rate secret
key. This characterization yields a single-letter expression for the
aforementioned communication rate when the number of rounds of interaction are
bounded. An application of our results shows that interaction does not reduce
this rate for binary symmetric sources. Further, we provide an example for
which interaction does reduce the minimum rate of communication. Also, certain
invariance properties of common information quantities are established that may
be of independent interest.
