The results of a solar model independent analysis of the existing solar
neutrino data under the assumption of MSW transitions in matter or vacuum
oscillations (in the cases of $\nu_{e}$--$\nu_{\mu}(\nu_{\tau})$ and
$\nu_{e}$--$\nu_{\mathrm{S}}$ mixing) are presented. The analysis was done in
two cases. In the first case no assumptions on the value of the total fluxes of
neutrinos from all reactions has been made. In the second case some boundaries
for the values of the neutrino fluxes, that take into account the predictions
of different standard solar models, are imposed. It is shown that rather large
regions of the parameters $ \Delta m^2 $ and $ \sin^2 2\theta $ are excluded by
the existing data. It is also shown that the astrophysical solution of the
solar neutrino problem can be excluded only in the case in which limitations on
the values of the solar neutrino fluxes are imposed.
