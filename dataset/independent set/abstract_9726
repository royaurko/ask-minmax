Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on single crystals of
HgBa$_{2}$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ are presented that identify two distinct
temperature-dependent spin susceptibilities: one is due to a spin component
that is temperature-dependent above the critical temperature for
superconductivity ($T_{\rm c}$) and reflects pseudogap behavior; the other is
Fermi-liquid-like in that it is temperature independent above $T_{\rm c}$ and
vanishes rapidly below $T_{\rm c}$. In addition, we demonstrate the existence
of a third, hitherto undetected spin susceptibility: it is temperature
independent at higher temperatures, vanishes at lower temperatures (below
$T_0\neq T_{\rm c}$), and changes sign near optimal doping. This susceptibility
either arises from the coupling between the two spin components, or it could be
given by a distinct third spin component.
