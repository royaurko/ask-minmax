The unital endomorphisms of B(H) of (Powers) index n are classified by
certain U(n)-orbits in the set of non-degenerate representations of the Cuntz
algebra O_n on H. Using this, the corre- sponding conjugacy classes are
identified, and a set of labels is given. This set is given as P modulo a
certain non-smooth equivalence, where P is a set of pure state on the UHF
algebra of Glimm type n^infinity. Several subsets of P, giving concrete
examples of non- conjugate shifts, are worked out in detail, including sets of
product states, and a set of nearest neighbor states.
