Two systems are homometric if they are indistinguishable by diffraction. We
first make a distinction between Bragg and diffuse scattering homometry, and
show that in the last case, coherent diffraction can allow the diffraction
diagrams to be differentiated. The study of the Rudin-Shapiro sequence,
homometric to random sequences, allows one to manipulate independently
two-point and four-point correlation functions, and to show their effect on the
statistics of speckle patterns. Consequences for the study of real materials is
discussed.
