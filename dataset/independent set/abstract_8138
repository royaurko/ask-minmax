We consider probability distributions with constant rate on partially ordered
sets, generalizing distributions in the usual reliability setting that have
constant failure rate. In spite of the minimal algebraic structure, there is a
surprisingly rich theory, including moment results and results concerning
ladder variables and point processes. We concentrate mostly on discrete posets,
particularly posets whose graphs are rooted trees. We pose some questions on
the existence of constant rate distributions for general discrete posets.
