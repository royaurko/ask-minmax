This paper is concerned with optimum diversity receiver structure and its
performance analysis of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) with
differential detection over nonselective, independent, nonidentically
distributed, Rayleigh fading channels. The fading process in each branch is
assumed to have an arbitrary Doppler spectrum with arbitrary Doppler bandwidth,
but to have distinct, asymmetric fading power spectral density characteristic.
Using 8-DPSK as an example, the average bit error probability (BEP) of the
optimum diversity receiver is obtained by calculating the BEP for each of the
three individual bits. The BEP results derived are given in exact, explicit,
closed-form expressions which show clearly the behavior of the performance as a
function of various system parameters.
