A construction of reversible extensions of dynamical systems which applies to
arbitrary mappings (not necessarily with open range) is presented. It is based
on calculating the maximal ideal space of C*-algebras that extends
endomorphisms to partial automorphisms via partial isometric representations,
and involves a newfound set of "parameters" (the role of parameters play chosen
sets or ideals). Additionally, it is characterised as a universal object. As
model examples, we give a thorough description of reversible extensions of
logistic maps, and a classification of systems associated with compression of
unitaries generating homeomorphisms of the circle.
