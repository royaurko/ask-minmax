We describe particle production in the framework of an independent string
model: the dual parton model. We show that an improved version of this model,
containing a diquark breaking component, allows to describe the bulk of
particle production and, in particular, baryon stopping and most of the
observed enhancement of strange baryons. Only for very rare processes, such as
$\Omega$ or $J/\psi$ production, the model has to be supplemented with final
state interaction (comovers interaction). Recent data on event-by-event
fluctuations in $p_{T}$ are also described by the model. Predictions for RHIC
and LHC are presented and the effect of nuclear shadowing is discussed.
