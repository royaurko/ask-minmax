We estimate B(K -> pi nu nubar) in the context of the Standard Model by
fitting for lambda_t = Vtd x V*ts of the `kaon unitarity triangle' relation. We
fit data from epsilon_K, the CP-violating parameter describing K-mixing, and
a_{psi K}, the CP-violating asymmetry in B -> J/psi K decays. Our estimate is
independent of the CKM matrix element Vcb and of the ratio of Bs to Bd mixing
frequencies. The measured value of B(K+ -> pi+ nu nubar) can be compared both
to this estimate and to predictions made from the ratio of B mixing
frequencies.
