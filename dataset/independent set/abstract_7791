We demonstrate the role of the mass asymmetry on the balance energy (Ebal) by
studying asymmetric reactions throughout the periodic table and over entire
colliding geometry. Our results, which are almost independent of the system
size and as well as of the colliding geometries indicate a sizeable effect of
the asymmetry of the reaction on the balance energy.
