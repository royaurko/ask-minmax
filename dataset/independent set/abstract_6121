We develop a dimension theory for D-semianalytic sets over an arbitrary
non-Archimedean complete field. Our main results are the equivalence of several
notions of dimension and a theorem on additivity of dimensions of projections
and fibers in characteristic 0. We also prove a parameterized version of
normalization for D-semianalytic sets.
