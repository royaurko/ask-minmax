The goal of this paper is to announce there is a single orbit of the c.e.
sets with inclusion, $\E$, such that the question of membership in this orbit
is $\Sigma^1_1$-complete. This result and proof have a number of nice
corollaries: the Scott rank of $\E$ is $\wock +1$; not all orbits are
elementarily definable; there is no arithmetic description of all orbits of
$\E$; for all finite $\alpha \geq 9$, there is a properly $\Delta^0_\alpha$
orbit (from the proof).
