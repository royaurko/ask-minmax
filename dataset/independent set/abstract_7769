We determine the geometric structure of a minimal projective threefold having
two `independent and commutative' automorphisms of positive topological
entropy, and generalize this result to higher-dimensional smooth minimal pairs
(X, G). As a consequence, we give an effective lower bound for the first
dynamical degree of these automorphisms of X fitting the `boundary case'.
