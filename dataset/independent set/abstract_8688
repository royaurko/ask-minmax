The dimensions of sets of matrices of various types, with specified
eigenvalue multiplicities, are determined. The dimensions of the sets of
matrices with given Jordan form and with given singular value multiplicities
are also found. Each corresponding codimension is the number of conditions
which a matrix of the given type must satisfy in order to have the specified
multiplicities.
