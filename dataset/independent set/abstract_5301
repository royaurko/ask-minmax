At the magnetic saturation field, certain frustrated lattices have a class of
states known as "localized multi-magnon states" as exact ground states. The
number of these states scales exponentially with the number $N$ of spins and
hence they have a finite entropy also in the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$
provided they are sufficiently linearly independent. In this article we present
rigorous results concerning the linear dependence or independence of localized
magnon states and investigate special examples. For large classes of spin
lattices including what we called the orthogonal type and the isolated type as
well as the kagom\'{e}, the checkerboard and the star lattice we have proven
linear independence of all localized multi-magnon states. On the other hand the
pyrochlore lattice provides an example of a spin lattice having localized
multi-magnon states with considerable linear dependence.
