A clone on a set X is a set of finitary operations on X which contains all
projections and which is moreover closed under functional composition. Ordering
all clones on X by inclusion, one obtains a complete algebraic lattice, called
the clone lattice. We summarize what we know about the clone lattice on an
infinite base set X and formulate what we consider the most important open
problems.
