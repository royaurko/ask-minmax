We present two new aspects of Extensive Air Shower (EAS) development
universality allowing to make accurate estimation of muon and electromagnetic
(EM) shower contents in two independent ways. In the first case, to get muon
(or EM) signal in water Cherenkov detectors it is enough to know the vertical
depth of shower maximum and the total signal. In the second case, the EM signal
can be calculated from the primary particle energy and the zenith angle. In
both cases the parameterizations of muon and EM signals are almost independent
on primary particle nature, energy and zenith angle.
