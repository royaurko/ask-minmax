We discuss the connection between the expansion of small sets in graphs, and
the Schatten norms of their adjacency matrix. In conjunction with a variant of
the Azuma inequality for uniformly smooth normed spaces, we deduce improved
bounds on the small set isoperimetry of Abelian Alon-Roichman random Cayley
graphs.
