Following the program, proposed in hep-th/0310113, of systematizing known
properties of matrix model partition functions (defined as solutions to the
Virasoro-like sets of linear differential equations), we proceed to
consideration of non-Gaussian phases of the Hermitean one-matrix model. A
unified approach is proposed for description of "connected correlators" in the
form of the phase-independent "check-operators" acting on the small space of
T-variables (which parameterize the polynomial W(z)). With appropriate
definitions and ordering prescriptions, the multidensity check-operators look
very similar to the Gaussian case (however, a reliable proof of suggested
explicit expressions in all loops is not yet available, only certain
consistency checks are performed).
