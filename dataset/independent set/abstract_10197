Over the last fifteen years, web searching has seen tremendous improvements.
Starting from a nearly random collection of matching pages in 1995, today,
search engines tend to satisfy the user's informational need on well-formulated
queries. One of the main remaining challenges is to satisfy the users' needs
when they provide a poorly formulated query. When the pages matching the user's
original keywords are judged to be unsatisfactory, query expansion techniques
are used to alter the result set. These techniques find keywords that are
similar to the keywords given by the user, which are then appended to the
original query leading to a perturbation of the result set. However, when the
original query is sufficiently ill-posed, the user's informational need is best
met using entirely different keywords, and a small perturbation of the original
result set is bound to fail.
  We propose a novel approach that is not based on the keywords of the original
query. We intentionally seek out orthogonal queries, which are related queries
that have low similarity to the user's query. The result sets of orthogonal
queries intersect with the result set of the original query on a small number
of pages. An orthogonal query can access the user's informational need while
consisting of entirely different terms than the original query. We illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach by proposing a query expansion method derived
from these observations that improves upon results obtained using the Yahoo
BOSS infrastructure.
