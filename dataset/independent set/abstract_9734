Incremental SAT and QBF solving potentially yields improvements when
sequences of related formulas are solved. An incremental application is usually
tailored towards some specific solver and decomposes a problem into incremental
solver calls. This hinders the independent comparison of different solvers,
particularly when the application program is not available. As a remedy, we
present an approach to automated benchmarking of incremental SAT and QBF
solvers. Given a collection of formulas in (Q)DIMACS format generated
incrementally by an application program, our approach automatically translates
the formulas into instructions to import and solve a formula by an incremental
SAT/QBF solver. The result of the translation is a program which replays the
incremental solver calls and thus allows to evaluate incremental solvers
independently from the application program. We illustrate our approach by
different hardware verification problems for SAT and QBF solvers.
