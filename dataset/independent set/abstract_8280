Analogously as in classical algebraic geometry, linear pencils of tropical
plane curves are parameterized by tropical lines in a coefficient space. A
special example of such a linear pencil is the set of tropical plane curves
with an n-element support set through a general configuration of n points in
the tropical plane. In [RGST], it is proved that these linear pencils are
compatible with their support set. In this article, we give a characterization
of points lying in the fixed locus of a tropical linear pencil and show that
each compatible linear pencil comes from a general configuration.
