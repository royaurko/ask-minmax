We study self-similar measures of Hutchinson type, defined by compact
families of contractions, both in a single and multi-component setting. The
results are applied in the context of general model sets to infer, via a
generalized version of Weyl's Theorem on uniform distribution, the existence of
invariant measures for families of self-similarities of regular model sets.
