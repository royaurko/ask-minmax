The statistical analysis of massive and complex data sets will require the
development of algorithms that depend on distributed computing and
collaborative inference. Inspired by this, we propose a collaborative framework
that aims to estimate the unknown mean $\theta$ of a random variable $X$. In
the model we present, a certain number of calculation units, distributed across
a communication network represented by a graph, participate in the estimation
of $\theta$ by sequentially receiving independent data from $X$ while
exchanging messages via a stochastic matrix $A$ defined over the graph. We give
precise conditions on the matrix $A$ under which the statistical precision of
the individual units is comparable to that of a (gold standard) virtual
centralized estimate, even though each unit does not have access to all of the
data. We show in particular the fundamental role played by both the non-trivial
eigenvalues of $A$ and the Ramanujan class of expander graphs, which provide
remarkable performance for moderate algorithmic cost.
