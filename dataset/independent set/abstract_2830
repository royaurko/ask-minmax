Following the principles of Cognitive Grammar, we concentrate on a model for
reference resolution that attempts to overcome the difficulties previous
approaches, based on the fundamental assumption that all reference (independent
on the type of the referring expression) is accomplished via access to and
restructuring of domains of reference rather than by direct linkage to the
entities themselves. The model accounts for entities not explicitly mentioned
but understood in a discourse, and enables exploitation of discursive and
perceptual context to limit the set of potential referents for a given
referring expression. As the most important feature, we note that a single
mechanism is required to handle what are typically treated as diverse
phenomena. Our approach, then, provides a fresh perspective on the relations
between Cognitive Grammar and the problem of reference.
