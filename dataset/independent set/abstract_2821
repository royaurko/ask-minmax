The leading-order nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential derived from chiral
perturbation theory consists of one-pion exchange plus a short-distance contact
interaction. We show that in the 1S0 and 3S1-3D1 channels renormalization of
the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for this potential can be achieved by
performing one subtraction. This subtraction requires as its only input
knowledge of the NN scattering lengths. This procedure leads to a set of
integral equations for the partial-wave NN t-matrix which give
cutoff-independent results for the corresponding NN phase shifts. This
reformulation of the NN scattering equation offers practical advantages,
because only observable quantities appear in the integral equation. The
scattering equation may then be analytically continued to negative energies,
where information on bound-state energies and wave functions can be extracted.
