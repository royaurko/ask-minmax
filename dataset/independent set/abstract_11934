By expressing the time-independent Schrodinger equation in one dimension as a
system of two first-order differential equations, the transfer matrix for a
rectangular potential barrier is obtained making use of the matrix exponential.
It is shown that the transfer matrix allows one to find the bound states and
the quasinormal modes. A similar treatment for the one-dimensional propagation
of electromagnetic waves in a homogeneous medium is also presented.
