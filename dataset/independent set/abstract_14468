One of the many theorems Freiman proved, in the second half of the twentieth
century, in the subject which later came to be known as "structure theory of
set addition", was 'Freiman's $3k-4$ theorem' for subsets of $\Z$. In this
article we introduce concept of a new `structure' on finite subsets of
integers. Sets with this structure are quite useful in additive number theory
in some contexts. Also we give some criterion for subsets to posses this
structure. Then this is used to establish an analog of Freiman's $3k-4$ theorem
for the groups $\Z \times G,$ where $G$ is any abelian group.
