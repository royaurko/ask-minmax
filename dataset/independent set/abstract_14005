Complete sets of mutually unbiased bases are only known to exist in
prime-power dimensions. We will describe a few approaches to the problem
proving the (non)-existence of four mutually unbiased bases in dimension 6.
These will include the notions of Grassmannian distance, quadratic matrix
programming, semidefinite relaxations to polynomial programming, as well as
various tools from algebraic geometry.
