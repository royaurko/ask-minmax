One of the main challenges in the field of embodied artificial intelligence
is the open-ended autonomous learning of complex behaviours. Our approach is to
use task-independent, information-driven intrinsic motivation(s) to support
task-dependent learning. The work presented here is a preliminary step in which
we investigate the predictive information (the mutual information of the past
and future of the sensor stream) as an intrinsic drive, ideally supporting any
kind of task acquisition. Previous experiments have shown that the predictive
information (PI) is a good candidate to support autonomous, open-ended learning
of complex behaviours, because a maximisation of the PI corresponds to an
exploration of morphology- and environment-dependent behavioural regularities.
The idea is that these regularities can then be exploited in order to solve any
given task. Three different experiments are presented and their results lead to
the conclusion that the linear combination of the one-step PI with an external
reward function is not generally recommended in an episodic policy gradient
setting. Only for hard tasks a great speed-up can be achieved at the cost of an
asymptotic performance lost.
