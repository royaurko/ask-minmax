The Cartan model of SO(3)/SO(2) matrices is applied to reduce of rotational
degrees of freedom on coadjoint orbits of u^*(3) Poisson algebra. The
seven--dimensional Poisson algebra u_SO(3) obtained by SO(3) reduction of
u^*(3) algebra is found and canonical parametrization of u^*(3) orbits
[p_1,p_2,p_3] is studied. The structure of bands formed by so--called families
of S and P ellipsoids obtained by searching extremes of many--body SO(3)
invariant Hamiltonians is investigated. The reduced four--dimensional system of
equations of motion describing the simple schematic Hamiltonian based on the
volume conservation is presented. A new set of canonical coordinates regarding
the separation of motion for independent modes is found with the help of the
Jacobi approach. Bohr Somerfield's quantization of new momentum space is
studied.
