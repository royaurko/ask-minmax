We consider rigid bodies moving under the influence of a viscous fluid and we
study the asymptotic as the size of the solids tends to zero. In a bounded
domain, if the solids shrink to "massive" pointwise particles, we obtain a
convergence to the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations independently to any
possible collision of the bodies with the exterior boundary. In the case of
"massless" pointwise particles, we obtain a result for a single disk moving in
the full plane. In this situation, the energy equality is not sufficient, and
we obtain a uniform estimate for the solid velocity thanks to the optimal L p
-- L q decay estimates of the Stokes semigroup.
