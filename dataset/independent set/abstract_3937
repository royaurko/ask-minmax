A formalism for the electromagnetic production of hypernuclei is developed
where the cross section is written as a contraction between a leptonic tensor
and a hadronic tensor. The hadronic tensor is written in a model-independent
way by expanding it in terms of a set of five nuclear structure functions.
These structure functions are calculated by assuming that the virtual photon
interacts with only one bound nucleon. We use the most recent model for the
elementary current operator which gives a good description of the experimental
data for the corresponding elementary process. The bound state wave functions
for the bound nucleon and hyperon are calculated within a relativistic
mean-field model. We calculate the unpolarized triple differential cross
section for the hypernuclear production process e + 12C --> e + K+ +
12_Lambda{B} as a function of the kaon scattering angle. The nuclear structure
functions are calculated within a particle-hole model. The cross section
displays a characteristic form of being large for small values of the kaon
scattering angle with a smooth fall-off to zero with increasing angle. The
shape of the cross section is essentially determined by the nuclear structure
functions. In addition, it is found that for the unpolarized triple
differential cross section one structure function is negligible over the entire
range of the kaon scattering angle.
