In this article, we study the behaviour of discrete one-dimensional dynamical
systems associated to functions on finite sets. We formalise the global orbit
pattern formed by all the periodic orbits (gop) as the ordered set of periods
when the initial value thumbs the finite set in the increasing order. We are
able to predict, using closed formulas, the number of gop for the set
$\mathcal{F}_N$ of all the functions on $X$. We also explore by computer
experiments special subsets of $\mathcal{F}_N$ in which interesting patterns of
gop are found.
