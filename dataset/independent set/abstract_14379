We prove a completeness-like relation for a non-orthogonal set of spherical
Bessel functions which is not known to be complete -- namely, the set
$\{j_m(\alpha^l_i z) \}$, with $0 \leq z \leq 1$, $l \geq m$, where
$\alpha^l_i$ is the $i$-th zero of the spherical Bessel function of order $l$.
This completeness-like relation arises in the study of Fourier-Bessel series
expansions of the probability density functions for random flights.
