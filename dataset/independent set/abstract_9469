We accelerate many-flavor lattice QCD simulations using multiple GPUs.
Multiple pseudo-fermion fields are introduced additively and independently for
each flavor in the many-flavor HMC algorithm. Using the independence of each
pseudo-fermion field and the blocking technique for the quark solver, we can
assign the solver task to each GPU card. In this report we present the blocking
technique for the many-flavor dynamical QCD simulations. We investigate the
effect of the blocking and the acceleration with the multiple GPUs for the
Schr\"{o}dinger functional simulations with Wilson SU(3) plaquette gauge action
and $N_f=10$ Wilson fermions. Five pseudo-fermion fields are introduced and the
quark solver task is distributed in the ratio of 2:3 to two GPUs. We expect a
40% timing reduction from the single GPU case and have observed a 34% timing
reduction in the test simulations.
