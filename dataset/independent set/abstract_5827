The nature of two-photon interference is a subject that has aroused renewed
interest in recent years and is still under debate. In this paper we report the
first observation of two-photon interference with independent pseudo-thermal
sources in which sub-wavelength interference is observed. The phenomenon may be
described in terms of the classical statistical distribution of the two sources
and their optical transfer functions.
