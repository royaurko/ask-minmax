Recommender systems research has experienced different stages such as from
user preference understanding to content analysis. Typical recommendation
algorithms were built on the following bases: (1) assuming users and items are
IID, namely independent and identically distributed, and (2) focusing on
specific aspects such as user preferences or contents. In reality, complex
recommendation tasks involve and request (1) personalized outcomes to tailor
heterogeneous subjective preferences; and (2) explicit and implicit objective
coupling relationships between users, items, and ratings to be considered as
intrinsic forces driving preferences. This inevitably involves the non-IID
complexity and the need of combining subjective preference with objective
couplings hidden in recommendation applications. In this paper, we propose a
novel generic coupled matrix factorization (CMF) model by incorporating non-IID
coupling relations between users and items. Such couplings integrate the
intra-coupled interactions within an attribute and inter-coupled interactions
among different attributes. Experimental results on two open data sets
demonstrate that the user/item couplings can be effectively applied in RS and
CMF outperforms the benchmark methods.
