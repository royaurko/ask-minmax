I summarize recent work comparing relative distances measured to individual
galaxies with independent methods. The comparisons include: ground-based
surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) and fundamental plane distances to 170
galaxies, distances predicted from galaxy velocities and the inferred gravity
field, HST SBF measurements to seven early-type hosts of Type Ia supernovae,
and ties of the Cepheid distance scale to early-type galaxies. Independent
calibrations for some methods provide interesting constraints on the Cepheid
zero point.
