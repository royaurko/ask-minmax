An up-to-date profile of the CKM matrix is presented, with emphasis on the
interpretation of recent CP-violation results from the $B$ factories. The apex
of the Unitarity Triangle is determined by a global CKM fit. A study is
performed to probe the dynamics of B decays into $\pi\pi$, $K\pi$, $\rho\pi$
and $\rho\rho$ within two theoretical frameworks. A model-independent
investigation of New Physics effects in $\Bz\Bzb$ mixing is given.
