Omega-powers of finitary languages are omega languages in the form V^omega,
where V is a finitary language over a finite alphabet X. Since the set of
infinite words over X can be equipped with the usual Cantor topology, the
question of the topological complexity of omega-powers naturally arises and has
been raised by Niwinski, by Simonnet, and by Staiger. It has been recently
proved that for each integer n > 0, there exist some omega-powers of context
free languages which are Pi^0_n-complete Borel sets, and that there exists a
context free language L such that L^omega is analytic but not Borel. But the
question was still open whether there exists a finitary language V such that
V^omega is a Borel set of infinite rank. We answer this question in this paper,
giving an example of a finitary language whose omega-power is Borel of infinite
rank.
