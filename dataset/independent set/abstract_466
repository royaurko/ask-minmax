Based on the notion of free orbit-dimension introduced by D. Hadwin and J.
Shen [4], we introduce a new invariant on finite von Neumann algebras that do
not necessarily act on separable Hilbert space. We show that this invariant is
independent on the generating set, and we extend some results in [4] to von
Neumann algebras that are not finitely generated.
