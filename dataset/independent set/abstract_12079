In this paper, we construct canonical action-angle variables for both the
hyperbolic BC(n) Sutherland and the rational BC(n) Ruijsenaars-Schneider-van
Diejen models with three independent coupling constants. As a byproduct of our
symplectic reduction approach, we establish the action-angle duality between
these many-particle systems. The presented dual reduction picture builds upon
the construction of a Lax matrix for the BC(n)-type rational
Ruijsennars-Schneider-van Diejen model.
