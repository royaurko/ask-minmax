Weak interactions between quarks give rise to hadronic parity violation which
can be observed in nuclear and few-nucleon systems. We study the QCD
renormalization of the isotensor component of parity violation at
next-to-leading order accuracy. The renormalization group is employed to evolve
the interaction down to hadronic scales. As the results are renormalization
scheme dependent, we compare various schemes, including 't Hooft-Veltman
dimensional regularization, and several regularization independent-momentum
subtraction schemes.
