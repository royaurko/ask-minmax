This paper presents the first convergence result for random search algorithms
to a subset of the Pareto set of given maximum size k with bounds on the
approximation quality. The core of the algorithm is a new selection criterion
based on a hypothetical multilevel grid on the objective space. It is shown
that, when using this criterion for accepting new search points, the sequence
of solution archives converges with probability one to a subset of the Pareto
set that epsilon-dominates the entire Pareto set. The obtained approximation
quality epsilon is equal to the size of the grid cells on the finest level of
resolution that allows an approximation with at most k points within the family
of grids considered. While the convergence result is of general theoretical
interest, the archiving algorithm might be of high practical value for any type
iterative multiobjective optimization method, such as evolutionary algorithms
or other metaheuristics, which all rely on the usage of a finite on-line memory
to store the best solutions found so far as the current approximation of the
Pareto set.
